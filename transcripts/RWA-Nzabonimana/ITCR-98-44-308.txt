P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. KOUO:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Emile Francis Short; and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 20th of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  The appearances are the same.  

Before we start the proceedings, before we start the continuation of the cross-examination, we have to indicate, Mr. Robinson, that we have not been able to conclude our ruling on the oral application you made concerning the alternative measures to obtain the documents which we have discussed last weekend (sic).  Part of the reason is that it's linked to a written application you've made before.  It's the same issue that has been raised, and we wanted to address them both together.  We think that that should not be a handicap to the conclusion of your cross-examination because, as we have indicated on other witnesses, if the need arises, we will respond to an application to re-call the witness if that becomes necessary.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, one of the components -- probably the -- what I consider to be the most logical component of my motion -- my oral motion was that the Trial Chamber obtain from the witness the information under seal.  And once I complete my cross-examination and he returns from Arusha, that is not going to be available to you.  So it seems to me that at least some ruling or some decision should be made before he leaves.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can make certain he doesn't leave before we decide.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  Are you ready for me to start my cross-examination now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the proceedings commence this morning.  I remind you you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took before at the commencement of your testimony.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, agreed. 
WITNESS HH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Witness HH, good morning.  How are you? 
A.	Fine, thank you. 
Q.	Witness HH, on Friday you acknowledged that the statement you made to the Prosecution that you had seen François Karera on the 7th of April 1994 was false.  I'm now going to read to you from the next paragraph in that statement to the statement to the Prosecution.  It's on page 5 of the interview of the 9th of November 2005.  And you are quoted as saying, "I saw Karera for the second time between 
	9 and 10 April 1994 in the evening in the front of Kigali-ville préfecture after his appointment as préfet."  

Was that true?  
A.	I did, however, explain under what circumstances I'd made that statement, unless you wish me to repeat what I said.  
Q.	No, it's not necessary to repeat, but when we were questioning you on Friday, we were dealing with your -- the part of the statement in which you had talked about the 7th of April.  And you were very clear about the circumstances that led to your lying about the events of the 7th of April to the Prosecution.  But now I'm asking you about your statement to them about the 9th and 10th of April.  Was that also false? 
A.	Concerning what I said about the dates, the 9th and the 10th, I said where I was.  I also mentioned the places I'd been to, but I think that doesn't have anything to do with Mr. Karera, François. 
Q.	So can we agree that when you said "I saw Karera for the second time between 9 and 10 April in the evening in front of Kigali-ville préfecture," that was not true?
A.	As to the question concerning Karera, I think what you want is for me to relate why I said that about Karera.  I told you that ***********asked me to confirm that on that date that man was in Kigali.  In fact, on the 7th they spent the night in***********, and they were in the company of ************because they hadn't been able to find a means of transport.  And they spent the 8th at that place and the night of the 7th.  

And then, upon his request, his request to me, he said that at one point he went to the préfectoral offices to fetch Karera.  That's what he told me.  I think he even -- he was being even prosecuted before the Gacaca court.  So as a friend, he asked me to corroborate that.  I don't know whether I need to go -- if whether we need to go into this any deeper.  So what I say about Karera and what -- is what you asked me to confirm because he had said the same thing to try and avoid -- avoid being in prison.  Those are the circumstances under which I said what I said regarding Karera. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness HH.  I think I understand your answer to my question. 

Now, I'm going to read to you what you said after the sentence that it said that "I saw Karera for the second time between the 9th and the 10th of April 1994 in the evening in front of the Kigali-ville préfecture after his appointment as préfet," because you went on to elaborate that "I greeted him by shaking his hand and seized the opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment.  He responded and immediately enquired about the situation in my zone.  I told him that the killings had started.  He then asked me whether I had not had discussions with Robert Kajuga, the Interahamwe national chairman.  I told him that I had already seen him.  He then told me that I had to carry out Kajuga's instructions to the letter, and I replied that I would.  And some moments later a policeman came looking for him to tell him that the préfet, Renzaho, wanted to see him very urgently.  In fact, Kajuga had ordered me to work in close collaboration with the soldiers in order to look for the enemy and its accomplices.  The enemy was RPF, and the accomplices were Tutsis and moderate Hutus.  The orders were to kill them and take suspects to the Kigali-ville office."  

So it's true, is it not, Witness HH, that not only did you claim to have seen Karera on the 
9th and 10th of April, but you fabricated an entire scenario, including a fictitious conversation you had with him? 
A.	Regarding the statement I made on that date, I told you under what circumstances I said what I said.  I wanted to help my friend to help him -- him to avoid imprisonment. 
Q.	And to help your friend, you were willing and able not only to claim to have seen Karera at a certain place and time but to have invented conversations, events, policemen coming to look for him to take him to the préfet.  So you were capable of, and willing to, create entire false stories in order to help your friend, correct? 
A.	But the date you've given is incorrect.  What I invent -- I wouldn't say "invent."  I was corroborating what my friend had said.  So the date is wrong.  The date is incorrect. 
Q.	Did **********tell you to give these details?  Did he tell you, "Yes, you should tell the Prosecution that I congratulated Karera on his appointment, and I should tell the Prosecution that a policeman came and fetched him to take him to see Préfet Renzaho"?  Were those among the things that ************told you to say?  
A.	At the outset, I conceded that ************had asked me to confirm what he stated following upon -- because of the problems he was facing.  So I admit that there was a mistake.  It was a mistake to do what he asked me to do.  For the rest of it, we'd have to go into the details, and that would really be too long. 
Q.	Who provided the false information that you gave to the Office of the Prosecutor about seeing Karera, congratulating him on his appointment, speaking about Kajuga, being fetched by a policeman?  Who provided that information to you?  Was that something **************said, or was that something you invented? 
A.	I did what I promised ************to do.  In the course of our conversation, he asked me to support him, and that's what I did.  That's what he'd asked me to do in the course of our conversation. 
Q.	And in making that request, did he provide you with these details that you provided to the OTP, to the Prosecutor, or did you invent those? 
A.	He told me -- he gave me the details, what I had to say, so that it would coincide with his own statement.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Now, in your statement you talked about the third time you saw Karera, this time in Rushashi, R-U-S-H-A-S-H-I, and you said that it involved a man named Kangabo, K-A-N-G-A-B-O, and that you had seen Karera in Mutabazi's bar in Kinyari centre -- that's K-I-N-Y-A-R-I.  Now, was that true or was that false? 
A.	There were many events at Kinyari.  I even saw him several times.  There were many opportunities.  It wasn't only three times, but more than that, because much happened at Kinyari. 
Q.	Did you see Karera in Mutabazi's bar in Kinyari centre sometime around the 12th of April after the government had left Gitarama? 
A.	On the date you mentioned, I don't think that would be correct.  But as to the rest, I did meet him at Kinyari on several occasions, not necessarily on the date you mentioned.  
Q.	Did ****************ask you to lie about times that you have seen Karera in Rushashi? 
A.	No, as regards Rushashi, unless you want me to go through the whole thing, but I did meet him on several occasions in Rushashi. 
Q.	Well, was your statement to the OTP about the meetings you had with Karera in Rushashi the truth, or did it include some elements that were lies that you told at the request of************? 
A.	No, they were not untruths.  
Q.	So can we agree, then, or am I understanding you correctly, that the only things that *************asked you to lie about to the Office of the Prosecutor was seeing Karera at the Kigali-ville préfecture office? 
A.	Quite, absolutely, the events supposedly on the 7th. 
Q.	Well, you've also told us that you lied when you said that you had seen him a second time between the 9th and the 10th.  So there were two events that you lied about to the Prosecution concerning Mr. Karera; is that correct?  
A.	I think it's the date that's wrong.  But as to the rest of it, I saw him.  I saw him at the PVK.  It's the date that's wrong.  
Q.	Okay.  And then is it your testimony that no other part of your statement to the Prosecution concerning Karera is false other than the instances when you claim to have seen him at the Kigali-ville préfecture? 
A.	Yes, yes.  All the rest is correct.  
Q.	Now, do you know a man from Rushashi named Simon Murengezi?  That's M-U-R-E-N-G-E-Z-I.  
A.	I do not know him. 
Q.	And what about François Nteziryayo?  That's N-T-E-Z-I-R-Y-A-Y-O.  
A.	Nor do I know him. 
Q.	Do you know Anistase Ntiriyimana?  That's N-T-I-R-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A.  
A.	That name rings no bell. 
Q.	And, finally, also from Rushashi, Cyprien Katarega, K-A-T-A-R-E-G-A?
A.	That one I know.
Q.	Was he also a friend of************?  
A.	I'd usually see him at***************. 
Q.	Do you know whether ***************approached any other people besides yourself to lie to the Prosecution? 
A.	I don't know.  The person whom I remember and who met him was one************,**************. 
Q.	Did ***************give a statement to the Prosecution as well? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Now, this business of telling false statements to the Prosecution in Arusha, were you the only one that's ever done that at the prison, or is that something that's done more often than it -- just this one time? 
A.	I have explained how the persons who asked me to do so did it.  Should other such cases exist is something I can't tell you.  I don't know. 
Q.	Well, Witness HH, it's a fact, isn't it, that, at the Kigali prison and other places in Rwanda, testifying in Arusha is a business in which people make agreements, corroborate each other's testimony, and get favours for that, whether it be money, promises, hope of reduced sentences?  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	I don't know if that's the reality of things.  I did it to help a friend under the circumstances I've explained.  I cannot agree with you that that is the reality of things. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to have the registrar take a piece of paper from me on which I have written the name of another person who should not be mentioned publicly.  And I'm going to ask that it be shown to the witness.  

Excuse me, Mr. President.  I should have said something, but I think this better be shown to all the parties.  Otherwise, no one's going to be able to follow.  So if the registrar could show this to my colleagues and to the Prosecution so that everybody knows who he's speaking of.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness HH -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- have you ever discussed the events of April 1994 with that gentleman whose name is on that piece of paper? 
A.	I know that person.  I do not believe so.  I do not believe that we have ever had a conversation focusing on that -- on those events in particular, with the exception, of course, of what is said before the Gacaca courts.  Apart from that, between the two of us, we never had a conversation of any description about the events of 1994 at the prison. 
Q.	So you never told him about Kajuga coming to your bar on the 8th of April 1994 with a letter from Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I said that, during Gacaca court sessions organised within the prison walls, during the debates, such things were explained.  So if he did come to hear of such a thing, that would have been on the occasion of such debates or discussions, because during the Gacaca proceedings we reveal everything.  We hide nothing.  
Q.	And so you're telling us, though, that you never had a conversation with him in prison in which you told him about the incident of the 8th of April 1994 when Kajuga came to **************and showed you the letter, or you saw the letter, from Mathieu? 
A.	In view of the fact that people denounce each other and accuse each other, mutually, during Gacaca proceedings, somebody of such a position of authority within the prison followed the debates, or discussions.  So it should not be surprising to you if he gave us further information on the subject of our respective testimonies, because whenever Kajuga gave instructions, there were other people present.  And I must have mentioned that, so, of course, it is not surprising that he mentions it himself. 
Q.	Did you ever have a conversation with the gentleman whose name is on that piece of paper concerning meetings that you had had with other Interahamwe leaders in the bar of Bernard Maniragaba in Gitega? 
MR. ROBINSON:
And Maniragaba is number 55 on the spelling list. 
THE WITNESS:
That falls into the same category, if you like.  During Gacaca meetings, or debates, everyone talks openly.  They talk about their role during the events.  And I told you that that person had authority within the prison where we were detained.  That's what I told you, so that falls into the same category as my previous statements, or affirmations. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And what about the meetings at the Diplomat hotel on the -- where -- which was attended by ******** ***********and then the one that you claim to have attended?  Did you tell the gentleman whose name is on that piece of paper about those meetings?  
A.	I never had a discussion with that person on the subject of what you have just mentioned.  I told you the standing that that person had within the prison itself.  He was an official.  So how do you expect him not to be in the know as to everything that goes on behind the prison walls?  
Q.	Well, let me read to you something he has said, and it's -- it's found at the transcript of the 
	2nd of November 2006 at page 68.  He said that "It was not just once that I had a discussion with Witness HH.  We often met and discussed, and he told me that he had attended a meeting at Maniragaba's bar and that a report had been prepared to be forwarded to the officials in Murambi."  Is that true? 
A.	Counsel, I specified the circumstances under which that person could have had access to such information.  He was a figure of authority, and I said that he would have had access to that information.  That does not seem -- mean to say that I had a face-to-face conversation with him.  He was an official there, and he was somebody who was there to solve any problems that arose. 
Q.	He testified that he and you often met and discussed these events.  Was that true? 
A.	Gacaca courts do not come together on one occasion solely.  It's a regular occurrence, and sometimes he would be there in order to intervene when there were disagreements.  So it is not a particular conversation that I might have had with him. 
Q.	Witness HH, apart from Gacaca sessions, have you had any conversations with (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) concerning events in April 1994? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Oh, I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- that reference is struck from the record. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I'm going to ask the question again. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Apart from Gacaca sessions, have you had any contact or conversations with the persons (sic) whose name is on that paper about the events of April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to say that in 1994 myself and that person were in Rwanda, and we followed everything.  I do not believe that that person would have asked me to explain everything to him.  He was a well-known person, and he could have had access to all information. 
Q.	Well, Witness HH, the individual whose name is on that paper testified on the 2nd of November 2006 at page 66 of the transcript that during the years 2000 to 2002 you and he had discussed these events in prison and you had told him about the meetings at the Diplomat hotel.  Was that true? 
A.	Counsel, I am not here to contradict him.  That person was a well-known figure, and he followed events closely.  But I would like to say that I never gave him specific information.  And if he did glean such information through the Gacaca sessions, then I understand that, of course.  But you should not think that I was the one who provided him with information during a conversation between myself and himself.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness HH.  

Now, when was the last time that you saw the gentleman whose name is on that piece of paper before coming to court today? 
A.	The last time I saw him was when we were travelling together by plane in order to come here. 
Q.	And approximately when was that? 
A.	That was during last month.  It was on the 13th. 
Q.	And when had been the last time you had seen him before that? 
A.	The last time that I had seen him was in prison.  He was in the company of the prison governor. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I would ask that the piece of paper that was -- is now before the witness be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ198 under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ198 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I have another piece of paper with another person's name that I would like to have the usher show to the parties and then to the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, while that's being done, I'm going to ask you one more question about the person whose name is in front of you.  He testified -- and this is at page 26 of the transcript of the 6th of November 2006.  He testified -- he was asked whether or not Witness HH had told him whether or not he had seen the letter from Robert -- from Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 8th.  So the question was, "Did Witness HH tell you whether or not he had seen that letter?"  And this gentleman said, "He told me he saw the letter, but he did not tell me whether or not he had read it.  He told me he saw it."  

And then he was asked, "And did he tell you the circumstances under which he had seen the letter?"  And then he went on to say that he had seen the letter when Robert Kajuga met him at a roadblock, and it was Robert Kajuga who had the letter.  

Now, did you tell the person whose name was on the paper that was first before you that you had seen this letter, or is that something he picked up from listening to the Gacaca in the prison? 
A.	During the Gacaca sessions that were held at the prison, things are organised secteur by secteur, and sometimes people would come together by cellule as well.  It is not surprising, for example, that people from our area would say that I said that.  And, what is more, I did admit having given that piece of information, and I do not believe that there is anything surprising about it. 
Q.	Was that gentleman who we're speaking of whose name was on the first piece of paper that was placed before you, was he from your secteur? 
A.	Are you talking about the same person we were talking about earlier?  I have not quite understood your question.  Are we referring to the first person or to the person whose name figures on the piece of paper that has just been put before me?  
Q.	We're talking about the first person.  Was he from the same secteur as you? 
A.	No, we do not hail from the same secteur. 
Q.	So how was it that he was attending Gacaca meetings of people from your secteur at the prison? 
A.	As a personality who was in charge of supervising the Gacaca sessions, he had to be present.  Such officials supervise Gacaca sessions for all secteurs, and that is how it happens for every session.  He had to be at the prison in order to act as a moderator because sometimes there are heated discussions when people start accusing each other. 
Q.	And you believe that that's how he came in to the information about your activities during April 1994, correct? 
A.	I am not accusing that individual.  I do not believe he asked me, but sometimes when people start to accuse each other during Gacaca sessions, one can refer to figures of authority in order to inform them of what other people are saying about you, especially when you believe that you are being falsely accused.  However, that does not mean to say that I had a discussion with him in private. 
Q.	Okay, thank you, Witness HH.

Now, there's another piece of paper been placed before you.  Do you know the person whose name is on that piece of paper? 
A.	Yes, I know that person. 
Q.	Was he also at Gacaca -- well, was he also a participant in Gacaca at the Kigali prison? 
A.	I started to see him over the last few days because he had a role to play.  But initially he did not take part in those Gacaca sessions. 
Q.	What was the role that he played? 
A.	He was responsible for sensitising prisoners with a view to entering a confession and a guilty plea.  And he started to do that over the last, or latter, period.  
Q.	And what did that involve?  Would he try to persuade people to confess? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And would he help prepare the documents that they submitted to the authorities? 
A.	No.  He was quite simply there to provide advice to people during those Gacaca sessions, and I believe that he spent fewer than five months in that position. 
Q.	Did he attend Gacaca sessions of people from your secteur? 
A.	No.  He never came to take part in the Gacaca sessions for our secteur. 
Q.	And did he and the person whose name is on the first piece of paper that I gave to you participate in the same Gacaca sessions? 
A.	No.  I told you that, with respect to that first person, well, he came to take part in the sessions.  And the second person, I told you that he began to take part over the last five months. 
Q.	Now, the second person whose name was on the letter -- the piece of paper that's in front of you, has he ever spoken to you about the events of 1994 in a private conversation? 
A.	In private, no. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that the piece of paper that's currently in front of the witness be marked as Exhibit D. NZ199 and admitted under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ199 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness HH, can we agree that at the prison in Kigali it's common for many people to know what other people are saying about the events of 1994? 
A.	Yes.  In most cases that is what happens. 
Q.	And just like *********asked you to corroborate some events that he had told the Prosecutors, do you believe that others have asked their friends or other people in the prison to corroborate what they have told the Prosecutor as well? 
A.	No, that is not common practice within the prison because, in most cases, people do not know each other because they do not come from the same area.  Of course, we often spend time together, but when we talk, we do so during the Gacaca sessions, where we accuse each other or denounce each other. 
Q.	Have you heard it said in the prison, or in Gacaca, that Mr. Nzirorera arrived in Kigali at the end of April of 1994 and held a meeting of leaders with the Interahamwe, after which he gave some money to an Interahamwe leader from Biryogo secteur named Sued Nyayitabi? 
MR. ROBINSON:
And that's number 84 on the spelling list.  
THE WITNESS:
I heard him during the Gacaca sessions.  I heard him say that that money had allegedly been handed over to those people.  That's something that I did hear, but I am not sure.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But that's a story going around the prison, is it not?  
A.	I heard it from the Interahamwes who said so during the Gacaca sessions within the prison walls. 
Q.	And did you, yourself, attend such a meeting on the end of April 1994 at which Mr. Nzirorera is supposed to have been present at the préfecture office in Kigali?  
A.	No, I did not take part.  That information was recounted to me.  I did not take part in that meeting. 
Q.	I want to go back to the 7th of April and ask you about some more events that took place on that day.  In addition to the four people killed by (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover), were there any other killings in your area on the 7th of April? 
A.	I remember that those four people were killed on the 7th of April.  However, I remember that in another neighbouring secteur a person was killed very early in the morning.  Now, with reference to my neighbourhood, there were only those four people who were killed on the date that you have just provided. 
Q.	And you have told us that there was already a roadblock set up in your area by the gendarmes, even before the 6th of April.  Were there any people killed at that roadblock on the 7th of April? 
A.	Nobody was killed at that roadblock. 
Q.	Were any Tutsis separated, detained, or taken to some other location on the 7th of April at that roadblock? 
A.	On the 7th -- on the 7th, people had not yet started moving around.  So one could not easily intercept people and ask them to produce their ID cards. 
Q.	Was it possible on the 7th for Tutsis to leave Kigali and proceed past that roadblock out of town? 
A.	I told you that on the 7th we heard a communiqué broadcast very early in the morning that asked the members of the population not to leave their homes. 
Q.	And if someone came to the roadblock attempting to leave Kigali, what would happen on the 7th of April? 
A.	The people who were moving around might have been well-known personalities.  Those are the type of people who could move around at that moment in time. 
Q.	And what would happen to them when they reached the roadblock? 
A.	I said that when you arrived at that roadblock, just as any other roadblock, you'd be asked to show ID, an identity -- your identity.  You'd be asked what your destination was.  And if you didn't hear the communiqué, telling the people to stay home, so one had to explain oneself at length. 
Q.	Was that roadblock reinforced on the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes, the roadblock was reinforced. 
Q.	Did any Interahamwe man the roadblock on the 7th of April? 
A.	But, Counsel, I'm telling you the roadblock was in front of a bar.  So, as a consequence -- consequently, it's -- would not have been possible for us not to follow closely what was happening.  The Interahamwe, who were free to move around, could be at that roadblock. 
Q.	Did they have any instructions to do so? 
A.	Regarding that day, I'd received no instructions to order such things, but I could see that it was going on, occurring.  
Q.	And so were the Interahamwe spontaneously acting to man roadblocks even before instructions were given to them? 
A.	No, no.  That was not the reality of things.  I explained to you.  There was a roadblock manned by soldiers a few metres from********.  I think it was not more than five metres.  So if I could follow closely what was happening, or an Interahamwe who lived near the road could see what was happening, that did not mean that they had any role to play at the roadblock.  I explained the circumstances under which it happened. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness HH.  

Now, let's turn to the 8th of April.  You've told us that between 9 and 11 in the morning you received a visit from some individuals connected with the Interahamwe.  And during your testimony you named those individuals as Robert Kajuga, Bernard Maniragaba --

Q.	-- Aloys Ngirabatware -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
75 on the spelling list. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, were there any other Interahamwe who accompanied them? 
A.	There were many, but I can't remember their names because they were so numerous. 
Q.	Can you -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Microphones overlapping)...sorry. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you give us an estimate of the number of Interahamwe in total that came on the morning of the 8th? 
A.	Listen, I think you're trying to make things hard for me.  If you want me to give you a rough figure -- in any case, every member of the national committee of the Interahamwe was accompanied by at least two other people and, moreover, soldiers also from the Presidential Guard.  I saw two.  
Q.	Was the first vice-president of the national committee of the Interahamwe, Phénéas Ruhumuliza, present?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's number 93 on the spelling list. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't recall very well, but it seems to me that all the members of the national committee were present, even if I have no clear recollection.  It seems to me that they were numerous.  But the names of which I'm sure were -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry.  I missed that name. 
THE WITNESS:
-- and the others. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If you could repeat that name, it wasn't clear. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Could you repeat the name that was just mentioned?  The interpreters didn't get it.  
A.	Among the vice-presidents, Kajuga's vice-presidents, the one whose name comes to mind is Rutaganda, Georges Rutaganda. 
Q.	And was Rutaganda present on the 8th at your area with Kajuga and the others when Kajuga had the letter from Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	You know, the people who were there were numerous, not very numerous, but I think that most of the members of the committee, the majority of the membership of the national committee, including Georges Rutaganda. 
Q.	Okay.  And what about the secretary-general of the Interahamwe national committee?  That's a man named Eugène Mbarushimana.  
A.	No, I don't think he was present.  I can't picture him at the meeting. 
Q.	And what about the -- the treasurer of the Interahamwe national committee, Dieudonné Niyitegeka? 
A.	I can't remember if he was present on that day. 
Q.	And what about one of the counselors or advisors named Ephrem Nkezabera -- number 77 on the spelling list -- was he present at your bar? 
A.	I think that Nkezabera was present. 
Q.	And Joseph Serugendo, another advisor, a counselor? 
A.	I gave you the names of the officials that came to that place and whom I talked with, but I don't think Serugendo came there. 
Q.	And one last one, and that is a man named Zuzu.  He was also a conseiller of the national committee.  Was he present at your bar on the 8th? 
A.	As to Zuzu -- however -- no, but, however, one Guillaume did come -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Guillaume, G-U-I-L-L-A-U-M-E, means William in French, Guillaume. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was he an Interahamwe? 
A.	You mean Guillaume?  Yes, yes, he was. 
Q.	From which secteur? 
A.	Guillaume, apart from the fact that I saw him as such, I did not know from which was his secteur, but I know that he came from Gisenyi. 
Q.	Was he the son of a person named Mbonabarye?  That's M-B-O-N-A-B-A-R-Y-E.  
A.	That is correct.  Yes, I said he was indeed his son.  
Q.	And what was your understanding as to what he was doing in Kigali on the 8th of April? 
A.	I don't know his role.  I don't know what he'd come to do, but I saw him with Nkezabera - 
	Robert Kajuga and Nkezabera, but I don't know what his functions were. 
Q.	Now, from your area were there a number of Interahamwe who were also present who saw these officials at ***********and who can verify that they were there on the 8th of April? 
A.	Not many, but the Interahamwe that lived in that area saw them but couldn't understand that, even if they saw them, they could necessarily identify them.  But I know that there are Interahamwe who did see the top officials that came to the bar. 
Q.	Now, when those officials arrived, did you have any advanced knowledge that they were coming, or did they simply surprise you and show up? 
A.	I knew that the people would come, but I didn't know at what time they would come.  But I sought that.  I knew that necessarily those top officials would come. 
Q.	And did you have any communication before they arrived that they would come, or was that something that you just expected from your own experience? 
A.	When I consider that I called quite a few people over the phone but couldn't reach them, Nzabanterura and Séraphin, I understood that, in any case, those people were moving around because of the troubles going on in town.  And -- and I had discussed the evening before with Karushara, Rose, who said she had did -- been in contact with Kajuga, but -- but Rose never told me that Kajuga would come, but in my -- but inside of me, I felt he would come.  
Q.	Now, you told us that there was a time when the people left ***********and you received some instructions to set up other roadblocks; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, but nearby in the vicinity of the bar so that, from the bar, you could see the various places where roadblocks were set up.  
Q.	But as I understand it, on the 8th of April when Kajuga and the others arrived, there was only one roadblock in existence at that time, the one right in front of***********; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And during the time that Kajuga was with you, as I understand your testimony, you say that he and Maniragaba instructed that other roadblocks be set up, correct? 
A.	Indeed, the first person to speak of it was Kajuga.  They were saying if the enemy comes from Gitarama or from another side, it would be easy for an enemy to do so, and, consequently, other roadblocks should be erected.  And I was shown, at this place or that, it would be useful to erect a roadblock.  
Q.	And were you with anyone from your area or from the surrounding area at the time that you were being shown where to set up roadblocks? 
A.	In any case, I can't say that we were at the same place.  But within five metres there were other curious onlookers.  The people in general could see what was happening.  But I'm not saying that they were involved in the discussion, but practically all the locals could see what was going on, could follow closely what was going on.  
Q.	Were you with a person named Assumani at the time? 
A.	He had come there.  Between his home and where we were, it was a distance of about 
	300, 400 metres.  And as to the rest of it, yes, he also came. 
Q.	So he observed Kajuga and the other people on the 8th of April, correct? 
A.	Yes, quite, he saw them. 
Q.	And can you tell us where Mr. Assumani is at the present time? 
A.	The latest I heard is that he's detained at Kimironko prison, Kimironko.  
Q.	Now, what did you understand from Kajuga to be the purpose of setting up the roadblocks? 
A.	The roadblocks were erected in order to prevent the enemy from infiltrating the city and in order also to detect enemy accomplices through the use of those roadblocks. 
Q.	And did Mr. Kajuga give you any information as to how accomplices could be detected? 
A.	From what he was saying, it was also my point of view, one can ask to see identification and check people coming into town or going out of town.  People passing had to be questioned so as to know their destination.  He did not -- there were no instructions to be given on that topic.  He asked us to strengthen monitoring and work in conjunction with the military.  
Q.	And did -- did he tell you that Tutsi, people with "Tutsi" on their identification cards, should be killed? 
A.	It was a normal matter, established practice.  He did not himself say that anyone holding an identity card mentioning the Tutsi ethnic group should be killed.  You must understand that anybody who is Tutsi was considered an enemy.  You must understand that.  He didn't need to say it. 
Q.	But he was Tutsi, wasn't he? 
A.	Frankly, I can't confirm that.  Moreover, I tell you that I cannot either confirm it nor cast doubt about it. 
Q.	And he was said to be Tutsi, wasn't he?
A.	Yes, some people said so.  Some people say he's an Interahamwe who is a Tutsi, but as someone who did not come from the same place, I'm not having any proof to prove it or the contrary.  I have no position on the matter.  I cannot have a position on the matter, as a person with definite information.  I can't say anything like that.  
Q.	Now, did he give new instructions as to what should be done with people who were suspected of being accomplices at these roadblocks?  Were you given instructions that they should be killed, they should be taken to the authorities?  What did he say about that? 
A.	At that place he said that we should unmask that sort of person and stop them.  Something was said, but I don't remember if it was him.  It was said that such a person should be taken before the PVK authorities, but I don't know whether it was him or Maniragaba who said that.  But I remember that it was said. 
Q.	And when you went to execute their instructions, what did you understand that the Interahamwe at these roadblocks were supposed to do when they encountered a person with "Tutsi" on their identification card? 
A.	In my view, since we were with soldiers, the Interahamwe, any person identified as Tutsi was killed because it was obvious that they were part of the group of people who had killed the president, the head of state, and we could not tolerate that any further. 
Q.	And were those the instructions you were given by Kajuga? 
A.	Even before the instructions came into force.  And that was what was happening elsewhere anyhow. 
Q.	But were those the instructions that you were given on the 8th of April by Kajuga? 
A.	I think I have explained that.  I said that on the 8th Kajuga came and told us to erect roadblocks to prevent the enemy from passing.  So when you stop an enemy, what do you do with him?  You have to kill him. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take our midmorning recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1032H) 
(Pages 1 to 16 by Ann Burum)

















(Court resumed at 1100H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
 You can continue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, I would like to offer as D. NZ200 the witness statement of the 8th and 9th of November 2005 given by this witness concerning Mr. Karera's case, which contained false statements, and ask that it be admitted under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ200 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness HH, after you received the instructions from Kajuga and the others, did you, in fact, order that roadblocks be set up in your area? 
A.	Yes, that was done. 
Q.	And did you give instructions to the people manning the roadblocks as to what they should do if they encountered a person who had an identity card with the word "Tutsi" on it? 
A.	As I had received instructions, you must understand that I, in turn, was -- had to inform the people manning the roadblocks in the vicinity.  However, I had the following:  If someone doesn't fulfil the necessary conditions, he should be brought to my roadblock, the roadblock opposite**********, and where the people responsible for the roadblocks were.  
Q.	So your instructions were that anybody who was suspected of being a Tutsi or accomplice to the enemy, they were all to be brought to your roadblock so that they could be checked further; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is how it went. 
Q.	And what were your instructions to the people at your roadblock as to what they should do if they believed that the person who had been detained was, in fact, a Tutsi?  What should they do?  What did you tell them? 
A.	Regarding the people manning that roadblock, and they were -- in any case, one should say there was a soldier who was a supervisor of the roadblock.  Well, when we observed that one person or another was Tutsi, then that person should be brought before Mr. **********************************, and he was the one who took the final decision. 
Q.	And he was the one on the bridge killing the Tutsis and disposing of their corpses? 
A.	Yes, that was him.  That was he.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Is -- is this revealing identity?  Sorry.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't believe so, Mr. President.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, because of the name.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Continue.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, did your instructions include women and children who happened to be Tutsi? 
A.	I didn't say -- say it like that.  Just as -- even if I said people were brought to my roadblock, that didn't mean that others weren't killed further on and that we hear about it.  That didn't prevent people from killing other people far from my roadblock, that is to say, at another roadblock, some distance away from ours.  
Q.	Well, when you gave instructions to people **************************to detain Tutsi, did that include women and children? 
A.	Well, in reality, when you specified a child, that's one thing, but what they said was the enemy and its accomplices.  As to me, it's hard for me to distinguish.  In what I was told, I was told we must seek out the enemy, but we saw that even innocent children were included in that category of people, but it doesn't emerge from the instructions I had given and the instructions that I had been given, but that is what we saw. 
Q.	Well, why were innocent children killed, then, if they weren't part of the instructions? 
A.	I don't deny that children were killed.  Indeed they were.  
Q.	Why? 
A.	I don't know how to answer you.  I have nothing to tell you.  I know that children were killed.  I know that women also were killed.  
Q.	Can you give us an approximation of the number of people that were killed at roadblocks under your supervision during the events of 1994? 
A.	I am not able to do so.  I know that people were killed, but I can't give you an approximate figure because I often was not there, but I know that people were killed. 
Q.	Would you agree that it was more than ten people over the course of the events of 1994? 
A.	Counsel, if you say ten, I don't know where you get that information.  I confirm that it is more than that, higher than that.  That's what I can say. 
Q.	Can you also confirm that it was more than 100? 
A.	Frankly, if I were to start discussing figures, it would amount to saying it's between such and such, but I cannot do so.  What I can tell you is that it is more than ten and very much more than ten. 
Q.	Well, since we weren't there, we're trying to get some idea, and we all understand that you didn't count the bodies and you weren't there all the time that people were killed, which is why I'm speaking in these very round figures.  So do you believe, based on the information that you have, that more than 100 people were killed at roadblocks under your supervision? 
A.	As you say, since on several occasions people were killed in my absence, I went off to seek foodstuffs, drinks, beverages, et cetera, so I can't tell you if it was less or more than a hundred.  Each time I came back, I was told that people had been stopped and people had been killed at that roadblock. 
Q.	Could it have been as many as a thousand people killed at roadblocks************************, or would that be too much? 
A.	I have no approximate figure to put forward.  I don't really have any figure to put forward that might be of use to the Court.  
Q.	Now, a man named************************************, has made a statement in which he said -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
And for the reference of Mr. Webster and the Prosecution, this is K0362169, disclosed to us as part of the Rule 68 material.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	-- that when the killing started,**************************************************************************** ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.  Is that true?  
A.	As you have said, the *******************was killed on the 7th.  Among his killers there was 
	********************.  I know that he has even confessed to that crime.  As to the other name that you mentioned, I do not know that person.  Moreover, I never transported anyone in my vehicle who was subsequently killed.  These are general accusations.  I don't know if they say it because I was in charge.  I don't know exactly what were the circumstances on which -- under which the accusations were made, but I know that whoever was killed, of course, there must have been someone to kill them.  That is sure.  
Q.	Now, in addition to your activities in your own section, did you also go on the 8th of April to Gitarama and attack at Ruyenzi -- that's R-U-Y-E-N-Z-I -- in Runda commune and a trading centre called Bishenye, that's B-I-S-H-E-N-Y-E? 
A.	I went to those places in the company of soldiers, but nobody died.  However, we freed Interahamwe that had been arrested by the bourgmestre of Ruyenzi commune.  I did it at the request of 
	Claver Kamana.  I did go to those places, but it wasn't on the 8th.  It was, rather, the 9th, Saturday.  I confirm, therefore, that I did go to those places, but nobody died.  
Q.	I'm going to read to you some portion of the testimony of the préfet of Gitarama, Fidèle Uwizeye -- that's U-W-I-Z-E-Y-E -- in the trial of Casimir Bizimungu and others.  And I'm reading from transcript of the 
	6th of April 2005 at page 40.

He says, "The attack came from Kigali town and was ***************************Witness HH, who now is in detention in Kigali, and he has agreed, he has accepted this, he attacked on the 8th of April.  He attacked at Ruyenzi in Runda commune and he also attacked another small trading centre called Bishenye.  After that -- during that attack, three Tutsis were killed, including Muyumbayire," that's spelled M-U-Y-U-M-B-A-Y-I-R-E, Axil, "and I had even*************************************.  They also killed a criminal investigator there and a teacher.  They killed three people then." 

What do you have to say to that?  
A.	It is not correct because Prefect Uwizeye, even before, was not on good terms with me because of different political party membership.  He was in conflict with Claver Kamana.  I confirm that I went to those people.  Moreover, he is in error, because I went to Ruyenzi to ask the bourgmestre to release the Interahamwe.  I was told he was in Bishenye.  When I went to Bishenye, I could not find him.  I was told that he had gone somewhere else by the name of Gihara.  I went there and I did not find him.  

When I came back, we did not want to attack the commune because there were communal policemen.  I sought him everywhere until I found him.  In fact, he'd heard that we were looking for him, and he went and he surrendered to a soldier, a sergeant major, and we agreed with him that we had to release those people.  

As to the people you mentioned previously and who were killed, I have no recollection of that.  I don't remember anyone being killed. 
Q.	Now, when you were in Runda, whether it be on the 8th or the 9th, were you on board a blue Daihatsu pickup? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you tell people -- excuse me, Runda is R-U-N-D-A.  

Did you tell people at Runda, the local people, that they have to start killing or else you would kill them too?  
A.	I didn't tell the people of Runda that, because at Runda most of the people were members of the MDR and, consequently, not under my control.  I did not speak to them in those terms.  That is not correct.  
Q.	And did you return the next day on the 10th of April 1994 to Runda? 
A.	No, no, I did not go back. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me, just for clarification, can Mr. Robinson indicate the basis for this line of questioning?  Is it still with Uwizeye and his testimony, or is this something else?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. Webster.  I was just about to get to that.  I'm now going to put to the witness a statement that was made by another witness, and this is found at K0294791.  It's a woman named Marie Clotilde, that's C-L-O-T-I-L-D-E, Ndamijuwimye, that's spelled N-D-A-M-I-J-U-W-I-M-Y-E, and what she said to the Rwandan authorities.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And just the date of the statement, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's 1997, the 21st of November. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What she said was that you arrived in Runda for the first time on the 9th of April 1994 on board a blue Daihatsu pickup, together with armed Interahamwe, that you gathered people and told them to kill people or otherwise you would kill them too, but the local people did nothing and you came the following day on the 10th of April 1994, and you asked why they had not started killing, and you and your men opened fire on the people in Runda.  What do you have to say to that? 
A.	That never happened.  I never got into that pickup you're talking of.  I did not go to Runda on the 10th.  I don't know where she gets that information from.  I don't know the circumstances under which you obtained that information.  As she was speaking to the Rwandan authorities, I should ask for clarifications that -- about that, because it's (unintelligible) not the only person that saw me in that vehicle, you must understand. 
Q.	Now, did you participate in attacks in the préfecture of Gitarama? 
A.	With the exception of the attack I told you of, which -- the point of which was to obtain the release of the detained Interahamwe, and another attack in June, and the purpose was to recover the corpses of Interahamwe or wounded Interahamwe or soldiers, I never participated in any other attack in Gitarama.  However, before the 6th, in 1994, at one point there were skirmishes between Interahamwe and members of the JDR.  So we went to obtain the release of Interahamwe in former Taba commune.  And on that occasion, there was a lot of talk until the prefect you mentioned came to talks regarding the incident.  On the government side, there was one Alphonse Nteziryayo, who also intervened.  At that time I accompanied Claver Kamana, and we reached an agreement at that time, and then the question never arose again.  Those are the circumstances under which I went to Gitarama, and those are the circumstances under which I played a role there. 
Q.	Préfet Uwizeye has testified at this Tribunal that you attacked Runda, Ruyenzi, Bishenye, and Gihara, that's G-I-H-A-R-A, on the 9th of April and again on the 10th of April.  

And that testimony can be found on the 6th of April 2005 in the Bizimungu case at pages 40 and 47, and on the 7th of April 2005 at page 62.  

So do you deny that?  
A.	I will repeat myself.  I did go to those three places, but I was looking for the bourgmestre of 
	Runda commune.  I was -- as I was seeking him at those various trading centres, there was no fighting, but I do acknowledge that I did go to those three trading centres, with the exception of Bishenye, because there we had to break into a door of a bar, and we took alcoholic beverages that were consumed by the Interahamwe, but at no time was there any fighting.  The local people are witnesses thereof.  So if someone, an individual, makes such accusations, he has to explain himself.  You know, when a person makes accusations before the Gacaca court, there must be proof to corroborate what he says.  One single person cannot make accusations like that in vacuo. 
Q.	Yes, Witness HH, there are many people who have made such accusations.  We're going to go over those, but I want to ask you now about Kigali-rural préfecture.  On the 9th or the 10th of April, did you participate in any attacks in any communes in Kigali-rural préfecture of Tutsis? 
A.	With the exception of a trip I made in order to look into the killing of a specific Interahamwe, on that occasion, notably, we sought the perpetrators of that killing, but in vain.  But to the best of my recollection, nobody else was killed.  I'm talking about an event that should be situated around the 10th. 
Q.	Now, on the 10th of April 1994, did you yourself learn of a meeting to be held at the Hôtel Diplomates? 
A.	Yes, I was informed of that. 
Q.	And who informed you of that? 
A.	That information was given to me by Gervais Ntirugurirwa. 
Q.	That's number 81 on the spelling list. 

And where did he receive that information? 
A.	He told me that the Interahamwe officials had come to get him -- had come to get me -- I apologise.  And in view of the fact that I was not present, he then had to go to the meeting, and at that meeting he was told that another meeting was to be convened on a larger scale in order to bring together all the youth movements of the Power wings, and it was that second meeting that I attended. 
Q.	Now, on the 10th of April 1994, you were not at your section because you were off attacking Shyorongi commune, correct? 
A.	Yes, I had gone to that place, because one of ours had been killed.  If you like, you can consider that to be an attack so that we can understand each other correctly. 
Q.	Now, when you returned from Shyorongi commune to your area, was *************already there or had he already gone to -- or was he gone? 
A.	I met him during the evening.  In fact, it was in the afternoon, because I had gone to Shyorongi in the morning. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when the meeting was held at the Diplomat hotel on the 10th, about what time of day?  
A.	I cannot provide you with that specification because I did not take part in that meeting.  I was merely informed that the meeting had taken place in that location. 
Q.	And did Gervais inform you which authorities had been present at this meeting? 
A.	He told me that the secretary-general of the MRND party, that is, Joseph Nzirorera, had taken part in that meeting. 
Q.	And did he tell you of any other MRND officials who had taken part in that meeting? 
A.	With the exception of the Interahamwe leaders, he did not tell me about anybody else. 
Q.	And did he tell you which members of the Interahamwe national committee had taken part in this meeting? 
A.	Amongst the people who were members of that committee and that he knew, he said that 
	Georges Kajuga had taken part, at least that's what I remember.  And he also told me that the Interahamwe leaders at secteur level had been in attendance at that meeting. 
Q.	We received the name of Georges Kajuga, so I'm wondering if you mean Robert Kajuga or 
	Georges Rutaganda. 
A.	I mean Georges Rutaganda.  
Q.	And was it your understanding that Sèraphin Twahirwa had been present at this meeting? 
A.	Yes, he was present. 
Q.	And what did Gervais tell you had been said at this meeting? 
A.	There was talk of the situation that prevailed in the different neighbourhoods, and people said that they would convene another meeting where the leaders of the other youth movements, aside from the MRND, would be invited. 
Q.	And did he tell you that General Dallaire was also going to come to that meeting the next day? 
A.	No.  That information did not reach my ears.  He did not mention it.  
Q.	Witness, when you were asked about the same meeting just on the 9th of November here at this trial, you testified that Gervais told you that a larger meeting with General Dallaire and the Power wings would be held the next day.  That's in the transcript at page 14, the draft transcript.  Now, why did you give testimony that is so irreconcilable on two different days of this trial? 
A.	I remember very well having said that Dallaire was due to chair that meeting, that was the meeting that was to be convened, that is.  And that is what was said when we reached the meeting place.  However, Dallaire did not turn up, so I do not know quite how I would have said such a thing.  However, I do know that there was question of inviting the representatives of the other youth Power wings, but I do not recall saying that that person said to me that Dallaire was going to chair the meeting. 
Q.	Well, the transcript reads that "They were told that a larger meeting with Dallaire and the Power wings would be held the next day."  That's what you're recorded as having said.  And I suggest to you, 
	Witness HH, that the reason that you give different versions of these meetings is because they never occurred.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, I've told you that those meetings occurred or took place, and you are telling me that there are contradictions in what I said.  Maybe you do not understand me correctly when I express myself.  I did not say that it was Dallaire who was due to chair that meeting.  We were told that when we reached the meeting venue in the morning.  Of course, this occurred a long time ago, but from what I can recall, that information was passed on to us when we reached the meeting venue.  

And when you say that that meeting never took place, what I'd like to say, that there is proof that that meeting took place and that everyone was aware of it.  And were we to go further into analysing this, it would be easy for us to ascertain that that meeting did indeed take place.  As proof, I would say that during that meeting rifles were distributed.  They were new rifles and they were distributed in large numbers to people who had come from different secteurs of Kigali préfecture.  And I do not believe that I am the only person to be able to confirm that fact.  
Q.	So can you give me the names of other people who could confirm that fact? 
A.	I have often given you the names of the Interahamwe leaders at secteur level, and I know very well that you have a list of those leaders.  So, it is not my responsibility to tell you whom you should talk to.  You can choose for yourself from the people whose names figure on the list and then go and glean information from those people.  
Q.	And were all of the presidents of the Interahamwe at secteur level present at the meeting on the 
	10th of April 1994************************************? 
A.	I cannot confirm that and tell you that everybody was present.  I could not attend, and you will understand that that might have been the case for other people too.  So I cannot say because I'm not sure. 
Q.	Okay.  Let's talk about the meeting that you say occurred on the 11th of April, the one that you did attend at the Diplomat hotel.  Could you tell me approximately when you arrived at the Diplomat, about what time? 
A.	With reference to the meeting that I took part in and the one that was due to be chaired by Dallaire, I reached that place before midday.  
Q.	And did you travel with someone else or did you travel alone? 
A.	When I went there, I was in the company of some Interahamwe.  I remember a man by the name of Assumani.  He accompanied me because********************************.  There was another gentleman by the name of Ndayisenga, and those were the two people that I can remember, for the time being. 
Q.	Was a person named Claude Munyengabe -- that's M-U-N-Y-E-N-G-A-B-E -- with you? 
A.	He was a driver. 
Q.	And did he drive you to this meeting? 
A.	*************************************************************************************************************** *************************************************************************************************************.  
Q.	And where was Ndayisenga from?  Was he from**********************************? 
A.	He came from***************. 
Q.	Now, in addition to the presidents of the Interahamwe at secteur level, were there conseillers who attended this meeting at the Diplomat hotel? 
A.	Yes, there were some in attendance.  I remember that some of the conseiller were indeed there.  
Q.	And can you tell which conseiller you recall being present? 
A.	I did not follow closely enough to know their names, but I do know that there were conseillers there, because instructions were due to be handed down.  I do not remember their names, but that does not mean to say that I do not know the names of the conseiller de secteur for Nyarugenge.  The problem is that I do not remember the names of those conseillers who were attendance. 
Q.	Do you recall whether or not Amri Karekezi was in attendance, conseiller from Bilyogo secteur.  
A.	Counsel, I told you that I know the names of the different secteur conseillers very well for Kigali-ville préfecture.  However, I do not recall who was in attendance? 
Q.	Was the bourgmestre, Jean Bizimana, in attendance at this meeting? 
A.	Nor do I remember that fact.  But in view of the fact that it was a meeting held in his commune, I would, therefore, deduce that he was in attendance, but I'm not sure and I cannot confirm anything. 
Q.	Who were the leaders of the other parties' youth wings who were in attendance at this meeting? 
A.	I remember a man by the name of Jean who was a leader in Muhima, but for the others, well, I do not know their names.  Jean was representing the Muhima JDR. 
Q.	Were there any officials of any other political parties present at the meeting? 
A.	As regards leaders of political parties, I did not see any political party leader as such during that meeting.  I merely saw people passing by.  For example, there was Callixte, who was a minister.  There was Gaspard Gahigi.  I saw them around the place; however, they did not take part in the meeting.  I merely saw them moving around.  They saw us, but they did not take part. 
Q.	Did an Interahamwe, Jean Berchmans Biziyaremye, B-I-Z-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E, take part in that meeting? 
A.	With reference to Biziyaremye, well, if you're talking about the Biziyaremye from Muhima, yes, he was in attendance.  In fact, his name was Habiyaremye and not Biziyaremye, and I did not know his Christian name. 
Q.	Is there a prisoner at Kigali prison with you by the name of Jean Berchmans Biziyaremye who was connected with the Interahamwe? 
A.	Counsel, I do not know any individual by that name.  I do not know that person, so I cannot tell you whether that person was in attendance or not.  Maybe, in order to refresh my memory, you might tell me which secteur he was an Interahamwe president for. 
Q.	Yes, I don't know necessarily that he was an Interahamwe president, but we have had testimony from another person that that person was told about this meeting by a prisoner at Kigali prison by the name of the Jean Berchmans Biziyaremye, so that's the context in which I'm putting that information to you. 
A.	I do not know that person.  And what is more, amongst the presidents of the Interahamwe that I do know, I have never come across such a person. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us, were there any officials of the national committee of the Interahamwe who participated in the meeting at the Diplomat hotel on the 11th of April? 
A.	Yes, some of the members of that committee were present, notably, the president at national level and Ephrem Nkezabera, who was his deputy, and Maniragaba, and there were lots of the members of the committee in attendance at that meeting. 
Q.	So you mentioned Robert Kajuga, Ephrem Nkezabera, and Bernard Maniragaba.  What about 
	Georges Rutaganda, was he present? 
A.	Yes, he was. 
Q.	Phénéas Ruhumuliza, first vice-president, was he present? 
A.	Yes, he was present, as was Georges Rutaganda. 
Q.	And was the secretary-general of the Interahamwe national committee, Eugene Mbarushimana, present? 
A.	I did not see him there.  What is more, I do not recall meeting a person by that name. 
Q.	What about the treasurer, Dieudonné Niyitegeka, was he present at the Diplomat hotel on the 
	11th of April? 
A.	You know, there were a lot of people there, and the people that I do remember are the ones whose names I have given to you.  I also know that Aloys Ngirabatware was there, and Ndabatwera (sic).  As far as Dieudonné is concerned, I do not remember having seen him there. 
Q.	And by -- you just referred to Nzabanterura, André, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's number 86 on our spelling list.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us what military authorities attended the meeting? 
A.	Yes, there were military authorities in attendance, indeed. 
Q.	Did you recognise any of them? 
A.	I remember that Bagosora was in attendance, and a number of others, whose names I did not know.  There were also some who were in attendance but whose names I can no longer recall.  But the fact is that Bagosora was indeed in attendance. 
Q.	What about General Gatsinzi, was he in attendance? 
A.	I no longer recall.  
Q.	What about General Ndindiliyimana, the chief of staff of the gendarmerie? 
A.	I did not see him there. 
Q.	Who was present representing UNAMIR? 
A.	We were told that it was Dallaire's deputy who was representing UNAMIR, and we were told that he was of Belgian nationality. 
Q.	Do you remember his name? 
A.	No, I no longer recall his name. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately how many people were in attendance at this meeting? 
A.	There were many people in attendance.  The room was full.  And in view of the fact that I did not know the seating capacity for that room, I would not be able to provide you with the number of people that were actually in attendance at that meeting. 
Q.	Was the room bigger than this courtroom? 
A.	No, I wouldn't say that it was larger than this courtroom.  
Q.	And who took the floor to open the meeting? 
A.	I no longer recall who was the first to speak. 
Q.	Can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what your understanding was of what was said at this meeting? 
A.	Inter alia, I remember that insistence was placed on the problems of security -- security, the people being killed.  And the second point was the refugees at the Gisimba orphanage.  General Dallaire was saying that they were seeking how to evacuate the orphans, help them to leave that place.  That is some of the points covered in the meeting that I remember. 
Q.	And were they speaking of the orphanage at Gisimba, G-I-S-I-M-B-A? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And was there discussion among the Interahamwe at the meeting about whether to agree to evacuate the orphans from Gisimba? 
A.	The problem was to know how to -- to access the orphanage.  It was managed by Maniragaba, who spoke often.  He said there were orphans at our place that had to be evacuated, the group at -- that was at Gisimba -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And another name which the interpreter failed to catch.  Perhaps the witness should repeat the whole answer. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, we had a problem receiving the translation of your last answer.  Would you mind repeating it, please?  
A.	I was saying that it was Maniragaba who often spoke, Bernard Maniragaba.  It was he who was making proposals that we should not try to evacuate the orphans at Gisimba and (unintelligible), the other orphans here and there.  He said that if we wanted to evacuate the orphans at Gisimba, we should include also the orphans here and there in the neighbourhoods. 
Q.	And what was the outcome of the meeting? 
A.	The discussions continued, and we agreed that it was necessary to go and see the person who had made the proposal.  So when the UNAMIR people left, we proceeded to distribute weapons, and when that exercise -- and as that exercise was still under way, two shells were fired at that place and we dispersed, each seeking how to get to his home. 
Q.	And when you say that "We were going to meet with the person who had made the proposal," who were you referring to? 
A.	I said that it was Dallaire's deputy.  That's what we were told in the course of the meeting. 
Q.	Now, was there any discussion at the meeting about the youth wings of the other parties having to follow the instructions of the leaders of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, we did speak of that.  It was decreed that we should stand together and no longer have suspicions, by which one should understand the Power wings of the other political parties, show united front.  
Q.	And was it agreed at this meeting at the Diplomat hotel that the youth wings would follow the instructions of Interahamwe leaders? 
A.	There were several things, Counsel:  There was to follow orders and to cooperate.  What I heard was that we had to cooperate and no longer be any confrontation. 
Q.	And was this said in the presence of the UNAMIR representative at the meeting? 
A.	No.  
Q.	So did the meeting continue inside the Diplomat hotel after the representative of UNAMIR had left? 
A.	The firearms were distributed, and that took place outside the conference room.  There was a military truck parked there, and the firearms were unloaded and distributed to the beneficiaries.  
Q.	And when was the decision taken that the youth wings of the other parties should cooperate with the Interahamwe leaders? 
A.	That was done before the start of the meeting, while we were awaiting the invitees, who were due to participate in the meeting, who arrived on the spot after the matter had been decided.  We had already heard the orders with regard to cooperation.  
Q.	And who was it that gave those orders at this meeting that took place before the UNAMIR representative arrived? 
A.	Among us, three people spoke:  Maniragaba, Sèraphin Twahirwa, Robert Kajuga.  
Q.	And who spoke on behalf of the Power wings to agree that they were to cooperate with the Interahamwe? 
A.	I no longer remember his name. 
Q.	Now, after the meeting, you've told us that weapons were distributed outside the hotel, and can you tell us who it was who was physically distributing those weapons?  
A.	In fact, the firearms were in crates.  In other crates there were ordnance, ammunition.  Other crates contained magazines, so, three type of crates.  Kajuga had a list and from the list would designate one person or another, from one secteur or another, and then the arms would be issued, distributed.  

So there were names of people, and it was Kajuga who supervised the distribution.  It was he who had the list and decided how many firearms to give to one neighbourhood or the other, one secteur or another, or one roadblock or another.  
Q.	And who had drawn up these lists? 
A.	No, I didn't know the person, but according to what I observed, it was when they were driving around, visiting the various roadblocks, the various neighbourhoods, I think it was on the basis of what they observed, that they prepared a list, and subsequently, the arms were issued, distributed.  
Q.	So you're saying that the list was prepared by the Interahamwe leaders who had gone around to the different roadblocks, including yours, on the 8th of April; is that what you're saying? 
A.	I will repeat the following:  The people that were supposed to receive on the roadblocks were named, taking account -- arms were issued, taking account of the situation of the roadblocks, but my -- that is, my position, I'm not telling you that because someone else told me, but it was my personal observation. 
Q.	And did you observe Bagosora give a list of people to receive weapons to Kajuga?  
A.	I did not see the list.  I did not see Bagosora give that list.  
Q.	Now, when you were interviewed by the Prosecutor in November of 2004, on page 8 of that record, that statement, on the sixth paragraph from the top, it is stated that "While we were in the room, an army lorry arrived carrying new Kalashnikovs.  They were distributed there by Kajuga, assisted by a member of the JDR, to the Interahamwe chiefs whose names appeared on a list given to Kajuga by Bagosora.  I was one of the recipients."  Did you make that statement to the Prosecutor? 
A.	I think that's a mistake, the question of Bagosora giving a list, when the statement was taken down.  I said that it was all done in the presence of other soldiers and Bagosora, but I'm not saying that it was Bagosora who gave him the list.  I confirm that Bagosora was informed, was aware of all that, and he was there when the firearms were being handed out, but I don't say that it was Bagosora who gave the list to Kajuga, Robert.  
Q.	So, when you did say that it was Bagosora who gave the list to Kajuga in your statement of 
	11 November 2004, that was mistake; is that your testimony? 
A.	I say that it's an error made by the person who took notes.  That's not what I said.  
Q.	Okay.  We understand you.  Now, did you ever tell -- you remember I gave you two pieces of paper today that had names on them; there was the first one and the second one.  I can show them to you again if you don't remember.  But now I'm speaking about the first person whose name was on the first paper that I gave you this morning to look at, which is Exhibit D. NZ198.  Did you ever tell that person that it was General Dallaire who had attended the meeting at the Diplomat hotel on the 
	11th of April 2004 (sic)? 
A.	How come -- how is that, Counsel?  How could I say that when I didn't see him?  We were informed that we were awaiting Dallaire's deputy, and he's the one who came. 
Q.	I'm going to read to you -- 
A.	We were awaiting Dallaire, but it was his deputy who came. 
Q.	Let me read to you from the testimony of that individual, and this is from the transcript of the 
	2nd of November 2006 at pages 66 and 67.  He said that he had received information about this meeting from you and that you gave them -- him this information when you were at Kigali main prison in around 2000, 2001, or 2002.  And then he went on to say that "He told me of a meeting which had been chaired by Colonel Bagosora, and he said he had attended that meeting.  He also told me Dallaire attended that meeting and that Callixte, too, attended that meeting."  And then he verified that it was at the Hôtel Diplomates.  And then he said that you had said that after Dallaire's departure, Bagosora had ordered for weapons to be brought in, and weapons were distributed -- that the weapons were distributed after Dallaire had left.  And then he was asked, "Was anyone present when Witness HH spoke to you about this in prison?"  And he said, "I went to see him asking for the information.  There was no one else.  We were just the two of us." 

Now, having heard that testimony given in this trial, can you comment on whether that testimony is correct?  
A.	What I am saying is that during those years, you say I met him; you spoke of 2000 and then 2001.  At that time, I had not yet confessed.  I had not yet gone through the proceeding of confessing and pleading guilty.  And, in any case, I wasn't in that prison.  I think I only arrived there in 2001.  You said that I said that it was Dallaire who came to the meeting and arms were issued in the meeting room.  That is not correct.  Please refer to my testimony.  There are even written statements on that subject.  As to the testimony of that responsable, it only commits himself, and so as you've read it to me, it is incorrect. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness HH.  Can you tell us approximately what time the meeting ended and -- well, what time did you leave the Diplomat hotel after receiving the weapons? 
A.	What I remember is that it was towards lunchtime.  We left the meeting place separately to meet again at Maniragaba's bar in Gitega. 
Q.	And when you say lunchtime, can you tell us approximately what hour of the day you're referring to? 
A.	No, I said in the afternoon.  When I said afternoon, it's because I can't say whether it was 2 p.m. or 
	3 p.m., but it was after noon, after noon. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Two words. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And approximately how much time had you spent at the Diplomat hotel from the time you arrived, which you say was around midday, until the time that you departed? 
A.	But, Counsel, I see that you are ascribing words to me that I did not speak.  I said I arrived between 
	10 and 12.  I didn't say I arrived at about noon or at about 12. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, my apologies for that.  And about how many hours did you spend there at the 
	Diplomat hotel before you left? 
A.	Well, it took a while.  It took a while.  There was the beginning of the meeting, we went on to discussions, so it took some time.  
Q.	Can you give us an idea of how much time? 
A.	I know I stayed there quite a while, but I cannot give you an estimate of the duration. 
Q.	The reason I'm asking you that, Witness HH, is that we've had testimony from two members of the Interahamwe national committee that, at the time same that you claim to be at the Diplomat hotel receiving weapons, that Maniragaba, Nkezabera, Niyitegeka, Serugendo, Sebanetsi were going around to the different roadblocks in Kigali, and they were passing on instructions from the MRND leadership that the killings had to stop, and that they even went to your roadblock, where you were in disagreement with those instructions.  Now, is it your testimony that at no time did you encounter any of those people on the 11th of April at your roadblock? 
A.	I told you I never saw them on that day, and that is the truth.  How do you expect to convince me that those top officials could give me orders and deny them?  If I refuse to obey, what did they do?  How could I avoid the orders given by those people?  What has been done to demonstrate that I refused to accept those orders?  Don't you think that there's some cheating?  They told you that I refused to accept those orders.  How?  How does that come about?  
Q.	Well, Witness HH, the testimony of Witness G, one of those people -- and this is from the 
	19th of October 2005 at page 23 -- was that people like you had become so powerful that members of the international -- Interahamwe national committee could no longer give orders to you.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	They're speaking of a power I had?  Well, it could only have come from them.  Have they shown from where -- from whence I had that power, because it only could come from them? 

Secondly, the people who provided you with this information, apart from the fact that they were trying to exculpate themselves, are there any among them who have confessed and said that?  If one or the other members of the committee has made a statement after going through the process of confession and pleading guilty, well, show me their statement, and then you can contradict me on the basis of that statement.  All they're trying to do is exonerate themselves. 
Q.	Well, Witness HH, I can only tell you that these were two witnesses that were brought here by the Prosecution.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
But, Mr. President, perhaps we could take our afternoon break at this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's time for lunch.  We rise now.  
(Court recessed at 1233H) 
(Pages 17 to 31 by Sherri Knox)











(Court resumed at 1415H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  Mr. Robinson, you can continue.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And, Mr. President, I'm pretty much on track to finish by the end of today.  I can't -- 100 per cent on track now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I thought so.  That's what I thought this morning.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yeah, but you never know -- but if things go as planned, I hope to finish by the end of the day today.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  So, Witness HH, you have told us that you did not receive the message of pacification from any Interahamwe leaders; correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And on the 9th of November, you testified here that, whether in the newspapers or over the radio, you never heard any message that "We should stop the killings"; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So, I take it then that you did not hear the address to the nation by President Sindikubwabo on the 8th of April in which he set forth the three tasks given to the new government and asked the Rwandan people to stay calm and refrain from killing others.  Did you hear that speech?
A.	No.
Q.	And I take it that you did not hear the speech of Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho on the 8th of April in which he urged of the population to respect the orders of the authorities and said it was forbidden to aggress other members of the population.
A.	No.
Q.	And I take it you didn't hear the communiqué of the five political parties, including the MRND, on the 10th of April in which they called for the restoration of security, regardless of a person's ethnic origin, party membership or region, and in which they urged the authorities to put an end to the massacres and punish those who broke the law.  Did you hear that message?
A.	No.
Q.	And I take it that you didn't hear the interview of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, on the 10th of April 1994, on Radio Rwanda when he said that MRND members, especially their youth, should refrain from criminal activity and that "those who were attacking us is the Inkotanyi and not the ordinary citizen in his house on the hill".  Did you hear that message?
A.	No.
Q.	And I take it that you didn't hear the message of Prime Minister Kambanda, on the 10th of April, on behalf of the interim government, when asked the minister of defence to do everything in his power to stop the massacres immediately and urge the prosecutors to punish those responsible for the massacres.  Did you hear that speech?
A.	No; I did not hear that speech allegedly made on the 10th.
Q.	And I take it you didn't hear the speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 10th, in which he addressed Rwandan people and said that no one has the right to tamper with the life of his or her neighbour and that the government had given orders that anyone caught committing such acts would be punished exemplarily and that unauthorised roadblocks were to be dismantled immediately.  Did you hear that speech?
A.	No, if that speech had been made, then those roadblocks would have been dismantled.
Q.	But for people, like yourself, who were not obeying authorities; correct?
A.	Counsel, you are saying that there were people who did not want to obey instructions.  Now, if we accept that I was not obeying instructions, if my roadblock was the only one which did not obey the instructions which were given, then I think there would have been peace throughout the country except in the place where I was controlling.
Q.	Witness HH, I take it you did not hear the speech by Prime Minister Kambanda after he met with the préfects -- all the préfets -- or, all those who attended on the 11th of April, in which he said that the population should be instructed that the attack by the RPF is not an excuse to incite one another and that no one ethnic group should exclude the other from the country.  Did you hear that speech?
A.	The speech made by Jean Kambanda, which I heard, was the one in which he said that members of the public had to have weapons, that is, firearms, which firearms they would carry along with them when they were going to work in their fields.
Q.	Witness HH, there have been approximately 50 speeches introduced in evidence in this trial, between the 8th of April and the time that people went into exile, in which different authorities -- the president, the prime minister, other ministers, minister of defence, the MRND, the political parties as a group, the préfets -- all called for an end to the killing.  Is it your testimony that you didn't hear a single one of those speeches?
A.	Counsel, I've told you I did not hear those speeches.  Well, perhaps, I was deaf; perhaps I could not hear.  But what I'd like is for you to prove to me that people were killed only in the area which was under my control.  Of course, that was not the case.  You always try to put to me speeches allegedly made, but everybody knows how the speeches were made, and they also knew what was the hidden message in those speeches.  I'm not the only one who did not hear those speeches.  If the others had understood and complied with the instructions, as you are purporting, then I do not think the country would have witnessed such a tragedy.
Q.	Yes, Witness HH, I agree that you were not the only killer or bandit that was operating in Rwanda during the period after April 6, 1994, but you were certainly one of the biggest and most notorious, and it's our position that even the authorities couldn't stop you.  Would you like to comment on that?
A.	Counsel, I think it is the second time that you are making such utterances, but I would like to know from you how somebody like me would have disobeyed instructions, whereas in the country there were authorities and soldiers.  What did they do to prevent me from disobeying?  I could not have resisted such an entire government.  Once again, I would like you to tell me where I derived such a strength from.  I got that strength from some people.  That should be clear.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the witness be shown Exhibit D. NZ78, which is a transcript of a radio broadcast on the***************?
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, what has been placed before you is a transcript of a radio broadcast on the *************** by Préfet Renzaho, and I want to direct your attention to a certain portion of this radio broadcast that concerns you.  And, first of all, do you see on the first page behind the cover sheet that the speaker is listed as Tharcisse Renzaho, préfet of the préfecture of Kigali-ville?  Do you see that after the very first page after the cover sheet?
A.	I have not read the speech, but I believe that you should not rely upon it.  It would be a great mistake because this speech was given but the criminal acts continued.  So, if this speech was not followed up with action, then how can you rely upon it, because nothing was done to stop the killings?  It could be that it was a speech that was made in order not to put people off their negligence, but you also should know what he said subsequently.  You heard what he said when he pleaded guilty.  So, when you want to put a document before me, you should go into the basis of the document.  You need to go into detail.
Q.	Well, Witness HH, this is a document -- an address by Préfet Renzaho, who has not pled guilty, and I just want you to see where your area is mentioned in this speech, because Préfet Renzaho spoke of a specific activity occurring in your area when he addressed the public on the****************.  So what I would like you to do -- first of all, I want you to understand -- if you look at the first page of the document after the cover sheet, you see that it says the speaker is Tharcisse Renzaho, and there's a page number "21" on the top.  So could you find that for me, please?
MR. ROBINSON:
Or perhaps the registrar can assist so that we know that he has the right page.
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, before being able to make use of this passage, I would like to say that, indeed, yes, this address was given, but the killings continued.  Because in the area******************, there were soldiers present when the killings started and, what's more, they were officers.  And I did not see anybody who was a soldier being rid of their position.  So, if you say that I was the only person who did not obey instructions that were given, then I would like to ask you why the other neighbourhoods also lived through such problems.  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that there were speeches written when people were in the Congo.  These were speeches that were aimed at throwing people off kilter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what had been drawn to my attention is that although you have not mentioned the -- nobody has mentioned names, the names are in the exhibit which is not under seal, and so we are wondering whether we should make an order to put the exhibit under seal for that purpose.
MR. ROBINSON:
I think that's a good idea.  Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
I fully agree, Your Honour, but -- I know the Court has addressed this, but I'll just comment again that I would love to know what is in the speech, but I can't read it.  It is in Kinyarwanda, and there's no other transcript for it.  So, we'll put it under seal but, for us, it is now indecipherable for us as it now --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I had already had indicated that we had, in fact, arrangements with the language department, and plans are already in place for providing translations for these documents.  But I order that this exhibit goes under seal now.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.

If the registry could go before the witness to turn the page to the page that has the number "25" on the top, so the witness has the correct page.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness HH, I am going to read to you the portion of the broadcast that begins on the second paragraph to the bottom of that page, right after the 16 minutes and 4 seconds is noted, and the first word in Kinyarwanda is "ndagira" and Préfet Renzaho has announced that meetings were going to be held --
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry to interrupt, but can't we have a Kinyarwanda speaker read that and then we can hear the translation?
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm going to ask the -- I think it would be easier because there are some words in here that I don't think should be stated out loud.  If I give him the translation that I believe exists and if he -- he can correct me if I am wrong.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness, you read along with me and tell me if I make any mistakes, but what is said here in this broadcast, first, is that "I wish these meetings to make decisions that can allow to us restore calm within the population and these killings and lootings should stop forever".  And then he goes on to say that "I would like -- again tell the population that we need their help.  We need them to remain in this town of Kigali.  How come some people go and set roadblocks, in public roads, especially" -- and then, he names a location, and the location is your roadblock.  And he says that "It is not understandable because this road is used by so many vehicles supplying this town".  And he says, "If they continue, the town will not get supplies, and that's why I order that those doing it to stop it definitely, and I call to the population who witness this criminal acts, to denounce the criminals, especially, that we have relevant organs who should meet."  And he goes on to say that "Instructions have been issued that checkpoints on that road should be removed and the perpetrators of crimes should be punished accordingly, and that this is disorder and we cannot tolerate it.

So, do you agree that, on the ***************1994, Préfet Renzaho got on the radio and, specifically, called for your roadblock to be removed?
A.	No, I do not agree with you.  As you have just read from this excerpt, and I believe I said this during my testimony, between my roadblock and another location I know that such acts were committed, and that is reflected in the report that we drafted.  I know that some people saw their belongings confiscated, and I believe that I told you that the former chief of staff, Mr. Bizimungu, stopped at****************, and a member of the population told him that*****************************************************, and the member of the population indicated the place where his property had been confiscated.  I went there myself and soldiers also came to the place, and it was noted that I was not responsible.

I went to the préfectures outside of Kigali, and I took supplies with me, foodstuffs, and I wanted to supply the town of Kigali.  So, such acts were not generalised, but I believe that I do agree that at one location such acts were committed, but that was not at my roadblock.  They were bandits and we knew who they were and we did everything in our power stop them, in collaboration with soldiers but, unfortunately, we were not able to arrest them.  But when you say that it was my roadblock, I must say that that was not the case because there were soldiers at my roadblock and there were officers, so it wasn't just any old soldier what was manning my roadblock.
Q.	So, it's your testimony that when the préfet was talking about the roadblock and your location, he was not speaking of you; is that correct?
A.	No, he was not referring to my roadblock.  If you do not trust what I say, there is a conseiller who was at the head of that secteur, who is currently a detainee at ***********prison, who would be able to give you more information on the subject.  He was the one who helped me to dismantle the roadblock that had been set up -- those roadblocks that had been set up illegally.  I could even give you the name of that conseiller if you so wish, and if you need to put questions to him, then I will give you his name.
Q.	Okay, I would like to have his name.  I am concerned that if you give the name, though, it may reveal -- if you give the name out loud, it may reveal your secteur, so I think it would be better if you could write his name down.  If the registrar could give you a piece of paper and you could write his name down, I think that would be the best course to adopt.
MR. ROBINSON:
And while he is writing that, I have an exhibit to distribute.  The exhibit was given to the Prosecutor a few days ago, but I'm now ready to use it, and I have hard copies for everyone, and if the registrar could distribute that while he's writing the names down.  Thank you.

Excuse me, Mr. Registrar, have you distributed these to the booths also?
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness HH, have you written down the name of the conseiller now?
A.	Yes, I have finished, Counsel.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the piece of paper on -- which he has written down the name of the conseiller on be admitted as D. NZ201, under seal?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No.  D. NZ201 admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, and if the registrar could pick up the document from the witness, that he has written the name on, and leave him a copy of this new exhibit, if he doesn't already have one.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness HH, what I've now distributed and placed before you are notes of a minister by the name of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, and the notes of a meeting of the council of ministers that were taken on the 15th of April 1994, and I'm going ask the legal -- my legal assistant to read the last point on the bottom of the first page, which is in French, so that you could understand what was being said at the council of ministers on the 15th of April.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me; before we start, I think we are having some translation issues.  The date of this meeting is the 15th April 1994, not 2004.  Thank you.
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
I shall read the last four lines of said document. "Soldiers and former soldiers and armed bandits, bandits armed with guns, grenades and knives stay in Gitarama." -- Witness HH -- "... and consorts; measures: increase the number of gendarmes and intensify - or, increase the number of patrol rounds within the population."
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. Nsengiyumva.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Robinson, the last exhibit number was 199.
MS. KOUO:
The last exhibit number was 201, not 191.
MR. ROBINSON:
I think -- yeah, that's correct, 201 is the last -- I think maybe it came through -- okay.  Anyway, thank you very much.

And, Mr. President, at this time, this document which I just had read to the witness was admitted as an exhibit, D. 355, in the Nyiramasuhuko trial and it was on the 28th September 2005, at page 38, and I would like to offer it at this time as Exhibit D. NZ202.
MR. WEBSTER:
This is a strange sort of exhibit, Your Honour, and it poses the same sort of problem that we have for the UNAMIR documents because what basis do we have now for admitting this particular piece of paper?  As a practical matter, the Prosecution will seek to enter the entire diary of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko at some point, so this could actually be marked for identification, and then the whole diary could come in at a later time, but simply to suggest that this contradicts the witness is insufficient for this to be admitted into evidence at this time.  So, perhaps, the Court would like to express itself.  I'm not, you know, a hundred per cent opposed to it being admitted because we want the whole diary admitted eventually.  But, to me, it poses the same type of legal issues that the Court is addressing with other documents that have been marked for identification.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, Mr. President, I'm not going to press this point.  I thought I would give it a try, but I don't think that there's a basis for admissibility of the document over the Prosecutor's objection at this point, so I'd ask that it be marked as ID. NZ54 for the time being.  May it be so marked?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness HH --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, there's just one point that is bothering us.  I find it a little bit illogical.  You say you want this document admitted, which is part of a larger document Mr. Prosecutor says he wants admitted, and then you are not going to fight about admission.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, at some point we could discuss how they are going to get admission of that document.  It may very well be that we don't object to it, but at this point I don't think it's wise to spend time arguing over the diary.  If the Prosecutor objects, okay.
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps I wasn't clear.  My concern is not this one -- these two pieces of paper; my concern is for the consistency of our approach, and I ask the Court for guidance on this --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  I agree; it's not admissible at this point in time.  I am having second thoughts about the issue of marking it for identification, as well.  But, in the meantime, I think we will mark it in for identification.

Mr. Robinson has agreed he has not laid a foundation and he is hoping (unintelligible) 
MR. ROBINSON:
And I do intend to lay a foundation ultimately, so it's important that this document be marked for identification so that it can be upgraded to an exhibit when Minister Nyiramasuhuko testifies.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification number?
MR. ROBINSON:
ID. NZ54.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ54, marked for identification)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness HH, what we have shown you are the notes of a minister who was attending a meeting on the 15th of April 1994 in Murambi, in which they were discussing problems with militaries -- excuse me, I think there might be another translation problem.  It's the 15th of April 1994.  Maybe I was -- maybe it's been me who's saying "2004".  In any event, the date is the 15th of April 1994.  So, to begin again, the minister took down some notes at this meeting, and they were discussing militaries and ex-militaries and bandits who were causing disturbances in Gitarama, and they mentioned one name, and that name was yours, and then talk about some measures they could take to stop people like you.  So, isn't it a fact that what you were doing was not supported by the authorities, but it was condemned by them?
A.	With reference to this document, well, I am not surprised.  If you are talking about Nyiramasuhuko, I'm not surprised that these notes belong to her.  You say that that person mentioned my name.  That surprises me because nobody told me that.  I do not understand how it is that I did not glean that information, that is, that I was mentioned during a council of ministers meeting.  I would like to say that Nyiramasuhuko is one of your clients, so I cannot take this document as valid.  To my mind, it is pure fabrication.  If my case had been discussed at a council of ministers meeting, then at least somebody would have told me about it.  And what is more, I did meet with your client in Gitarama and nobody told me about this.  So, I believe that the contents of this document are pure fabrication.  It is but a tissue of lies, so I do not give any truth over to the contents of this document.
Q.	Thank you very much for that comment.  Now, it's true, is it not, that, according to you, Georges Rutaganda was somebody of higher rank than you in the Interahamwe; correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And isn't it a fact that in April of 1994 Georges Rutaganda had to pay you tens of thousands of francs in order to let two girls from his residence pass through your roadblock?
A.	You should explain the situation as I recounted it.  It was a person who provided that information.  He gave me that sum of money so that I could help him and help those young girls pass through the roadblocks between Gacyingoro (phonetic) and Gitarama.  If he says he handed over that sum of money to me and whether I helped these girls, yes or no, well, no, I did not manage to help those girls.  I was the one who volunteered that information.  He asked me to help him, but I did not manage to do so.  Did he tell you that he had brought those young girls to me?  I told them to turn back when those girls got to Muhima, and I was the one to volunteer that information.
Q.	Thank you, Witness HH.  Now, Witness HH, did you participate in an attack on Mugina parish -- that's M-U-G-I-N-A -- in Gitarama?
A.	With reference to the Mugina attack, I must say that I have never set foot in Mugina.
Q.	You have never set foot in Mugina commune?
A.	Never, sir.
Q.	Let me first make reference, then, to a document that was provided to us by the Prosecutor as Rule 68 material.  It's K0294802, and it's a sworn statement before Rwandan authorities of an individual named Pierre Ntibitura, that's N-T-I-B-I-T-U-R-A.  And this witness says that he was at Mugina parish on the 20th of April 1994 when you and your group attacked the parish and a total of some 36,000 persons were killed, and he also says in his statement that you killed the bourgmestre, Callixte Ndagijimana, that's N-D-A-G-I-J-I-M-A-N-A.  Is that true?
A.	No.  It is false, very false.  In fact, I heard people talk about it in 1998, the first time.  There's one prison warden in ***************who talked about it to me.  What I'm telling you is that I have never been to Mugina in my whole life.  I don't even know that place.  From what I was told, it was one of the communes of Gitarama préfecture, but I have never set foot in that commune.
Q.	Well, another witness who gave a statement to the Rwandan authorities, which is found at K0294829, by the name of Claudine Nyiransabimana -- that's N-Y-I-R-A-N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A -- said that she was in Mugina commune, Ngoma secteur -- that's N-G-O-M-A  -- around ten o'clock in the morning on 18th of April when you and your group attacked and that you and your group came back and attacked Mugina parish the following week.  Do you have any comment on that?
A.	Be it this lady or the other gentleman, whose statement you have just referred to, I don't know those people and, as I have told you, I have never set foot on that commune.  If you say those people have testified before Rwandan courts, well, I hope those people will show proof that I had set foot on Mugina commune.
Q.	Witness HH, I am going to also ask you about yet another statement from the Prosecution's Rule 68 disclosure, and K0294812, from a woman named Euphansie (sic) -- no; excuse me, Epiphaniye, E-P-I-P-H-A-N-I-Y-E, Mukantwari, M-U-K-A-N-T-W-A-R-I, Mukantwari, and she was also in Ngoma secteur, Mugina commune, and said that "On the 18th of April 1994, I was in my secteur.  An attack led by" -- Witness HH -- "on board, three vehicles came, and they opened fire on us, and two people were killed at the home of Anastase Rwabuhungu" -- that's R-W-A-B-U-H-U-N-G-U -- "and we fled to the parish and" -- Witness HH -- "came with his Interahamwe and fired at us, killing many."  Is that true?
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness's answer -- this line of questioning is completely appropriate, but I would appreciate it if Mr. Robinson did not introduce this document by saying it's a document from the Prosecutor that was made available through Rule 68, because this witness can't possibly understand the implications of that.  I think it'd be more helpful to say that this is a witness statement taken in 1997 by Rwandan authorities, in his file in Rwanda, and then he can know what he is up against.  That's my only observation.
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine.  I was actually including the Rule 68 to help Mr. Webster to locate the documents, but the point is understood.
MR. WEBSTER:
I appreciate being able to locate the document, that's not my concern, so I thank you for that.  I'm trying to make sure that the witness understands your question.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness, do you have any comments you'd like to make on the allegation of Ms. Mukantwari?
A.	What I can see is that you keep on putting to me statements given by various people but, as I have told you, I have never set foot in Mugina commune.  I never went there, be it on foot or in a vehicle.  I don't know that place.  If those people allege that I had gone to that place, then they would be able to prove so before a court of law, and then I will have my opportunity to explain.  I don't know whether those people know me or whether they got information regarding me from other persons.  What I know is that there are certain things which I have acknowledged.  If I had gone to Mugina, then I would have admitted having been there.
Q.	Witness HH, the last witness statement I'm going ask you about has K0294793.  It's a statement from Augustin Kalingire -- K-A-L-I-N-G-I-R-E.  And he says, that you -- that Witness HH was called to intervene in Runda as the locals resisted killing, and on the 18th of April, three vehicles transporting Interahamwe, led by you, arrived there.  Witness HH "opened fire and people were killed, including Serudonyori".  That's S-E-R-U-D-O-N-Y-O-R-I.  He says that on the 21st you came back with your Interahamwe and led the attacks on Mugina parish.  Then he said when he was in Kabgayi -- that's K-A-B-G-A-Y-I -- you and your Interahamwe used to come and load people to be killed, and that you also looted cows and properties, as well.  What do you have to say to that?
A.	Regarding the incident concerning Runda, I know very well that place.  I went there on the 9th.  I remember, yes, that I went on the 9th to that place.  But in the three trading centres I was able to visit, there was no killing.  Some people of that area know me and there are some others whom I know.  The other time when I went to Runda was towards the end of June 1994.  There was heavy fighting in that place.  We went there to evacuate dead bodies and injured persons, be they soldiers or Interahamwe; it was actually a mixture of those two groups.  In fact, I was fired at when I was in that area.  There is proof to that.  I'm not the one who asked people in Runda to kill or who killed people in Runda.

Regarding Kabgayi, I went there on two occasions.  I was able to save a Tutsi family, comprising 11 people.  When I talk about 11 family members, it includes children.  So, the lady sent me a message, saying that she needed my assistance, and when I arrived there, she told me that there were some unusual killings going on in Kagbayi, that young girls and young persons were being abducted and taken to an unknown place to be killed.  So, she pleaded with me to take her son and her daughter and evacuate them.  I told her that in Gitarama, at a place called Mucyakabiri, there was a roadblock which could not be crossed, but she told me to take them along, and even if they were to be killed, she wouldn't blame me for that.  So I accepted to take those two children.

I did all what was within my power to rescue them, and I succeeded in doing so.  I took them to their home because they were neighbours of mine.  I assigned a group of people the task of ensuring their safety.  There were a number of soldiers who were trying to rape that young girl, but they did not succeed because I had assigned the task of protecting them to a group of people.  A number of days later I went to Kabgayi again.  I was able to save a number of people, 10 people, who I took to my home and I kept until the day we went into exile.

So, if you don't want to understand what I'm telling you, then I would ask you to go to my home area.  I know very well that you are familiar with that place.  You can go there, conduct inquiries, and you will receive information from people which may convince you.  Regarding those two people, *************** ******************************************************************************************************************* ******************************************************************************************************************** **********************************He may make it possible for you to contact those two people and he may give you information regarding the trips I made to Kabgayi.
Q.	Witness HH, how was it that you were saving some Tutsis and ordering others who passed through your roadblock to be killed?  What was your thinking at the time?
A.	You should simply know that it is not possible to exterminate an entire group.  I have described the circumstances under which people were stopped at roadblocks.  I think that, above all, it is necessary to conduct inquiries to ascertain whether what I'm telling you is the truth, but know that, as far as I am concerned, I am telling you the truth.  You cannot exterminate an entire ethnic group.
Q.	And what criteria did you use to decide which members of the Tutsi ethnic group should live and which should die?
A.	Counsel, I don't think that question of yours concerns me.  I have told you of Tutsis who were rescued.  I am going to ask you to go to my area and you will find Tutsis there who will tell you how they were rescued.  Even when we went to the Congo on exile, there were some Tutsis who accompanied us there, and who are still alive.  So when you start putting such questions to me, my inference is that you are simply saying that I'm not telling the truth.  So, what I can ask you is to go to my area and talk to those people.
Q.	Witness HH, assuming that you are telling the truth about the Tutsis you saved, and actually I have no reason to doubt you, my question is: what were the criteria you used to save some Tutsis and kill others?
A.	Counsel, I can see that you are insisting on this question.  It is very difficult for me to answer it.  I know that it is not a peculiar case which concerns only our own area.  I know very well that in other areas there were people who struggled to save others, who were even ready to sacrifice their lives just to rescue others.  I don't know whether you are aware that there were some people who were even ready to sacrifice their lives just to save others.
Q.	Well, that -- let's talk about those who were killed.  Did you participate in any attacks against Tutsi after the 6th of April 1994?
A.	An attack at which I participated and during which people were killed was when we took part in the combat between the Rwandan government forces and the RPF troops.  I went there.  But when I was going to the front, it was to evacuate dead bodies and the wounded.  We had to take the injured people to the hospital, and the dead ones had to be buried.  We participated in the combat, and when the enemy proved stronger than us, we had to retreat.  When there were such tactical retreats and when we crossed Tutsis in the course of our retreat, we would kill them because it was said that the Tutsis were the ones accommodating the RPF troops.  That said, when we went to the battleground, my mission -- or, the mission of my group was to evacuate the dead and the injured.
Q.	Witness HH, you have testified that your instructions from Kajuga were to flush out Tutsis.  Did you follow those instructions?
A.	Counsel, I'm going to repeat what I've said already.  That even existed before the genocide.  It was necessary to know how to flush out the enemy.  Regarding RPF troops, everybody knew that they were the enemy.  The problem was in connection the accomplices, because it was known that the RPF had accomplices, and by "accomplices" we had to add people who sent contributions.  There were also some Tutsis who sent their children to be trained by the Inkotanyi.  Those were the people considered as accomplices, but I've told you that after the death of the president of the republic, those people were amongst the first to be killed.
Q.	But when you were following the instructions to flush out Tutsis after the death of President Habyarimana, did you limit yourself to those persons who might be considered accomplices, or did you flush out all Tutsis?
A.	When I talked about accomplices, and I am referring to the period before the death of the president of the republic.  After his death, all Tutsi had to be killed, but as I said earlier on, one cannot exterminate an entire ethnic group.  Let me point out to you that the Tutsi, who were able to survive the tragedy, survived because there were some of us who had the good will to save them.
Q.	But, Witness HH, what did you do after the 6th of April to flush out Tutsis?  Did you simply sit at your roadblock and wait for them to arrive, or did you move about looking for Tutsis in hiding?
A.	Counsel, I have always said that we set up roadblocks.  We did not set up any illegal roadblocks.  The legally set up roadblocks were dismantled.  I was amongst the group of Interahamwe which killed people.  And I told you that we tried to get them from like -- everywhere, in all areas, but if you still belabour this issue of legal roadblocks, I would like to tell you that whenever there was an illegally set-up roadblock, we would go and dismantle the roadblock, and we sent reports when such things happened.
Q.	But can we agree that, among the activities that you engaged in, after the 6th of April, was going around trying to flush out Tutsis who were in hiding?
A.	Yes, Tutsis were being sought out.
Q.	Now, you've made an offer to have plead guilty.  You've asked for forgiveness.  Can you tell us, approximately, how many Tutsis were killed by people****************************?
A.	I don't have an exact figure.  Besides, in my confession, there is no mention of the people I killed.  Let me give you an example.  Your clients are charged with committing killings, but what I know very well is that none of them personally killed.  It's the same thing concerning me.  I know that the people ******* **********committed killings, but I did not personally kill anybody.
Q.	Yes, I understand that.  So, what you are saying, Witness HH -- but my question was -- I think it's important for the Trial Chamber to have some understanding of the scope of your conduct during these events after the death of the president.  So, I am asking you -- I know you didn't count at the time, but to give us an estimate, a rough estimate, of the number of Tutsi who were killed by people who were **********************************.
A.	I'm unable to give a figure.  Now I understand your question very well.  If I try to give an estimate, I would say that in our neighbourhood -- well, it is very difficult for me to give an estimate.  Let me give an example regarding the cellule I lived in.  I was aware that 12 people were killed.  Everybody in our neighbourhood knew that those people had been killed, and the people who killed them have confessed.  What I am telling you is that it is very difficult for me to give you an exact figure, because I know that the figures in our neighbourhood were exaggerated.  Many people were killed, but it is not possible for me to give you the specific figure of the number of people in our neighbourhood killed by the men*************************.
Q.	Okay, Witness HH, now, can you tell us: did the RPF kill civilians in Rwanda during the war starting on 6 April 1994?
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, I would object to that question.  What is the basis for that line of questioning?
MR. ROBINSON:
We could start out with Professor Reyntjens book, the Prosecutor's own investigations into the killings by Rwandan civilians by the RPF.  I'm simply asking this witness to what extent he is aware of that.
MR. WEBSTER:
My objection is to relevancy.  How is it pertinent to this witness's cross-examination or to the Defence case?
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like me answer that?  I know that you don't want to have extended debates, but if you'd like me to answer, I can.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it will need an extended debate to answer that point.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, our position is that the killing by the RPF that took place in Kigali demonstrates that the RPF -- it was the RPF who launched the war after the 6th of April, beginning with the attack on the president's plane, and that the reaction of the population to that included killings, such as those committed********* *************************************, and that, therefore, those killings are relevant to understand the motivations and the feeling -- and the feelings and the fear that were present in Kigali at the time this witness acted.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if that's the line of questions, Mr. Robinson has already asked those questions.  He asked about the response of this witness after his perception of the death of the president.  Going any further than that to enquire into the number of -- or, the allegation of RPF killing of civilians is not a relevant issue for this trial or this witness, so that's the basis of my objection.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's now 3:30.  I think we will take the mid-afternoon recess now.
(Court recessed at 1530H)
(Pages 32 to 45 by Verna Butler)







(Court resumed at 1605H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can resume.

Mr. Robinson, with regard to the issue, we accept that you are entitled to put the Defence theory to the witness.  We have already made a written decision on an aspect of that.  So we expect you to keep within the borders of the theory that you have put and have the questions related to that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, did you come to learn that the RPF had killed civilians in Rwanda during the period after the 6th April 1994? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would still object, Your Honour.  What is basis the for this particular question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, our problem has to do with finesse, finessing the issue.  The way you put the question opens up the whole issue of RPF killings in Rwanda which we have already decided is not an issue in this trial.  And the way you put the question is not exactly consistent with how you expressed the Defence theory, which we thought was a legitimate theory to produce.  So it is a question of organising your questions to fit into the statement that you had made earlier.  We said that you are entitled to do that, but we don't want you to open up the whole issue of a completely irrelevant enquiry to our trial. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, during the month of April 1994, did you learn that the RPF had been killing civilians in Kigali? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm still objecting, Your Honours, because that whole -- my understanding of Mr. Robinson's line of enquiry or his Defence case is that he is explaining the motivation of the killers; and what they learned subsequently is irrelevant to that issue, so that is the basis for my objection. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, when you earlier responded to the objection, you indicated that it was the Defence theory that the RPF killed the president and that consequently -- and that --and after that the RPF started the killings.  And the population reacted by starting killings in Rwanda.  So your response to the objection was, in a way, putting across the Defence theory of how the events transpired, the sequence of events.  And I think that is what we are saying, that if you are putting your theory of how the events evolved, that is a difficult matter.  But if you put the question in a general form as to whether the witness heard about RPF killings, then we will end up going into where these killings took place, how many people were killed, et cetera, et cetera, which, as the President has already said, we've ruled that is not relevant to the issues before us. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Your Honour, I don't think, maybe, I have expressed the theory well enough then, because it wasn't only about the sequence of events, and it goes beyond that.  And it goes to the fact that when the RPF began the war, that people killed Tutsis for a number of reasons.  Some of them killed Tutsi because they were either victims or their families were victims of killings by the RPF; they were refugees from areas where the RPF was killing.  Others killed because they heard that the RPF was killing Hutus in Remera, killing Hutus on their grounds; and it made them angry and made them fearful; and as a result of that, they joined in the killings.  Other people maybe were killing for totally different reasons; maybe they just hated Tutsi.  So there is a myriad of reasons why people were killing.  

And I think that it is a component of that that people were reacting to the action of the RPF, not solely in shooting down the president's plane, but in the activities of the 7th of April and afterwards in which they were killing people in the zones in which they were active.  So, that is broader than simply setting the sequence of events.  And I think I am entitled to ask this witness what he learned in April 1994 about the killings of the RPF and how that affected people during that time.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I can offer an additional response, Your Honour, but I think my last submission covers my concern, which is that, you know, Mr. Robinson has to link his question to the motivation of this witness or to the motivation of militia that this witness would have come in contact with.  We are not exploring the issue of killings of civilians generally.  The issue, as I understand it from Mr. Robinson, is what did this witness perceive in relation to what action flowed from that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we do allow the question.  You have been wondering what has been concerning us, and it is an issue of the technique of addressing the issue.  But we have decided to let you ask the question. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, during the month of April 1994, did it come to your attention that the RPF was killing civilians in Kigali? 
A.	I was not aware that the RPF was killing civilians in Kigali.  I did not follow up such an incident, or an event. 
Q.	And as you are here now in 2006 as a prisoner in Kigali, having been in the country since 1997, are you aware that the RPF killed civilians in zones in which they occupied in Kigali after the 6th of April; do you know anything about that? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm objecting for the same reason, this goes beyond what I understand to be the Court's ruling on the matter.  We are not talking about what the witness knows in 2006.  What is relevant to this trial is what he knew or what he perceived as he was going about his business from April, moving forward. 
MR. ROBINSON:
	Mr. President, if you let me respond to that I would like to have the witness take off his headphones; otherwise, if you overrule the objection we can go forward? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We overrule the objection.  We think there is a challenge on credibility. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Exactly, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness HH, you can keep your headphones on.  And my question to you is whether, even as of today, you know of any killings by the RPF in the zones that they controlled in Kigali after the             6th of April 1994.  
A.	Given that I was not an eyewitness to those RPF acts, I'm not in a position to confirm that to you. 
Q.	Well, Witness HH, you were not an eyewitness to other events in which -- of which you have testified; for example, the meeting on the 10th of April attended by Gervais, supposedly.  So that doesn't disqualify you or give you an excuse not to answer the question.  

	So, are you aware today that in 1994, after the 6th of April, RPF killed civilians in areas of Kigali that they controlled?  
A.	The only information I know is information concerning fighting.  When there are two belligerents, of course, there would be innocent victims.  So, I'm not in a position to tell you that this or that person was killed by the RPF when I do not have any proof of that.  Granted such information can be heard, but to confirm such information when you are not an eyewitness to it would not be fair. 
Q.	Well, that is interesting, Witness HH, that you want to be fair to the RPF but not to the Accused in this case when you have repeated information told to you by others to which you were not an eyewitness.  But, be that as it may, were you aware that the préfet of Ruhengeri, who was living in Kigali on the     7th of April, was murder by the RPF? 
A.	Which préfet of Ruhengeri are you referring to, Counsel?  
Q.	I'm referring to the préfet whose name was Sylvestre Baliyanga, B-A-L-I-Y-A-N-G-A? 
A.	I did not know that préfet. 
Q.	Have you heard that he was killed by the RPF on the 7th of April in Kigali? 
A.	I told you that I did not know him. 
Q.	Well, I didn't know President Kennedy, but I heard he was assassinated in November of 1962.  So, answer my question please; did you hear whether or not he was killed by the RPF? 
A.	Were I to have known him I would be able to confirm that fact.  The problem is, however, that I did not know that person. 
Q.	Did you ever hear that the préfet of Ruhengeri had been murder by the RPF? 
A.	I only knew Nzabageragaza or Zigiranyirazo as préfet of Ruhengeri, that I knew. 
Q.	Did you hear that the former préfet of Kigali, Claudien Habarushaica, H-A-B-A-R-U-S-H-A-I-C-A, was killed by the RPF? 
A.	With reference to Claudien Habarushaica, when we were in exile in Rubara (phonetic), her -- his wife in Uvira, his wife came to find us to tell us that her husband had been killed.  However, she did not tell us whether he had been killed by the RPF.  She told us that her husband died during fighting that occurred in their neighbourhood.  

So, in view of the fact that I was not interested, and that her husband was a member of the opposition, I was not interested in finding out precisely in what circumstances her husband met his death.  What is more, I would add that his nephew told us that he thought that the RPF could not have killed Habarushaica in view of the fact that he was one of them.  I remember that his nephew uttered those words when we were in Uvira.  And that gave rise to a misunderstanding between Claudien's wife and his nephew. 
Q.	Witness HH, did you learn that the sous-préfet of Kigali-rural, by the name of Sekagina, S-E-K-A-G-I-N-A, had been killed by the RPF?
A.	Counsel, I do know Sekagina, he was a sous-préfet.  We went into exile together, and we lived in Bukavu refugee camp together.  Even when he was still working in Rushashi we would meet on a regular basis.  I am surprised that you say that he was killed by the RPF, whereas, we were living together in a refugee camp from Kashusha to Bukavu, and that is the first time that I have heard talk that that sous-préfet was killed by the RPF.  I did not know that fact. 
Q.	Okay, I will have to inform Professor Reyntjens of that so that he can take that man out of his book as one of the people who was killed on the 7th of April by the RPF.  But anyway, let me just ask you one more since you were used to going and picking people from Kabgayi, who killed the bishops and the priests there? 
A.	As regards those bishops and priests from Kabgayi, well I heard people say that they were allegedly killed by the RPF.  Now, as regards other people that you suggested to me, well, I believe that you should be content with the responses that I am providing you with.  But as regards the bishops, I heard people talk about that when I was in prison. 
Q.	I want to ask you some questions about the meetings you claim to have had in Murambi in               April of 1994.  You testified that you had a first meeting where you went in the company of Kajuga, Maniragaba, Rutaganda, Twahirwa and Aloys Ngirabatware, and that there was a meeting on that occasion.  Do you recall that?  
A.	Yes, I do recall. 
Q.	And were you in the hall with the members of the MRND national committee, Mr. Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera and Karemera, during the reports made by the Interahamwe on that occasion? 
A.	No, I could not take part in such a meeting.  I went to Murambi with the view to accompanying those leaders.  But after their meeting, I then went into the room in order to greet them. 
Q.	But you were not in the hall when the members of the Interahamwe national committee were reporting in the presence of Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse and Karemera; is that correct? 
A.	No, I did not go into the room, but at the end of their meeting I went in with a view to greeting Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse and Karemera. 
Q.	Let me read to you from your statement that was filed with the court on the 30th of March 2006.  And I'm going to read to you paragraph 40 of what you told the Prosecutor on an earlier occasion: 

	"I have remembered that I was in the hall with the national bureau of the Interahamwe members when the first reporting meeting took place in the presence of Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera and Karemera at the Murambi training centre.  Only Ngirumpatse spoke, while Nzirorera and Karemera seemed to show little interest in the discussions and were going in and out of the meeting room.  Ngirumpatse asked about the situation in Kigali.  And in reply we described in detail the attacks carried out and their outcome, as well as the support giving to soldiers in identifying Tutsi.  We also told him about our ammunition requirements.  In answer, Ngirumpatse gave us his moral support, and assured us that we would receive the ammunition requested." 

Now, did you make that statement to the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	Counsel, what you have just said is not correct.  I did not go into the room.  They had gone there, into that meeting room, to discuss a number of problems.  I did not accompany them into the room.  At the end of the meeting I went into the meeting room, and I merely entered it with a view to greeting them.  

When I greeted Mathieu, he asked me what situation was prevailing in our area, and I described it to him.  So I did not go with the view to taking part in the discussions.  I merely went there to accompany them. 
Q.	Witness HH, the problem is that this wasn't something that I said, this is something that you said.  And it is recorded by the Office of the Prosecutor.  So what we have here is a situation where you have described a meeting that you claim you did not attend in your testimony at this trial, and you described the same meeting in your statement to the Prosecutor, and you claim that you did attend.  Now, what is your explanation for that? 
A.	Counsel, I can see that you are contesting the fact that I took part in that meeting.  That is what I said.  I told you that I went there in order to accompany those people.  And I told you that at the end of the meeting when they were still inside of the meeting room, myself and the group that was with me went into the meeting room and we greeted Mathieu Ngirumpatse as the president of the party.  He asked me to describe to him the situation prevailing in our area, and I told him what you have just said.  So I was accompanying those people.  I did not go to take part in the discussions.  I believe that it is a mistake that was made by the person taking down my statement.  I did not go there to take part in their discussions.  
Q.	Well, Witness HH, it is a little bit hard to believe that the Prosecutor's investigator was making so many mistakes when it is, in fact, you, who on other occasions, notably in your statement of the                      9th of November 2005, have shown that you're capable of making up events, meetings, conversations.  And so I put it to you that this is not a mistake made by the Prosecutor, but this is an example of how when you are fabricating an event, you can't tell the same storey twice.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	Counsel, this is not a fabrication.  I told you that the members of the committee were present at that meeting, and that I had gone there with a view to accompanying them.  So I do not see why you say that it is a fabrication.  I remember only too well that I said that those people were going to take part in the meeting, and that I was accompanying them.  And I said that at the end of the meeting I was able to go into the meeting room, because I wanted to greet those people before going back to Kigali. 
Q.	Well, Witness HH, let's talk about the second time that you went to Murambi.  You've told us that you went to Murambi a second time where Kajuga, Maniragaba, Twahirwa, Ephrem Nkezabera and Georges Rutaganda met with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and that you did not see Nzirorera or Karemera on this occasion.  And I'm reading from the transcript of the 9th of November, at page 27, the draft transcript.  Is that your testimony?  Do I have that right? 
A.	As far as the second occasion is concerned, I believe that you -- your version is clear and correct.  But at one point you said those people only met with Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I believe that I told you that I saw those two people -- those two men outside of the meeting room whilst they were walking around. 
Q.	And by "those two men" you are speaking of -- who are you speaking of? 
A.	I am referring to Nzirorera and Karemera. 
Q.	Now, Witness, when you talked about this meeting to the Prosecutor on the 11th of November 2004, and I'm reading from the top of page 14, you said that, "The second time I went to Murambi with Kajuga and Rutaganda, who submitted the report in the presence of Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, and that Karemera was not in the room but I saw him in the vicinity."  So you have testified that you submitted -- that the report was made only to Ngirumpatse.  And you told the Prosecutor, in 2004, that the report was made in the presence of Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera.  How do you explain the difference in your recollection? 
A.	Counsel, are you talking about the fourth occasion?  I never knew there was a fourth occasion. 
Q.	Well, perhaps, the translation didn't come across, so let me start and do that again.  I'm speaking of the second meeting.  And what you said in your statement of November 11th 2004 was:  "That the second time I went to Murambi with Kajuga and Rutaganda, who submitted the report in the presence of Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera; and that Karemera was not in the room, but I saw him in the vicinity."  So what I'm putting to you is that when you testified about the second meeting, you said the report was made only in the presence of Ngirumpatse.  And when you told the Prosecutor about this meeting in 2004, you put Mr. Nzirorera there.  And I'm asking you how you can explain, if, in fact, there was such a meeting, the difference in these two versions?  
A.	Maybe it is because it happened a long time ago.  You said that on the second occasion Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse were there, and I agree with that.  But with reference to the first occasion, you said that I took part in the debate, and that I was inside of the meeting room.  And I told you that it was only at the end of the meeting that I managed to gain excess to the meeting room.  And I think that that is where we disagree. 
Q.	Well, Witness HH, you and I don't disagree.  You are disagreeing with yourself, because all I have done is repeat what you said on other occasions.  But I think we can move on, and I will ask you about Bisesero.  Now, you have testified to a conversation between you and Seraphin Twahirwa about Bisesero; do you recall that? 
A.	Yes, I do remember. 
Q.	And you told us that on your first conversation with Twahirwa he asked you to find people to send to Bisesero, correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That is what he told me. 
Q.	Was there anyone else present when he told you that? 
A.	When he said that -- well, no, I don't remember.  I cannot remember whether yes or no somebody else was present.  All I know is that I asked him why he was asking me to do that.  He then said that he had had a conversation with Nzirorera.  And I told him that it was very difficult for me to find people to send to Bisesero.  So, I said that I would think about it and that I would give him a reply.  

He then told me that it was no longer necessary because Yusuf Munyakazi had supplied men who had gone to Bisesero, and that those men had managed to keep an eye on the Tutsis that were massacring the Hutus.  There were some guards from Kayove who had gone to Bisesero.  And then the Tutsi had put up a strong resistance.  So he said Yusuf Munyakazi had supplied men who had gone to Bisesero.  And he said that the problem was no longer a current one. 
Q.	And during that second conversation in which Twahirwa told you that it was no longer necessary to send Interahamwe, was anyone else present? 
A.	I do not remember very well.  I do not remember whether anyone else was present. 
Q.	Now, when you were recounting this event to the Prosecutor in November of 2004, you said that these conversations had taken place in late April of 1994; is that correct? 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel Robinson please repeat his question? 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	When you discussed this issue with the Prosecutor in November 2004, you said that this conversation with Twahirwa had occurred in late April of 1994; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct; I provided an approximation.  It was towards the end of April, beginning of May.  And as I did not take down any notes, I merely provided an approximation because I did not know that I was going to be put -- that questions were going to be put to me on the subject of those dates. 
Q.	Now, you have testified at this trial that you saw Nzirorera twice during the period between April through July 1994, and that is at page 18 of the draft transcript of 8th November 2006.  Do you stand by that? 
A.	Do you mean in Kigali or Murambi?  
Q.	Your testimony was that you had seen Mr. Nzirorera a total of two times, anywhere, during the period April through July 1994.  Mr. Webster asked you, "How many times did you see Mr. Nzirorera between April and July 1994?"  And you said, "two"; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, when you put the question to me on a number of occasions is it because you want to make me confused?  I said that he had come to Kigali on two occasions.  And I also saw him in Murambi on two occasions, from 1994 to 1997, that is.  So between 1994 and 1997, I believe that you are just trying to confuse me and set traps for me to fall into. 
Q.	Witness HH, I don't know if you are receiving some incorrect interpretation or whether you're -- I didn't mention anything about 1997.  So, I'm trying to have you understand that the question you were asked was about 1994 -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- (microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is apologising, Counsel.  In fact he was talking about July 1994.
MR. PRESIDENT:

(Court recessed at 1658H)
(Pages 46 to 53 by Donna M. Lewis)















(Court resumed at 1701H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, sorry for the sudden interruption, but you can continue now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Was my cross-examination that bad?  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, I'm going to read to you from the transcript of the 8th of November 2006 on page 18 of the draft transcript.  And you were asked by Mr. Webster on line 13, "Can you --" it says, "If you think back between --" well, it says, "We broke off at the point where you were telling us how you came to know Joseph Nzirorera.  If you can think back to the period 1992 and 1994, can you tell us how you knew him or interacted with him during that --"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you slow down, please, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  I'll start all over. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Mr. Webster asked you the question, "We broke off at the point where you were telling us how you came to know Joseph Nzirorera.  If you can think back to the period between 1992 and 1994, can you tell us how you knew him or interacted with him during that period?"  And your answer was, "Well, apart from the fact that I saw him very often when he came to the MRND party offices and the fact that I saw him when he was still a minister, that is when I would see him.  At rallies also I would see him."  

Mr. Webster asked you, "Can you give us an estimation, an approximation, of how many times you saw him during the period April to July of 1994, if you'll restrict yourself to that period?"  And your answer was, "Were I to estimate the number of times I saw him, I would say twice."  

Now, was that testimony correct or incorrect? 
A.	But, indeed, that is what I was saying a while ago.  When you put questions to me, you ask me the same questions again.  It is just to put some confusion my mind.  

I saw him on two occasions in Gitarama, either in Murambi or when he came to Kigali.  So I am not making up anything.  I only talked about the occasions I remember.  I saw him on two occasions in Murambi, and then I saw him in Kigali on two occasions too, in Kigali when the government was in Gitarama.  I saw him pass through***************************************.  

When I say I saw him on two occasions, it -- it's actually the times when he came to Kigali because I know that I saw him twice in Gitarama and twice in Kigali.  Perhaps I expressed myself poorly in answer to the question which had been asked.  So I saw him twice in Kigali and twice in Gitarama between the months of April and July 1994.  
Q.	Witness HH, you also testified that you saw Mr. Nzirorera on the 11th of April at the Hotel Diplomat on the balcony, did you not? 
A.	Yes, I remember that part of my testimony. 
Q.	And I suggest to you, Witness HH, that the reason why you can't keep your stories straight about how many times you saw Mr. Nzirorera between April and July 1994 is that you didn't see him at all and that the number of times you saw him is, in fact, zero.  
A.	Well, that's your opinion, not mine, and I'm not surprised at what you are saying. 
Q.	Witness HH, when you went into exile, did you take any documents with you pertaining to the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  Some of the exiles had documents with them, just as others did not have. 
Q.	What kind of documents did you have with you? 
A.	I would say that I had with me personal documents, documents concerning the number of Interahamwe in the secteur.  The number of Interahamwe was known.  There were also reports and copies of reports which I had made.  There were also documents concerning the problems which were encountered by the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And did you ever have in your possession a register which listed the names of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Concerning such a register, whether it was the time when I was still *****************or the time when I was********************, that register was always at********************************************************.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness is correcting as follows:  "It's not********************************************************** ***********************." 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did you have that register with you when you were in exile? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	Do you still have any of those documents today? 
A.	No, I no longer have that document -- or, those documents with me.  The documents have disappeared.  They were being kept by my family members, and given that my family members have also disappeared, well, they were the ones keeping the documents. 
Q.	What papers have you brought with you to Arusha? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  That question is -- is a little broad, Your Honours.  I mean, the -- if Mr. Robinson's enquiry if he -- is if he has documentation of his court case and things of that nature, that's a legitimate question.  But then to ask him to give a listing of his private possessions I don't think is -- is quite fair. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think I agree with the Prosecutor.  The question is too -- too broad. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Have you brought with you any papers concerning the events of 1994, such as your statements and your documents relating to your own case in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I have a number of documents, some of them linked to my court matter, and others connected with statements I've given officials of the Tribunal.  Regarding the documents you just mentioned, I just told you a while ago that I have lost those documents because they were being kept by my family members.  And, as I have told you, I have lost sight of my family members.  
Q.	Yes, I understand that.  So, focussing on the documents that you have with you in Arusha, do you have a copy of your statement that you gave to the Prosecutor in November 2004? 
A.	Yes.  I closely follow the statements I gave to officials of the Tribunal. 
Q.	And who gave you that copy? 
A.	When I'm interviewed when I give a statement, I have to closely follow and also keep certain documents so that I will be able to know what my subsequent conduct would be. 
Q.	And so who gave you a copy of your statement of November 2004? 
A.	I will give you an example:  If I testify in this court today, I can go and sit down and try to note certain points which are of interest to me regarding all what was said today. 
Q.	Who gave you a copy of your statement to the Office of the Prosecutor in November 2004? 
A.	But, Counsel, I just told you that, when I make a statement, I try to reconstitute everything and keep notes, and that would be similar to the statement I have given. 
Q.	So do you have a copy of your statement or just a copy of your own notes? 
A.	I closely follow.  Whenever I say something, I take notes down because I know that most of the time questions are put to me regarding my statements. 
Q.	Do you have a copy of the statement that you signed in November 2004? 
A.	I have told you that I tried to reconstitute what was said.  So if, for instance, I go home after testifying in this court, I will note down the salient points. 
Q.	But do you have a copy of the statement that you signed to the Office of the Prosecutor in November 2004?  I think you can answer that with a "yes" or a "no."  
A.	No, sir, not a signed copy.  There are notes which I personally took down regarding what I said.  
Q.	Do you have a signed copy of any statement you've made to the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	No, I don't have such copies.  But if, for instance, I give a statement and then subsequently I try to note down the salient points, I don't consider it as a statement.  I, rather, look at it as my own notes.  
Q.	Yes, I agree with you on that.  

And why did you bring those notes to Arusha? 
A.	Counsel, that's my personal secret.  I am in prison, and when I leave the prison grounds to come to Arusha, there is no one to whom I can leave the documents.  There's nothing strange about that, so I move about with the documents. 
Q.	Have you reviewed those notes since arriving in Arusha? 
A.	That is possible, Counsel.  In fact, I would say that it may be possible or impossible.  
Q.	Well, everything is either possible or impossible.  Can you be a little more specific? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to know whether it would be a problem if I had looked through those notes again or if I had not looked through the notes again.  I move about with those documents, and I am entitled to consult them.  If I decided to come with those documents, it's because I did not want to lose them.  
Q.	Witness, there's nothing wrong with your consulting documents, but we have a right to know what documents you've consulted.  So I'm asking you whether or not you've consulted the notes that you took after giving the statements to the Prosecution since you've been in Arusha.  
A.	Counsel, I think it is my most absolute right to move about with my documents.  I have them with me, but I have not yet had the time or the opportunity to consult them.  At the end of my testimony, I may go through those notes and then take down other notes. 
Q.	So just so we're clear, it's your testimony under oath that since arriving in Arusha you have not consulted the notes of any of your prior statements to the Prosecution, correct? 
A.	From what I can see, Counsel, you are adding things now.  What I've told you is that I move about with my confidential documents.  That is the reason why I decided not to leave them back in Rwanda.  I opted to bring them along with me.  Now, I know that, if I tell you I have gone through those documents again, you will want me to tell you of the content of the document, whereas I know that there are many things in those documents. 
Q.	Witness, since you're here to speak the truth, you're simply to answer a question with a simple "yes" or "no" answer, not to calculate your own interest in the matter, which you seem to do frequently.  

So the question is, simply, whether or not you have reviewed any of the notes of your statements since you've been in Arusha, "yes" or "no."  And you're under oath.  
A.	Regarding the documents in question, I can see that you are very inquisitive.  When I came here, I realised that you had some documents.  You showed the documents to me, but I did not know where you had got the documents from.  

Regarding the documents in my possession, I have been able to consult some of them, but what I am telling you is that I have lots of documents.  Now, as to you suggesting to me that I answer with an umbrella "yes" or an umbrella "no," I know very well that it is not the most appropriate way to answer a question simply with a "yes" or a "no."  That is the procedure which you should suggest to pupils of first-year primary school.  When a question is put, it is better to explain things and give specifics regarding the particular document.  I can tell you, for instance, yes, I have this document, and I will tell you the circumstances under which I was able to obtain such a document. 
Q.	Okay.  So why don't you tell us the documents which you have reviewed here in Arusha.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what's the relevance of that now?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have -- we have heard his answer.  He has reviewed some of the documents. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  May I ask that he take the headphones off in order to give you the answer to that question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Please take the headphones off.  Mr. Witness, please take the headphones off. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, if he has been reviewing substantive documents concerning the events that he's testified about here in Arusha, that affects his credibility; his memory is being enhanced by other things.  And we're entitled to disclosure of those documents which he has reviewed in preparation for his testimony.  Documents reviewed by a witness in preparation for their testimony are disclosable.  And the next step would be, if I can establish that he has reviewed documents that are pertinent to his testimony, is to ask you to order him to produce them.  So that's the relevance. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, first of all, he said these were his notes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  And if he's relying on notes to refresh his memory in preparation for his testimony, we're entitled to those notes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Notes he himself prepared about his testimony?  Are you entitled to his own private notes? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  If he's used them to refresh his memory to prepare his testimony, absolutely.  Isn't -- isn't that common practice in every jurisdiction, that a -- a witness who's used material to refresh their recollection or prepare their testimony has to produce that material? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Unintelligible)...if he uses it in court, that's a different issue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
No.  I would suggest, Mr. President, if someone is back in their room reading their notes or reading anything and then they're using that to prepare for their testimony, the parties and the Trial Chamber are entitled to see and know what it was that was used to make that kind of preparation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not aware of that rule.  It is not consistent with the -- as I understand it, the -- a witness will not be allowed to refresh his memory in court without disclosure and some control on what he uses to refresh his memory in court.  But I'm not aware of a control of what he reads when he's not in the witness box. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So if a witness has prepared some kind of document and uses that in the evenings to refer to, it's -- it's your understanding that that is not disclosable?  It's only if he brought it to court with him that it is?  Maybe that's my -- maybe it's my national practice that I'm betraying knowledge of only, but I'm not aware of that distinction.  But perhaps I'm mistaken.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think in that regard it must be a California practice because I practiced in New York and I've never heard an application quite like this one.  But I would suggest that there's nothing in our rules that require disclosure of a witness's own memoranda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have ruled that is not disclosable. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President.  So I think maybe this would be a good time to take our recess, and I'm almost finished, but not quite.  So... 
MR. WEBSTER:
Dare I ask the question, how long tomorrow for a best-case scenario, just for planning purposes? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I just have three documents to go through, so I'm thinking one hour.  But I can't be positive.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Okay.  We take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, it is (unintelligible) that this may be your last day in the witness box.  We take the adjournment now -- 

Tomorrow -- I said "this."  Sorry.  But I meant -- yeah, okay, tomorrow.  

We're taking the adjournment now, and you will return tomorrow morning for the last stage of your -- your testimony.  I remind you, as I have done before -- as I've done before, that you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this or any other adjournment.
(Court adjourned at 1734H)
