MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Could we have the representation of the parties, starting with the Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution team is composed of 
Mr. Paul Ng'arua, the senior trial attorney, who will be in shortly; myself, Memory Maposa, 
appeals counsel; Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; 
Ephrem Mutashya, language assistant; and our two interns, Jamen, Marion, and Igor Barilik.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence team?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Good morning, Madam President.  The Defence this morning is composed of Mr. Célestin Kakango 
and Justin Habineza, investigators; Mr. Erik Sullivan, intern; myself, co-counsel, Philippe Larochelle and, of course, Mr. Nzabonimana himself.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you made a solemn declaration at the beginning of your testimony.  You will continue with 
your testimony today on that same declaration.  And keep in mind everything we said at the beginning of your testimony.  
THE WITNESS:
I recall the instructions that you issued to me.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel, we are in open session.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, I think it would be preferable to revert to the closed session.  The first -- the very first question I will ask the witness concerns his brother.  And I think in view of that, it will be advisable that we move into a closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Members of the public, we regret you have to leave at this moment for the reasons given by learned counsel for the Defence.  

Registry, could you please facilitate a closed session for these proceedings.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 69] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
