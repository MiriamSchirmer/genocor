P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Madam Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. KOUO: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 7th of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Today might be the final day of your testimony.  I remind you that you remain under oath to tell the truth as you swore when you started your testimony.  And Mr. Robinson will continue his cross-examination now. 

I'm sorry, Mr. Weyl, did you wish to say something?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, briefly, I just wanted to intervene to thank the registrar for giving us the minutes of the hearings.  I just wanted to indicate that we are listening to the eighth witness is what has been said so far, that we have been hearing the eighth witness, but, in fact, we are hearing the ninth witness now, because I believe that the eighth witness was AWB, and I would like for that to be amended, please, within the transcript and the minutes of the hearings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sure the registrar has noted your remarks. 

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  

MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning to you and the members of the Trial Chamber. 
WITNESS ALG,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, mwaramutse.  Amakuru ki?  
A.	Yes, good morning, Counsel, and I am well.  Thank you.  
Q.	Did you manage to undertake your task yesterday?  
A.	Yes, I did, indeed.  I tried to do my homework, Counsel. 
Q.	(Kinyarwanda spoken)
A.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That will wake up the interpreting booth this morning. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, we're going to go back for a minute to the testimony you gave about the Hutu 
	ten commandments, because I think we can correct something you said in error.  Now, you testified on the 1st of November that the Hutu ten commandments were published when Mr. Ngirumpatse was minister of justice, and I want to ask you if you can remember the period in which Mr. Ngirumpatse was minister of justice. 
A.	He was minister of justice towards the end of 1991, between the end of 1991 until the 
	16th of April 1992.  
Q.	That's correct, thank you.  And that was during the first.  During the -- the government which was headed by Sylvestre Nsanzimana; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, it's true, is it not, that the Hutu ten commandments were published in Kangura in the issue of December 1990, fully one year before Mr. Ngirumpatse became minister of justice? 
A.	I don't really remember very well, but I thought that he was minister at the time at which that paper was published.  I thought it had been published in December 1991.  In fact, I don't really remember very well.  It is difficult to remember dates, especially when you are taken unawares and questions are put to you on the subject of dates.  But when those ten commandments were published, the editor of Kangura was not published (sic), despite the fact that his newspaper published words that incited ethnic division.  That's all I can say on the subject. 
Q.	I'm going to read to you a small sentence from the book of Alison Des Forges called 
	Leave None to Tell the Story.  And in this book on page 118 she says that "In the December 1990 issue where Kangura presented the ten commandments of the Hutu, it also printed a picture of Mitterrand on the back cover."  So at least according to Alison Des Forges, Kangura was -- published the Hutu 
	ten commandments in December 1990.  And assuming that were true, would you agree that Mr. Ngirumpatse was not the minister of justice at that time? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Before we have an answer to that question, is it the Defence's contention that the ten Hutu commandments were published only one time and that time is the time that is mentioned the 
Alison Des Forges book?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, that's my understanding, unless there -- I could be -- I don't claim to have exhaustive knowledge, but that's the only time to my knowledge it was published in Kangura.  But if that's -- I'm wrong about that, I can be corrected.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But my question is, assuming that in December -- the ten commandments were published in 
	December 1990, you would agree, would you not, that Mr. Ngirumpatse was not the minister of justice at that time? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you.  I told you precisely the period during which he occupied that post, and I believe that we understand each other on that date.  I would like to say that I remember that when those 
	ten commandments were published for the first time in the year 1990, Ngeze continued to publish those commandments, even at a later date, and even on the cover page of the newspaper.  There were words saying that Kangura was a means to wake up the majority of the people.  And even if that wording did contain a type of ethnic dividing, I would say that the Rwandan authorities did nothing to stop that paper from being published, even though it was following a bad line or thought.  And even in the Rwandan constitution, it is stated that any person causing ethnic division is or could be subject to punishment, so Ngirumpatse did nothing to publish (sic) the person who published those 
	ten commandments.  It is true that that publisher did publish a number of things that encouraged divisionist tendencies, but those ten commandments are just but one example. 
Q.	Well, let's look at some events that did occur when Mathieu Ngirumpatse was minister of justice.  And I'd ask that you be shown a document which has distributed this morning and which I believe was given to you last night as part of your homework.  And this is a letter from the prosecutor in Kigali, 
	François Xavier Nsanzuwera.  That's N-S-A-W-E-U-R-A (sic). 

Now, Witness ALG, looking on the second page of this letter under heading number B where they're specifically speaking of Hassan Ngeze, you would agree, would you not, that this is a letter which indicates that Hassan Ngeze had been arrested in March of 1992 on the crime of incitement to ethnic hatred, and that in this letter the prosecutor, who was working under the minister of justice, was protesting the decision of the court to provide -- to give provisional release to Mr. Ngeze and was urging that he remain in jail?  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, you are mentioning the problem, and in fact, that problem is outlined in the document that you gave to me last night.  Ngeze had been provisionally released on allegations of ethnic division, but I would like to say something about Mr. Nsanzuwera, François Xavier.  He was a prosecutor who accomplished his tasks admirably, and he tried to arrest criminals, but the political parties did everything to get in his way.  Criminals were arrested, indeed, but the leaders of political parties that were powerful at the time then had those criminals released.  So I believe that it is in such a context that this letter was drafted.  And I read in the letter yesterday that the vice-president of the CDR, Mr. Nahimana, went to the prison and wanted to have Ngeze forcibly released, and he was indeed released. 

I do not know whether it was the ministry of justice who had Ngeze released, but there were external forces that obliged the senior judicial authorities to have those criminals released.  Ngeze made many other mistakes, but nobody ever reproached him for that.  And even when he was released, he carried on publishing his divisionist paper, but nobody arrested him again and put him back behind bars.  Why was he not arrested again in view of the fact that he never stopped uttering divisionist words?
Q.	Witness ALG, let's just take this one step at a time.  First of all, would you agree that Hassan Ngeze was arrested for inciting ethnic hatred during the time that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was minister of justice? 
A.	I do not deny the fact -- I do not deny the fact that Hassan Ngeze was in custody for a short period, but what I am saying is that when he was released, he carried on publishing that divisionist newspaper, and nobody did anything to stop that paper from being published.  Nowhere can we see that he was arrested because he published the ten commandments of the Hutus. 
Q.	Witness ALG, I think that you need to calm down a little bit and just answer my questions, because you're just flowing with information like some prosecutor, and I'm reminding you, you're just a witness here, okay?  You don't need to make the Prosecution's case every time you're being asked a question.  It doesn't reflect well on your credibility.  So, what I asked you -- I simply asked you is whether or not it's true that Hassan Ngeze was arrested when Mathieu Ngirumpatse was minister of justice, and you answered yes, and that was enough. 

Now, my next question is, when -- you have something you want to say?  
A.	Yes, thank you, Counsel.  But sometimes when you ask me to say yes or no, you seem to require me to provide you with further explanations.  I must say that I am calm, and I am giving you correct answers, and the situation was as I am describing it to you.  I said that yes, he was arrested and placed in custody, but then when he was released, he carried on publishing words that incited ethnic hatred.  So you must understand that it's very difficult for me to answer you with a yes or no, because I need to describe the situation as it was at that time. 
Q.	Witness, my next question to you -- we have now established that Mr. Ngeze was arrested when Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the minister of justice, and my next question to you is whether or not the provisional release was the result of an order by the president of the tribunal, and I think you'll find that in the very first paragraph of the letter.  Doesn't the very first paragraph of the letter at the very beginning, doesn't it say, "After having received the order of the president of the tribunal, dated 
	17 March 1992, granting provisional release to Ngeze, Hassan" -- and then it goes on to say, "I am appealing against that order"?  Isn't that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is what is said in this letter. 
Q.	So while Mathieu was minister of justice, Hassan Ngeze was arrested.  His provisional release was ordered by the tribunal, and the ministry of justice, in the person of Mr. Nsanzuwera, was appealing against that release, they wanted keep Hassan Ngeze in prison.  Correct? 
A.	Counsel, I do not deny that fact, but the problem is as I already explained. 
Q.	And among the arguments that were being made by the ministry of justice to keep Mr. Ngeze in prison is that there were ethnic tensions in Bugesera at the time, and they felt that since Hassan Ngeze was persistently insisting on ethnicities and claiming that nothing good could come from the Kangura -- I mean, from the Tutsi ethnic group, that his release might increase the ethnic tensions that were existing in Bugesera.  Isn't that correct?  

And I think you could -- you could actually find that on page 2.  It's the fourth paragraph underneath section B "Hassan Ngeze".  And I could just read that to you if it helps you.  It says, "On the charge of ethnic discrimination, incitement to ethnic hatred, the prosecution cannot understand how the release of Ngeze could be considered harmless, while there are ethnic tensions in Bugesera and in other corners of the country, even though the authorities have successfully stopped them."  So wasn't that the argument of the ministry of justice?  
A.	Counsel, I would concede that fact.  That is how things occurred, as you just said.  This letter was drafted after the disturbances in Bugesera.  I talked about the problems associated with the Hutu 
	ten commandments, and if he was arrested and placed in custody because of the disturbances in Bugesera during that period, then why was he not re-arrested at a later date when he continued to publish inflammatory language?  Why did they not stop his newspaper from being published?  That is the problem, and that is why I still persist in putting that question to you.  Why was he not arrested and put in prison when the Hutu ten commandments were published?  Nowhere is it written that he was arrested and placed in custody because of the inflammatory nature of his publication.  I would suggest that he was put in prison after the Bugesera disturbances, indeed, but he carried on publishing inflammatory language, and he wasn't published -- punished for that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the letter of the 18th of March 1992 from Mr. Nsanzuwera be marked for identification at ID. NZ50. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ50 marked for identification) 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, continuing with the story of Mr. Ngeze's arrest and release in March of 1992, I would like you to be shown document number 31 in the packet of exhibits that was submitted yesterday, and I believe also you had an opportunity to read this letter last night, which was from the director of the Kigali prison to the préfet of Kigali, dated the 19th of March 1992. 

Now, Witness ALG, it's true, is it not, that what this is is a letter from the director of the prison to the préfet, correct?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And the director of the prison is under the minister of justice, correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And this was at a time when the minister of justice was Mathieu Ngirumpatse, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And in this letter the director of the Kigali prison is complaining that the vice-president and president -- well, the vice-president of the CDR, Théoneste Nahimana, and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza -- that's B-A-R-A-Y-A-G-W-I-Z-A -- had gone to the prison and tried to obtain the provisional release of Mr. Ngeze, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what we can read in this letter. 
Q.	And so the director of the Kigali prison, who was under Mathieu Ngirumpatse in the ministry of justice, was complaining about the interference by leaders of the CDR party in this process, correct? 
A.	It was not only the leaders of the CDR party that were putting pressure on them.  All the leaders of political parties would put pressure on the system when their members were imprisoned.  This is just an example that is being given, that is, the CDR party, but other political parties did likewise.  And I would even say, Counsel, that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had one of his members released who had committed a serious crime, a murder, in the year 1993.  So the members of the CDR party are not the only ones to put pressure of this type upon the system.  Other political parties did likewise.  

If you would like, I could give you another example, Counsel.  I would give you the example of the person who Ngirumpatse had released, because I remember that very well in the year 1993.  There was a conseiller by the name of Karushara, Rouge.  
Q.	Witness ALG, you're causing a disturbance here by attempting to inject information that goes way beyond the question, and what will result from that is what happened yesterday when we spent 
	45 minutes when you were simply asked to spell a name.  So I'm going to stop you here so that we can try to finish your testimony today. 

And my question was simply whether this letter indicated that the director of the Kigali prison, an employee of the ministry of justice under Mathieu Ngirumpatse, was objecting to the intervention by the CDR for the release of Hassan Ngeze.  And you said that that was correct, and that's all that's necessary.  We're not having a debate here where you need to bring up other issues.  I asked you a question, you answered it, it's enough, okay?  
A.	Yes, we can read in this letter that the governor of the prison said that the leaders of that party wanted to have Ngeze released. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I would ask that this letter dated the 19th of March 1992 be marked for identification as ID.  NZ51.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ51 marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness ALG, it's true, is it not, that as of the 18th of April 1992, one month after this event, the ministry of justice was given to the PL party, and the minister of justice was Stanislas Mbonampeka thereafter; isn't that correct? 
A.	His name was Stanislas Mbonampeka, M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-N-K-A -- P-E-K-A at the end, unfortunately, yes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A, repeats the interpreter.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you.  And he was of which political party? 
A.	He was from the PL party. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now we're going to go back to another thing that we discussed yesterday, involving killings on the 7th of April of people in Remera, Hutus.  And I have here a book I would like to show you to see if it might refresh your memory, since you seem to know nothing of any killings of the -- by the RPF.  And this is a book by Filip Reyntjens called Rwanda: Three Days That Changed History, and I've highlighted a passage and a footnote on page 62.  So I'm going to ask the registry to show this to the Judges, the Prosecutor, and then to have you read what I've highlighted to see if that refreshes your memory concerning those events.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm a bit concerned about how we're proceeding here.  I don't recall the witness saying that he knew something that he no longer remembers and that something would refresh his recollection.  I think that's the basis of proceeding in this manner.  I don't know how to address this, quite frankly, because the way we've been proceeding with documents and in the cross-examination is not what I'm used -- I'm not very familiar with this manner of proceeding in cross-examination, so I simply rely on the Court's discretion, but this doesn't seem an appropriate approach to me.  If the issue is refreshing a recollection, I think there's inadequate foundation to proceed along those lines, but I'll rely on the Court's discretion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we'll permit the question -- permit the witness to look at the passage and to respond to the question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, having now read the passage in the book by Mr. Reyntjens concerning the killings by the RPF on the 7th of April and thereafter in Remera in which he lists the names of Hutu intellectuals and their families who were killed in Remera, does that refresh your recollection as to whether or not, in fact, there were killings by the RPF in Remera as we discussed yesterday? 
A.	Counsel, from what I can see, it's a book, which book is a mere reflection of the opinion of the writer.  You say people were killed at Remera.  I did not witness the killings.  I was at Kacyiru, spelled K-A-C-Y-I-R-U, so I was in Nyarugenge commune, N-Y-A-R-U-G-E-N-G-E.  So I did not live in 
	Remera secteur, and there is nothing which would make one think that I must have been aware by all means of what was going on in Remera. 
Q.	Well, it's interesting that you say that, Witness ALG, since you were also not at the home of 
	Agathe Uwilingiyimana when she was killed on the 7th or of Joseph Kavaruganda when he was killed on the 7th.  You were not at the Hôtel Diplomates on the 10th or 11th when there were meetings between the MRND and the Interahamwe leaders, and you were not at many locations about which you've given testimony that has helped the Prosecution in this case.  And so the mere fact that you weren't present at these killings doesn't answer our question, whether or not you were ever aware that the RPF had killed these people in Remera around the 7th of April.  So were you aware of that fact before you came to court today?  
A.	Counsel, you just referred to the prime minister's death.  She lived in Nyarugenge commune.  I know she was killed on the 7th, but you also need to know that she lived in Nyarugenge commune, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  So I tried to get information from people who lived in that commune regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of people.  That is how I became aware of the president -- of the prime minister's death, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover).

Now, about you putting to me information regarding what happened in Remera, and when I see you are surprised that I was not aware of what happened there, there is no reason for you to be surprised, because I was not there.  It all depended on the circumstances. 
Q.	You see that one of the people who's listed as having been -- having his family killed in Remera was a sous-préfet of Kigali; isn't that correct? 
A.	Which person are you referring to, Counsel?  Kindly give me the name of the person.  Oh, very well.  I can see, Counsel, that you are referring to Sekagina, spelled S-E-K-A-G-I-N-A.  He was in Kigali-rural préfecture.  He was not in Kigali-ville préfecture.  He was a sous-préfet in Kigali-rural préfecture. 
Q.	And for all of this time, from 1994 all the way through the time you came to this courtroom, all these people were missing, the sous-préfet of Kigali-rural, the préfet of Ruhengeri, many other people were unaccounted for during this period, and you never got any information about what had happened to them? 
A.	Counsel, I did not even know those people, particularly.  Now, if any of those people had perhaps been a personal friend of mine, then perhaps I would have sought to know what was the fate of the person.  So I did not seek information regarding those people.  I know there were certain things about which I tried to get information, but regarding those people, they were not personal friends of mine.  None of them was a sibling of mine, so there was no reason for me to try to know what had happened to them. 
Q.	Did you know any of those people that's listed in that footnote in Professor Reyntjens' book?  
A.	Of those people, I know Théoneste Mujyanama, who had been justice minister; yes, I know him.  I also know Mr. Emmanuel Bahigiki, who was a university lecturer, Faustin Sekagina, who was a sous-préfet in Kigali-rural préfecture, but I don't know the sous-préfecture which he headed.  I did not know the others. 
Q.	And you never had any idea what had happened to any of those people before you came to court in this case this week? 
A.	Counsel, I knew nothing about those people.  I thought they were still alive.  I did not know that they were already dead. 
Q.	You see, Witness ALG, I have a real problem with that testimony because even when I go to Rwanda, I speak with peasants and they know this information:  The RPF was killing people in Remera in the early part of the war in 1994.  So I put it to you, Witness ALG, that what you're doing here, given the fact that you've been a prison of the RPF government in Rwanda and given the fact that you owe your freedom on provisional release to the RPF government in Rwanda and given the fact that you're about to go back and be tried by the RPF government in Rwanda, is that you simply refuse to give any information in this trial which would reflect poorly on the RPF.  Isn't that true?  
A.	Counsel, I have a different opinion.  You seek information and you want me to answer along the lines you want.  I'm here to say the truth, so I cannot dare talk about things I did not witness.  Well, contrary to your opinion, it is not my intention to please RPF officials.  
Q.	I find it interesting to say that you can't talk about those things that you did not witness, given the testimony that you gave during the Prosecution's direct examination about many events which you did not witness.  

But in any event, let's move on to have a look at the civil defence instructions, which are 
Exhibit D. NZ183, and if those could be placed before you.  And this is the document that was originally in tab 13 of the Prosecution's exhibits. 
Have you had a chance in the evening to review this document?  
A.	Regarding the prime ministerial instructions on civil defence, well, what I can notice is that the document shown me just now is not legible.  Regarding the instructions of the ministry of interior and communal development about civil defence, that is the letter which the minister sent to the préfets.  I have read it, because it is legible.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think the witness has the wrong document in front of him.  I wonder if the registry could make sure that he's looking at Exhibit D. NZ183, which is a letter dated the 27th of April 1994 from Prime Minister Jean Kambanda entitled:  "Instructions to restore security in the country." 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Can I have a look at what the witness is actually seeing, because there may be a bit of confusion?  There are actually four texts to that exhibit.  I'm not sure if Mr. Issa had all four of them.  The first, which is the original, is a handwritten document, which is very difficult to read.  I don't know if he was given that initially, that's the handwritten document in -- in Kinyarwanda, I believe, and then there was a typed text, and then there was the French and the English translation.  So I do recall that one of the documents was very difficult to read, but there is a very clear typewritten text also.  There's a text that was actually signed by the prime minister which was difficult to read, but what I've seen there seems pretty legible to me.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, in this letter from the prime minister on the 27th of April 1994, of which the subject was "instructions to restore security in the country," on page 2 he sets out several tasks that he's asking the préfet to undertake; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, I am able to read the version just shown to me, because the one I had yesterday was not legible.  So kindly give me a few moments to peruse the document.  
Q.	Very well.  Thank you. 

Witness ALG, turning to page 2 of this letter, is it true that on behalf of the government of Rwanda, the prime minister gave instructions to be followed by all levels in charge of security and by the whole population, and that instruction number one was that the -- in the préfectures, the authorities were requested to organise security meetings in which concrete measures should be taken to deal with the security problems in those préfectures.  Is that correct?  
A.	Yeah, that is what we have in this letter. 
Q.	And the second instruction was that the authorities were to ask -- or call on the assistance of representatives of the political parties, the religious denominations, and the representatives of the central administration of the country and the national army in order to help reinforce security, correct? 
A.	Correct, sir. 
Q.	And under the third point, Prime Minister Kambanda wrote that "The enemy who attacked Rwanda is well known.  It is the RPF Inkotanyi.  You are, therefore, requested to explain to the people that they must avoid anything that would bring about violence among them on the pretext of ethnic groups, regions, denominations, political parties, hatred, et cetera, because violence within the population constitutes a breach for the enemy.  Nevertheless, the population must remain watchful in order to unmask the enemy and his accomplices and hand them over to the authorities and to get the national army to assist them where the authorities are incapable of doing that." 

Was that the instruction of the prime minister?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is what we have in this letter.  But when we start saying "but", it poses a problem to me and it was a problem when you say, "but you need to remind members of the population to be constantly vigilant so as to spot the enemy and its accomplices."  And when it was difficult for members of the population to do so, then they had to seek the assistance of the army.  

Counsel, if you allow me, I would like to make the following comment:  As you can see, this letter is dated 27th of April 1994.  Everybody is aware that the genocide started on the 7th of April.  Hostilities resumed on the 7th of April 1994, so this letter was written 20 days afterwards.  And during that period, those who were killing and massacring civilians claimed that they were killing the Inkotanyi and their accomplices.  So the definition of the act of the enemy is not provided, and you can see what the risk is, because people under the guise of hunting down the enemy and the accomplices were actually killing innocent people.  

It is stated in this letter that people arrested had to be handed over to the authorities.  I know that no one was handed over to the authorities.  Those arrested were simply killed.  The army had to ensure the security of members of the public, but during that period, it was that same army which was massacring people.  So, as I have constantly explained, this is mere rhetoric.  Nothing was done to stop the massacres.  

Reference is made to the justice system here.  If you refer to point 2, reference is made to political party officials, officials of religious denominations and members of the army.  Let me start with political officials.  I would like to tell you that the power wings of certain parties -- or the non-power wings of certain parties were in hiding at that time because they too were killed. 
Q.	Okay, Witness ALG, I'm going to stop you here because you're just going to create a situation where you'll be here all week.  You're just here to answer the question, not as some expert witness to comment on documents and not as some prosecutor to give a closing argument for the Prosecution.  You're really misunderstanding your role here -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry -- 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	-- and you're well beyond the question.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, we've gotten to this point several times before, and I'm asking the Court to take over the role that Mr. Robinson seems to be appropriating to himself.  The witness's response -- the answer was responsive to the question.  If we're going to look at a document that has such historical significance as this letter of the 27th of April, the witness should have an opportunity to explain himself fully.  So it's inappropriate for Mr. Robinson to -- to engage in the type of discourse that's now going on.  I respect his right to conduct his cross-examination, he can attempt to control the witness, but the witness's answers are responsive, and Mr. Robinson's directions to him are inappropriate at this stage.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I think this will give you a good opportunity to make a ruling on whether that answer is response -- and the length of that answer is responsive.  If you believe it is, then I'll ask more responsive follow-up questions, and we will have a trial here that will be infinite in its duration, so I think you have to exercise some control. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, those sort of remarks, which could slightly be interpreted as a little bit of a threat, a suggestion of indefinite duration, is unnecessary.  And this is your witness; you have to control the witness.  You are entitled to stop him.  Maybe it's not necessary to make the kind of speeches that you did.  After all, we are a panel of professional Judges.  We are going to be assessing the testimony, are trained to assess the witness's reliability, credibility.  We are interested in him, what he says, (unintelligible) understand what the evidence is all about, but you're conducting the cross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So I take it, then, that Mr. Webster's objection that I interrupted the witness is overruled, and I can do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course you're entitled to interrupt the witness, but I thought Mr. Webster was commenting on the engagement of an argument with witness, which I think was unnecessary.  If you told the witness, "Well, you've answered my question," that would be sufficient.  If there are matters that are required to be cleared up, Mr. Webster can do so in re-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Exactly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Or the Court itself may ask another question.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Well, the problem is, Your Honour, that when I place a document in front of the witness and ask him to -- if something appears in the text, it's not helpful, I don't think, to anyone that he go on for 
ten minutes about his own opinion about the situation in the country at the time and why things -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not something that we want to intervene at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I'll intervene, but I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you ask a question, the witness tries to answer it.  And if you wish to interrupt, and then we'll control it if necessary.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe we could ask the witness to spell the word Abatabazi, because I'm not sure I know how to spell it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think that's a good thing for you to do in re-examination.  

So I'm going to control the direct -- the cross-examination, unless you stop me, Your Honour.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, it's true, is it not, that among the instructions of Prime Minister Kambanda -- it's true, is it not, that among the instructions of Prime Minister Kambanda on the 27th of April 1993, under number 3, was that "The authorities were requested, with the assistance of the army, when possible, to identify places where officially recognised roadblocks should be set up and to set up a system in which rounds would continue to be done in order to prevent the enemy from infiltrating and that those who were on the roadblocks and those who were doing those rounds shall not commit acts of violence against innocent population."  My question to you is simply, does that language appear in the letter under number 3?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And under -- 
A.	It is that you stopped me from going into detail.  Yes, I just wanted to say that yes, that can be found there. 
Q.	Thank you.  And I don't want you to go into detail, so we are on the same wavelength.  

Now, with respect to number 4, is it not true that Prime Minister Kambanda indicated that all acts of violence, looting, and all criminal acts have to stop immediately, and that is why the national army, the public prosecution, and other judicial authorities have to punish severely any person who will be found guilty of those acts?  Now, my question to you is whether that appears in the text of this letter. 
A.	Yes, that does appear in this letter.  
Q.	And under number 7, does Prime Minister Kambanda also call upon the préfets to make sure that humanitarian organisations can work in order to fulfill their task of assisting people in distress?  And my question is whether that appears in the text.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- 
THE WITNESS:
It does indeed appear in the letter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You've gone now to other extreme. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm going to ask some -- I'm going to ask some follow-up questions about this.  I'm just trying to take this step by step, but I'm not simply asking him to repeat something that's already in evidence.  I'm almost to the end of this.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In paragraph 8, it's indicated that "As soon as security of people and goods come back in your commune and préfecture, you have to see urgently how people would go back to work, markets take place as usual, factories resume their activities, and farmers do their daily works in order to fight against the plague of famine we are heading for."  Does that appear in the text under number 8?  
A.	I would like for something to be amended somewhat here.  I am under the impression that the security of possessions and people will be restored, whereas it appears in the letter that the security of possessions and people will be restored bit by bit. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, in number 8 I see that in the English version the word "work" is used, and looking at the Kinyarwanda version, I see the word appears as "gukora", that's G-U-K-O-R-A.  And that was also the same word that was used by President Sindikubwabo on the 19th of April in his speech in Butare.  So I would like you to tell us from the text of number 8 in this letter whether you interpret that to it mean that Prime Minister Kambanda was suggesting that people go back to killing and that farmers do their daily killing.  Was that what was being suggested by Prime Minister Kambanda when he used the word "gukora"? 
A.	In view of the context during that period, we can see that he is saying that people should go about their ordinary business. 
Q.	Now, in fact, if the instructions in this letter had been carried out, will you agree that the killings would have stopped if these instructions could have been carried out? 
A.	Counsel, you have just said that those instructions were carried out.  That is not true, but I am happy, however, that you did use the conditional tense, and you said that if those instructions had been carried out, as you just said, those instructions were never put into practice. 
Q.	Well, they were -- they were attempted to be put in practice, because you've told us that in 
	Kigali préfecture the préfet called a meeting, he set up security organs, crisis committees, they trained people for civil defence.  So there were efforts to carry out these instructions, but they were unsuccessful; is that correct? 
A.	There were reasons why it did not work in practice.  People did try, but there were other factors that meant that those people were not successful.  I am glad that you've brought this point up, and I see that these instructions are very clearly drafted, but the problem is that the author of these very same instructions might not himself have respected them.  It might be possible or easy to draft instructions and then not take the appropriate measures for those instructions to be implemented.  

Well, you've asked me not to provide you with lengthy explanations, so I shall stop here. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  I want to turn to the time that you claim to have seen Mr. Nzirorera.  
A.	Yes, I did indeed see him, Counsel. 
Q.	And you've told us in your direct examination that you believe that that was on the 28th of April 1994; is that correct? 
A.	I said that I was not sure of the precise date.  I said that it was before -- towards the end of the month of April.  I might be wrong about the precise date. 
Q.	Well, what was it about the 28th of April that caused you to give us that date? 
A.	That was the date that I remembered. 
Q.	Now, you also remember that on the 30th of April you attended a meeting in which (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) was replaced, and you know that that took place on the 30th of April, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And so is it your recollection that the meeting at which you claim to have seen Mr. Nzirorera took place a few days before that? 
A.	Yes, the -- there was a change of counsellor a few days after that -- a few days after the meeting. 
Q.	Now, you've also testified that you didn't stay for this entire meeting and that you had to go and tend to some incident that had occurred concerning the evacuation of refugees; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And was this the incident that had occurred in which an attempt was made to evacuate refugees from the Mille Collines hotel and they were encountering resistance from Interahamwe? 
A.	I would like to amend something.  I am not in total agreement with the terms that you've just used to describe that action.  You say it was an incident.  It was a humanitarian action, but I do not remember very clearly what happened.  Whatever the case may be, I did go to the Hôtel des Mille Collines for a few moments and I was there. 
Q.	Well, on the date of the meeting where you claim to have seen Mr. Nzirorera, you said you had to leave early.  So when you left, tell us -- 
A.	Yes, that is right, I did leave the place of the meeting before the end of the meeting.  Before the end of the meeting.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Repeats the witness.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And where did you go? 
A.	I've just told you that, Counsel.  
Q.	The Mille Collines hotel?  
A.	I think that's where I went, yes.  I believe so.  
Q.	And then was that the same day that they tried to evacuate the people from the Mille Collines? 
A.	No, that was not on the same day, but at that time, people were coming to the Hôtel des Mille Collines. 
Q.	You'll recall there was an incident in which UNAMIR attempted to evacuate people from the 
	Mille Collines hotel, and they were turned back and the people had to return to the Mille Collines.  Do you recall that incident? 
A.	Yes, I do remember that.  
Q.	And was your visit to the Mille Collines on the day of Mr. Nzirorera's meeting before or after the event where the refugees had to be returned to the Mille Collines hotel? 
A.	I do not recall, Counsel.  Whatever the case may be, I did not leave the meeting because of the evacuation at the Mille Collines.  I knew that -- I know that that evacuation took place during the afternoon, whereas Mr. Nzirorera arrived before midday.  
Q.	But was it on the same day as the -- the unsuccessful evacuation of the refugees from the 
	Mille Collines? 
A.	I told you, Counsel, that I could not remember whether it was on the same day or not. 
Q.	Was there some urgency or emergency that required you to leave that meeting? 
A.	Whatever the case may be, there were numerous incidents around the town, whether at the 
	Hôtel des Mille Collines or at the Red Cross office.  There were plenty of incidents or action.  And I remember that I went to the Hôtel des Mille Collines with reference to the people who were to be evacuated by the UNAMIR and who had to go back to the Mille Collines because they had been blocked by the Interahamwe, I know that that incident occurred during an afternoon. 
Q.	And when you went to the Mille Collines hotel on the day Mr. Nzirorera's meeting, did you meet anyone from UNAMIR there? 
A.	UNAMIR was at the hotel on a permanent basis.  There was a UNAMIR faction that was permanently located at the Mille Collines hotel, so it is entirely possible that I did meet with the UNAMIR elements at the Hôtel des Mille Collines. 
Q.	And can you recall, as you're sitting here now, what you did on that day at the Mille Collines hotel, the day of Mr. Nzirorera's meeting?  Who did you talk to?  What did you do?  What was your purpose for going there and leaving a meeting early? 
A.	I was going to assess the situation prevailing at the Mille Collines hotel.  There were plenty of refugees that had numerous problems of a humanitarian nature, and I went there to see the conditions in which those refugees were living.  I did not go to the Mille Collines hotel because I -- because I had seen Nzirorera.  I left the meeting whilst it was in full swing, and when I came back again, the meeting had just come to a close.  
Q.	And what was the need for you to leave a meeting in the middle?  Was there some incident or emergency that made you leave the meeting before it was over? 
A.	I think I have answered that question, Counsel.  
Q.	And to make sure I understand your answer, there was no emergency or incident that caused you to leave that meeting early; is that correct? 
A.	I have just said, Counsel, that, firstly, I did not know that Nzirorera was going to come.  I had already received the agenda, but I did not go to the Mille Collines hotel immediately.  Firstly, I sought to ascertain what was on the agenda, and then when I thought it was a timely moment to leave the meeting, I did so in order to continue my programme of the day as planned.  I do not believe that I made any mistake by going to the Mille Collines hotel, because that was part of my programme well beforehand. 
Q.	And are you saying there was a written agenda for the meeting that was attended by Mr. Nzirorera?  
A.	No, Counsel, that is not what I just said.  I said that before he arrived, I had planned to go to the 
	Hôtel des Mille Collines.  I do not know whether there was a written agenda, but my personal agenda or programme was not written down.  
Q.	And you testified, did you not, that you had not been invited to this meeting beforehand, correct? 
A.	No, I was not aware of that meeting. 
Q.	And so on the morning of this day in April 1994, how was it that you came to attend the meeting? 
A.	You just mentioned the date 8th of April.  It was not on the 8th of April.  I would like to make that correction.  I attended that meeting.  I was not the only one who got into the meeting place.  Perhaps they forgot to invite me, but what I noticed was that there were many attendees, and I realised that even commune conseillers had been convened there.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take a break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1030H) 
(Pages 1 to 17 by Sherri Knox)







(Court resumed at 1055H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you can continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, could you tell us approximately what time the meeting, involving Mr. Nzirorera, began? 
A.	He arrived during the morning and I believe that the meeting began at approximately 9 a.m. 
Q.	And where, within the office of the préfecture of Kigali, did this meeting take place? 
A.	The meeting was not held inside the préfet's office; so when I say in the office, you should not understand that it was inside of the préfet's office as such. 
Q.	Where was the meeting held? 
A.	To the best of my recollection, and if I am not mistaken, I believe that there is a corridor and in that corridor a space had been set aside for meetings. 
Q.	And were you present when the meeting began? 
A.	Yes.  As I said, I was there when the meeting began. 
Q.	And who opened the meeting? 
A.	It was the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture who opened the meeting. 
Q.	I'm going to ask the registry to give you a piece of paper and we are going to write down the names of those who you can recall participating in this meeting.  

So if the registry can be asked to provide you with a blank piece of paper so we can compile an accurate list? 

So, what I would like you to do first is on this piece of paper write the name of the préfet of Kigali, Tharcisse Renzaho.  

Witness ALG, have you finished? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I have written down the names of the people whose names I can recall. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  And if I could be shown that list?  

Witness, thank you very much for completing that list.  I apologise to the Trial Chamber for the delay.  And I realise I should have assigned this as homework, but I wasn't thinking about that yesterday.

Now, in this meeting you have indicated that Préfet Renzaho opened the meeting.  And I see here that you've indicated Mr. Nzirorera was present, as well as Laurent Semanza, S-E-M-A-N-Z-A.  And both of those people were not officials of the Kigali préfecture.  Now, were there any other persons besides those two who were not members of the Kigali préfecture administration who attended this meeting?  
A.	Amongst the people whose names I have given you, there were only those two people who were not, I believe.  The others were officials of Kigali-ville préfecture.  However, it is possible that there were other people present who were not officials of Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	Did you see General Gratien Kabiligi present at this meeting?  That is K-A-B-I-L-I-G-I.  
A.	I did not give the names of any soldiers but there were some soldiers present.  Now with reference to the person you have just mentioned, that is Gratien Kabiligi, I do not remember whether he was at that meeting or not.  However, there were soldiers present. 
Q.	And what about General Marcel Gatsinzi, was he present? 
A.	I do not remember, Counsel.  But I do know that the persons whose names you have just given were in the habit of attending meetings at Kigali-ville préfecture.  But with reference to this very meeting, I do not recall whether that person was in attendance or not. 
Q.	Did you personally see General Gatsinzi at any meetings at Kigali préfecture in the month of            April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I did see him during a meeting. 
Q.	And when was that? 
A.	I do not remember the precise date, but it was during the month of April; and I saw him on                 two occasions. 
Q.	Was it during the period when he was the acting chief of staff of the Rwandan armed forces?
A.	I don't recall very well, no.  Maybe he came once before occupying that post, and then once when he was acting chief of staff.  But whenever we saw a superior officer we could not, just by virtue of looking at him, know whether he was chief of staff or not. 
Q.	General Gatsinzi was appointed chief of staff on the 7th of April 1994, and his last day in that position was on the 17th of April 1994 when he was replaced by General Augustin Bizimungu.  Did he attend any meetings at the office of the Kigali-ville préfecture during that period between the 7th and the     17th of April? 
A.	I do not really remember, Counsel, but it is possible because I know that he took part in at least         two meetings that were held at Kigali-ville préfecture during the month of April. 
Q.	And were those meetings of the security council of Kigali-ville préfecture? 
A.	The meeting that Nzirorera took part in was not a security committee meeting for Kigali-ville préfecture.  People always said that it was a security meeting but it was not, in fact, the members of the security committee who were in attendance.  People would merely say that it was meetings convened by the security committee of Kigali-ville.  But, in fact, for the most part it was not the members of that committee who were in attendance. 
Q.	But speaking of meetings in which General Gatsinzi attended, what type of meetings were those? 
A.	Counsel, they were meetings that people claimed to be security meetings for Kigali-ville.  But he was not the only member of the military to take part in that meeting.  There were others, such as the representatives of the urban police, the representatives of the gendarmerie and civilian defence and political parties, and the representatives of the youth movements of the political parties.  For example, the Interahamwe would take part in such meetings.  So, people said that they were security meetings. 
Q.	And did you see General Gatsinzi in a meeting that you have just described which included members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, he took part in that kind of meeting, and I saw him. 
Q.	Now, returning to the meeting in which you claim Mr. Nzirorera was present.  I have asked you about General Kabiligi and General Gatsinzi; was there a military officer name Rutayisire, that is R-U-T-A-Y-I-S-I-R-E, present at the meeting involving Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  He, that is General Gatsinzi, and Kabiligi took part in those meetings.  But as far as Kabiligi is concerned, I did not see him taking part in the meetings convened during the months -- the month of April.  I especially saw Gatsinzi and Rutayisire.  Now, with reference to that meeting, I do not know whether Rutayisire was in attendance at that particular meeting or not.  You asked me to give you the names of those people whom I recalled to be present.  So I did not seek to mention the names of those people that I was not sure about. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, very much, Witness ALG.  Now -- 
A.	And I also thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether the president of the MRND at the préfecture level in Kigali, Jean Habyarimana, attended the meeting in which Mr. Nzirorera was present? 
A.	No, he was not in attendance. 
Q.	Now, turning to the Interahamwe who were in attendance at that meeting, you have put here on your list the name of Sued, that is S-U-E-D, Ndayitabi N-D-A-Y-I-T-A-B-I.  Were there other Interahamwe in attendance in addition to this person? 
A.	There were many.  There were many Interahamwe at that meeting. 
Q.	Now, was Bernard Maniragaba at that meeting? 
A.	I do not remember very well, but it is possible that he was in attendance. 
Q.	Was an Interahamwe named Pecos, P-E-K-O-S (sic), present at that meeting? 
A.	Yes, that is possible.  His name is Pecos Ngarageze.  Ngarageze is spelt N-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-E, Ngerageze.  So Pecos Ngerageze was the president of the Interahamwe in the Gitega area, spelt G-I-T-E-G-A.
Q.	And are you able to recall whether or not he was present at the meeting at which you claim Mr. Nzirorera attended. 
A.	I think he was in attendance.  Yes, I believe he was there. 
Q.	If you could take another piece -- if the registry could give you another blank piece of paper and we can add his name, so that we have a complete list by the time we are finished with this. 
A.	Counsel, if you would like you might give me the piece of paper that I wrote on before and I can add his name. 
Q.	Okay, I prefer you do it on a separate piece of paper because otherwise we will be having to pass this paper back and forth.  So it is easier if you write it on a separate piece of paper? 

Now, can you tell us whether or not an Interahamwe known as Sukari was present at this meeting?  
A.	Counsel, I do not recall.  You know, it is very difficult to remember all of those people who were in attendance at that meeting.  And as you can see you have just suggested a name to me that I am writing on this piece of paper, and now you are suggesting another to me.  So, as you can see it is very difficult for me to remember everybody. 
Q.	I understand that, Witness ALG.  So if you remember that the person was present, you can say, yes, and we can write that down.  And if you don't remember, you can say you don't remember and we can move on.  But I want to try to get from you, to the best of your recollection, the identity of the people who were present at that meeting.

Now, what about an Interahamwe by the name of Hadjigitosa, that is H-A-D-J-I-G-I-T-O-S-A, who I understand was from Biryogo secteur.  
A.	Perhaps that person attended that meeting, but I am not sure.  But, perhaps, he was there.  He was called Hadjigitosa.  He was the Interahamwe president for Biryogo secteur, B-I-R-Y-O-G-O.  I wonder whether you'll require me to write that name, but I think he was present.  You see, I cannot remember all of those who attended that meeting. 
Q.	Well, if you think he was present, then please write his name down.
A.	But, Counsel, I may be mistaken.  Perhaps, I may think he was there whereas that was not the case. 
Q.	Well, if you are not sure then can you put a question mark next to his name? 

Now, were any of the officers of the national Interahamwe committee present at this meeting?  And by officers, I'm asking about Robert Kajuga, Pheneas Ruhumuliza, Georges Rutaganda,             Dieudonné Niyitegeka and Eugene Mbarushimana.  Were any of those people present? 
A.	I can't remember that, Counsel.  But I think those people were not present.  Perhaps,                  Bernard Maniragaba was in attendance.  Yes, I believe he did attend that meeting.  Just the same way as I mentioned Kitungo's name, I think I am going to mention Bernard Maniragaba's as well. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG.  Now, was Ephrem Nkezabera, Joseph Serugendo, Jean Pierre Sabanetsi, were any of those people present? 
A.	I don't know Sabanetsi.  I know Nkezabera, and I think he was not present.  As for Serugendo, I am unable to remember; I am not sure. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness ALG.  Now, were there any leaders of any other political parties present at this meeting?  
A.	If my memory is not failing me, there were not any officials of other political parties.  The only officials of the MRND, the Interahamwe, as well as the people's names I have given you.  You should also add the name of Jean-Baptiste Butera, who was the head of political affairs and administrative affairs service in Kigali préfecture office.  Let me spell Butera, B-U-T-E-R-A. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG.  I'm going to now ask you about some of the officials of the préfectures and the commune.  Can you tell us whether the bourgmestre, Gasamagera, that is, G-A-S-A-M-A-G-E-R-A, of Kicukiro commune, that is K-I-C-U-K-I-R-O was present at this meeting? 
A.	He wasn't. 
Q.	Now, what about one of the assistants to the préfet named Fabian Bunane, B-U-N-A-N-I -- N-E, excuse me, B-U-N-A-N-E, who I understand was in charge of economic and financial affairs; was he present? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And what about Aloys Simpunga, S-I-M-P-U-N-G-A, who I understand was in charge of cultural affairs for the préfecture, was he present? 
A.	I can't quite remember if he was present.  What I know, that he sometimes attended such meetings.  I don't know if he attended that particular meeting.  He was the head of the social, educational and cultural affairs service. 
Q.	And what about Faustin Munyakazi, that is spelt, M-U-N-Y-A-K-A-Z-I, who was, as I understand it, in charge of infrastructure and equipment; did he attend this meeting? 
A.	I can't quite remember. 
Q.	Now, with respect to the conseillers, in addition to the ones that you have listed on this sheet, can you tell us whether or not the conseiller for Muhima secteur, Euphasie Kamatamu, attended this meeting.  And that is spelt E-U-P-H-R-A-I-E (sic), and last name is K-A-M-A-T-A-M-U. 
A.	The names I mentioned were only those of people I remember here and now.  So, what I would say is that not all of the names have come to my mind.  I mentioned only the names which have come to my mind here and now.  However, I think she was in attendance. 
Q.	So, if you could put her name down on the sheet that is in front of you, that would be helpful.  I want to ask you about the representative of Gitega secteur at that time, who I understand was a man named Majaliwa Bizimana, standing in for the conseiller of Gitega?  That is spelt M-A-J-A-L-I-W-A, B-I-Z-I-M-A-N-A.  Was this person in attendance in the meeting involving Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	I can't remember. 
Q.	And what about Célestin Sezibera, S-E-Z-I-B-E-R-A, the conseiller for Nyamirambo secteur, was he present? 
A.	I don't remember if he was there. 
Q.	And what about Rose Karushara, K-A-R-U-S-H-A-R-A? 
A.	It is possible that she was there.  I think she was present, but I have some doubts about that. 
Q.	Why don't you put her name down, and put a question mark next to her name. 
	
	Now, with respect to the conseiller of Kacyiru, who you have told us was Mr. Dusabe, D-U-S-A-B-E, was he present at this meeting? 
A.	I am unable to remember.  To make things easy, the conseillers of Kicukiro and Kacyiru communes, I think most of them were not present because I did not see them very often attending meetings.  There was sustained fighting in those areas.  And the members of the population of those respective areas had fled together with the officials of the areas. 
Q.	And do you know whether or not the conseiller of Kimisange secteur, K-I-M-I-S-A-N-G-E, by the name of Gakuru was in attendance? 
A.	I can't remember, Counsel. 
Q.	And what about the conseiller of Kicukiro secteur, whose name I understand to be                       François Biziyaremye, B-I-Z-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E? 
A.	I also cannot remember whether or not he was there. 
Q.	What about François Karera, was he present? 
A.	No. 
Q.	What about the person responsible for the immigration service for the préfecture, by the name of Tharcisse Rubwejanga, that is R-U-B-W-E-J-A-N-G-A; was he present? 
A.	I can't remember, but he regularly came to the préfecture office; however, I do not know whether he attended that particular meeting. 
Q.	And finally what about the person responsible for intelligence in the préfecture by the name of Bigega, B-I-G-E-G-A; did he attend? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	And the conseiller in Nyakabanda secteur, Gregoire Nyirimanzi, N-Y-I-L-I-M-A-N-Z-I; did he attend? 
A.	I can't remember. 
Q.	And so between the piece of paper you have in front of you and the one you completed earlier, do those contain the names, to the best of your recollection, of those who attended the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	Those are the only persons I remember. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer the two pieces of paper, that is the list compiled by this witness of those in attendance at the meeting, as Exhibit D. NZ184. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could we give them separate exhibit numbers, because there should be a clear distinction between the list that the witness compiled on his own, and the one that he was prodded to make at Mr. Robinson's suggestions.  So if we can -- I think if we gave them separate exhibit numbers the distinction would be easier to notice. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, that is fine, Mr. President.  So, the list that was composed by the witness before questioning should be Exhibit D. NZ184.  I have that in my hand.  And the list is that before the witness should be  D. NZ185. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Entered. 

Is it necessary to put these documents under seal?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't believe so, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ184 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ185 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what the préfet said when he opened the meeting? 
A.	As far as I remember when he opened the meeting he made a rapid overview of the state of affairs in Kigali.  He addressed the security situation in Kigali town and also talked about the existing problems then. 
Q.	And what were those existing problems? 
A.	Insecurity.  Further he insisted on the war situation.  He mentioned the fact that members of the public were fleeing their areas, fleeing the town.  Those were the issues he underscored. 
Q.	And given that he was in the presence of members of the MRND and the Interahamwe, did he direct any comments to them? 
A.	He talked about the work done by the Interahamwe within Kigali town.  He said Interahamwe were assisting the Rwanda armed force in protecting the town.  He requested assistance from political party officials.  And he particularly requested from MRND officials that they play a part in restoring peace within the town, and also in combating the enemy so that they would attend victory.  Those were the issues he addressed in broad strokes.  Of course, when he started his address he thanked the MRND's secretary general for his visit to Kigali town. 
Q.	And what did you understand was the purpose of this meeting? 
A.	Actually, what transpired was that the meeting highlighted the MRND's role in what would happen.  At that time the MRND secretary general was with Lauren Semanza, MRND chairman for Kigali préfecture, Semanza is spell S-E-M-A-N-Z-A, had come to encourage them in their work of assisting the Rwanda armed forces in fighting the enemy.  I think that was the purpose of the meeting, in a nutshell. 
Q.	And can you tell us who took the floor after Préfet Renzaho? 
A.	No, I do not remember how people spoke in turns.  But in any case, Nzirorera made an address during that meeting about seeing the various people who spoke and in what order; I'm unable to do that. 
Q.	Who chaired the meeting? 
A.	It was apparent that a meeting was co-chaired by the préfet and Nzirorera. 
Q.	And can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what Mr. Nzirorera said at this meeting? 
A.	I think I just mentioned some of the ideas he raised.  He thanked the authorities of Kigali-ville préfecture for the efforts they have been making towards fighting the enemy.  He thanked the Interahamwe for their conduct, be it at the roadblocks or in the frontlines.  He said they had the backing of the MRND.  And that if ever they needed any assistance, then they were to seek the assistance of the soldiers with whom they were working together or the préfet.  

I forgot to mention a VIP who attended that meeting and who was working very closely with the Interahamwe, that is Major Bivamvagara, spelt B-I-V-A-M-V-A-G-A-R-A.  I also remember another important personality I had forgotten.  And I would ask you to add his name to the list.  That was the Kigali-ville préfecture police boss, Major Nyanuhimba, N-Y-A-N-U-H-I-M-B-A, Nyanuhimba.  So they were saying that they had to do their level best.  And they asked the Kigali-ville préfecture to assist them so that they would carry through successfully their mission of fighting the enemy. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG, for remembering those other two names.  And I would ask if the registry can give you another piece of paper and we can put those two names down so we have a complete list.  And if you recall any others, we can also add those to the list?
MR. ROBINSON:  
I think it would be good to leave the list with him.  We can have it there in case he remembers other names.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And by the way, Witness ALG, was Colonel Felicien Muberuka present; that's M-U-B-E-R-U-K-A?  
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	And what about Lieutenant Colonel Laurent Munyakazi, M-U-N-Y-A-K-A-Z-I? 
A.	I do not recall whether those soldiers were present, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us who else took the floor?  First of all, you've told us what Mr. Nzirorera said.  Did any members of the audience ask Mr. Nzirorera any questions? 
A.	To the best of my recollection, after the préfet took the floor and Nzirorera, that is when I left the meeting.  So I do not know what questions might have been put to him.  I remember that after the préfet and Mr. Nzirorera addressed the meeting, I left the meeting room. 
Q.	Did you hear -- well, I think you have answered that part of it enough.  So let me ask you, after you left the meeting did you hear anybody talk about what had occurred in your absence? 
A.	The truth be told, when you take part in a meeting what you remember about it depends on your understanding.  People put questions -- I'm sorry, I didn't really respond to your question very well.  In fact, people talked to me about how the meeting had gone after I left. 
Q.	And what were you told about how the meeting had gone? 
A.	In fact, the meeting did not last for very long.  And merely a few questions were put and people were concentrating on the subject of civilian defence as to how they were to behave, as to how they were to obtain equipment.  And the Interahamwe were complaining, especially about the lack of equipment and rifles.  And whether it be Mr. Nzirorera or the préfet who were responding to the questions put, they promised to do their best in order to find rifles for them.  And towards the end of the meeting, somebody raised the question as to the lack of food stuffs, and also with reference to the living conditions.  And Mr. Nzirorera said that the leaders of the MRND party were conscious of those problems and that they were going to do their best to come to their assistance.  

And in order to show that they were supporting the Interahamwe, Sued Ntadyitabi, N-T-A-D-Y-I-T-A-B-I, Sued Ntadyitabi, S-U-E-D, so he handed to Sued the sum of 100,000 francs with a view to showing his support, that is support of the Interahamwe leadership.  

That is the information that was given to me by the people who remained in attendance at that meeting.  And they gave me that information because whilst I returned to the place from where I had left, I met Interahamwe who were dancing along the way.  And they said that Nzirorera was a good man.  They said, "Our leader is a good man."  So I came across them.  They went on their way and I went on mine.  

And on reaching the préfecture, I found the préfet and Kacyiru bourgmestre, who also provided me with the same information. 
Q.	And can you recall the names of any Interahamwe who provided you with information about what had occurred after you left the meeting? 
A.	I just told you that the bourgmestre of Kacyiru commune and some other conseillers were the ones who gave me that information.  

Now, with reference to the Interahamwe, I came across them when they were dancing on their way and claiming that Nzirorera was a good man, and I wanted to know why they said that.  So, on reaching their préfecture, I was told that the Interahamwe were probably happy because Nzirorera had handed over such a sum of money. 
Q.	And in addition to receiving that information from Préfet Renzaho, and the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, which conseillers provided you with that information? 
A.	Yes, as I said, the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, his name was Pierre Clavier Nyelenkwaya, Nyelenkwaya, N-Y-E-L-E-N-K-W-A-Y-A -- sorry for the speed, and other conseillers who were also in attendance at the meeting.  I believe that one conseiller -- or, at least, two conseillers gave me such information. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Pardon me, Counsel, perhaps I'm mistaken, but I don't see where he said he got that information from Renzaho.  I was looking at the transcript, I don't see where he said that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I will clarify that.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you receive the information about what had occurred at the meeting after you left from             Préfet Renzaho? 
A.	No, I never talked of that. 
Q.	That is my mistake then.  And can you give us the names of the conseiller who gave you the information about what had occurred at the meeting after you left? 
A.	Those are the two conseiller whom I recall; that was Gabriel Mbyariyehe, but I'm not sure.  I remember that they were together.  They were standing with Amri Karekezi.  I should spell Mbyariyehe, M-B-Y-A-R-I-Y-E-H-E.  Karekezi, K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I. 
Q.	Now, is there any other information that you recall about this meeting? 
A.	That is the only information that I can recall on the subject of that meeting, Counsel -- the only information. 
Q.	Now, I would ask that you be shown Exhibit D. NG29, which is a statement that you wrote out in February 2000 concerning your activities during the war. 
A.	And that is D. NG29, so it is an exhibit offered by Ngirumpatse.  Witness ALG, we've talked about this document before.  This is a document that you wrote at the request of the prosecutor in Rwanda in February of 2000 in which you describe your activities during the war.  And I want to direct your attention to page 18 in which the item number 4 "Meetings" is indicated; do you see that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I've found the excerpt. 
Q.	And it is true, is it not, that under the topic of meetings you describe two meetings in which you had participated and made no mention of the meeting in which Mr. Nzirorera was present, correct? 
A.	Counsel, as I said, and I shall confirm it once again, I would like to say that this document does not indicate all activities or details. 
Q.	But my question to you is whether or not -- when you were describing the meetings at which you had participated or attended, whether or not you included the meeting involving Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Counsel, the meetings that I referred to in this document are at the level of two secteurs.  And if you look closely, you will see that I did not mention any meeting held at the préfecture office.  So, when I spoke of meetings here it was meetings held for the attention of all members of the population.  That is why I began by saying the following, and I shall read:  

So, as I was saying, this document does not contain all of the details of the meetings that were held.  As I said, when I talked of meetings here, I meant meetings for the entire population.  So, I did not convene a meeting at the time because it was not possible.  There was fighting in Kigali, and people were fleeing that fighting.  Some people were running away from those members of the youth that were attacking them.  So I remember that I did take part in security meetings at secteur level.  And one of them was held in Nyakabanda secteur", N-Y-A-K-A-B-A-N-D-A.  And another meeting was held in the secteur of Nyamirambo which is spelt, N-Y-A-M-Y -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is going too fast for the interpreters, unfortunately.
THE WITNESS:
Nyamirambo, M-I-R-A-M-B-O (sic).  But as you can see, Counsel, I did not talk about meetings that were held at the préfecture office.  And as I said to you,************************************************* *********************************************************************.  But as you can see, such a meeting is not mentioned this document.  And I have given you the reasons for that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, we can agree that nowhere in this 12-page document did you mention the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera, correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, no mention is made of that meeting in this document. 
Q.	And then I would like you to be shown Exhibit D. NG31, which is the report of -- which is your statement during your meeting with the Office of the Prosecutor, including Mr. Webster, in October of 2002? 
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, I want to direct your attention to page four of this statement, which has at the top of it number K0259089.  And it -- particularly beginning with the paragraph that starts on the second full paragraph, during the 15th through the 30th of April.  And is it not a fact that you told the Prosecution that between the 15th and 30th of April, "Security meetings were convened by Renzaho."  And you go on to describe what had happened during one of these meetings.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes, I have found the passage, Counsel. 
Q.	And then during to page -- two pages later and this is when the interview resumes on the                  10th of October in the presence of Dior Fall.  This is on page 6.  And do you see where you say that, "During meetings held in April or May 1994 and chaired by Renzaho, many topics were discussed."  And then you go on to discuss those topics.  Do you see that?
A.	Yes, Counsel, I can see that passage. 
Q.	And further along you discuss, "At during another meeting in April, Renzaho directed corpses be removed from the streets."  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And that at a meeting in May, Préfet Renzaho spoke of distributing weapons.  Do you see that?   
A.	Yes, I can see the passage, Counsel. 
Q.	And can we agree that nowhere in this statement in October of 2002, did you mention this meeting at which Mr. Nzirorera allegedly attended? 
A.	Counsel, I agree with you that I did not mention that meeting, but it really depended on the questions that were put to me, because as you can see, this document is a sort of summary.  I -- and you are putting questions to me on the subject of Renzaho in particular. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG.  And now I would like to turn to Exhibit D. NG37, which is the annex to your confession, a document dated on the*********************.

Now, Witness ALG, this is a statement that you did not provide in response to questioning, but it is something that you yourself drafted, correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel.  But I think you were going to say that I did not write everything down, and I believe that I gave you a reason for that. 
Q.	But we can agree that, can we not, that in this document, specifically, you were charging the national secretary out of the MRND and others of responsibility for the genocide, correct?  And if you could look at the last paragraph under number 2, you might find that specific reference.  Do you see where you said that:  

"The national secretary out of the MRND, the ministry of defence, Interahamwe leaders and other political parties referred to as power and members of the CDR, including Stanislas Simbizi, S-I-M-B-I-Z-I, must bear their responsibility for the tragic genocide."  And that is the last paragraph under number 2 in your document. 

So, Witness ALG, I don't know if you want to reread your whole document to yourself, but my question is directed at -- 
A.	Counsel, before doing anything else, I would like to find the passage, because I have not been able to identify the passage that you mentioned. 
Q.	Well, in your document you have certain numbers as headings:  Number 1, Organisation of Meetings; Number 2, Preparation of Criminal Acts; and number 3 -- Number 3, The Conduct of 
	Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho.  And right before number 3, the paragraph before number 3, the last paragraph in number 2, it begins at:  "I don't know anything about the planning of the genocide."  Do you have that paragraph? 
A.	Yes, I have found that paragraph, Counsel. 
Q.	And in that paragraph, in the middle, you say that, "The national secretary of the MRND and others must bear responsible for the tragic genocide," correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And then when you go down, it is under number 3 you talk about the security meetings at the PVK.  You say that, "All PVK security meetings were presided over by the préfet.  And he invited the following people" and you list the people who were invited, including chairman of the political parties at the level of the préfecture from time to time; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And can we agree that nowhere in this document do you speak of the meeting attended by Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	True enough, Counsel, I did not mention that meeting because when he participated in that meeting it was in the context of his political party.  It was not a meeting that was similar to the type of meetings that the préfet normally convened, and to which he invited specific people.  So, I did not want to mention that meeting because it was not a meeting like any other. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take our recess now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  We will stand for our luncheon adjournment now and resume -- Mr. Robinson are you still on track for the course of this afternoon?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I am.
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how far down the afternoon do you think you are likely to finish?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think after this -- after -- sometime after the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Okay, we will take the adjournment now. 
(Court recessed from 1233H)
(Pages 18 to 30 by Donna M. Lewis)

















(Court resumed at 1414H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody. 

Mr. Robinson, you can continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  And at the beginning I would like to offer exhibit -- as Exhibit D. NZ186, the piece of paper on which the witness, ALG, wrote the final two names he believed had attended the meeting at the end of April with Mr. Nzirorera. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ186 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, I want to ask you about the meeting that took place on the 30th of April concerning the conseiller, Celestin Sezibera; that is S-E-Z-I-B-E-R-A.  

Now, first of all, we can agree, can we not, that that meeting did not take place on the same day, that's the meeting of Mr. Nzirorera occurred; correct? 
A.	Indeed, the two meetings did not take place on the same day.  I don't think it was on the same day.  And that meeting, if I am not mistaken, I think you said on the 31st, but really it was the 30th, I think, rather, in 1994. 
Q.	Right.  That's correct, April only has 30 days. 

Now, that meeting was held at the Nyamirambo secteur; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was it held in the morning or in the afternoon? 
A.	It was in the forenoon. 
Q.	Now, when you attended that meeting, when you -- did you take with you a message from the préfet concerning the replacement of the conseiller? 
A.	No, there was no such message. 
Q.	And when you arrived at that meeting, did you know that the conseiller was to be replaced? 
A.	I did not know it on that day. 
Q.	When did you learn that he was being replaced? 
A.	I learnt of it in the course of the meeting.  The news came while we were in the middle of the meeting. 
Q.	And how did that news come? 
A.	There was a responsable de cellule, unless I am much mistaken, who came from the Kigali -- who came from the Kigali urban préfecture, and he had that message written down. 
Q.	And did you think it was odd that the removal of a conseiller would be performed in a message delivered by a responsable of the cellule instead of being a message from the person**************** ********************? 
A.	Indeed, I also found that a bit strange. 
Q.	Now, you have told us that at this meeting, Major Bivamvagara, B-I-V-A-M-V-A-G-A-R-A, addressed the group; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you tell us what he said? 
A.	He didn't speak at length.  In fact, we should have expected some sort of presentation.  He spoke of how things worked and, especially, he wanted to define the "enemy".  He said the enemy we were up against was the Tutsi who had attacked our country.  That is what he said in the course of that meeting. 
Q.	And did you hear him say that on another occasion, as well? 
A.	Yes, I heard him say such things on other occasions.  I don't know if you want me to speak of those occasions.  On one other occasion, when we were in Kimisagara -- Kimisagara is spelt, K-I-M-I-S-A-G-A-R-A, it is one of the secteurs of Nyarugenge commune in Kigali urban préfecture -- we were in Kamuhoza cellule.  Kamuhoza is K-A-M-U-H-O-Z-A, which was normally called Katabaro, K-A-T-A-B-A-R-O.  It was at Akatabaro, A-K-A-T-A-B-A-R-O.  And when he was saying those things, he was addressing the young people he was training.  He also appointed some reservists to help him.  So he had come to visit these young people and I accompanied him.  I also heard him say such things at Nyamirambo stadium.  Nyamirambo is spelt N-Y-A-M-I-R-A-M-B-O, Nyamirambo.  So there were some young people undergoing military training at the stadium, and when he came he said again the same things.  Those are the occasions on which I heard him say such things. 
Q.	And that definition of the enemy as being the Tutsi was different from what we read in the instructions from Prime Minister Kambanda issued on the 27th of April, in which he said that the enemy was the RPF-Inkontanyi; is that correct? 
A.	I don't know if it is really different because from what we could see: any Tutsi was hunted down.  He was called "Inkotanyi", or "Inyenzi" at that time in those days.  So, even if what he said was different, the people hunted down were the same, that is to say the Tutsis. 
Q.	Now, on 5th of May 1994 -- and I am going to refer to a cable that was sent by General Dallaire to 
	Kofi Annan, which is number 26 in my package of material, and General Dallaire said that there is a third element or force that has significantly affected the overall situation behind the RGF lines and it has been mixing with the general population, and it seems to have its base in the political militia, the youth wings and the local quota self-defence groups.  And he describes that these groups have demonstrated fanatical and ruthless actions and quite often are under the influence of alcohol and drugs while at the barricades or while roving the streets and hillsides, and that these people have been the principal authors as far as it can be ascertained of the destruction -- of the terrible atrocities and destruction throughout most of the country.  And he goes on to say that each individual cell seems to have a self-appointed leader who does not necessarily obey or take orders from anyone in the normal chain of authority.  And he goes on to say that even if a ceasefire were brought into effect, it might be difficult to control these groups.  Does that appear to you to be an accurate assessment of the situation in Kigali in early May 1994? 
A.	Counsel, that was the situation that prevailed at that time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document be marked as ID. NZ52, the cable from General Dallaire to Kofi Annan on the 5th of May 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ52, marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, on the 6th of May in a daily situation report by UNAMIR, the authorities of UNAMIR noted that the RPF seemed to be intensifying its group on the city, that troops were still infiltrating into the city and that the chief -- in a meeting between General Dallaire and the chief of staff of the Rwandan army, the chief of staff conceded that they are not in full control of the situation and that he was going to make an effort to straighten things out.  And from your observations in Kigali in early May, did it appear to you that even the highest ranking people in the army were not able to stop the massacres? 
A.	It would surprise me, Counsel, if the top ranking officers were faced with a situation where they 
	couldn't -- such a situation where they couldn't stop the massacres.  I am surprised if you tell me that in their capacity, the top ranking officers of the army entrusted with ensuring public safety would have said such a thing. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that the daily situation report of 6th May 1994 be marked for identification as ID. NZ53. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
At number 25, is this in the bundle?
MR. ROBINSON: 
At number 27, I am sorry. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ53, marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, were you aware of a broadcast on Radio Rwanda on the 6th of May 1994 in which 
	Préfet Renzaho called upon the conseiller to supervise the roadblocks and to replace anyone who causes harm to others and to put them in prison, and he called upon the prosecutors to return to work and prosecute those who were breaking the law, and he told the population not to harm people, but to take them before the appropriate authorities.  And this is in Exhibit D. NZ87.  Did you hear that broadcast?  
A.	Counsel, I do not recall that -- I could not recall that announcement being broadcast or that communiqué being issued, and if such a communiqué existed, it would surprise me because at the time he knew well that the prosecutors were not working, that the préfet no longer had the means of arresting anyone.  I see that you are submitting communiqués to me that might have been broadcast, that I was not aware of.  And such communiqués might have been broadcast simply because the authorities wanted to fool the international community.  They were not translated into action.  Anyone 
	is -- could doubt that.  And let me continue.  If there was any request for people to be arrested, there was -- where could they have been locked up?  There were no prisons.  There was nowhere to detain people and everyone knew that he, himself, had released all the people from prison in Kigali because they were no longer able to feed them.  I think even the authorities at that time were not sure of their own safety or security.  They didn't know what would happen from one day to the next.  One should really make an objective analysis of the situation that prevailed at the time. 
Q.	Did you hear the broadcast of the interview with president -- with Préfet Renzaho on the 10th of May on Radio Rwanda, in which he said that security committees had been formed comprising members representing the cellules to deal with security concerns and that it was important that their directives be respected and that that's why he had decided to arrest those who violate those instructions and commit crimes so that they could be punished.  And that is Exhibit D. NZ88.  Did you hear that broadcast? 
A.	Counsel, you will have to bear with me.  During that period, it was not often that one had the opportunity to listen to the radio.  Perhaps you are not going to believe me, but that was the situation then.  So, I don't remember having heard that. 
Q.	Do you remember the préfet, on the 16th of May, having issued a letter to the conseillers, telling them to put an end to the killings? 
A.	Yes, I heard of that letter.  I was aware of it.  But, Counsel, as you can see, if you make an effort to be objective, you will realise that he sent them a written message requesting them to stop the massacres, whereas it was not possible.  You just said a while ago that even the army top brass had said that it was impossible to stop the killings.  So how could you imagine that the responsable de cellule would be able to stop massacres?  The letter was written, granted, but you need to conduct an analysis to ascertain whether what was being requested was doable.  
Q.	Now, did you hear the speech on the 17th of May in Cyangugu of President Sindikubwabo, in which he condemned some people in some communes who were still committing acts that aimed to break the law and government regulations, and he asked all préfets in all préfectures to report to him on the security situation in their respective préfectures, and he stated that people who break the law would be punished and he recalled that the enemy of Rwanda was the RPF-Inkontanyi?  Did you hear that speech? 
A.	No, sir. 
Q.	Now -- by the way, that was Exhibit D. NZ81.  Now, on the 19th of May, we have evidence that 
	Préfet Renzaho was interviewed on Radio Rwanda and said that criminals should be arrested, that no criminals should be tolerated, they have to be arrested and then taken to the judicial authority; and he asked the prosecutor's office to resume so that criminals could be punished; and he called upon the leaders of the commune, including the leaders of the secteurs, to denounce those who impair the security; and he called upon the conseillers and the bourgmestres in Kigali to arrest people who were committing criminal acts, such as killing others.  And in that broadcast, he said he didn't want reports and he wanted deeds, and if they couldn't do the job because the criminals were stronger than the authorities, he wanted the authorities to let him know and he would bring in more might.  Did you hear that interview with the préfet on the 19th of May, which is Exhibit D. NZ90? 
A.	Well, it is possible that he granted such an interview, but my answer to this question is similar to my earlier answer.  So I don't think it is necessary for me to repeat what I had said.  He said so because he knew full well that it was not achievable.  He was addressing himself to people in charge of the prosecution department, whereas the prosecution departments were no longer operating.  I did not see any officer of the prosecution department.  I did not see any officer of the judiciary in Kigali préfecture office. 
Q.	Now, on the 8th of June 1994, did you hear the interview of Préfet Renzaho on Radio Rwanda, in which he said that killers, looters and the Inyenzi must all be considered on the same footing and that we must take measures to take care of those categories of people, that all the members of the public should feel secure and safe, and that people who ensure security do not fit in those categories; and that those who commit acts against the public safety are wrongdoers and criminals, and acts -- and action must be taken to counter their acts so that they are answerable for them?  And that those people, the killers, were the enemy of the people and the enemy of the public.  Did you hear him say that?  And that is Exhibit D. NZ92.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Just a minute, a correction to the transcript, Counsel, it says in the transcript, "Préfet Ngirumpatse".
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much.  I think we all know how that should be corrected.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, did Préfet Renzaho -- did you hear Préfet Renzaho say that? 
A.	Counsel, he made such utterances, but my comment now will not be different from my earlier comment. 
Q.	Now, you have told us you went into exile -- rather, you left Kigali around the 3rd of July 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	And before leaving Kigali, did you instruct *************************to burn copies of their reports? 
A.	No, I did not give instruction to anyone. 
Q.	And, in particular, conseillers in the commune of*******************, has testified on the 
	23rd of February of 2006, as Witness UB, at page 8, that you ordered him to burn copies of his reports.  Did you do that? 
A.	Never, sir. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, when did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I can't very well remember the date.  In any case, we left the town on the 3rd.  We fled.  We went by various routes: Kigali, Rushashi.  We continued on our way.  In any case, it was around the 17th or the 18th of July. 
Q.	And then you returned from exile in October of 1996; is that correct? 
A.	That was when we left the camps.  I arrived in Rwanda in January or February 1997.  I passed through Cyangugu. 
Q.	And you were arrested on the****************************? 
A.	That is right.  I received a summons, which summons I answered.  It was in the commune office when I got there.  I was detained. 
Q.	And then a process began where on occasion you would be questioned by persons connected with the criminal justice system in Rwanda, including the criminal investigations officer and the prosecutor; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And we have seen those statements from the*************************************************.  We have seen your account of your activities during the war that you provided in February 2000.  We have seen a statement you made to the prosecutor concerning Odette Nyirabagenzi in March of 2000.  And we have seen the confession that you submitted to the Rwandan authorities on the ********************** and the additional statement to your confession that you wrote on the**********************.  And my question to you is whether or not you made any other statements to the Rwandan authorities in your case. 
A.	I think those are all the statements I have given. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, have you given any statements to the Rwandan authorities in connection with anyone else's case?  Have you been interviewed by the Rwandan authorities about other people? 
A.	Yes, I have been asked questions about other people.  Some of those people have been tried already; others are still awaiting trial. 
Q.	Now, I am going to try to take a measure to protect your identity.  So I am going to ask the registrar to give you a blank piece of paper so that we don't expose the names of the persons against whom you have given information or about whom you have given information.  

So if the registrar can give you a blank piece of paper, I am going to ask you to write down the names of those persons about whom you were questioned by the Rwandan authorities.  Okay?  And I am speaking of statements now that were not in your own case file, but statements that would be in the case file of others. 
A.	If that is your wish, then I am going to do so.  But I think there are many. 
Q.	That's okay.  Take your time.  Please be as complete as you can possibly be.

Witness ALG, have you done that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Before you give the list to the registrar, I want to ask you if you could do one other thing, and that is:  Is it possible to write the month and the year of the time when you made the statement as to each of those people, next to their names, if you can recall that? 
A.	Counsel, you see, the problem is that there were times when investigators came on several occasions over successive years.  That is the problem.  However, I will endeavour to mention the dates I remember, which does not mean, however, that those were the only periods when I was interviewed. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much and I would appreciate it if you can make your best effort.  

Thank you very much, Witness ALG.
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, Issa, if you could bring another piece of paper to the witness and just leave it with him.  And if you could collect the piece of paper he has just written and show it to everyone, and while you are showing it to people, I am going to ask him some other questions.  I am having a multitask here in the courtroom.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ALG, in addition to the people -- the cases in which you have given statements to Rwandan authorities, have you also testified in any court or Gacaca proceedings in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  I think I have mentioned that on the document.  I think I had mentioned that I had testified in a court against this or that person.  There is another occasion when I testified before a cellule -- Gacaca court in the cellule I live in. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is actually giving the name of the cellule where he lives, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, excuse me.  Because we don't want you to give the name of the cellule where you are living, that is something I would actually like you to write down on that piece of paper in front of you.  Can you write down the name of the cellule and the date that you gave that testimony, if you remember, before Gacaca? 
A.	Could you repeat the question, please?  
Q.	What I would like you to write is the name of the cellule in which you testified in Gacaca proceedings and the date that you testified.  
A.	Counsel, as I do not recall the date, is it a problem if I just put the month?  I don't remember the day.  There would be a risk of a mistake if I tried to put a date.  But if I just put the month, is that all right with you, Counsel, or is it a problem?  
Q.	No, it's fine, thank you.  And, Witness ALG, if there are any other times that you appeared before the Gacaca, if you could write down the cellule or the secteur and the time at which you appeared?  

Witness ALG, do you think, now, between the two sheets of paper, that you have listed all of the times on which you were questioned by the authorities or on which you testified either in a court or Gacaca proceedings in Rwanda? 
A.	I think I have written everything down.  It is impossible that I might have forgotten one thing or another, but, otherwise, I have included everything. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French booth is asking that you repeat your question, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Thank you, Judge Kam. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	My question is whether or not you think that you have written down all of the times on which you were questioned by authorities in Rwanda or that you had testified either before a court or a Gacaca proceeding in Rwanda, and your answer that I heard was that, yes, to the best of your ability, this is complete.  Is that correct? 
A.	I have written down all the occasions I remember. 
(Pages 31 to 38 by Sithembiso Moyo)

















1510H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you, very much for doing that.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time if the registry could now collect the document that he has now completed, and I ask that the document which he completed first, which is in my hand, be marked as D. NZ187, and that the document he has now completed concerning the additional testimonies be marked as D. NZ188, and that both exhibits be received under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ187 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. NZ188 admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.

And if the registry could also show the parties and myself the most recent document that he has completed.

Actually, if the registry, Mr. Issa, could place before the witness my document No. 35 in my packet of exhibits that was distributed yesterday, and then we can discuss that exhibit while you are showing us the other one.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, directing your attention to the document that's been placed before you, which is No. 35 in my list of exhibits, is that the document which indicates that you were granted provisional release on the ***********************?
A.	Yes, that is indeed the document in question.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted, under seal, as D. NZ189.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ189 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And at the moment, Witness ALG, you are free, pending your trial; correct?
MR. ROBINSON:
Are we going to have a translation of that answer?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry; could you repeat it?  It seems to have got lost somewhere.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	The question was: are you now free, pending the outcome of your trial?
A.	Yes, yes, that is correct; that is correct.
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, we have now come to the part of the case where I am going to put my comment to you and ask you to comment on it.  The first thing I want to tell you is that it's our case that you did not participate in any wrongdoing in Rwanda during these events and that you're not guilty of any rapes, any killings, any malfeasance at the St. Paul centre, and we've investigated your situation about as much as we could possibly do.  It would have been easy for me, given the kind of testimony you have given here, to have brought up all these accusations against you, to make it look like you are some kind of a bad character, but, in fact, our investigation has shown that you are, in fact, not a person who did those things that you are accused of, and so we are not taking the position that you are, in fact, someone who participated in the genocide.  I want you to understand that.

Now, I also want to let -- tell you that it's part of our case that when you were questioned by the authorities in Rwanda that you told the truth, basically.
MR. WEBSTER:
This is -- I am objecting.  I really shouldn't have to say more than "I object", Your Honours.  I didn't hear a question in the last two minutes.  I heard a period somewhere, because there were several statements, but no question mark yet.  Mr. Robinson is in the habit of having -- requesting things to be stricken from the record.  I could see no more appropriate application than right now, to strike the last four or five sentences from the record, and that's the application I'm making.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I admit I'm winding up a very long question, but I am putting my case to the witness, and so, part of my case is that the witness is not a criminal and that we don't contend that he participated in the genocide.  That's part one of my question.  I'm ready to move on to part two.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You haven't asked a question yet.
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  I was interrupted in the middle of a very long question.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
But, seriously, Mr. President, how can it be a part of the counsel's case when the witness is not on trial before Your Honours?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, as I understand it, your case should be your case for the Defence -- your case on behalf of the Defence, as it relates to the charges against the Defence.  But how can your comment about his case be interpreted -- or, be designated as your case?

MR. ROBINSON:
Because I am directing myself to my case as to the credibility of this witness and the facts that this witness has -- had brought against Mr. Nzirorera, and my first point is that we don't believe, and it's not our case, that this witness was, himself, involved in wrongdoing.  I was just about to try to make --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Robinson, what is interesting me in that position, is that the witness's confession is on our record.
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I agree with the witness's confession.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it was interesting to me as to what your question was.  I would be interested in hearing the witness's response to what you are -- what you are saying.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I'll break up my question and make it shorter.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ALG, it's the position of the Defence that you did not engage in criminal acts in Rwanda during the war, and that we accept your confession in which you feel responsible for --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the point, you see.  At some stage you will have an opportunity to address us on those issues, but at the moment the witness is still giving evidence, so we are interested in his response.
MR. ROBINSON:
How can he give a response if you keep interrupting my question?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know.  But you're saying "I don't believe".  What you believe is irrelevant to us.
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm putting my case to him --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but it's too subjective.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, it's the case of the Defence that you did not participate in the atrocities in Rwanda in 1994 and it's also our --
MR. WEBSTER:
How is that any different from the last three attempts to ask the question?  The way Mr. Robinson moves into the question is what's flawing the procedure.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, please try again.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, what I'm trying to do here is to put on the record -- or, put to you the position concerning Mr. Nzirorera concerning the allegations that you've made in this trial.  I'm not doing a very good job of it, but I'm trying.  And the first part of it, what I would like to put to you is that it's the Defence case that you are not a participant in criminal acts during the genocide.  Do you have any comment to make to that part of our case?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question.  There's a simple way -- maybe, perhaps, the Court can ask the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I'm going to allow the question.  You see, it's of great interest.  This witness has been cross-examined at great length.  He has given evidence that he has made certain confessions.  He has not been cross-examined in detail on these issues, but it's an important issue for us -- for me.  I would be interested to know what the witness's answer to that question is.
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I understand, Your Honour, and I sympathise with the Court's position, and I can understand the logic of the question, but that's not what I'm hearing from the Defence.  Participation is a legal -- the way that we're discussing -- using the word "participation".  Now, it almost raises the level of a legal term of art, because we all know that there is affirmative acts and positive acts and culpable omissions, and for Mr. Robinson to suggest to the witness that it is his case -- or, the Defence case that he did not participate, there are presumptions in the very word "participate" that this witness, you know, may not appreciate.  So, that's what I am concerned with.  The issue can be probed with a simple question.  Mr. Robinson doesn't have to preface it by saying, "It is my position", or "It is the Defence position that", and so on and so forth.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, part of this is a historical problem, because I recall at an earlier stage in the proceedings where the Prosecution took the view that it was the duty of the Defence to put their case to the witnesses when they got here.  And Mr. Robertson, as far as I am seeing, is trying to respond to what has been stated as to one of the objections -- obligations that he has.  Now, it's a difficult issue.  It's an important issue for us as a trial Bench because, to some extent, it's going to assist us in determining how much reliability to place on this witness's testimony, and it would be of interest for me to know whether the witness accepts that he did not participate in any criminal activities during the genocide in Rwanda, or whether he is saying that he did participate.  It's a factual issue which the witness can answer.
MR. WEBSTER:
I agree, Your Honour, and that's not what I'm objecting to.  Putting one's case -- putting the Defence case to the witness is an obligation in the rules.  I'm not disputing that, but that's not what I get from Mr. Robinson's question.  Mr. Robinson's question, to me, is a bit of sleight of hand, and that's what I'm objecting to.  So, the witness should answer the question, but he should have a question; he shouldn't have an oration or a discourse by Mr. Robinson that tilts the issues a bit.  That's my only concern.  I would like to hear the witness's response, but I think a more appropriate way of dealing with it is by simply asking him, "What did you do that was" ...
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a question of style.  I mean, I think people are entitled to their own style.
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not -- with due respect, I do not see it as an issue of style.  It's not simply an issue of form.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, try again.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, it's the Defence case that during the events of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, try again.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, it's the case of Mr. Nzirorera that during the events of 1994 you did not commit any affirmative criminal acts; you didn't kill anyone; you didn't order that anyone be killed; you didn't desire that anyone be killed; and that you did the best you could under the circumstances.  Do you have any comment on that?  Do you agree or disagree with that?
A.	This is the sort of question, I'd call -- I would term an intentional question -- deliberate question.  In any case, I'm accused of quite a few things.  I'm waiting for the outcome of my trial.  I don't know, as yet, what the final decision would be.  What I think is, in my capacity as authority at the time, considering people were killed at the time -- I did go through the plea of innocence procedure and avowed guilt and confession -- I don't think I'm a hundred per cent innocent.  That is not my position.  But, please, Counsel, set that question aside.  You have been informed that there is a case file against me.  Leave that question aside.

I came here to testify and I have done so.  I didn't imagine that my case file -- or, my dossier would be referred to.  I don't know why you come back to it.  I don't know if there's any connection with your client's cases, but, in any case, everyone has his own case.  That's what I have to say.  Moreover, I said that I tried to speak the truth, the truth that I know.  That is the essential point.  And as to the rest of it, regarding my case, I'm sorry, I told you that when I came here, I didn't -- I wasn't -- I wasn't thinking about my own case, my trial.  I'm not thinking of it even today.  I'll think about that when I get home again in my own country.  So, if we speak of my case here, I don't think it will make things easier.
MR. ROBINSON:
Are we having any more translated?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, it's the Defence case that when you were questioned by the authorities in Rwanda after your arrest, from 1998 until************, that you essentially told the truth, as you believed it.  Do you have any comments on that?
A.	Counsel, what I'm telling you is that up until now I have been saying the truth.  It was not only at that period; up until now I'm saying the truth.
Q.	Witness ALG, it's the Defence case that for some six years, as you tried to tell the truth in Rwanda, it got you nothing but time in Kigali prison.  And that in April of 2004 --
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry; I am objecting to the way this question is starting out.  I don't understand why we proceed in this manner.  I respect the Court's authority and I understand that there are issues that the Court would like to probe, but this is not appropriate.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't know what the question is.  Mr. Robinson, we don't know what your question is yet, so we can't actually rule on it.  Criticism had been made, which I think is fair, is -- that you are making speeches.  So, could you come to your question?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, it's the position of the Defence that, after having languished in prison for six years, you came to Arusha in April of 2004, and you decided that it was in your interests to tell a different story.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry; I am still objecting.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, that's the problem.  You see, that's the sort of submission which I expect to hear at some later stage in the proceedings.
MR. ROBINSON:
That's an issue which, if I don't give any witness a chance to give an answer, you will criticise me for that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you are giving a speech.
MR. ROBINSON:
I am putting my case to him.  Doesn't that require some sort of affirmative assertion?  Maybe we should take the break so that people can be a little bit more relaxed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  The problem is this, right: I understand that you are trying to respond to what has been described as "an obligation".  I understand that that's the objective.  On the other hand, this is a witness, and there's a problem in putting matters to him in an argumentative manner where you're making a sort of a speech to him.  How does he respond to that?  So you are going to have to find a method of putting your case which is not argue -- in a manner which is not argumentative.  And that's the -- that's the point.  You are presenting arguments to him which, basically, in due course, you are going to have to present to us as an argument, as a submission, and I think that when you are putting the case to him that the methodology you are employing should be slightly different from that.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, I'll try my best.
MR. WEBSTER:
Can I make a final comment before we take the break because I would like us all to consider -- and I'm directly myself to, Mr. Robinson -- it is the text of Rule 90(G) sub (ii).  I don't think it's necessary for me to read it into the record.  We all have access to the rules, but the way Mr. Robinson understands putting his case to the witness, I don't think is reflected in the text of this rule.  The text of this rule concerns cross-examination of a witness when the cross-examiner is trying to impeach the witness, where the cross-examiner has a case that is different from the witness's evidence, that goes counter to the witness's evidence.  Mr. Robinson has started out by saying he agrees with the witness's evidence.  In that context, I don't see that how this -- what Mr. Robinson characterises as putting his case to the witness is appropriate.  So I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, that's not fair.  Mr. Robinson said that the witness told the truth within a certain time frame, and he has now come and put to him that that changed on a certain date, but he can put that to him without making a long speech.  So, that's what he is doing.

And we can take the adjournment now -- the recess.
(Court recessed from 1538H to 1604H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can continue now.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, it's a fact, is it not, that as of******************, despite your best efforts at telling the truth about what you had done and in confessing to the Rwandan authorities, you remained in prison; correct? 
A.	Yes, I was still detained, but I thank the Good Lord because I was provisionally released.
Q.	And while you were still detained in April of 2004, you were brought to Arusha with another man, Witness (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover); correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the -- as far as I'm aware, the protection orders would prevent each witness from knowing pseudonyms of other witnesses.
MR. ROBINSON:
That may be, but I think that this witness knows the pseudonym of Witness (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, well - but, anyway, we are in the trial process right now and I don't think it's appropriate.
MR. ROBINSON:
Then would you like me to give the name of Witness (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you see, if you had not already given the pseudonym, that would have been appropriate because there would be no link with that witness, with the pseudonym.
MR. ROBINSON:
Except that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's -- the problem is that I don't know how to manage that problem at the moment.
MR. ROBINSON:
By virtue of the fact that the witness -- that the person was here in Arusha with the witness to give testimony, I think if I had mentioned his name would not have been a good idea.  So, I believe from the witness's previous answers that he knows the individual who was designated as Witness (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), so without us revealing any information to this witness, I think we can discuss it along those lines, but if it becomes a problem, then perhaps we can deal with it.
MR. WEBSTER:
To me, the solution is simply going into closed session and then Mr. Robinson use whatever designation he prefers, but ...

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I know the Prosecutor likes to go into closed session at every opportunity, but I think this can be done in public.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think that the solution to the problem is to redact the name from the record and to ask you to put the name on a bit of paper which can be admitted in the testimony.  So, we can continue the cross-examination without the use of names and without going into closed session.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we make the order for redaction now.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.

I've written the name on a piece of paper.  I'd ask that it be shown to the witness and marked as an Exhibit D. NZ190, under seal.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, were you with the individual whose name has been written on the piece of paper before you, in April and May 2004, here in Arusha at the UNDF?
A.	Yes, I remember that I was with this person, but each had his own cell, so we did not share a cell.
Q.	But you were able to communicate freely, other than the evening when you were locked in your cell; correct?
A.	Yes, we would talk in a general way.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the document which is before the witness be marked as exhibit -- and admitted as an exhibit D. NZ190 under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ190 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness ALG, isn't it a fact that the only mentions we can find in your writings and statements of the meeting of Mr. Nzirorera in the end of April 1994 and the meeting at the Diplomat hotel on the 10th or 11th of April are in documents which you prepared or statements which you made after you arrived in Arusha in April of 2004?
A.	Unless you refresh my memory, but I know that it wasn't the only occasion on which I spoke of Nzirorera.  I think I have spoken of him on other occasions.
Q.	But the first time in which you mentioned seeing Mr. Nzirorera at a meeting at the Kigali préfecture in April 1994 was in the letter that you prepared in May of 2004, after you had arrived here in Arusha, and then it appears subsequently in other statements that you made.  But the very first mention of this meeting was not until after you had arrived in Arusha with the gentleman on Exhibit D. NZ190; correct?
A.	Counsel, perhaps it is at that time I began to speak of him, but I think even before, a while back, I don't know whether it was this morning, you'd said that I had mentioned in a document that the national secretary of the party should be held responsible for the genocide that occurred in Rwanda.  As you know, Nzirorera was the secretary general of the MRND.  So, you see, it isn't from that time I began to speak of him.  The fact that I didn't mention his name when I mentioned the secretary general of the party in no way whitewashes him.  On the 21st of February 2000, I made a statement in which I spoke of Nzirorera.
Q.	Witness, I suggest you're in error, that, in fact, the statement that you just referred to was the annex of your confession in ******************but, in any event, it's true, is it not, that you made no mention of seeing Mr. Nzirorera in Kigali until May 2004?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that you --
A.	Counsel, remember what we were looking at this morning.  It was specified therein that among the people who had planned the genocide there was the national secretary of the MRND.  You asked me to confirm it, and I did so.  And I confirm that Nzirorera was secretary general of the party.  So, you see, it wasn't in May 2004 that I implicated him.  I did that -- I implicated him long before that date.
Q.	Witness ALG, I think you are more intelligent than this.  You know what I'm asking you.  And my question is: did you -- isn't it a fact that you made no mention of seeing Mr. Nzirorera in Kigali until your statement of May 2004; correct?
A.	Maybe I didn't say it before that date, but it doesn't mean that I didn't see him.  The fact that I didn't write it down doesn't mean that I didn't see him, and he, himself, knows it.  He knows that I saw him and he saw me.
Q.	And, Witness, isn't it a fact that it wasn't until May 2004 that you first mentioned the meeting at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 10th and 11th of April to which you've testified; correct?
A.	I don't remember very well.  That is possible.  But, again, it doesn't mean that I didn't know anything about that meeting.
Q.	Well, the Trial Chamber has all of these statements now in evidence and they'll evaluate what appears in those statements and you will understand your position that simply because something isn't in the statement didn't mean it didn't happen, and it's our position that those -- the fact that you didn't mention those until May 2004 is significant as it relates to your credibility.  Now, it's the case of Mr. Nzirorera that those two events -- the meeting of the 10th and 11th at the Diplomat and the meeting at the end of April in the PVK -- did not occur and are inventions of the man whose name is on Exhibit D. NZ190, and that you, having found yourself six years in prison, decided that it was in your best interests to do as that gentleman was doing and to charge people in Arusha with acts, so that you, yourself, could finally obtain the freedom that you so desperately wanted.  Would you like to comment on that?
A.	That only commits you, Counsel.  I'm of a different opinion.
Q.	But it's true, is it not, that after having charged Mr. Nzirorera and the other Accused, that you did, in fact, get provisionally released in***********; correct?
A.	Counsel, I don't know if that is the reason for my provisional release.  I don't even know if the people who released me are aware of the fact that I testified against those people.  They might have their own reasons for having released me.  I think that -- I don't know on what they grounded their decision, but I don't think the case against the Accused is present in my case file.  At least, that is not my opinion; that is your own opinion, and you have the right to see things thus, but I do not subscribe to that.  I do not agree with your opinion.
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that there's another person charged in your same case file, a conseiller; correct?
A.	Before which jurisdiction, Counsel?
Q.	I'm talking about the individual who appears with you in court when you go to court in Kigali.  There's another individual.  There are four people charged in your case and there's another person who you go to court with, right, a conseiller?
A.	You're saying that we appeared at the same time together?  No, I do not know that person.  Such a thing did not occur.  I don't even know which court you are referring to.
Q.	Well, Witness ALG, I'm trying to do this in a way that doesn't lead to the disclosure of your identity.  I think the best thing for me to do is to write down the name of the conseiller who appears in your case file with you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the registrar collect this piece of paper from me and place it before the witness after showing it to the parties?
THE WITNESS:
I have seen the person in question.  I've seen the name.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And that's the name of a person who is charged in the same dossier as you; correct?
A.	Yes.  He is my co-accused.
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, may the piece of paper bearing the name of the witness's co-accused be admitted as D. NZ191, under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ191 admitted, under seal)

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And that person, your co-accused,**************************************************************; correct?
A.	Yes, I acknowledge that.
Q.	And that person, your co-accused, was, in fact, relieved of his duties at the end of April 1994; correct?
A.	You are right.
Q.	And you continued to perform your duties all the way until the 3rd of July 1994; correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that your co-accused has spent the entire time awaiting his trial in prison, including to this day, while you have been provisionally released?
A.	Yes, I was provisionally released, Counsel, but you must also acknowledge that I have not yet been tried.  We are co-accused and I, too, am awaiting my trial.
Q.	And you are awaiting your trial in freedom and he is awaiting his trial in prison; correct?
A.	Yes, that's the case.
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG.  I have no further questions for you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.

Now, Witness, you have not finished your testimony as yet, because under the rules, the Prosecutor has an opportunity to ask you some further questions that are related to your cross-examination in some way or the other.  So, I now have to ask the Prosecutor if they have any further questions to put to you.

Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Just a few, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, you may proceed.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness ALG.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	There are just a few matters following on your cross-examination that I will invite you to clarify for the Chamber.  When you were cross-examined by Counsel Weyl you said you stand by your statement; it was difficult to make a distinction between Interahamwe and bandits; the situation was anarchic.  Do you recall that?
A.	That was a fact that was difficult to make a distinction between Interahamwe and bandits and, in reality, that was the truth, but you, yourself, have understood that it was the viewpoint of UNAMIR.
Q.	Yes, Witness, but I haven't asked you the question yet.  The question is this: in view of the evidence that you have given regarding the organisation, the training, the arming of the Interahamwe and their cooperation with soldiers in executing the massacres against the Tutsi, please explain what you mean when you say the situation was anarchic.
A.	I say so because I noticed that there was no power which could make it in such a way that there was no disorder, on account of this situation, when you consider the way Interahamwe were massacring people.  When I went to meet them, I could not reason with them.  They did not have any respect for any official when an official gave them orders.  Usually when an official gives orders, the orders are implemented but, unfortunately, from what I observed such was not the case.  That is what makes me say that it was a chaotic situation.  When you realise that those who were riding roughshod are the bandits indulging in lootings, the justice system was broken down completely, you realise that the word for the situation is "chaos".  There is total impunity.  So, Madam Prosecutor, that is how I can explain the situation in a nutshell.
Q.	Thank you.  When you speak of their not responding to officials, are you speaking of communal officials?
A.	That is what I meant, actually.
Q.	Was the communal official the person who was exercising authority and control over Interahamwe and soldiers committing massacres?
A.	Counsel, I had explained it when I said that those officials did not have any authority over the Interahamwe; all the more so because they were not their line superiors.  They did not control them.
Q.	I'm not meaning to put too much pressure on you, Witness, but insofar as some of what you've said is not clear, this is why we are going through this exercise, so, please, bear with me.  You also said that order had broken down.  Whose responsibility was it to maintain law and order?
A.	Actually, all the organs of power have responsibility for maintaining order and security amongst members of the public, from the president of the republic up to the lowest level; that is, the 10-household head called nyumba kumi.  All those people are responsible for maintaining peace, order and security for the people under their control.
Q.	Thank you.  You said in the capacity in which you were functioning you did not have the means to stop the killings.  Who had the means to stop the killings, from your perception of what was taking place?
A.	Counsel, let me complete the previous answer before I handle this question.  I had forgotten another category of people who were responsible for security.  That category comprises gendarmes and soldiers.  I had forgotten that category of people.  You should also mention policemen.

Now, it is not the first time that you were asking me this question.  Recently, you asked me such a question, and my answer is the same; actually, the officials of the country as well as top military commanders.  What I mean is that if they had wanted to, given that those officials hailed from various parties, which parties had as members those perpetrating those killings, what I'm going to say is that if all those people had worked together to enable the justice system to operate, then they would have made it possible for delinquents and criminals to be arrested.  They would have stopped the publishing of newspapers, producing inflammatory messages; they would have closed down those radio stations broadcasting inflammatory messages.  I think things would have turned out for the better.  Last time I dwelt on the length on this.  Here, I'm merely summarising.
Q.	Thank you.  You also confirmed for Counsel Weyl, when he read from your statement of the 
	6th of May 2004, that the authorities of the regime in place at all levels did not protect and provide security for the entire population.  Do you remember that?
A.	The statement was dated in 2000, or was it 2004?  I believe, Counsel, that it was actually May, 2004.
Q.	It must have been a mistranslation; I did say "2004".  Witness, you are correct.  My question then is this: did you observe any attempt to provide security for the entire population, or was the effort directed against security and protection of some members of the Rwandan population?
A.	Counsel, I think this is a question you have already asked me several times.  More particularly, efforts were made to ensure the safety for a different category.  Regarding the others, one could even think that they were not part and parcel of the population.  I'm referring to the Tutsi here.  So, concerning the security of the Tutsi, it was seriously undermined, and overtly so.  They were killed.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  It takes me to another point in your evidence where you've said that, instead of providing security for the population, the government took it out on part of the population.  What did the government take out and on what part of the population?
A.	I was referring to that category of people I just mentioned, ma'am.  I'm sorry; you see, Defence counsel was putting me questions earlier on and I am still answering as if it was Defence counsel.  Well, regarding the others, I was referring to the category of people whose security was not protected; that is, the Tutsi.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We are almost finished, and I know you don't mean to mistake me for Defence counsel.  You spoke of members of the MRND decamping after the alliance was formed with the CDR.  Who are the persons who decamped at that time?
A.	Specifically, I know there were Tutsi MRND members.  They are the ones who left.
Q.	On a different note: when you were questioned by Counsel Robinson in relation your efforts to dismantle roadblocks, you said, "We did everything to stop killings, but we failed".  Who is "we"? 
A.	Perhaps that question concerned me, personally, and I may have answered using the pronoun "we".  Perhaps I ought to have said "I tried", instead of saying, "we tried".  You see, that question was referred to me, myself.  So you need to understand is that I personally tried to no avail, unfortunately.

     1645H
BY MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Q.	This takes me now to the directives or instructions from the prime minister that you were shown this morning, Witness; do you remember that document? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	For tidiness of the record, let me state instructions for restoring security.  Now, you said in your answer to Counsel Robinson, it might be possible or easy to provide instructions than not take the appropriate measures for them to be implemented.  Did the government take the appropriate measures for the implementation of these instructions? 
A.	As a matter of fact there were measures written down in the document by the minister of the interior, concerning the modalities for implementing the prime ministerial instructions; however, they were not translated into reality.  Let me give an example: It was said that killers and criminal had to be taken before the law courts, whereas people new full well that the law courts were not operating.  That is one example.  They observed that the law courts did not do anything.  I am not aware of what was going on in the other préfectures, but regarding the Kigali préfecture I said those services never operated.  That is one of the examples I can mention.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness ALG.  I have no further questions for you.  Have a good evening.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, that concludes the re-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor.  

Now, Mr. Witness, that winds up your testimony here before us completely.  You have now completed giving evidence.  The Judges don't have any questions to ask of you.  We thank you for coming to Arusha to testify before the Tribunal and we note that you are excused and you can return home.  

Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President, sir. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Robinson were you trying to attract our attention? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I just wanted to note for the record that the witness provided a list of many cases in which he has given statements and some cases in which he has given testimony, and Exhibit D. NZ187 and 188.  And it is our intention to follow up with the Rwandan authorities, now that we have that information, and to see if we could obtain those statements, and if we do, and they seem to be important, it may be that we would ask you to allow the witness to return.   I did not want him to leave without mentioning that.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Your comments are noted.  

Mr. Webster, where are we now?  What's our next witness?  And I would like you to give me an indication.  I gather that -- I know that all counsel have discussed the duration of their examination.  And what is the estimated length of the next witness's testimony?  When do you -- according to present information, when does this witness conclude?  
MR. WEBSTER:
The estimation is the same, Your Honour, a day and a half.  I am going to make every effort to complete his testimony in one full day, but I would rather stay with my estimations so I do not cut myself short, but I will make every effort to complete his direct examination in a full day.  

I will be handling that witness.  I would prefer to start tomorrow morning and get a fresh start.  So, I'm asking the Court to allow me to call the witness in the morning.  What I'd like to do at this point is to invite the Defence to comment on the e-mail that was circulated earlier this morning.  I had sent some exhibits and given some indication of the scope of the witness's testimony with the exhibits, in any case, and I'm used to starting a witness's testimony with a lot of discussion of disclosure issues, and, perhaps, if we could do all of those things this afternoon, then, we would get a fresh start with the witness's testimony first thing in the morning.  

So, that's my request.  But I would think a day, a day and a half. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you got any indication of how long the cross-examination is likely to be?  
MR. WEBSTER:
There was some communication from the Defence, but I'd rather they reaffirm their own information.  I know it is much longer than expected. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought the level of cooperation had reached high enough for you to take the chance of -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Inaudible) Quite frankly, I don't recall what it is.  I had it written down, but I don't have it in front of me now.  I think Mr. Robinson had said he wanted two or three days, and others had said a day or two each.  So, we're looking at at least four -- five or six days of cross-examination if my memory -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So if this witness starts giving testimony tomorrow morning, when would the witness -- when would we expect the next witness to start to give testimony?  
MR. WEBSTER:
By my estimate, I do not know.  I think we should - Thursday, or Wednesday?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you want -- you want me now to manage the duration, because I can, you know. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I would prefer that, quite frankly.  That was the subject of my motion to the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may get what you wish.  All right.  

Yes, on the Defence side, can we have an indication of the duration of the cross-examination of the next witness? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, if the next witness is the one we have been informed of, that is, Witness HH, then for now we still stay within the same time estimate given, that the Prosecutor has not changed his time estimate.  So, as of now we are within the two-day cross-examination.  

Now, regarding another witness to be called after HH, it would depend on the indication given us by Mr. Webster about who will be the next witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you aware of what your colleagues have entered in terms of duration of cross-examination?  For example, do we expect that if the witness starts giving cross-examination tomorrow morning that we will be able to start the next witness on Thursday morning?  Is that something that we can reasonably consider as a probability -- reasonable probability?
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, what would be the best would be to ask my colleagues about what their provisional cross-examination duration would be.  Unfortunately, I am unable to answer your question now with regard to the trend in the estimates. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, dear.  

You see, I was criticising Mr. Webster for not knowing what you all were going to do.  Now, I have to ask each person individually.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. President -- 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, my estimate ranges from one to two days.  So, it may be one and a half days.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, you are increasing your estimate. 

I have a document which had initially indicated one day. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I must say that as I familiarise myself more with the documents, and I have also taken into account the fact that the Prosecutor had disclosed a series of documents, and, contrary to the first witness, he intends to stick with his time estimates, then, I believe that with the Prosecutor's examination in-chief we may have to reassess, but here and now it is difficult to have a given estimate which will be exact.  We're just making a simulation.  But as you know, usually, for my cross-examination, regarding the witness who just completed his evidence, it was between one day and one day and a half.  So, it is taking into account that fact that I am of the opinion that the most reasonable estimate would be one day and a half. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, there is something I would like to add.  Taking into account the length of -- list of names to spell, which we can avoid spelling, we also are faced with all uncertainties regarding slippages which may occur in the examination-in-chief, and also slippages which may occur in the cross-examination, because the list which Mr. Webster disclosed to us is really humongous, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will adjourn now.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, for our part, I will make every effort to be as direct in the direct examination as possible and to conclude as quickly as possible.  So, we are all making efforts to handle this expeditiously, and in the interests of that I would like the Court to raise the issues of whether there are disclosure issues that are going to pop up when the witness takes the stand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's something that I don't think is necessary in open court.  

Don't you all speak to each other?  Come on.  Now, I -- I don't think either -- you know, that is not something, I think, that I want to do in trial time.  I expect that is an issue that should be resolved.  It is a simple administrative issue.  There is nothing technical about it.  Just general civility among counsel should solve that problem.  I don't want to manage it in open court.  

We're going to take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1703H)
