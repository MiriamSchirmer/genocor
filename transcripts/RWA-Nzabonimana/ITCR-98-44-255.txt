P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday the 17th of February (sic) 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, I note that neither the Accused Nzirorera nor his counsel are present.  Do you have anything to report?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, yesterday, Mr. Peter Robinson told me that Mr. Nzirorera will be giving testimony in another case in Trial Chamber I, and that if today he will available, he will let me know, but I have not had any information from him yet.  But I just see that Mr. Peter Robinson has just entered the courtroom, so maybe he has some responses for the Chamber.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we just noticed your absence and we enquired from the registrar if he had anything to report. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, good morning, Mr. President.  I'm sorry for being late.  Mr. Nzirorera just completed his testimony in the Bagosora case, and they'll be bringing him into this courtroom as soon as soon as WVSS can get him down here.  It should be momentarily.  And I'd ask that we not commence until he is can be present. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Rapp.  
MR. RAPP:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Just a housekeeping matter:  I was asked to come to discuss the ADE security situation, and that security situation, for discussion, does require essentially revealing his identity because one begins to talk about his whereabouts, and under those circumstances, at least for that part of this status conference, we would ask that it be in closed session, if the whole status conference is not in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  Perhaps at this stage, in that case, we better start off by taking appearances.  
Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning Your Honour, good morning to the parties and to the registry.  The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, Iain Morley, Gregory Lombardi, Gilles Lahaie.  The record should also reflect the presence of our Chief of Prosecutions, Steven Rapp, and our crime analyst, Massamba Ndiaye.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  For the Defence.  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, everybody.  Moussa Felix Sow, co-counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning everyone.  Chantal Hounkpatin, lead counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, with Mr. Frédéric Weyl, co-counsel, and Ms. Anta Guissé, my assistant.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning again, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  Peter Robinson for Joseph Nzirorera, who is not yet present.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we are going to start with the ADE matter, and we have agreed that we should go into closed session to discuss the arrangements for his testimony.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 43] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
