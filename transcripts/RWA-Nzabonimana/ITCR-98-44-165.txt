MR. FRY:
Decision on Defence Motions Challenging the Indictment as Regards the Joint Criminal Enterprise Liability.

The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, "the Tribunal," sitting as Trial Chamber III, composed of Judges Dennis C. M. Byron, presiding; Emile Francis Short; and Gberdao Gustave Kam, "the Chamber," being seized of Joseph Nzirorera's preliminary motions on the form of the indictment and on jurisdiction, both challenging the joint criminal enterprise liability, and Édouard Karemera's preliminary motions challenging the same; considering the Prosecution's responses and its further submissions filed on 26 August 2005.  

Footnote 1:  For those motions and responses, see Karemera et al decision on Defence motion, challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, joint criminal enterprise, Karemera et al decision on defects in the form of the indictment, both dated 5 August 2005.  

Recalling the decisions of 5 August 2005 in which the Chamber postponed its deliberation on two issues, namely, one, the pleading of the extended form of joint criminal enterprise in relation to the charge of rape in Count 5, when the indictment does not include any specific acts of rape; and, two, the pleading of joint criminal enterprise in relation to complicity in genocide in Count 4.  

Footnote 2:  See Karemera et al decision on Defence motion challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, joint criminal enterprise, paragraphs 9 to 12, and decision on defects in the form of the indictment, paragraphs 46 to 47. 

Considering the oral arguments presented by the parties at the hearing of 5 September 2005. 

Footnote 3:  T. 5 September 2005.  

Decides as follows, pursuant to Rules 72 and 73(A) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, "the rules," on the basis of the written and oral arguments submitted by the parties.  

Introduction:  One, the trial of the Accused in this case is set to begin on 19 September 2005.  On 5 August 2005, the Chamber decided the preliminary motions filed by the Accused challenging the amended indictment of 23 February 2005 on defects in the form of the amended indictment and on the use of the joint criminal enterprise as a form of liability.  The Chamber reserved its decision on two issues that were raised in the motions and filed a scheduling order to receive further submissions and hear oral arguments on the issues.  

Footnote 5:  Karemera et al scheduling order, oral arguments on rape, complicity in genocide, and the pleading of a joint criminal enterprise in the amended indictment, 8 August 2005.  

At the first pre-trial hearing on 29 August 2005, the Defence for Karemera brought to the Chamber's attention that his preliminary motion, which included arguments contesting the pleading of joint criminal enterprise in the amended indictment, was not fully treated by the Chamber's prior decisions.  

Footnote 6:  T. 29 August 2005.  

The Chamber heard oral arguments on 5 September 2005 on the questions presented in the scheduling order and invited the Defence for Karemera to make its additional submissions on the issue of joint criminal enterprise.

Footnote 7:  T. 5 September 2005.  

Paragraph 2:  The amended indictment of 23 February 2005 provides in paragraph 4, quote, "'committing' in this indictment also refers to participation in a joint criminal enterprise as a co-perpetrator," unquote.  

The relevant counts in the amended indictment are as follows:  "Count 4, complicity in genocide.  The Prosecutor charges Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and Joseph Nzirorera with complicity in genocide pursuant to Articles 2 and 6(1) of the Statute of the Tribunal in that, during the period of 
1 January to 17 July 1994, all named accused instigated or provided the means to other persons to kill or cause serious bodily or mental harm to members of the Tutsi population or to deliberately inflict conditions of life upon the Tutsi population that were calculated to bring about its physical destruction, knowing that those other persons intended to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi racial or ethnic group, committed as follows:" 

"Count 5, rape as a crime against humanity.  The Prosecutor charges Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and Joseph Nzirorera with rape as a crime against humanity pursuant to Articles 3, 6(1) and 6(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal in that, on or between the dates of 6 April and 
17 July 1994, throughout the territory of Rwanda, all named Accused were responsible for raping persons or causing persons to be raped, as part of a widespread, systematic attack against a civilian population on political, ethnic, or racial grounds, committed as follows:" 

Discussion:  Pleading of the extended form of joint criminal enterprise in Count 5 of the amended indictment, rape as a crime against humanity.  

Paragraph 3:  The Accused, Joseph Nzirorera, requests that Count 5 of the amended indictment of 
24 August 2005 be dismissed because, (a), the third form of joint criminal enterprise, the extended form in relation to sexual offenses, was not part of customary international law in 1994; (b), applying the extended form of joint criminal enterprise to rape creates a form of strict liability; and, (c), because of defects in the pleadings.  The other Accused support such arguments.  

Footnote 8:  T. 5 September 2005, pages 7 through 11.  

Paragraph 4:  In the Tadic judgement, when it was recognised that joint criminal enterprise as a form of liability is a form of commission well established under customary international law, the appeals chamber also held that there are three different forms without limiting its application to any particular crime.  The Defence is not, therefore, correct in arguing that the third form of joint criminal enterprise, in relation to crimes of a sexual nature, was not established under customary international law.  Consequently, the first part of the argument related to Count 5, paragraph 3(a) above, falls to be dismissed.

      1700H 
MR. FRY (continuing): 
Paragraph 5:  The Chamber recalls that Count 5 does not charge the Accused with having personally committed any specific rape.  Under Article 6(1) of the Statute of the Tribunal, the Statute, Count 5 rather charges the Accused with being part of a joint criminal enterprise in which rape was a natural and foreseeable consequence of its object.  Following the jurisprudence, the pleading of a joint criminal enterprise has to mention (i) a plurality of persons, (ii) the existence of a common plan that amounts to or involves the commission of a crime provided in the Statute, and (iii) the participation of the Accused in the common plan involving the perpetration of one of the crimes provided for in the Statute.  

Footnote 9: See ICTY, Prosecutor v. Mitar Rasevic, Case No. IT 97 25/1 PT, decision regarding Defence preliminary motion on the form of the indictment (TC), 28 April 2004, paragraphs 14 and 15.  

Paragraph 6:  On the argument related to strict liability, the Chamber is not convinced that there is any automatic conclusion that there are genocides, that in all genocides rape is a natural and foreseeable consequence.  The Chamber considers that the Prosecution has the burden to prove in that regard, and the Chamber will have to determine whether there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of such a conclusion.  Therefore, this argument, paragraph 3(b) above, also falls to be dismissed.  

7:  In the present indictment, the Chamber highlights that the Accused are charged with rape only on the basis that such a crime was a natural and foreseeable consequence of their common plan to destroy Tutsi throughout Rwanda.  The Chamber recalls that in the Blaskic appeals judgements --   judgment it was stated, in relation to pleading of criminal enterprise liability, that, "the precise details to be pleaded as material facts are the acts of the persons, not the acts of those persons he is alleged to be responsible for.  

Footnote 10:  See ICTY, Prosecutor v. Tihomir Blaskic, Case No. IT 95 14 A, Judgment (AC), 
29 July 2004, paragraph 210.  

Subsequently, the particulars of the acts of rape in Count 5 are not material facts which must be pleaded in the indictment, and the challenge based on defects in the form, paragraph 3(c), cannot therefore succeed.  But the Chamber is of the view that such particulars are important for the preparation of the defence of the Accused.  It is therefore sufficient, in the view of the Chamber, that those particulars are disclosed to the Accused in a manner which does not prejudice their preparation.  The Chamber notes that details of the acts of rape were disclosed to the Accused through the 143 witness statements and the pre-trial brief.  
11.  The witness's statements were filed on 5 July 2005, with a supplemental filing on 29 July 2005.  The pre-trial brief was filed 27 June 2005.  

Pleading of joint criminal enterprise liability in a crime of complicity to commit genocide (Count 4):  

Paragraph 8:  The Accused, Joseph Nzirorera, and the other Accused argue that (a) complicity in genocide is a form of liability and, as such, cannot be committed through joint criminal enterprise since the latter is also a form of accomplice liability.  

Footnote 12 T. 5 September 2005, page 11; and, (b) the third form of joint criminal enterprise applies to a situation where there is an escalation between the object of the common plan and its natural and foreseeable consequence, the Defence being of the view that this is not the case in the present indictment.  

Footnote 13 T. 5 September 2005, page 12: "People who agree to genocide, it's foreseeable that another crime, rape, could be committed.  In this instance, the foreseeable crime, intended crime, is genocide and the unintended but foreseeable crime, is complicity.  And it's our position that it's impossible to intend genocide and be liable for complicity as an unintended but foreseeable crime.  If the object of the joint criminal enterprise is genocide, any member who provides acts of assistance is within the scope of that intended crime and, therefore, is doing something that is not an unintended but foreseeable crime, but doing something within the crime intended by the joint criminal enterprise, which is genocide.  And, therefore, under those circumstances, if that were proven, the person would be guilty of genocide itself under the basic form of joint criminal enterprise."  

In his oral reply to the Prosecution arguments, Defence counsel for Joseph Nzirorera has incidentally requested that the submission of the authorities by the Prosecution should be excluded because it was not served on him in due time.  

Paragraph 9:  The Chamber notes that the Blagojevic judgment referred to in the Defence submissions is not pertinent to the present case because it is related to the pleading of command responsibility under Article 6(3) of the Statute, and the Chamber does not find it relevant to this case.  The Chamber also considers that the filing on 2 September 2005 by the Prosecution of the authorities supporting its further submissions, does not introduce any substantial argument, nor does it prejudice any of the Accused.  The Defence request to exclude such filing is furthermore without legal basis because there is no Rule 27(D) in the Rules.  

Footnote 14:  T. 5 September 2005, page 37:  "First of all, I didn't receive the table of authorities that was referred to, and it was filed in violation of Rule 7(D), which requires that anything filed in support of the hearing an oral hearing, be filed 10 days before the hearing."  

This incidental request therefore falls to be dismissed.  

Paragraph 10:  Finally, the Chamber is of the view that the challenge to the application of joint criminal enterprise liability, to complicity in genocide, is premature because this count is an alternative to the count on genocide.  In the event that the count of genocide is proved, the issue will become moot.  The Chamber therefore reserves its deliberation on the matter.  

For the above-mentioned reasons, the Chamber denies the motion in the entirety of their challenge of Counts 4 and 5, and reserves the deliberation of the application of joint criminal enterprise to complicity in genocide.

The Prosecutor v. Karamera, Case No. ICTR-98-44-PT. Decision on the continuance of trial, 
Articles 19 and 20 of the Statute.  The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Tribunal, sitting as Trial Chamber III composed of Judges Byron, presiding, Short and Kam, the Chamber.  

Being seized of motion for continuance of trial, filed by the Defence for Nzirorera on 14 July 2005, the motion, and Mathieu Ngirumpatse's joinder, filed on 8 August 2005, the joinder; 

Considering the Prosecution's response to the motion filed on 27 July 2005, first response, Joseph Nzirorera's reply thereto, filed on July 2005, the Prosecution's response to the joinder, the second response, filed on 16 August 2005, and Joseph Nzirorera's supplemental filing in support of motion for continuance of trial, filed on 23 August 2005; 

Considering the Prosecution's response to the motion filed on 27 July 2005,  first response; the Defence for Nzirorera, Defence for Karamera and Defence for Ngirumpatse and by the Prosecution on 5 September 2005 decides as follows pursuant to Rule 73(A) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, the rules.  

Introduction: The present trial is scheduled to begin during the course of September 2005.  In the instant motion, the Defence for Nzirorera, joined by the Defence for Karemera and Ngirumpatse, argues that its right to adequate time and facilities for its preparation of trial as expressed in 

Article 20(4)(b) of the Statute will be violated if the trial continues as scheduled.  It requests that the Chamber order the postponement of the trial for an unspecified period of time due to the following reasons:  (a) The indictment against the Accused is not yet settled since the Chamber still has to deliver its rulings on decisions regarding the indictment; (b) The Prosecution only recently revealed its intention to rely on the evidence of 143 witnesses who are victims of sexual assault; (c) disclosure under Rule 66(A)(ii) and 68 of the rules remains incomplete; (d) Nzirorera's investigator was unable to complete his investigations in Rwanda and the lead counsel is therefore not in a position to cross-examine some of the Prosecution witnesses scheduled to testify in the first trial session; (e) The Chamber should first rule on all the pending motions before starting the trial.

Paragraph 2:  While the Prosecution initially opposed any postponement of the trial, it expresses, both in written and during presentation of its oral arguments, concerns about the ability to start the trial on 12 September 2005, as scheduled, for the moment.  As a preliminary matter, the Prosecution claims that the Accused have been charged with rape and sexual assault in the amended indictment and that it has satisfied the notice requirement for disclosure on this issue.  It contends that it disclosed all the documents in its possession in compliance with its obligations under the rules.  In addition, concerning the rape witnesses, it claims that the Defence will have sufficient time to prepare itself since these witnesses are scheduled to be called at the end of the Prosecution's case, at least seven months from now.  Should the Chamber accept the Defence submissions on insufficiency of pleadings in the amended indictment or completion of disclosure requirements under Rule 66 of the Rules, the Prosecution suggests that the interests of justice weigh in favour of according the Defence additional time to prepare their case. The Prosecution also shares the concerns expressed by the Defence on the uncertainty of the final version of the amended Indictment and the outstanding motions before the Chamber.  It furthermore emphasises the necessity for the Chamber to deliver its decision on the special protective measures requested for two Prosecution witnesses and the practical impact that such measures could have on the organisation of the trial.  It adds that it was not received - that it has not received reasonable assurances from the Witness and Victim Support Section, WVSS, that the witnesses for the first trial session will arrive in sufficient time to ensure adequate preparation. 

Finally, the possibility that the Rwamakuba trial may continue beyond its scheduled time could also interfere with the start of this trial.  It suggests that the Chamber should take into account the resolution of these technical impediments in determining the commencement date of  trial.

Discussion:  Pursuant to Article 19(1) of the Tribunal's Statute, Statute, the Chamber must ensure that a trial is fair and expeditious while respecting the rights of the Accused.  In a decision concerning the preparation and presentation of the Defence case, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found that the Trial Chamber must "balance the need for the accused to have adequate time for the preparation of his case and the need for an expeditious trial." 

Footnote 1: The Prosecutor v. Slobodan Milosevic, Case No. IT-02-54-AP73, decision on interlocutory appeal by the amici curiae against the trial chamber order concerning the presentation and preparation of the defence case (AC), 20 January 2004, paragraph 8."

In arriving at its decision regarding the scheduling of trial, the Chamber must consider all the relevant factors, appropriate concerns, and then use its discretion.

Footnote 2: Idem paragraph 16 through 17:  In this regard, the Chamber must decide whether the Accused are disadvantaged when presenting their case.

Footnote 3:  The Prosecutor v. Mladen Naletilic and Vinko Martinovic, Case No. IT-98-34-PT, decision on the Accused Naletilic's motion to continue trial date, (TC), 31 August 2001, paragraph 7.

Paragraph 4:  In the present case, both the Defence and the Prosecution claim that the content of the applicable indictment is still uncertain.  Since then, in its decisions on the various motions filed by the Defence both under Rules 72 and 73 of the Rules, the Chamber has ruled on the proposed amended indictment filed by the Prosecution and on its compliance with the Chamber's order.  This matter is therefore now settled and should not impede the commencement of the trial at the earliest date.

Paragraph 5:  The Defence claims that it had no prior notice of the Prosecution's intention to call or rely on 143 victims of sexual assault as witnesses. To prepare a coherent defence, it would have to review all the documents and conduct investigations before the beginning of the trial.  The Defence furthermore contends that such investigations must be conducted by properly trained personnel in such a sensitive matter. 

Paragraph 6:  The Chamber is of the view that the amended indictment of 24 August 2005 gives sufficient notice of the Prosecution's intention to rely on rape as a natural and foreseeable consequence of the object of the alleged joint criminal enterprise of the Accused to destroy the Tutsi as a group. The Prosecution's theory of its case was also explained in its pre-trial brief.  The Defence has had adequate information to prepare its defence plan.  In addition, the Prosecution has indicated that none of the witnesses testifying to rape and sexual violence are scheduled to appear in court for the first trial session.  As a result, the Defence will have more time throughout the progress of the case for its investigators to proceed as they would with any other witness called by the Prosecution.  While the Chamber appreciates the Defence's approach to get a trained investigator in sexual assault, this is a matter that should be addressed with the Defence counsel management section, DCDMS, and does not justify a delay in the commencement of the trial.

Paragraph 7:  The Defence contends that the Prosecution has not complied with its disclosure obligations pursuant to Rules 66 and 68 of the Rules.  Specifically, in the Defence's view, the Prosecution has failed to disclose the testimonies in prior trials and Rwandan judicial proceedings of the 143 rape witnesses, that it has failed to disclose all the Rwandan statements concerning the factual Prosecution witnesses including Witness HH, that it has not complied with Rule 68 obligations, and it has failed to disclose the expert reports.

Paragraph 8:  The Chamber notes that most of the contentious disclosure issues have been addressed by the recent Chamber decisions.  The expert reports are scheduled to be disclosed within the next two months, and will not prejudice the rights of the Accused, since none of these experts are scheduled to be heard before next year and the Defence has an overall knowledge of prior reports from the same experts.  With respect to Rule 68 material, the Chamber recalls that the Prosecution has an ongoing duty to make disclosure as the need arises.  There is no evidence before the Chamber to show that the Prosecution has failed to comply with this rule.  In its prior decisions, the Chamber did not find that the Prosecution breached its obligations under Rules 66(A)(ii) of the Rules, but that in the interests of justice, it should assist the Defence in obtaining specific documents.  In addition, the Chamber does not consider that the sole remedy for a violation of the Prosecution's disclosure obligation is the postponement of the trial, taking into account the right of the Accused to be tried without undue delay.

Paragraph 9:  The Chamber is no more convinced that the difficulties encountered by the investigator for Nzirorera may justify an indefinite postponement of the trial.  Further, regarding the attached communication from the Deputy Prosecutor, it appears that the Defence has not been prevented from meeting with prisoners, except the contentious investigators.  The Defence has other investigators and has discretion to use its resources accordingly.  This cannot be a sufficient reason to delay the start of trial at this time.

Paragraph 10:  Finally, the Chamber notes that most of the pending motions have now been addressed. There is no reason to postpone the trial while the remaining pending motions do not affect its commencement.

Paragraph 11:  With respect to the Prosecution's additional concerns, the Chamber notes that its recent ruling on special protective measures for two Prosecution witnesses will allow sufficient time for the Prosecution to make all the necessary arrangements for scheduling their testimonies.  No delay is therefore warranted.
Paragraph 12:  The argument that the WVSS has not assured the Prosecution that witnesses for the first trial session will be brought to Arusha in time for adequate preparation is speculative.  WVSS has been successfully managing the transfer of witnesses to Arusha for many years in coordination with the Prosecution's needs, and the Chamber has not been given any reason to believe that a similar procedure will not be followed in this case.  Also speculative is the Prosecution's argument that the Rwamakuba case will not finish in its allotted time. The Chamber will deal with this issue if and when it arises to accommodate all parties involved.

Paragraph 13:  The Chamber notes that this is the second time that this case is being heard before a trial chamber. The Defence and the Prosecution have already investigated and prepared for most of the issues in the case before the beginning of the first trial in November 2003.  The Defence cannot therefore be disadvantaged, nor can their rights be infringed if the case proceeds as planned.

Paragraph 14:  The Chamber has given serious consideration to the concerns expressed by both parties.  Some of those concerns have been addressed by the recent decisions delivered in the instant case.  The Chamber is therefore of the view that no postponement of the commencement of the trial is warranted at this stage.

For the abovementioned reasons, the Chamber denies the motion.
