WITNESS 3/11
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I want to take up your account of events where you live and you've described a school, and we can continue just to refer to it perhaps as "the school", and you've described the position of your home in relation to that school.  And you told us yesterday how refugees, displaced people, people fleeing, had gathered at that place and how you had witnessed their staying there.  And you told us that they remained there until something happened, and let's pick up your account from that.  

Can you remember the date when something happened in that context?
A.	That was on the 12th of April 1994.  
Q.	Now, about what time was this? 
A.	It was between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. 
Q.	And where were you during the events that you're now going to tell the Judges? 
A.	I was at that very spot when the events occurred at the school.  
Q.	Well, tell us what you saw, please.  
A.	This is what I saw:  Four vehicles arrived, and when they reached my father-in-law's house, *************************, a policeman steps down from the vehicle, a policeman called Nduwezu.  He got out and he shot at my father-in-law.  But I did not witness that scene because it was my mother who law who told me about this.  When they got to the school, they came out of the vehicle and surrounded the school. 
Q.	Just pause there.  I don't mean to interrupt you, it's just that some people may be taking a note. And, also, you just mentioned a name, and it will help if we spell it.  Nduwezu is spelt, I believe, N-D-U-W-E-Z-U.  And let's just pause there for a moment in respect of what you've said about that.  And you stated that that was not something you yourself witnessed, but your mother-in-law later told you what had happened.  And -- 
A.	Yes.  She's the one who talked to us about it because we were not at the spot. 
Q.	So what happened to your father-in-law? 
A.	My mother-in-law told us that that man Nduwezu came and was looking for *********, who was their daughter.  When he was told that ****** wasn't there, he shot at my father-in-law.  And ********************************. 
Q.	Now -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
**************************. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I have a piece of paper passed to you, and I'll ask you to draw against the figure 1, because there may be other names that you will be invited to write as we go through your story, if you could write the name of your father-in-law on the piece of paper, please.  That way we don't have to pronounce his name in open court.  

Now, while that's doing the round so we can see the name, can I ask you this in respect of the name:  What ethnic group was your father-in-law, whose name you've just written?  
A.	He was Hutu. 
Q.	Do you have any idea why he, a Hutu, should be murdered by this group -- by this man, I should say? 
A.	********** had lost her husband and the people wanted to seize the family property from her.  She went and complained in court and won the case, and that is why some people were not happy.  He took advantage of the genocide to want to kill **************.  When he couldn't locate *********, he killed her father.  
Q.	And *********** was who in that story?  Who was that person? 
A.	He killed that old man.  ********* was the daughter of my father-in-law, and her husband was a member of the family of the person who killed him; that is the man who came to look for her to kill but who, rather, killed her father. 
Q.	And what was her job, this lady? 
A.	She used to work ******************. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, having, you understood it, stopped in order to do that and to murder that man, what happened then?  You were telling us that they went on to the school.  So when they got to the school, was that something you now saw with your own eyes, and is your evidence about this going to be something that you saw yourself? 
A.	Yes, I witnessed that. 
Q.	All right.  Well, let's take it bit by bit.  First of all, when these people arrived, did you notice how they arrived, what vehicles they were in, that sort of thing? 
A.	Yes, I saw the vehicle in which they came. 
Q.	And what was that, or what were the vehicles? 
A.	One of the vehicles was a blue Daihatsu.  There were also two cars, and finally there was a white vehicle.  I don't know; people used to say that such cars were called Peugeot cars, but I don't know how I can describe that fourth vehicle.  Those, in any case, are the vehicles that came to the school. 
Q.	And having got there, what happened? 
A.	When they arrived, they alighted from the vehicles and surrounded the school, but prior to that, when the refugees had heard the gunshots that were fired at my father-in-law's house, some of them started fleeing, in particular, those who were strong.  Mostly women and children remained.  And when those people arrived, they told the Hutus to come out of the group, as well as to the children.  Now, the children also stood on one side, and the nursing mothers, or mothers who had children with them, put their children in the group of children.  Thereafter, they shot into the group and threw grenades and killed those people.  

After having killed them, they also shot at their cows.  
Q.	Just pause there, please, with the shooting of the cows, just for a moment.  So the children are separated from the adults.  Does that mean that both Hutu and Tutsi children were separated from the adults, or just Hutu children?  
A.	All the children, including Tutsi children, came out of the group.  No child was killed on that spot. 
Q.	Now, what of men?  Were there -- 
A.	Men fled.  Only six men died at that location.  When -- during the exhumation exercise, only the corpses of six men were found. 
Q.	Now, you mentioned some nursing mothers who placed their children that they were nursing with the children who'd been separated.  What then happened to those nursing mothers?  What happened to them? 
A.	Those mothers were also killed.  They were also shot at. 
Q.	All right.  Now, that separation having taken place, and you told us then the shooting and the use of hand grenades was the form of the attack to kill those people, and after that -- and I interrupted you at this point -- they started shooting at the cows that the refugees there had with them.  Now, you can take up your story again, please, from there.  They shot at the cows, and what happened then? 
A.	They shot at the cows and killed them, and they were to take the cows and put the -- or the legs of the cows and put in vehicles.  After that, they went to Pastor Nkarangwa, where they took the items belonging to the refugees and put them into the car.  They also took goats belonging to the refugees and the said goats were put on board the vehicles, and they all went with the goods and property that they had just seized. 
Q.	Thank you.  And between the time that they'd arrived at this school and the time that this killing group came to leave, how long would you estimate they were there? 
A.	It took quite a while; I would say more than 30 minutes.  I would say they were at that place for more than 30 minutes. 
Q.	And did you see all those things? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	After the killers had gone, what did you do? 
A.	After having killed those people and after the people had been killed, there was a certain Biserurambi, who told the members of the population to kill Tutsis and to burn down their houses.  We stood there, not knowing what to do.  We were very scared and did not know what to do.  
Q.	Can you spell that man's name, Biserurambi?  Can you spell it for us, please? 
A.	Yes, I can spell out the name to you:  B-I-S-E-R-U-R-A-M-B-I (sic), Biserurande -- N-D-E. 
Q.	Thank you very much indeed.  Who was that man?  I mean, did you know him and did he hold any position? 
A.	We did not know that man.  He was an employee of the Rubungu commune and had come with the refugees, but before making his statement, he first of all introduced himself and told us what his name was. 
Q.	So having told you to do that, and you said you were scared, what happened then? 
A.	That evening, nothing happened.  We were scared.  I remained at the school, sitting down, and many inhabitants of the locality came to see what was happening.  We did nothing that evening. 
Q.	The group that had been attacked, were they all dead, or not? 
A.	Not everyone died.  There were some who were only wounded. 
Q.	Do you know the names of any of those who were only wounded? 
A.	I have a problem with my headset. 
Q.	It's come a bit loose, I think.  Mr. Issa will sort you out.

Fine, I think that's more comfortable for you.  So, I was asking you whether you knew the names of any people who were attacked and who were not killed but only wounded.  If you do know any of those people -- 
A.	Yes, I know the names of some of them. 
Q.	Can you speak those names out loud, or would you rather write them down?  Which do you feel most comfortable with? 
A.	I'm going to give you the names of those persons. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	Karangwa lost a leg.  He hails from Mbandazi at Rubungo.  
Q.	Just pausing there, can you spell that person's name, and can you tell us if it's a man or -- a male or a female?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, Mr. Hooper, can you repeat the question?  Your microphone was not lit when you started asking it.  
THE WITNESS:
It's a man.  I will spell it:  K-A-R-A-N-G-W-A. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And he lost a leg.  Do you know, is he still alive, and if he is, do you know where he is and where he lives today? 
A.	He is still alive and lives at Mbandazi, which used to be the former Rubungo commune.  
Q.	And I'm sorry, can you help us yet again?  Can you spell "Mbandazi" for us, please? 
A.	M-B-A-N-D-A-Z-I. 
Q.	Thank you very much, indeed.  And was there anyone else you can name, other than Karangwa, who survived? 
A.	There was another lady called Nirere, N-I-R-E-R-E, Nirere. 
Q.	Was she wounded as well, or not? 
A.	Nirere wasn't wounded.  When Hutus were asked to step aside, she went and joined the Hutu group. 
Q.	Can you help us as to how many people were killed?  First of all, how many people you estimated at the time, as it were, with your own eyes you thought had been killed, and secondly, what you may have learned since, if there is a difference between the two?  How many people on the day did you think had been killed?  Were you in a position to estimate that? 
A.	On that day there were very many victims.  They were all in the schoolyard, and there were so many corpses that you could see that there were many people.  But subsequently, after the exhumations, it was noted that there were 61 corpses which were later on buried with greater respect. 
Q.	And where were those corpses exhumed from, as best you can remember? 
A.	There is a latrine that was being dug in the school; that is where the corpses had been thrown in.  
Q.	Who cleared away the bodies, the corpses? 
A.	Pastor Nkaranga convened the population and they are the ones who gathered the corpses. 
Q.	Now, 61 bodies were exhumed.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How does that number compare with your estimate of the numbers of people who were actually killed on the day? 
A.	We did not count the corpses and we felt that there were many more corpses, but only 61 corpses were exhumed.  
Q.	And we all appreciate this will be a difficult exercise for you, but can you give us some idea how many more corpses there were?  Was it like twice the number, do you think, of those exhumed, or a greater number than that?  Or not as much?  Can you help us at all?   
A.	I'm not in a position to say whether it was double the number of corpses that were exhumed.  We even felt that there were less than 61 because they were spread out.  Indeed, when the corpses were exhumed, we realised that there were many more than what we had thought at the time of the event. 
Q.	All right.  So does that mean that the numbers killed, you thought at the time, was less than 61 or more than 61, or what? 
A.	If one has to give an estimate, we felt there were more than 50 people who had been killed, and others were saying probably there were 40, but we did not count the corpses.  We merely noted that there were many corpses, many bodies. 
Q.	All right.  Now, there are, in fact, some photographs which we could just briefly look at here.  
MR. HOOPER:
Having said I wouldn't show any photographs this morning, I thought perhaps I should.  Is that going to be a difficulty, Mr. Fry?  

It is.  All right.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Very well, we'll deal with this in another way.  In fact, a CD is being distributed, and what I propose to do is just very quickly show you two or three pictures and ask you to identify the place that they show, and I'll show you them on my laptop.  It will be passed to you and -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Have the Judges received the CD?  It won't take a -- it's the quickest and easiest way to go about it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was it served, Counsel?  
MR. HOOPER:
It was served last week. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Honourable Judge is not speaking into his microphone.
 
MR. HOOPER:
Photographs of Gikomero, Gikomero commune, and I'm going to look at photograph 29 on the CD, and just formally ask this witness if she recognises the CD.  If I could possibly bother someone -- Mr. Fry -- with a safe pair of hands.  And it's photograph 29.  If that can be shown to the witness, please, photograph 29.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you recognise that place?  
A.	Yes.  That is the church. 
MR. HOOPER:
It might be easier if I go to the laptop and just trigger the next one, if I may, rather than come to me.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And the next photograph I'm looking at is photograph 30.  And can you tell us, please, where that is? 
A.	The school. 
Q.	And photograph 31, do you recognise that place? 
A.	Yes, I know that place.  It's the school, from the other side where they threw the corpses. 
Q.	This is photograph 32.  Do you recognise that place? 
A.	This is from the left side, the left side of the school, from the peasants' fields, the local peasant farmers' fields. 
Q.	And is it possible to see Lake Muhazi in that photograph? 
A.	Yes, you can see Lake Muhazi in the photograph. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  So those are the photographs I'd ask you to look at.  After the killings at the school on the 12th of April, were there any other killings that you know of in sector Gikomero? 
A.	Yes, after the 12th of April, from 14, 15, April, another group of refugees from Gasabo and Kayanga came to the Kayanga health centre, Tutsi refugees.  Some came to the centre, trading centre; others took refuge in local inhabitants' houses.  There were two children of a man named Karangwa -- named Batesi and another young girl, and they were killed at the trading centre on the right in relation to my grandfather's house.  That is where those two children were killed.  
Q.	Just pause there.  Just so we're clear, when you talk about a trading centre, does that trading centre have a particular name? 
A.	That trading centre's name is Kurupagu, a trading centre where there was also a small marketplace, but in those days in 1994, the market wasn't held. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness actually mentioned her father-in-law, not her grandfather, says the Kinyarwanda booth.  The reference made was to the father-in-law and not the grandfather.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that correction.  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And just dealing with that, was that the father-in-law who was -- you mentioned earlier had been killed? 
A.	I told you ******************************************************* was my father-in-law.  Sixty yards further -- 60 metres further was the trading centre I am talking of, so it was a bit further away that the children were killed.  
Q.	Now, these children who were killed, in relation to the 12th, how long after that was it that they were killed?  Can you help us? 
A.	The children were killed about two weeks later because those children came with a group of refugees, Hutu, that were fleeing the fighting with the Inkotanyi, the Inkotanyi that had taken Gasabo, Rutunga -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could you repeat those three -- the witness mentioned three places.  Sorry, one of them escaped me. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sorry, Madam Witness, if we just go back for a moment.  The killings of those two children were two weeks after the 12th, when a group came that was fleeing the Inkotanyi, and then you specified where the group came from.  Could you just tell us again where you understood that group was fleeing the Inkotanyi from?  
A.	They came from Gasabo secteur, Rutunga secteur and Kayanga secteur, so they came to our secteur, Gikomero secteur, to the Kurupangu trading centre.
Q.	Thank you.  And these two children who were killed, what ethnic group did they belong to? 
A.	They were Tutsi.  At that time it was the Tutsi that were targeted to have been killed. 
Q.	Do you know who killed those children, and if you do, are you willing to give us the names?  
A.	On the next morning when we went to the trading centre, because we would go there quite often, we met a group of people who spoke of the perpetrators of those crimes.  They mentioned Karekezi, Didace; Augustin Ngiruwonsanga; Bertin Karangwa.   And Ngiruwonsanga, Augustin.  And in the process of collecting information for the Gacaca process, those two names have been cited as the perpetrators of the crimes -- offences committed against those children, and they are at present in Kimironko prison. 
Q.	And just remind us of the two names who were the instigators of that incident, please.  And, if possible, take them one by one and help us with the spelling, which is a little difficult for us.  Thank you.  
A.	Let me begin with Karekezi, K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I.  K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I. 
Q.	Thank you.  And the next one, please.  
A.	Ngiruwonsanga, N-G-I-R-U-W-O-N-S-A-N-G-A.  N-G-I-R-U-W-O-N-S-A-N-G-A. 
Q.	Now, at that time or since, have you ever heard -- 
A.	There is one more perpetrator, instigator of the offence.  I don't think you left me the time to mention his name.  
Q.	I'm sorry.  Please provide it to us.  
A.	Karangwa, K-A-R-A-N-G-W-A.  Karangwa, K-A-R-A-N-G-W-A. 
Q.	All right.  Now in respect of any killings within Gikomero secteur, have you ever heard of a man by the name of André Rwamakuba being mentioned? 
A.	No, I never heard anyone mention the name Rwamakuba because he never came to our secteur. 
Q.	Now, I'll ask you a little bit more about him in a minute, but before I do, let me ask you about somewhere that's not your secteur but still in the commune, a place called Kayanga.  And we know that at Kayanga there was a health centre, and we have heard that there were killings there.  Do you know anything about those killings, and who the perpetrators were?  
A.	With regard to the Kayanga massacres, I was not an eyewitness.  It is only things I was told.  But if you wish, I can tell you what I was told about those massacres. 
Q.	Did you lose anybody in Kayanga at all? 
A.	No. 
Q.	What were you told of the events that took place there?
A.	I was told that the refugees -- refugees who came from Kayanga told us that there were four children at the Kayanga dispensary, and one Nyarwaya and other people in his company were killed along with him.  This is what I heard.  This is what I was told about the massacres at Kayanga. 
Q.	And when you say children -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry, Nyarwaya was one of the killers, not one of the victims says the booth, the Kinyarwanda booth.  He was a local policeman, communal policeman known as brigadier.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So Brigadier Nyarwaya was one of the perpetrators.  You mentioned children as victims.  Do you know how old -- when you say children, what age are you talking about, please? 
A.	I did not ask the children's ages. 
Q.	And how did you find out anything about what happened at Kayanga health centre?  How did you learn about that? 
A.	As I just explained, the inhabitants of Kayanga sought refuge with us and so they were talking.  Among the refugees from Kayanga was my sister-in-law, my husband's sister, and they were talking; they said so-and-so was killed by so-and-so, and so-and-so was killed by so-and-so.  
Q.	Is your sister-in-law still alive today? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Let me get a piece of paper for a moment.  Can I just pass this piece of paper with a name, known to us as *****, of course.  So it can go straight to the witness.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	There's a name on this piece of paper.  I'd ask you to look at it and tell us if you know that person.  
A.	Yes, I know this person.  We live in the same cellule, but this person lives at the very -- lives at the trading centre itself.  Yes, we were friends; we were quite close friends. 
Q.	And did you see her during the period of the genocide? 
A.	Yes, I saw her during the genocide, as a Tutsi person.  Her husband was a soldier and had a firearm.  We were together, therefore, around the 12th.  The Inkotanyi were coming to Kibobo.  And the Inkotanyi came to our place and we sought refuge at Kibobo.  When the Inkotanyi arrived in Gikomero on the 15th, that is when we sought refuge at Kibobo.  Kibobo is in the plain next to the GBK project, the woods of the GBK projects.  When we felt threatened by the arrival of the Inkotanyi, we continued to seek refuge near Ntungamo in Kibobo secteur. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, that wasn't quite clear.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  Well, let's just go back a little bit over the event.  You know this woman, and let me ask you this:  When the Inkotanyi came, did the Inkotanyi come and stay at Gikomero, or what, on the 15th?  What happened? 
A.	On the 18th they came; they arrived near Gikomero and fired.  When we heard the firing, the gunshots, we went to the neighbouring cellule in Kibobo, down in the Kibobo plain.  As to that lady and her husband, and another man by the name of Kamanzi who had a Tutsi wife, we sought refuge a bit further.  When we heard that the Inkotanyi had left, we returned home.  

On the 6th of May the Inkotanyi returned to Gasagara commune in Gikomero, and we again fled to Kibobo.  When we heard that the Inkotanyi had left the same day, we returned home again.  And then on the 15th of May, we left Gikomero once and for all, and we returned after the war was over.  
Q.	Now, when you say "we" in this coming and going, does "we" include the person whose name -- 
A.	No, I'm referring to myself and other people from Gikomero secteur, all of us, all of us inhabitants of Gikomero and the refugees who had come from outside Gikomero. 
Q.	Does that include the name on the piece of paper? 
A.	When we left Kibobo, it was when the Inkotanyi were near the woods and were firing, so everybody fled toward Gikoro, where the Inkotanyi had not yet come.  We went to Ntungamo and others went to other secteurs of Gikoro.  Later we could return to Kibobo, and the Inkotanyi came and told us there was no problem and took us to Karama camp until we finally could return home. 
Q.	Now during the days after the 12th of April did you ever meet and speak to the person whose name is on that piece of paper? 
A.	When we got home we continued to meet, but later she left the sector.  She got married and she went to live somewhere else, but we were still close. 
Q.	Did you ever talk about the events that had happened in Gikomero with her? 
A.	After we got home no one spoke of the genocide.  We returned home.  Until the authorities came to question us about what had happened during the genocide, we, the members of the population, did not discuss it.  
Q.	Now, you mentioned the two young people who were killed at the centre about two weeks after the 12th, and you named the people who killed them and how you'd been in the centre the day afterwards.  Are you in a position to help us as to where in the centre those two children or young people were killed? 
A.	They were killed at Karekezi's place, near where they sold coffee. 
Q.	Is that Didace Karekezi, the name you mentioned earlier? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I want to ask you now about André Rwamakuba.  Do you know an André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I come from Shango secteur, and that's where Rwamakuba came from.  But later his parents went to Katanga and that's where Rwamakuba grew up.  If I saw him, I couldn't recognise him, but I could recognise his sister Helen and his brother Athanase Kanimba.  Because we went to school together, but I don't think I could recognise André Rwamakuba.  I saw him when I was a child and never saw him again.  
Q.	During the war, during the genocide, do you know if that man held any particular position in the country? 
A.	I heard over the radio that he'd been appointed a Minister after Habyarimana, President Habyarimana's demise.  I heard that over the radio. 
Q.	So I'll ask you again:  Did you ever learn of André Rwamakuba coming to the commune and, in particular, Gikomero secteur, during the war? 
A.	During the war he never came to our area.  ********************************************************************************************************************, and no one has ever mentioned his name.  
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all the questions I ask.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your evidence will continue, but you now have to answer questions from the Prosecutor.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood. 
MR. HOOPER:
Just for the record, there's no dispute, I hope, that the piece of paper that's been passed up contains the name of the people we know under the pseudonym of ***, for the record.  There's no dispute about it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you propose to put in any exhibits?  
MR. HOOPER:
We'll put in the CD of photographs of Gikomero.  We may as well do it with this witness as with any other witness, but I would use another witness to go through it in more detail.  Plus the already-exhibited personal details document, plus the names that this witness wrote down a moment ago, so that's, essentially, three exhibits, one of which I think has already been entered.  No, none of them have been.  We'll organise that so immediately the witness finishes, we'll have, I hope, the numbers and the appropriate references. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I simply would like to say that it is Madam Cummings-John, Tamara, who will cross-examine this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness 
A.	Good morning, madam. 
Q.	Can I just ask you to move your chair forward a little?  
Thank you.  

My name is Ms. Cummings-John.  I work in the Office of the Prosecutor, and I will ask you a few questions in cross-examination.  Please forgive me because I have a bit of a cold and I may tend to sniffle a little.  I'd like to start by asking you -- I'd like to start by asking you, Madam Witness, how many times have you met with members of the Defence team, be they the investigators or the counsel? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, your microphone is on.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.  
THE WITNESS:
I have met them on several occasions because they -- usually, they frequently came to our area. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Can you give us a rough idea of how many times is "several occasions"? 
A.	They came quite often to visit the area, but personally, I had discussions with them twice. 
Q.	Can you recall when these discussions took place? 
A.	Well, it has been quite a while.  It's been a long time since I had discussions with them. 
Q.	Would you say this year?  Last year?  Two years ago?  An idea will suffice.  
A.	I talked to them once this year, and after a certain time period, I talked to them again still within this year.  
Q.	Did you give any statements at this time when you talked to them? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Were these statements read by you or to you? 
A.	My statement was read out to me. 
Q.	And did you sign these statements? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, we have been served with a collated document comprising of two statements dated the 9th of August 2003 and the 26th of July 2005.  Does that sound familiar to you? 
A.	Yes.  I wasn't remembering the year, but I think that rings a bell, but I don't exactly remember the precise date. 
Q.	Okay.  So you acknowledge, therefore, that you met with them in 2003 and gave a statement, and then subsequently in 2005 when you gave a statement? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	In 2003 did you sign the statement? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what about this year, did you sign it this year? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Unfortunately, we don't have either signed copies, but I'll move on.  Can you tell us when you came to Arusha?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, nor do I have any signed copies.  I've got two statements as they've been served indeed on the Chamber and on the Prosecution.  One is 2003 and is in French.  I'll make enquiries as to whether there exists a Kinyarwanda version.  Of course, this witness doesn't speak French.  

Attached to that, as you can see, by a cut-and-paste exercise, is Svetlana Pouplard's note of a conversation or her record of our conversation with this witness in July of this year.  There would have been no opportunity to sign that.  It was never on paper.  Since that time I have met with this witness at the safe house, and I have my counsel's notes as recorded by Ms. Oberti.  That's not a document that we've served, and nor was it read to the witness.  So inevitably, in dealing again with the witness, one would refer that witness back to the previous things that witness has said.  I'll make enquiries over the break of our investigator as to whether he believes that there might be a signed statement or not, or a further statement, or whether that's merely a -- perhaps a simple error on the part of the witness.  And that, as I know it, is the full position of contact, certainly in respect of myself.  And in respect of the investigator, I'll make enquiries, if that assists.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I would be much obliged if Counsel could make enquiries and find out if there are signed statements that could be served on us, and also I believe that even if counsel's notes taken at the safe house contain answers to questions put, they should also be served on us.  

I'll move on.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, can you tell us when you came to Arusha? 
A.	I got to Arusha on the 2nd, on the 2nd of this month. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many times you've met with Defence counsel since you came to Arusha? 
A.	I have met the Defence team once. 
Q.	Can you recall the last time you met with Defence counsel before the commencement of your testimony?  
A.	I cannot recall the exact day.  I cannot remember the day.  
Q.	Can you recall whether you met with counsel in the little room where you were kept before coming into the courtroom? 
A.	Yes.  He stopped by briefly in the waiting room and he left soon thereafter. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, in your first statement of March 2000 -- sorry, my apology -- of 2003, I believe August 2003, which you acknowledge giving and signing, you talk about your husband *****************************; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Thank you.  In your second statement of July 2005, you state that he, your husband, who I won't name here -- for reasons obviously of your protected nature -- is accused of having participated in the Kayanga health centre massacres.  This is what you said, isn't it? 
A.	No, it doesn't have to do with the attack at the Kayanga health centre.  It was after that attack.  After the massacres, people went to Kayanga to fight the Inkotanyi.  People were compelled to go and fight the Inkotanyi, and it is within that framework that he went to Kayanga.  And when they got to the Kayanga school, the Inkotanyi shot at them, and they retreated and when they got to Sebaturo's - Sebaturo, Nyargwaya's house, others got -- made a Hutu doctor to come down, who they killed, and they also killed the wife of that Sebaturo.  We learnt about this from people who had come from Kayanga to fight against the Inkotanyi.  I did not talk about the massacres or the killings that took place at the Kayanga health centre. 
Q.	My apologies.  Perhaps it's my misinterpretation of your statement.  Can I ask that you try to keep your answers as short and precise as possible so that we can keep up?  Now, when did the events that your husband is accused of take place at the Kayanga health centre?  
A.	That didn't take place at the Kayanga dispensary.  They didn't even reach Kayanga because Inkotanyi were there already.  The Inkotanyi shot them, and they retreated, moving towards Gikomero, near the accounting officer's house.  And when they got there, they made Murasira to come down from the vehicle.  He was a Hutu who was amongst the group of those who were going to fight the Inkotanyi.  He was taken to Sebaturo's house.  Sebaturo was Hutu, but his wife was Tutsi.  And when they got to Sebaturo's house, they killed Murasira. 
Q.	I know it's difficult -- I know it's very difficult and there is this urge to want to explain further, but if you can answer my questions as precisely and concisely as possible, I would really appreciate it, because it's very difficult to keep up.  

Now, when did this retreat or -- when did this attempted attack on the Inkotanyi take place; what date?  
A.	I cannot recall the date.  The Inkotanyi had already taken that Kayanga locality and the communal policemen were telling members of the population to get into the vehicle to fight the Inkotanyi, who were at Kayanga. 
Q.	Was it before you fled on the 15th or after you came back? 
A.	That was before the Inkotanyi had taken the Gikomero area. 
Q.	So this was before the 15th of April? 
A.	Prior to the 15th of May. 
Q.	Prior to the 15th of May.  And sorry, Madam Witness, when did you testify as having fled your home for the first time? 
A.	The first time we took flight was on the 18th, and we got to Kibobo, and the next day we returned. 
Q.	On the 18th of which month, please, Madam Witness? 
A.	18 April. 
Q.	So your husband's attempt, with others, to go and fight the Inkotanyi, did this happen before the 18th when you first fled, or after?
A.	That happened after the 18th of April. 
Q.	Do you have any idea when the Inkotanyi took the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	I don't know the date on which they captured the Kayanga health centre, but I know at what time the refugees got to the Gikomero secteur.  They got there on the 15th of April. 
Q.	In your statement which you acknowledge signing, of 2005, you stated that at the Kayanga health centre, and I quote, "My husband is accused of events there.  He" -- further down the paragraph --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	May I finish, madam?  May I finish?  "He told me that the Inkotanyi did the killing at the health centre."  Is this what you said, or not? 
A.	Later, Nyarwaya took people who had to go and bury those who had been killed at the health centre, and amongst those people who had been killed was Nyarwaya's sister, but the young people that we are talking about had already been killed well before the refugees reached Gikomero.  And when the refugees got to Gikomero, the young people had already been killed.  

Subsequently, there were others who were killed and who were said to have been killed by the Inkotanyi.  They were killed while they were fleeing from the combat with the Inkotanyi, and when they got to Gikomero, that is when the groups were formed; that is groups who had to go and fight at Kayanga.  And at a certain point in time, people were asked to go to Kayanga to bury those who had been killed at the health centre, and amongst whom was Nyarwaya's sister.  That was what was being said; I wasn't present.  

Actually, they went to Kayanga twice.  Once they went there to bury the people, and the second time around they went there to fight the Inkotanyi and that is when Musasira and Sebaturo's wife were killed.  
Q.	My question, and I'd like to ask you to take a pause in between your version, your recount of your story, but my question I thought was quite precise, Madam Witness, and it was:  Did you or did you not tell the investigators or Defence counsel that your husband told you that the Inkotanyi were guilty of committing the massacres at the Kayanga health centre?  Did you or did you not tell the Defence investigators that? 
MR. HOOPER:
That doesn't appear in my note of -- excuse me, Madam Witness.  I've got the -- obviously, the document that was served on you, which is a statement taken by Svetlana Pouplard.  It's wrong to describe it as this witness's statement.  It's her note. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Perhaps the witness should take her headphones off. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, will you remove your headphones, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I only speak Kinyarwanda; I can't understand what you're saying.  
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Just for safety.  And, hopefully, the Chamber also have access to this, and this is Svetlana Pouplard's note.  It is not this witness's statement, though reasonable inferences can be drawn from its contents, obviously.  But on this particular aspect, it reads, "Nyarwaya obliged some unarmed men to accompany them to KHC.  The only people who were killed another KHC -- were killed at the Inkotanyi -- that is what she learnt from her husband."  "Were killed at the Inkotanyi."  It doesn't make sense to me, either.  She then goes on about militiamen organising a second attack and she names them.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm sorry, can you please just clarify where you're reading from, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm reading from the bit that's been attached to your statement of 2003, the cut and paste on that which has been taken and placed on that.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Perhaps, Your Honour, I can assist.  The document I have is written in the first person, which suggests to me this is the witness talking, and certainly it says nothing about -- the words that my learned colleague has just spoken don't feature on my document.  I'm looking at 1303 CMS reference, and it states, "I," "I stayed at Gikomero secteur until now.  Kayanga health centre, my husband is accused of events there.  I can explain some things about this."  And so on and so on.  

It's one thing for counsel to refer to a document as simply notes, but when we produce a document which we are the author of, we indicate "Prepared by Tamara Cummings-John" or whoever.  We have no indication on this document that it's a document that's been prepared by Miss Svetlana Pouplard.  For counsel to tell us this in court I would argue is inappropriate, and for Ms. Pouplard to compose a statement in the first person and end it with, "I confirm I am willing to go to Arusha," this is a statement, Your Honours, with all due respect.  
(Pages 1 to 17 by Karen Holm)



















1035H
MR. HOOPER:
Well, statements normally, or even notes that could in future form statements, will often be taken in the first person.  We have provided the Prosecution with what we've got, and in this context may I emphasise we haven't had one note, ever, in respect of any witness the Prosecution called.  I think we're being somewhat more generous and, I hope, more frank and open than we're being treated -- apart from investigators' notes, that's true.

I've already said and undertake that I will do as thorough research as I can, but I think the position is as you see it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think in cross-examination counsel is entitled to seek clarification of what is on the note.  

It is important that you do not mischaracterise what you are putting to the witness.  You must reflect -- there must be some accuracy in the way that you approach this matter.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Absolutely.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The inquiry will be admitted subject to you taking care as to the accuracy in the way you put it to the witness.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Indeed, Your Honour.  I'm simply reading from the document, unless of course we've been served with an incorrect document.  But I've even made reference to the CMS number.  I'm simply reading from the document and not interpreting anything whatsoever.  I don't know if you wish to take the break.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is the time for the mid morning break.

Madam Witness, could you put back on your headphones, please?  Madam Witness, we take a short break of about 15 minutes mid morning and we take it now.  We'll resume -- we are going to take a short recess. 
(Court recessed from 1038H to 1104H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now continue.
MR. HOOPER:
Just before we start, in fact I had a brief discussion with Ms. Cummings-John and in fact, in all fairness to her, she was putting to the witness what was on the document she had.  What had happened was this, that there was the statement taken in 2003, the French statement.
MS. FALL:  
(No interpretation)
MR. HOOPER:
She doesn't speak English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has her headphones on.
MR. HOOPER:
There was a statement in 2003.  I haven't caught up with my investigator, so I don't know whether that's his translation of a signed Kinyarwanda document, which is often what happens here.  So there could be a signed document.  If there is, or if there has been one, I'll let the Prosecution know.

Then, in July, over half an hour, as I can see from the original note by Pouplard, I and Pouplard met this witness in Kigali, and there is a note by Pouplard of her recollection of what is said.  I say "recollection"; she would have made that note at the time.  What's happened then is I've taken that note and put it into the first person and, indeed, I notice it then ends up saying, "I'm willing to come to Arusha in December."  That's then pasted on to the first statement.

It is that that is served on the Prosecution and it's apparent to me that that, or the intention behind it was at some time to get the witness to sign that as a complete statement.  But that's never happened, because it has to be translated, and that's not happened.  

I don't always find it helpful reading statements back to witnesses in any event, because it gives them an impression of a script or whatever.  I'd much rather they just say their story.  Anyway, that's what's happened there.  

What the Prosecution got was the original statement plus the, as it were, additional statement that had by then been redrafted and drawn by me into the first person.  And instead of being in the noted form that it appears in Pouplard's notes, it follows very much the same course, but it's in better English, I hope, and clearly with that in view.  So that's why there was a difference and why I indeed criticised Ms. Cummings-John for putting something which wasn't specific in the note, but indeed, it's rendered specific by my alteration in the statement.

So I hope that is a clearer position.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'd like to thank my learned friend for the explanation and clarification.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, do you recall testifying about four children who were killed at the Kayanga health centre?
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And when you talk of "children", what do you mean; what sort of age group are we looking at?  Were they under 16?
A.	I was not an eyewitness of that event.  It was the refugees from Kayanga who spoke of it, so I couldn't know what the children's ages were. 
Q.	But when they spoke of it to you, they referred to "children"; is that correct?
A.	In general, in our country, when you're not married, people who are older than you call you a child.  So they could be small children, just as they could be youths -- young boys or girls. 
Q.	Could they also have been 50-year-old unmarried men?
A.	That is possible, but when someone isn't married, people who are older than that person consider that person as a child, because they're still living at their parents' house. 
Q.	And you personally, what age -- up until what age do you consider someone a child?
A.	Personally, any celibate person is a child.  A man who doesn't have a wife, for me, is a child. 
Q.	Madam Witness, did the refugees tell you what ethnicity these four children were?
A.	In those days the Tutsi were targeted, and since those four children were killed, it must mean that they were Tutsi. 
Q.	Apart from those four children, were any other people killed at the Kayanga health centre that you're aware of?
A.	At that time, when the Tutsi were being hunted down, I didn't hear mention of any other victims apart from the children, but subsequently I heard about other people who had been killed. 
Q.	Did you hear how many other people were killed when you heard this subsequently?
A.	I didn't hear mention the number of victims who were subsequently killed, the figure pertaining to the number of people killed. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, I'd like to ask you to bear with me.  This may be an error in your statement, or it may be a misinterpretation, but in your second statement, which is dated -- or the notes taken from the meeting with you which is dated the 26th of July, there is mention of your husband attributing the only massacres at the Kayanga health centre to the Inkotanyi.  Is this correct or not?
A.	That is not correct.  The refugees from Kayanga, when they arrived in Gikomero, took members of the population to Kayanga, they said, in order to bury the people killed by the Inkotanyi, and among those victims was Nyarwaya sister and subsequently -- that is why my husband went to Kayanga. 
Q.	When you were told of the four children who were killed at the Kayanga health centre, then you subsequently learned of other people who were killed there, did you also learn who the perpetrators of these massacres were?
A.	As regards the second massacre, they said it was the Inkotanyi who had killed the people at Kayanga; that certain people were physically killed by the Inkotanyi, and others had been killed by stray shooting by the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Did you learn at the time, or at a later date, who was responsible for the murders of the four children?
A.	No, I never heard who had killed those four children, but the communal policemen were accused, including one Nyarwaya, but I was not an eyewitness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must interrupt at this stage.  We have a security alarm, a fire alarm, and we must adjourn now.  So we adjourn.  You'll be notified as soon as it is safe to return. 
(Court recessed from 1118H to 1127H)
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Mr. President, may I?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, Ms. Cummings-John.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, just before we went out, you had, I believe, told us that you were not aware of those who were accused of committing the -- of killing the four children at the Kayanga health centre; am I correct?
A.	I told you that it was said that Nyarwaya, as well as other people with him, who allegedly killed those children.  Nyarwaya is a communal policeman. 
Q.	Do you know who the other people with Nyarwaya were?
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, I'd like to move on to, and leading up to, the events of the 12th of April.  I'd like to start with the refugees who came on the 8th.  Is that correct, you said that they came to the school on the 8th of April?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You also stated that they came from Rubungo commune; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did you witness how many of them there were when they arrived?
A.	There were very many. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you to be a little bit more precise.  When you say "very many", do you mean 100, 200, 1,000 -- more?
A.	There were many -- very many refugees.  The courtyard of the school was full of refugees. 
Q.	And how big would you say the courtyard was?  Was it the size of this courtroom, or larger?
A.	The courtyard was very big. 
Q.	Is that bigger than this courtroom?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when you say that they filled the courtyard, were they in groups, were they in clusters in different parts of the courtyard, or did they completely cover the courtyard?
A.	They were everywhere throughout the courtyard. 
Q.	So we're talking about a very large courtyard, larger than this courtroom, completely covered with refugees; am I accurate?
A.	Yes, quite. 
Q.	Now, I don't want to hazard a guess, but would you agree with me, in saying that, there would have to be certainly more than 100 to have that kind of an effect?
A.	I think there was more than 100. 
Q.	Would you say there were more than 500?
A.	No, there were less than 500 of them. 
Q.	Would you say there were more than 200?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And they were with their animals; is that correct?
A.	Yes, they had their livestock. 
Q.	Do you have any idea of how many livestock we're talking about?  Did each person have a cow, for instance?
A.	No, each person didn't have only a cow. 
Q.	So it would be possible for each person to have more than one cow, say?  Two, or three?
A.	Yes, but there were some who didn't have any. 
Q.	Can I ask you to hazard a guess as to how many livestock there were?  An approximate figure will do.
A.	There were about between 40 and 50 cows. 
Q.	And can I just clarify, because I don't know if it's my misinterpretation.  In your evidence-in-chief, you talked about them coming from Rubungo; is that correct?
A.	You are right. 
Q.	Would that be the same direction as Remera?
A.	Yes, it is the same direction -- Remera is located in the Rubungo commune. 
Q.	Thank you.  You also stated in your evidence-in-chief that amongst them were teachers -- teachers of your children; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did your children school in Rubungo?
A.	They used to come to teach in Gikomero, but they hailed from Rubungo.
Q.	So would they commute every day to come and teach your children in Gikomero?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Approximately how long a commute would you say that would be?
A.	Rubungo is adjoining to our secteur.  It was just close by us. 
Q.	Did you ever go to Rubungo yourself?
A.	Yes, of course; I used to go to Rubungo. 
Q.	And how did you go -- by foot or by car?
A.	It is very close to our place and we used to trek there. 
Q.	Can you give us an idea, for someone who's not familiar with your area, of how long it would take you to get there from your area, from your secteur?
A.	Yes, I could tell you that. 
Q.	Please do so.  
A.	From the school ***********************, to get to Rubungo you could cover the distance in 40 minutes -- 40 minutes on foot. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, if we can move on to the events of the 12th, concerning which you gave evidence both in your statements and in your testimony, I'd like to ask, Madam Witness, did you leave your home at all on the 12th?
A.	Yes, I left my home and I went to the school.  I was in the school. 
Q.	Can you recall what time this was?
A.	I went to the school following or after the vehicles began moving towards the school.  We wanted to know whether those vehicles had come to take along those who were there. 
Q.	And where were you when the vehicles arrived, Madam Witness?
A.	I was at my home, but I have told you that, actually, **************************. 
Q.	So when the vehicles arrived, were you inside your house or outside?
A.	I was outside my house. 
Q.	Were you standing in front of your house watching the vehicles go past you?
A.	That is correct; I was by the roadside. 
Q.	And the vehicles would have been coming from the main road; is that correct?
A.	Yes, the vehicles came from the main road. 
Q.	And in making their way towards the school, when you observed them, would they have reached your father-in-law's house first, or your house first?
A.	Before reaching the school, the vehicles passed by my father-in-law's house first. 
Q.	So when they arrived at your father-in-law's house, can you tell us where you were?
A.	I was standing near my house close to the courtyard of my house. 
Q.	And what did you do subsequently when they got to your father's house -- father-in-law's house, pardon me?
A.	Remained where I was standing. 
Q.	And when they entered your father-in-law's house, where were you?
A.	I was at my home by the roadside. 
Q.	Can I ask, Madam Witness: were you alone standing by the roadside at your home?
A.	No, there were people there with me. 
Q.	Now, your father-in-law, would I be correct in saying that is the father of your husband, or not?
A.	That is correct.  Actually, he is the paternal uncle of my husband, but my husband was raised in that old man's house. 
Q.	And where was your husband at this time?
A.	He was also present at that location. 
Q.	Could you please specify which location you're referring to?
A.	He was at our home. 
Q.	With you?
A.	No, he was inside the house. 
Q.	Now, the gentleman that you say by the name of Nduwezu -- pardon my pronunciation -- 
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	-- he's the one who you accuse of killing your father-in-law; is that correct?
A.	Absolutely so. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the relationship between Nduwezu and ******************************** -- I don't know if I'm permitted to say her name; she's a protected witness.  Or may I?
A.	***********. 
Q.	Can you tell us the relationship between Nduwezu and *************?
A.	Yes, I can tell you the relationship between ************** and Nduwezu's brother -- between ****************** and Nduwezu, I beg your pardon. 
Q.	Please go ahead, Madam Witness.
A.	********************* of Nduwezu. 
Q.	And you also state that Nduwezu was a policeman; is that correct?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Do you have any idea of what his rank was?
A.	No, I don't know the ranks of communal policemen. 
Q.	Do you know how old he was at the time -- an approximate figure will do.
A.	If I were to make an estimate, I would say he was aged between 25 and 28 years.  He was a young man.  
Q.	Now, let's go back to the other members who you saw -- the other people, rather, who you saw on board the four vehicles which came from the direction of Rubungo.  You state that there were police officers -- this is from your statement -- you state that there were police officers and members of the Presidential Guard; is that correct?
A.	Though I refer to as members of the Presidential Guard, and it was said they were Presidential Guard members, since they didn't wear the same uniform as the communal policemen. 
Q.	Would you be so kind as to tell us what kind of uniform they wore?
A.	They wore khaki uniforms. 
Q.	And the communal police officers, what sort of uniform did they wear?
A.	Their uniform was green in colour. 
Q.	Did you see all of them when they arrived?
A.	Yes, when they arrived, they came out of their vehicles and I saw them with my own eyes. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court how many of them, approximately, there were?
A.	From my reckoning, I believe that the policemen that were accompanying the members of the population totalled some 20. 
Q.	And the members of the Presidential Guard, how many were they in number?
A.	Those who were wearing khaki uniforms numbered four. 
Q.	You also talked about ordinary people amongst them.  Here I'm looking at your statement.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam Prosecutor, can you start your question all over, because your microphone was not on when you started asking it.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Apologies.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	You also talked about ordinary people being amongst them.  What did you mean by "ordinary people"?
A.	There were also ordinary people, members of the population that they had, that they took along with them on their way. 
Q.	Can you give us an idea, an estimate, of how many members of the population there were?
A.	There were also many, because even the people from Gikomero were in those vehicles.  You had the Daihatsu vehicle that was full, and there was another vehicle in which they came. 
Q.	Would you say there were perhaps 10 members of the population -- 10 ordinary people -- or more?
A.	No, there were more than 10 in number. 
Q.	Could you offer a bit more assistance?  Would you say there were more than 20?  If there were more than 10, were there more than 20 ordinary people?
A.	No, there were less than 20 in number. 
Q.	Thank you, less than 20 but more than 10.  Now, you say these people were taken along the way.  How do you know this?
A.	This is because they came on board those vehicles, whereas they lived in Gikomero.  Do you want me to stop my answer there?  By the way, the people who were present said -- told themselves that they were picked up along the way. 
Q.	So these ordinary people told you that they were picked up along the way?
A.	Yes.  Since those persons subsequently were detained and they gave testimonies, they were accused of having taken part in the attack, but while they were giving their evidence, in their defence they said that the attackers had picked them up along the way to bring them along. 
Q.	Now, can you recap for us again the colours of the vehicles that you saw?
A.	Yes, I do recall the colours of the vehicles that came. 
Q.	Please go ahead and tell us.
A.	The first vehicle was a blue Daihatsu.  There were two small cars.  There was also a Peugeot. 
Q.	Can you recall, Madam Witness, what type of a Peugeot this was?
A.	The Peugeot was white in colour. 
Q.	Was it a saloon car, was it an estate car?  Do you have any idea what type of a car it was?
A.	It was a pickup. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you state in your testimony that they stopped at your father-in-law's house and the young policeman by the name of Nduwezu got out and went into your father-in-law's house; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did he enter the house alone, or did he go with the other people who he'd arrived with?
A.	He entered alone. 
Q.	So the other members stayed outside.  Did they stay by the cars?
A.	No, the other attackers proceeded towards the school. 
Q.	So they didn't wait for Nduwezu; is that correct?
A.	No, they did not wait for him. 
Q.	Now, you mention in your evidence-in-chief that, upon hearing the firing of these people, that the refugees were able to escape, some of them -- able-bodied men, I believe you said; is that correct?
A.	That's exactly what I said.
Q.	Madam Witness, when did this firing take place, can you tell us?
A.	It took place between 1 and 2 p.m. when we heard the gunshots. 
Q.	Where did it take place?  Was it at your father-in-law's house, or elsewhere?
A.	No, I was talking about the school in reference to the gunshots. 
Q.	Perhaps I misunderstood you.  I'll take time to consult the transcript, but my understanding was that whilst at your father-in-law's house, the shootings, which started, warned -- or the hearing of these shootings were able to warn the refugees and they were able to escape.  Is that not what you said?
A.	Yes, I did indeed say that when the refugees heard the gunshots from my father-in-law's house, some of them took flight. 
Q.	So who was shooting the gun at your father-in-law's house?
A.	It is Nduwezu who fired the shot. 
Q.	How many shots did he fire?
A.	Two gunshots. 
Q.	And upon hearing this, the refugees began to escape; is that correct?
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	And in escaping, did they go past your house?
A.	That is correct.  When they took flight, they proceeded towards the forest belonging to the GBK project. 
Q.	Can you help us as to where this forest was situated **********************?
A.	Yes, I can tell you where the forest belonging to GBK is located. 
Q.	Please go ahead, Madam Witness.  
A.	It is below the school, towards Kibobo cellule. 
Q.	And did you witness this flight with your own eyes?
A.	I did not see them fleeing, because I was on the other side -- the side where the vehicle was, and they were on the other side.  I arrived after the shooting, after my father-in-law had been shot at.  I followed the vehicles, whereas the young man who had shot at my father-in-law stayed at home.  So I was on the side where the vehicles were. 
Q.	So how did you know who fled?  How do you know that they were able-bodied men who fled upon hearing the firing?
A.	We knew that, because it is the women who were killed there as well as a few men, whereas before there had been many men who had sought refuge at the school. 
Q.	Do you know how many minutes passed after Nduwezu entered your father-in-law's house when the shooting occurred?
A.	We don't know how many minutes it took.  I don't know; I wasn't at my father-in-law's house. 
Q.	But you did see Nduwezu enter his house, did you not?
A.	No, I did not see that.  It is my mother-in-law who told me of it. 
Q.	But you were standing outside your house, which is next door to your father-in-law's house; is that correct?
A.	Yes, but the vehicle stopped and he went out, but I couldn't see him, because there were other vehicles in front of the vehicle from which he emerged. 
Q.	Did you see him go out the vehicle, even if you didn't see him go in to the house?
A.	I saw the vehicle stop. 
Q.	Did you see anybody else come out of the vehicle when it stopped?
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you know what time elapsed between the vehicle stopping and the shooting?
A.	Yes, I can give you an approximate length of time. 
Q.	Thank you, that would be kind.
A.	Approximately three minutes. 
Q.	So, based on your count, in approximately three minutes Nduwezu entered your father-in-law's house, he asked for his daughter -- your father-in-law's daughter.  He was told she wasn't there, and then he shot at your father-in-law in three minutes; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it didn't take very long. 
Q.	And during this time, whilst Nduwezu had entered, so we have a lapse of three minutes, the vehicles then moved towards the school; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, I believe you stated that between ************************************************.  I hope I haven't misquoted you.  If I have, please correct me.
A.	That is an approximation, but in fact it's less than ***************************. 
Q.	Thank you, but we can work with *************.  Do you know how long it would take a vehicle to arrive at a distance of ****************?
A.	I couldn't tell you. 
Q.	Do you think it might take one minute, two minute, three?
A.	It would take very little time.  I couldn't tell you exactly. 
Q.	We're certainly in agreement there.  It would take very little time.  And how long does it take you to get **************************?
A.	Not long at all, because **************. 
Q.	Five minutes, or less?
A.	I think it took me less than five minutes. 
Q.	And after the vehicle stopped and the other vehicles went towards the school, did you follow them immediately, or did you wait at your house for some time?
A.	I waited for some time and I left after the vehicle that stopped at my father-in-law's had moved on. 
Q.	Did you leave after hearing the shots, or before hearing the shots?
A.	I did not hear the shots fired at my father-in-law's house, because of the noise of the vehicles.  My attention, rather, was drawn to the vehicles.  I told you that it was my mother-in-law who told me that my father-in-law had been shot at. 
Q.	And do you have any idea who told you the refugees who fled -- who told them about the shots at your father-in-law's house?
A.	There were refugees who were just a bit further near the trading centre.  The vehicles first passed the trading centre, and when the refugees at the trading centre saw the vehicles, they came to warn those who were at the school and they passed -- then passed in front of my house. 
Q.	So it is now your testimony that the refugees did not flee after hearing -- after having heard gunshots, but because they were warned by other refugees from the trading centre; is that correct?
A.	Yes, the refugees came and warned the others.  I was with a man by the name of Nzaramda, and the refugees also warned him and he left immediately.  Nzaramda is N-Z-A-R-A-M-D-A. 
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, am I correct in saying, although I don't know your area very well and I don't claim to do so -- am I correct in saying that the trading centre is located on the main road of Gikomero secteur?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And your house, would I be correct in saying that your house is some 200 metres from the main road?
A.	The distance from my house to the main road is less than 200 metres. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
At this point, Your Honour, I'd like to introduce an exhibit taken from Exhibit Bundle P. 2, page 11, sketch B.  I believe the Defence have it and I've served copies on other parties.  If this can be shown to the witness.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, I have asked my colleague, Mr. Issa, to show you where the parish is located on this sketch.  Now, if I can just give you a quick background, this is a document that was produced by someone who works in our office.  He didn't estimate the distances; they were actually measured.  So I hope you'll take my word for it that these are accurate distances.  Can you see -- can you see on the plan, on the sketch, where the parish is located?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you see the secteur office?
A.	Yes, I see the secteur office. 
Q.	Can you see the main road?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you also see the indication below the road that leads to the parish -- the figure 200 metres?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And it is correct to say that your house was located (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal); is that right?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So would you acknowledge the figure given in this sketch, that the distance between your house and the main road -- not even your house and the trading centre but your house and the main road - (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John, that is a protected witness.  I'm going to have to redact the specific information concerning the location of the house of this witness and place it under seal.  Now, if you intend to pursue this line, we will have to go into closed session, because you cannot -- I don't see how you could deal with it in open session.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I had hoped to avoid it by not mentioning the area itself and simply referring to "school" or "trading centre", but I defer to your better judgment.  If you think it would be best that we go into closed session, by all means we can do so. .
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much more time do you think you have overall? 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I think approximately -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I think approximately about an hour, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And how much time do you have in closed session? 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Bearing in mind that I hadn't planned to go into closed session, I would imagine it wouldn't take more than a few minutes just to deal with this geographical point.  I don't think it will take more than maybe five minutes at maximum.
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if I can assist.  We have had the witness's response -- a distance which is remarkably accurate in fact, and we can see the plan and I take no -- we can draw our own conclusions, I would have thought, from the plan.  The plan isn't disputed; it's accepted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We were just concerned about the publication of the identity of the witness by an accurate description of the location of her home.  That was the simple point that bothered us.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
We can go into closed session for five minutes, if that is okay.  That way we can clear everything on this line of questioning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I think that we should go into closed session.  For the benefit of the public, we take our adjournment today at 12.30.  If we go into closed session now, we will not resume in open session.  This matter will resume on Monday morning.  We think the closed session is necessary to protect the identity of the witness.  We go into closed session now.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 31 to 34] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
