PROFESSOR FRANCOIS XAVIER BANGAMWABO
CROSS-EXAMINATION

BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I am going to you ask a series of questions and I will appreciate it if you can answer me with a yes or no answer or briefly, where you can, so that we can move forward. 
A.	Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Can the witness be shown the document containing the CV.  I am not sure of the exhibit number.
MR. KIYEYEU:
That should be 51(A).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it in English? 
MR. KIYEYEU: 
Yes, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Do you have it in --
MR. HINDS:
It is in English, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is in English?
MR. KIYEYEU:
Okay, 51(A) and (B), My Lord.
MS. OJEMENI:
I am requesting for 51(A), please, the English translation.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, are you a historian or political analyst?
A.	Well, no, but I am an observer of the Rwandan national scene.
Q.	Is it your testimony that there is nowhere on that document, Exhibit 51(A), is it indicated that you are either a historian or a political analyst?
A.	That is true.
Q.	Your expertise is linguistics, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Are you a general linguistic (sic) or applied or social linguistic?  Which one is your expertise?
A.	I studied linguistics in general.  I studied linguistics and French grammar, but in my research work, I specialise in the field of social linguistics.
Q.	When did you do your research for your thesis?
A.	I conducted my research work between 1985 and 1989, that is in the formal manner, but this is research work that I had already started when I was a teacher as part of my professional activities.
Q.	How long did the research work take you?
A.	Officially, it is four years, but as I said, I started earlier on getting interested in the field of social linguistics.
Q.	Was it after --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just a minute, Counsel.  Witness, you can just slow down a bit.  We would like the translation to come through easily for us to follow, those who follow the proceedings in English, please.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q. Was it after your qualification of DE as reflected on your CV?  DEA, I am sorry.  That's diploma -- 
A.	De studies?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Where are you referring to, Counsel with regard to 51(A)?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are you referring to --
MS. OJEMENI:
I am referring to Exhibit 51(A).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, which area?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Under Item 2, educational background, page 1.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Okay.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	I can't speak French very well, but the abbreviation (sic) is DEA and the full meaning is in brackets.
A.	The DEA is part of the PhD programme.  So the period that is covered by the DEA is part and parcel of the third cycle programme.
Q.	I presume in conducting your research you carried out field studies and evaluated the data you have entered; didn't you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And before you arrived at any conclusion in your research work, you had sufficient empirical date; isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Witness, did you receive any outstanding reward in the area of your expertise?
A.	I do not clearly understand the question, if you are talking about my research work or if you are talking about an academic -- an area which is outside the academic programme.
Q.	I am referring to your area of linguistic --
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I didn't understand the question.  Is it reward or award, that she asked on?  
MS. OJEMENI:
I am posing the question, Your Honour.
MR. HINDS:
Well, I am saying, counsel, I don't understand whether you said reward or award.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you.  I think the witness has also said he didn't quite understand my question.  I am rephrasing it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, my question is on award.  I said outstanding award on your area of expertise, as you told this Court, you are a linguist:  So do you by any chance have any outstanding award on that field?
A.	Well, the first award that I could refer to is that on the distinction that I got at the end of the programme itself.  I had a very honourable distinction which is the highest in the university programme.  Beyond that, if you are talking about award after training programme, after the university programme itself, well then, there is none as such but, I have been invited to give various lectures in areas outside the university.
Q.	This is distinction you have just mentioned, wouldn't it have enhanced your CV if you had indicated so on Exhibit 51(A)?
A.	It so happened that all the information cannot appear on the CV, but obviously, it appears on the degree itself.  It is not possible to put everything on the CV, otherwise the CV becomes too busy and not very useful.
Q.	Now, is it your testimony that you have not been awarded any recognition by anybody or university apart from the distinction that you got in your studies, in your certificate?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And are you referring the PhD or was it the diploma or your DEA, which one?
A.	Are you -- the DEA is a third cycle degree in the French university system.  It comes after the masters and it's a programme that is preparatory to the doctorate programme.  It is done -- it covers one year during which you have seminars, courses and so on and so forth, and then after that you start writing your thesis.  So it's a degree that you take prior to the PhD degree itself.  It is a third cycle degree which is part of the PhD programme.
Q.	Witness, my question is whether the distinction that you have just told this Court that you received was in respect of your PhD degree or the masters or your bachelor, which one does it reflect on?
A.	I think your question is a bit ambiguous because there are various cycles within the university programme.  The first university cycle ends with a BA, a BA degree.  And the second cycle in the Belgian system is crowned by a degree which is called Licence which is equivalent to the masters in the French programme.  And the third cycle, the third cycle is the PhD which is preceded by a DEA degree.  So, when I am talking about the degree which I got at the end of my training, then I am talking about a PhD programme which is the end -- which is a degree you get at the end of your studies, your third cycle studies.
Q.	The -- which distinction in respect to the PhD programme?
A.	Yes, it refers to the PhD.
Q.	Do you have any previous record of testifying as an expert in any court prior to your testimony in this case?
A.	No.
Q.	Now, we move over to your report.  Could you tell this Court what, the terms of your reference for this report were, when you were commissioned by the Defence to prepare the report?
A.	Now, if you allow me a few moments before I answer your question, I will say that human sciences are sciences that are inter-penetrating, they overlap.  In a course of research work, particularly in the field of social linguistics, it is obvious that the focus is not exclusively to linguistics.  It extends very wide in the sense that during the programme you have courses in anthropology, ethnology 
psycho-linguistics, Rwandan literature and so on and so forth, such that at a given point, these sciences overlap and then at one point history comes in -- into this field of social linguistics.  

Now, to answer your question correctly, I would say that the area that are needed to focus on are those elements that appear in the title, that is; inter-relationships in Rwanda, the October conflict, the multi-party system in Rwanda and the implications of the conflicts, and all these events on the events of 1994. 
Q.	Witness, as a professor and a consultant, you understand my question very well.  My question is not on the area you concentrated, my question is on the terms of reference you received from the Defence for the preparation of this report.
A.	Just give me a moment to look for the document.  The document was in English.  It has no French translation and I am not very good in English, so you bear with my pronunciation.  The terms of reference are drafted as follows --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Start again, please, slowly.
THE WITNESS: 
"To undertake research on the history of the inter-ethnic relationships in Rwanda, the armed conflict of October 1990 and its implications on the events of 1994, the history of multi-party system, the implications of the armed conflict of 1990 on the events of 1994, and the dispelling linguistic myth associated with Rwandan terminologies such Interahamwe, Inkotanyi, Inyenzi, to write an expert report to this trial before the Trial Chamber II of the ICTR."  Yes, those are the terms of reference.
Q.	And subsequently, so the letter commissioning you in which those terms of reference were stated, you had discussions with Defence on how to proceed; didn't you?
A.	Yes, we worked together.
Q.	Now, Witness, I observe that in your response, paragraph 7 to be precise of your affidavit --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Paragraph?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Paragraph 7 to be precise.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	In the affidavit you filed in response to our motion challenging his expertise, that you argued as an author of a book that you worked extensively, you worked with extensive collaboration with your colleagues.  Now, my question is this:  In the scholarly world, no work produced by collaboration is ever seen as the work of a single author; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes, it's a team work.
Q.	Your argument is that you are author, you base your expertise on the fact that you are an author of a book; isn't it?
A.	It is stated that I am a co-author of the work and in the preface, the conditions under which the work was produced are indicated, that can be seen in the affidavit, and I believe I never said anywhere that I was the sole author of this book.
Q.	Even that, even as the co-author, Witness, you will agree with me that the author of that book is actually all the people that participated in the book; isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You agree with me that each author in that book worked independent of the other in writing his own article in either one or two chapters; isn't it?
A.	No, I am telling you, because I was there, I worked on this document, and I have told you the conditions under which we worked.  I am the one who knows how the work, this work was done, not you.
Q.	Do you have the book with you?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Turn to page 10.
A.	There is nothing on page 10.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I crave your indulgence to have a look at the book, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Yes, you mean the witness's book?
MS. OJEMENI: 
The witness's book.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  It's okay.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, it might take five minutes to find it.  It is in French, so it will be a bit difficult for me to look at.  I just want to draw the witness's attention to a particular paragraph.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
MS. OJEMENI: 
Just two minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please, go ahead.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Can the witness be shown this?  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you take a look at page 9, first paragraph; can you read it?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page 9?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Page 9 first paragraph; can you read the entire paragraph, the first paragraph, about four lines?
A.	Yes.  The following is what appears:  "The study was prepared by a multidisciplinary team of qualified lecturers or teachers."
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slowly, slowly again. 
THE WITNESS: 
Les études
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, for the record, let me read the title of the book and the page.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, can you read the title of that book?  Can you start with the title of the book?
A.	Yes, the title is: The inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda -- inter-relations in Rwanda in the light of the aggression or the attack of October 1990, genesis, foundation and prospects.  Let me repeat for me to me more complete:  Inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda, the attack of October 1990, genesis, undercurrents and prospects.
Q.	Witness, now can you read the first paragraph on page 9 of that book, and please read slowly?
A.	Yes:  "The study was prepared -- the study was prepared by a multidisciplinary team of experienced teachers or lecturers.  Each lecturer was the main author of one or two chapters.  However, the general introduction, the conclusion and the recommendations were written collectively."  That is the end of the paragraph.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I crave your indulgence again to look at that paragraph, myself, just one second.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, how could you then say that you wrote the book collectively, the entire -- your article in particular, given what you have just read?  Do you still maintain the view that you wrote your article in collaboration with the rest of authors, apart from the lecturer 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Witness, I haven't finished.  Apart from the lecturer that contributed to your article, that is, who is mentioned against the topic of your wri - of your topic, the topic you participated in, in that book?  I will produce my question again: is the topic you participated in, was done in collaboration with another lecturer; is that correct?  That's my first question; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How then, do you then, given the topic, given what you have written and what you have read to the Court now concerning how the articles were written, do you still maintain the view that that book was written collectively by all the authors that participated in their various topics?
A.	I stand by my position, and I can explain it, if you so wish, if you allow me to do so.  If we come back to the paragraph which I have just read out, and if we examine in depth, I would say, the said paragraph, it is mentioned that this was a multidisciplinary team involved; it is not said that these were articles which were picked here and there by someone who was supposed to coordinate that material.  The project was conceived of together, discussed together, and the division of labour was principally done as a team, together.  So this is a multidisciplinary team.  I then went on to read that each lecturer was the main author or, if you wish, the coordinator for the writing of that particular chapter.  So if you wish, what happened was, there were discussions, there were discussions, debates, and each lecturer had an aspect which was predominant, and when we make reference to main author or principal author, it means the others would also contribute, given their different disciplines and also with the framework of culture and the history of Rwanda.  At that level, the discussions were open.  But with regard to the main author who was the leader of the team for that particular aspect, discussions were open on all aspects with this division of labour or assignment of tasks.  Each chapter did have a principal author, but the others contributed, given their various specialities.  

If we are talking about the collective writing of the introduction, the conclusions and the  recommendations, that is another aspect, because in that particular context, we had agreed on all aspects involved, including the formal aspects, by which I mean the writing, the terms to be used, the full-stops, the commas and so on and so forth.  So, as I have said, I stand by what I said because the article does indeed even reflect what actually happened.
Q.	Witness, how many historians participated in that book?
A.	We have page 8, and we have the qualifications of the participants or contributors, and we have two historians, Rumiya and Nyagahene.  Rumiya is spelt, R-U-M-I-Y-A, Jean Robert.  And then there was Antoine Nyagahene.  Nyagahene is spelt as follows: N-Y-A-G-A-H-E-N-E.  These were people who had doctorates in in-depth studies in history or history in general.  I believe I have answered your question, and we will deal with the three elements later on.
Q.	And the names of each author is -- of a chapter, is written against the topic of that chapter; isn't it?
A.	The names of the authors provide the principal authors or drafters of each chapter, and that is what appears at the top of each chapter within the text.
Q.	And you participated in your area of expertise, which is linguistics, isn't it?
A.	I participated in that area, but also in others regarding the history of Rwanda.  I contributed to the theme which we discussed.  The theme to which I did not contribute is the theme concerning -- the theme developed by the geographers, because that is really a subject which is far removed from my specialisation, far from my field of qualification and my knowledge is very limited therein.  I contributed mainly to the themes which developed the Gihanga myth, for instance, because that is part of Rwandan literature, and that is under chapter 2, which was written by Emmanuel Rukiramakuba. There I participated and contributed significantly because we were developing aspects which I was conversant with.  I also contributed to the themes developed by Eustache Munyantwali regarding -- Munyantwali is spelt, M-U-N-Y-A-N-T-W-A-L-I.  He develops the subject of ideology and mentality.  That's an area which is interest to me, so we discussed this subject before he wrote the chapter as the principal author.  I also contributed to the aspects developed by Rumiya on socio-politics because that is part of the recent history, and very intellectual in Rwanda is aware of this, and more so because there are social linguistic aspects which are involved, for instance, the manipulation of discourse and so on and so forth.  I also participated, together with the same Rumiya, on the chapter on the war of October. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter did not get the full name of that chapter because we don't have a copy of this thing to start with.
THE WITNESS: 
It was Rumiya who developed this theme, I mean he was the principal author of that chapter.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, so in respect of the three chapters that you just mentioned, your name did not appear against the chapter, the topics; does it?
A.	That is true, but once again, this was for practical reasons.  I stand by what I said about the main chapter which talks about the principal writers and other authors who participated.  I have also told you how we worked, what my mythology was.  We would have been able to speak simply of the chapters, but this was specifically for control reason that we included the principal author, who was well-versed with the subject of the chapter, with qualifications and various degrees, and this is why we proceeded in that manner.
Q.	My last question on this book, and please answer, yes or no, your name and another lecturer's name appeared against the topic "demystification", of the key words, of the key terms used in the conflict; isn't it?
A.	You say another name appears, I don't quite understand your question, if you please.
Q.	Turn to page 223 of that book.
A.	Yes, I am with you. 
Q.	On the topic -- under the names of the two people against the topic on that chapter?
A.	Yes, the title of the chapter is:  Vocabulary and discourse of the Inkotanyi and allies as the names or principal author you have Francois Xavier Bangamwabo and you have Emmanuel Rukiramakuba.  This is the first time that we are coming across Rukiramakuba and I will spell his name.  It is spelt R-U-K-I-R-A-M-A-K-U-B-A.
Q.	Now, Witness, does your name appear against any other chapter in that book, yes or no, please?
A.	It doesn't appear, but I have explained to you this spirit under which we worked in the writing of this book.
Q.	Thank you.  Let's turn to your report before this Tribunal.  Could you tell the Court what scientific method you adopted in preparing this report?
A.	Could you please repeat your question?  I do not --
Q.	You have been accredited an expert by the Tribunal based on the report you testified on yesterday --
MR. HINDS:
Objection, objection, Your Honour.  That was not the basis upon which this Tribunal recognised Professor Bangamwabo as an expert; it was not on his report.  I mean it is just -- is not true.  That is not the basis upon which this Tribunal -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you for your correction.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you were accredited an expert yesterday, and you have since testified in favour of Kajelijeli's team; isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you testified extensively on the report that you prepared pursuant to the terms of reference that you have read previously, given to you by the Defence; isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, could you tell the Court the method you adopted in choosing your sources for the report?
A.	In the drafting of my report, I selected the sources which were of some relevance either historically or ideologically speaking and also obviously relevant to socio-linguistics.  It is obvious that in my approach I did not want to repeat things already said by others, and that is why that explains the substance of my report.  But if we are talking about a critical approach, questioning the facts, interpreting the facts, interpreting the terms or terminology given what is included in the objective, in other words, inter-ethnic relations, studying these aspects in the light of the events which took place in the country in 1994.
Q.	Witness, if I understood you correctly, you just said that you did not want to repeat what was said by others.  What do you mean by that?
A.	There you are confusing me because I did not speak about the co-authors.  In the report, I was not referring to the book.  In the report, what I have done -- I said that I didn't want to repeat what was said.  And in approach, I wanted to make a new contribution, in other words, look at the material under a different light.  I therefore did not refer to the book.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I think the question was, what sources, if any, that you may have used in drafting your report.  Was that the question?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What sources you based your conclusions in the report? 
A.	As for the references, I indicate them as I go along -- in the body report I mention them, I quote them, and in some cases, I have added annexes for aspects which needed to be looked at, at greater depth, but otherwise I mentioned the references as the report progressed.
Q.	What method then did you use in choosing the sources?
A.	I chose the sources depending on their relevance to the subject under discussion.  Also, in respect of certain critique that they included.  So it was using that methodology that I selected my sources to prepare and support my argument, and this is the method that I prefer to use.
Q.	Witness, are you aware that there are abundant literature and reports on the events that took place in Rwanda in 1994, aren't you?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Are you aware of the reports such as the one prepared by the OAU, Eminent Persons Report and several other reports?
A.	That is correct.  I know that are many reports which exist, but apparently they were not sufficient because they could have helped in finding a solution to the problems.  Furthermore, each person looks at the problems in his or her own way.  The problems require a series of visions, of analyses.  So, I know that other reports exist and amongst those reports there are some which were accessible to me, because you also need to consider the conditions under which I was working.  There is this problem of accessibility to these reports that you are referring to. But I know that these reports exist and I they do not say the same things.  That's the least that one can say.
Q.	Is it your evidence that you didn't conduct sufficient research in preparing this report because of availability of sources; is it?
A.	I did not say that I did not carry out adequate research.  I am convinced that what I did is amply sufficient to support the conclusions I reached and to support the point of view I expressed. 
Q.	Now, Witness, could you turn to page 1 of your report.
A.	Yes, I am there.
Q.	Can I draw your attention to paragraph 1, line 7, and it reads --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Paragraph?
MS. OJEMENI:
Paragraph 1 line 7.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be page 3?
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 3, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In English?
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 3 in English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In French, it should be --
THE WITNESS: 
What would be this page in French?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Page 3 as well.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Line 7 of the English text.  This should be -- I will read and you will find it:  "This problem that has always poisoned the relationships between the human groups in Rwanda."  Have you seen it?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That would page 2 in the English version, page 2, paragraph 1, line 7.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 3 not 2. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
In the French, in the French, page 2 paragraph 1 line 7.
MS. OJEMENI:
The copy we have is page 3 in French.  
MR. HINDS:
I am sorry, it's page 3 in the English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is 2 in French.
MR. HINDS:
It's 3 in English, Your Honour .
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have located it, yes.
MR. HINDS:
And the term is not "relationships", but "relations".  I don't see any relationships in that sentence.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I take it again: "It is this problem that has always poisoned the relations between the human groups in Rwanda."  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And this conclusion, or this assertion runs through your report and my question is this:  Was there never a time when relations between Hutu and Tutsi were good in Rwanda?
A.	As I said yesterday, there was a succession of events.  And I said that it was at the beginning of 1973 that we had the least possible tension between the ethnic groups in Rwanda, and, therefore, ideologically and fundamentally, citizens were equal before the law.  That is what the authorities were saying.  But subsequently, even when there was no war, when there was conflict, there was this institutionalised inequality and the fact that people were not revolting -- there some revolts, but the fact that people were not revolting, the fact that people were resigned to the situation and kept quiet, did not necessarily mean that there was peace in the society.  And that is what happened during a major portion of history.  There was a group that dominated and there was a group that was in domination, but they were bowed in resignation.
Q.	If I understand you correctly, you are saying that there has never been any variation in the relationship between Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda; am I correct?
A.	I don't know what you mean by variation, but I said that up until 1959, there was at the level of the state in what was called Rwanda then, there was a domination of one group by the other; there was no equality.  And this domination, I did say, was institutionalised because it was part of the ideology of the then authority, of the then government.  I can give you an  example during the colonisation, the chapter -- that the name of the reigning Tutsi king was so, in other words, the Tutsi was always -- and during that period, you cannot say that there was peace, there was equality, there was harmony, for as long as there was one dominant group which raised to the level of ideology, institutionalised the domination of one group by the other and other group should serve another group.  And for us to have what we say in Kinyarwanda Abagarabu.  And for Abagarabu, and that was a society built on servitude.  I will give you an example, for a long time African Americans had to bear slavery in silence.  Sometimes, there were revolts which were crashed, but when they kept quiet and continued with their activities as slaves, you cannot say that there was peace.  This domination, and that is what was happening in Rwanda, and that at the same conditions, there was an institutionalisation of inequality.  Even if in the dominant group, and there were some members who could be victims, but there was also institutionalisation.  And to the extent that, there was institutionalisation of inequality, of exploitation, of oppression, you cannot talk about peace, even if the oppressed people don't complain for centuries upon centuries.
Q.	Witness, could you then tell the Court which group was actually dominating the other in 1994?
A.	I think it is much more complex than that.  I will say that in 1994 or even before 1994, we talked about peace, harmony, and I gave -- I made reference to testimony in that respect.  It is true that we should distinguish between the individual and the state that institutionalised inequality.  In 1994 we were in a peculiar situation.  That was three years or about three and a half years after the onset of the conflict which was bringing or which was rekindling the tension that existed before then and which led some people to bring to the country in the state that we found ourselves.  I am saying that it is the tensions that brought the country to that level, because among Rwandans there some who had maintained the spirit or had maintained the spirit or ideas which prevailed before 1959. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you say to the question then?  What would be the answer to counsel's questions?  We follow the explanation.
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you very much.  That is a group which dominated the other in 1994.  Well, if I do not take into account the tension of the war, there was no dominant group as such; some were more visible because they are more numerous, but I did say that that the person I quoted, Nyetera, I mentioned his name yesterday, Nyetera gave the areas in which the Tutsis -- the economy was in the hands of the Tutsis.  But obviously the Hutu were more visible because statistically they were more numerous, and in some areas they were more Tutsi than Hutu.  So there was kind of distribution.  So because it is rarely that you find a mathematical situation in terms of who is dominating.  In 1994, before the onset of the war, there was not -- there was not an ideology that made one group the dominant group over the other.  There was no official doctrine coming from the leaders of the state which institutionalised inequality by saying that the Tutsis should be servants of the Hutus and so on and so forth.  That is the aspect that I am emphasising because this is the most important aspect.
Q.	Witness, it is your evidence that at any given time in Rwanda, there was inequality, one group was dominating the other.  My question is this: Isn't it true that between January and July 1994, the Hutus were dominating the Tutsi?
A.	What is the basis of these dominations beginning January 1994?  What are the indications that point to the fact that beginning this date the Hutus were dominating the Tutsi?
Q.	Based on what you have told the Court that any given time one group is dominating the other.  So if my question or statement is wrong, you correct me.
A.	Yes.  Let me go back to what said.  I do not see an ideology up to 1994, at least up to 6 April, between 1959 and 1960 and 1994 I do not see an ideology which places one ethnic group above another one.  That is what I am saying.  I do not see that ideology.  It is possible that somebody might err in that direction, but he might be going so individually, but there is no ideology that preaches inequality or which preaches the domination of one group by another group during that period.
MR. PRESIDENT:
 We want to follow you, Witness -- sorry Counsel.  You are talking about ideology; what do you mean by that?  There must be an ideology; what do you mean by that?  We would like to follow you.  Can things be factually based?  We are not the experts in the area of language or politics for that matter, but we would like to follow your evidence as an expert, please.
THE WITNESS: 
I am going to speak in more, simpler terms.  I was saying that up until 1959, there was this widespread idea which was maintained, thought through the elite, through the myth of the Gihanga, which asserted, which explained, which spread the domination of one group over another; that is the Tutsi over the Hutus.  That is how it happened.  Our common father decreed the following, that you the Batutsi would dominate your Gahutu brother, and you the Gahutu, because you have done this, I mentioned this yesterday, I punish you and I banish you to the slave of your brother.  I even made some reference to some variance, that it's a God, that is, God Mana in Kinyarwanda, after testing one and the other realised that the Gahutu was not intelligent, was not prudent, whereas his brother is more intelligent, so he blesses one and banishes the other.   That is what, as I said, explains and justifies the idea of domination of one group over the other, and which makes them accept this fact as being a natural fact.  And that is perpetuated through the various reigns of kings, that it was normal for a Tutsi to be king and it was normal for the Hutu to be servant, and that until the revolution.  Now, with the 1959 revolution, this was born out of challenging, come as a result of challenging the pre-established ideas.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't want to go over to that.  I don't -- it's, it's --  we understand where you came from about your testimony yesterday, but we are talking about if the question was based on the events of 1994.  We are aware of that ideology, if that is the ideology that you are talking about.  Is that the ideology you are referring to in answer to counsel's question because we want to understand you?
THE WITNESS:  
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about, you know, yesterday and how things were got through, but we are with the events to 1994 and 1990 and what have you.  When you talk about that ideology, when you say there was no ideology that would make another one prominent, what do you mean?  We are aware of what you told about in 199 - at the beginning of your testimony yesterday about, you know, the past.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think he is pointing out the ideology of the past as compared to the present --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no.  Just a minute.  We are talking with regard to the events of 1994, 1990 when -- this is what we want to understand.  When he talks about ideology, we are asking what kind of ideology does he have in mind.  Here, he has now started talking about the events.  He did - ideology, as we -- as he testified, you know.  Yes, that we understood and we have followed very closely.  The question is:  Is that the ideology that he is addressing the issues at the end of 1994?  You can go on, counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I think my learned friend should be aware that we re dealing with an enlightened professor and not an illiterate, so he understands the questions being put to him.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please go on.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you now explain the ideology you were referring to, in 1994?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The absence of it.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS: 
Well, I went back to what I was saying so as to come back to this issue, what was referred to as dominant ideology in 1994.  It is that under the republican government, the ideology was the equality of citizens before the law, justice, democracy and the fact that the people elect their leaders.  That was the republican and democratic ideology.  Now, in 1994, we are in a war situation, conflict situation between, I would say, two different conceptions or models.  There is a republican model which fights for the values of the 1959 revolution, that is, republican value which talk about the equality of citizens, and another model which was saying that '59 was an aberration and that we should come back to the situation that prevailed before the revolution.  That raises a problem.  So, if you wish, in 1994 we were in a conflict situation, a situation of conflict between the two different models, between those who want to go back to pre-1959 situation; it cannot be otherwise.  I was trying to understand the alternative, but the challenging of 1959 is just the challenging of the principles of equality and social justice.  So, in 1994 the dominant ideology, well, in any event before the conflict, the ideology was the republican democratic ideology with all its implications in terms of justice, equality, democracy.
Q.	Witness, on what source do you base this conclusion of the ideology in place in 1994?
A.	Are you talking about the republican ideology or the alternative, those who are preaching the alternative?
Q.	Okay.  You've testified on two models, right, in respect of this ideology?  According to you, the ideology that was in existence in 1959 was not in existence, was not in place in 1994; am I correct?
A.	Between '59 and '94, yes.
Q.	In fact, no group was dominating the other in 1994, is that what you are -- is that correct?
A.	No, except that we were in a conflict situation. 
Q.	And there were two ideologies in place in 1994, one is a group wanting the ideology of 199 -- that existed between 1959 and 1973 to return; is that correct?  Before 1959, the return of the ideology that was in existence before 1959?  And then another group is the group that wanted the ideology that existed in terms of multiparty system; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  In 1994 we were in the midst of a conflict that started in 1990.  The conflict that started with those who represented the former regime who wanted to bring back that ideology, in terms of ethnic groups, since this is the implication on people.  There was no ideology, as I repeated, which preached the domination of one group over the other, since the question was whether there was no dominant group in 1994.  And I did say that there was no dominant group because the existing ideology as at then preached equality.
Q.	Now, my question is, how did you arrive at that conclusion that there was no ideology in 1994 in terms of domination of, I mean, of groups, dominations of groups?  How did you arrive at that conclusion?
A.	First of all, if I take into account the socio-political evolution from 1959 to 1990 and if I analyse the programme manifestos of the political parties that were active in 1994, I come to the conclusion that, at least as far as the Rwandan state was concerned, as it existed up until then, up to 1994, there was no political party that preached the domination of one group over the other.  However, when I analyse the media of the Rwandan diaspora, those who prepared the war, the literature that talked about what to do once they get there and which describes the ideology of the RPF, I realise that there was this idea of challenging the social revolution of 1959.  It is clear there are a lot of assertions in that vein, and even the position of the RPF supports that, that the challenge, that the achievements of the social revolution of 1959 so on and so forth.  So, my conclusion is based on all these facts and on observation of what was happening on the field, but also based on information coming from here and there.
Q.	Is it fair to say then, that your conclusion in that regard, in terms of the absence of the ideology of the group, of the ethnic group seeking to dominate the other, is based on your personal knowledge?  Is it fair to say so?
A.	But I have just said, I have just made reference to the sources that I consulted.  I just didn't sit down and draft it.  I first of all pointed out the sources.  I made references to the programmes and manifestos of political parties, a document that talked about the history of Rwanda, the evolution from  1959 and then the publications, media of the Rwanda diaspora in relation to socio-political situation as they saw it - as they saw the future.  And I have given references to this.  And in the report, I have made reference to some sources.  Well, these are quotations, sentences, but they contain information at that point to those conclusions.
	(Pages 1 to 17 by Petrus Chijarira)



1030H
Q.	What is the name of the document that you have just referred to that is on the history of Rwanda that you consulted in coming to this conclusion; what's the name? 
A.	First of all, there is the book you are referring to, that is, the interethnic relations, and the document that I mentioned in the bibliography.  It is there.  You have all those elements.  Historically, I was more interested in Louis de Lacger, that is page 59, and then I was interested in the interethnic relations -- the book on interethnic relations which gives an overview -- which gives a presentation from the historical standpoint on events as they occurred in 1959, followed by specific analysis.  So this is not something just from the top of my head or which I invented. 
Q.	Witness, we move on to the same page, page 3, English translation, and page 2, of the French, the original document.  And I draw your attention to paragraph 2, the first two lines, where you talked about the Gihanga myth.  And it reads: "In fact, the Gihanga, 'myth'" -- even though the translation is "legend", but you've talked about "myth" extensively, and that's what it is, not 'legend' -- "sanctioned the domination of Hutus and Twas by Tutsis, and allowed the latter to impose a feudal system based on serfdom".  Witness, you agree with me that the meaning of feudalism is a decentralised political structure based on control of land, isn't it? 
A.	I don't know -- I don't know how this term applies within the context of Rwanda, because there is land and there is cattle.  I did not make extensive reference to cattle or even land.  What I was interested in was domination in all aspects.  In the case of Rwanda, the feudal system was based essentially on cattle, because cattle represents economic power.  Land comes in, in the sense that it represents pasture.  Well, obviously one needs to eat and to grow crops, but economic power in Rwanda at that time was based on the possession of cattle.  The feudalist system in Rwanda and economic power as at then was cattle and not land. 
Q.	But, witness, one thing is certain, you agree with me that the meaning of feudalism is what I have just stated; am I correct? 
A.	Well, words are used, but they adapt to the local context, and I have said that the feudal system in Rwanda was based on cattle.  Elsewhere it could be based on money, it could be based on land, but in the case of Rwanda, power was based on cattle, and cattle also enable you to control land.  Those who had cattle needed land for purposes of grazing their cattle. 
Q.	So you agree with me that Rwanda, from time immemorial, is centralised and, therefore, cannot be called feudal? 
A.	I don't know if we understand each other clearly.  Rwanda has not been a centralised state from time immemorial.  It's like all societies; it started somehow and extended and developed. 

So the system of serfdom was limited -- could be limited to a small area, but it could also be extended to a more -- a bigger area.  A Rwanda centralised, as you are saying, I don't know whether you mean by that Rwanda as it is centralised within its borders today.  
But even oral traditions from the royal courts have indicated where it was supposed to have been born in Gasabo, and from there it extended through conquests, agreements and so on and so forth.  So it was not within the current borders, and that it is centralised is something that came with time. 

But if we talk about Rwanda as it is today, we see the map as it is.  But the map then was not -- in the year 1900, for example, the map is not what it is today.  So the feudalist system is not a characteristic of the space that it covers, but the ideology that underpins it. 
Q.	Witness, what is serfdom? 
A.	In the framework or in the context of Rwanda? 
Q.	Yes, we are talking in the context of Rwanda.
A.	Yes, the specific term in Kinyarwanda is ubuhake.  Serfdom is a translation of ubuhake.  I can spell that term if you wish.  It's spelt U-B-U-H-A-K-E, ubuhake.  What does it mean?  It means that relations between men were based on that principle.  Each person needed to have his protector, and that was not the state.  Each one had to look for someone else, stronger than himself, to protect him. 

Furthermore, in order to exert one's influence, one needed to have people in their service, servants or slaves if you wish, but these would be people dependent upon him.  So the system functioned in that manner. 

There was a shebuja, the chief, or some people speak of a sovereign.  There was someone who had subjects dependent upon him, worked for him and who were subject to him.  Quite often one said that one could change one's boss or chief, but this happened insofar as the person or the servant found a stronger boss than the previous boss.  So this was a situation of dependence of others upon others.  It's not in the sense of a state protecting individuals, but it was this ubuhake which ensured the protection of individuals. 

The unmugaragu, the one who is subject to a higher person, needed to provide services to his boss, the person referred to as shebuja in Kinyarwanda -- maybe I can spell that term -- because that shows the relationships or relations between Rwandan groups, and unmugaragu was the one who was the servant.  It's spelt U-N-M-U-G-A-R-A-G-U; that's the person who is dominated.  And shebuja, the dominant element, it's spelt S-H-E-B-U-J-A. 

The relations between these people was often referred to as an agreement which was voluntary.  But who wants to be subject to another person voluntarily?  But it was intended for protection because the system was dominated by persons who grabbed everything they found in their path, using the economic power, which was cattle, or the cow, at the time.  It wasn't the Hutus who possessed cattle; it was the Tutsis. 
Q.	Witness, you agree with me that, as a linguist, you are having a bit of difficulty trying to invade the area of a historian, because "serfdom" to a linguist, and the meaning of "serfdom" is a system whereby people were fixed on land controlled by a lordly class.  Rwandan people are not fixed to land; they are free.  Even up to colonial days, they were free and they moved about freely.  How could you use the word "serfdom" to describe the situation in Rwanda in 19 -- October 1990, as you've done here? 
A.	I do not quite understand your question.
Q.	My question is this: you agree with me that "serfdom" means a system whereby people were fixed on land controlled by a lordly class.
A.	I told you how the system operated in Rwanda.  I also gave you the terminology used to define those involved in the system.  I am saying to you that the unmugaragu depended upon his shebuja.  Now, when you say he was free, how could he have been free whereas he had to provide services?  Let's take the example of someone whose job was to look after his boss's cattle.  How would he be free when, whereas, he has to spend the whole day herding the call and milking them in the evening or in the morning?  How was he free?  Or let's take someone who needed to work regularly for his boss for nothing.  How was he free?  Even if he had to work three days a week, and sparing the rest of the week to his own needs, you realise that these three days that he gives to his boss would not be considerable in a system where there is full liberty.  How would you consider it that people are free when you are lashed?  

Yesterday we saw the example of Musinga who shows that he was advising measures to be taken against people who refused to work for nothing.  So how could you say that these people were free when they had to provide free services, they had to work for nothing, and there was no code, no specific code regulating the services?  It depended on each boss, each sub-chief or head of a hill who made them work.  There was no freedom. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, witness, was this sanction you mentioned in this statement that I read out, as a sanction of the Gihanga myth, was this sufficient to allow the establishment of Tutsi control over Hutu and Twa? 
A.	Are you referring to the Gihanga who said that you will do this and you will do that? 
Q.	I refer you once more to that statement, to the statement at the beginning of the second paragraph of the introduction part, and I read: "In fact the Gihanga myth sanctioned the domination of Hutus and Twas by Tutsis and allowed the latter to impose a feudal system based on serfdom".  And my question is now, given all the explanations you have given to the Court in respect of my questions, do you think that the Gihanga myth was sufficient to allow the establishment of Tutsi control over the Hutu, as you've demonstrated in that statement? 
A.	The Gihanga myth is an explanation which came after the events, and this is why I'm saying that it explains and justifies, and it is responding; in other words, it is what I would refer to as the ideologisation of inequality.  It's this search for an explanation, historic or natural explanation, in order to justify the situation obtaining at a particular point in time.  But we all agree that it was not used at the point of departure, because this is a myth.  

A myth is something which is made up.  It is intended to impose a model on those who are going to listen to the myth.  So it is something which is constructed in a very elaborate manner and it tries to justify, to explain, and tries to bring people to consider what is contained in the myth as something which is normal and something which is ideological.  Otherwise there are factors which intervene, in particular, power, domination, through conquest.  You try to pacify people and try to have them accept, and bring them to integrate within their conceptualisation, their vision of things, what the myth is transmitting.  But the myth is in the service of people who want to use it, because they want to bring the others to follow the content of the myth and have them consider the content of the myth as something which is quite normal and not subject to discussion. 

So, to be more specific in response to your question, I said this myth is not sufficient in and of itself.  It is something which is going to be used as an explanation when someone says, for instance, "Why do I have to work?  Why must I work for this person?  Why am I dominated?  Why am I not free?" and so on and so forth.
Q.	Didn't the military have something to do with this myth? 
A.	Which military? 
Q.	The military that was in existence then, the period that you're discussing now.  Didn't they have a role to play on the power, the domination, that was prevailing at that time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which time, counsel? 
MS. OJEMENI:
I'm referring to the time that he just -- the myth, when the myth was in existence; that's, in 1959 when the -- before the situation changed in 1959.  That's what I'm asking.
THE WITNESS:
You know, Rwanda, as I mentioned a moment ago, was built on -- was built within a system of conquest, so we had warrior kings.  In fact, all political, economic, military power was in the hands of the king and his entourage, his dynasty.  And, of necessity, it is difficult within that context to separate the military from the political, and sometimes the economic from the religious.  Sometimes the system was constructed in such a way that everything was in the hands of a man who was at one and the same time -- most of them were warrior kings, and, obviously, some fought more than others.  But, in principle, this involved a lot more aspects than they do right now.  So there was no military to one side, and I would say the system was a compact one.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, but it is still part of the history of Rwanda; that's why I brought it to the attention of the Tribunal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	We now move on to the same page where you talked about the RPF objective, and that's on the same second paragraph.  I read from eight -- line eight, the second paragraph:  "The republican regime had established egalitarian conditions, such that from 1973 especially, there was actual peace among the people in the country.  It was the first time in the history of the country that there had been the least tension possible between Hutus and Tutsis.  It was prompted by the notion of the 1959 monarchists, as it was revealed by reading the media, which prepared the attack, that the RPF launched the attack on Rwanda on 1st October 1990, even if the concept of the monarchy had since been put off indefinitely".  

My question is this, witness.  The objective to re-establish monarchy, which was said was the reason for the RPF's attack, my question is, why did -- if that was RPF's attack -- I mean, objective, why did they not notify the king, who was then in exile in Kenya, of their intentions? 
A.	I have indicated earlier that the media which prepared the war -- in other words, the media which questioned the ideology which had existed since 1959, preaching for a return to the past -- I am specifying that they were preaching the return of the monarchy, the return to the system which prevailed or obtained before 1959.  In reality, one needs to read between the lines and read the return to a system which was anti-republican as it had been set up. 

Now, the issue of wanting to know why the RPF did not inform the king to come back, those are complications of the search for power.  You need to know whether those who fought on the ground for power are ready and willing to hand it over to somebody else.  This is why we need to look at these later developments of the war, and they are probably elements linked to the rivalry between the former dominant Tutsi families, the families which had power in their hand.  There's a lot involved in all that, but what we realise is that, generally speaking, people who take power by force are not always willing to hand it over to someone else so willingly. 
Q.	Witness, why did RPF put off indefinitely the restoration of the monarchy? 
A.	That's a question I cannot respond to; cannot answer.  What we need to know is that before the -- before the attack, there are many groups, for instance, IMPURUZA, which is spelt I-M-P-U-R-U-Z-A, which became prestigious.  So there are a lot of these writings, the literature, which preached the return of the monarchy and the king.  

After the victory of the RPF this matter was referred to marginally.  It was not returned to, and I wouldn't be able to explain, I, myself, why this subject, which so impassioned people, and which was preached by the people in the diaspora who had fled and who were intending to come back, I wouldn't be able to explain why the return of the monarchy, given the victory of the RPF, had been set aside.  I'm totally unable to explain that to you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	So the conclusion here, on that statement, you didn't base your conclusion on any source? 
A.	No, I have indicated the sources on which I based my statements.  But I'm not a prophet.  Political strategies have their own exigencies.  The fact that the RPF took over power, that established a new context, a new situation, and gave an explanation or a reason for people to remain where they were, those who so wished.  And I have nothing to say about this.  

I think it was in nine years -- nine years today, after the RPF came to power.  Many things have changed in the minds of people on the ground.  I wasn't saying that the RPF was going to reinstate the monarchy.  What I'm saying is that those who contributed to building the awareness amongst people who supported the armed conflict, the war, they also supported the people who mobilised the return -- for the return of the king -- people who had fled the consequences of the '59 revolution.  This was an opinion which was at one time abandoned, and I cannot explain why.  And having said that, I am not going to predict something which is going to happen.  I am talking about things which happened and I am basing this on published works.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, looking at the time, I know it's the time you take your usual break.  Can you give me -- just one question on this so I don't come back to it, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, if this was the objective, that the restoration of the monarchy was the objective of the RPF, don't you think now that they have enough powers to do whatever -- I mean, to restore the monarchy in terms of political system, if it's actually the objective of RPF? 
A.	Once again, I would say that since I'm not in the minds of the RPF, since I am not and have never, ever been in the minds of the RPF, they can do what they want or what they can with the power they have.  You have many people who take over power democratically or by force, and they speak about -- or they promise human rights, democracy and so on, and they announce these things publicly, but they subsequently become dictators or oppressors.  So I cannot respond or answer your question.  And you need to approach the RPF for you to be able to find out what is happening.
Q.	Do you then agree with me that this conclusion on the objective of RPF has no basis whatsoever, as an expert? 
A.	Once again, I will say to you that the expert works with data which he looks for.  Now, if he says things, whether they actually materialise or whether people who make promises actually deliver on their promises, that is a matter of history.  I cannot work on the future.  I cannot project myself into the future to see what the RPF is going to do.  I based myself on affirmations or assertions contained in the media campaigns and what was included in the literature.  What was announced there is that we must restore the monarchy, our people from the 1959 revolution, they must come back, and so on and so forth.  These were points which were agreed upon unanimously at the level of the diaspora, and the return of the monarchy was considered at a given point in time.  But, now, once the people came into power, they can do the opposite of what they promised.  It is possible, even that, that at the time when some people were talking about restoring the monarchy, they were speaking about this merely and simply because of a strategic objective.  I know that these people mobilised people, they came to power, but now that these things did not happen, it's not the fault of the expert that these things did not occur as promised. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Okay.  We'll take a break and when we come back we'll continue the cross-examination of the witness.  

And, witness, please remember to be brief in your answers.  We would like to see the end of your testimony today.  I hope so, learned counsel. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I'll try my best, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
I also make the same promise. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we'll adjourn these proceedings for 15 minutes and come back at twenty past eleven.  Until then, these proceedings are adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1107H to 1127H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.

Q.	Witness, you have finished?  Have you seen it?  And then I draw your attention to it.  It reads:  "The assassination of President Habyarimana on 6th April 1994, taking place after those of other Hutu leaders, and after the killing of more than 100,000 civilians by the RPF, triggered off the crisis and the country rose up in arms".  Witness, have you seen it? 
A.	Yes, I can see the passage. 
Q.	Could you, then, tell the Court when, where and which dates did the RPF kill the civilians you refer to? 
A.	I am referring to the various attacks which took place, which were carried out by the RPF before 1994, the most fatal being the one that took place in February 1993.  These were military attacks which took place in the north of the country. 
Q.	When specifically?  Which date? 
A.	Well, I'm not going to refer to all the dates of the attacks, I only remember the generalised attacks.  Let's say 1st of October was the first attack, whose victims have not been fully taken stock of.  

There were several attacks.  I do not have the dates of all the attacks, but there were a lot of attacks, and I noted those that made the greatest impact on people.  There was the attack of the 8th of February.  There were progressive attacks.  I cannot remember the exact number, but there were many.  I do not have in my mind all the dates of the various attacks, but these were attacks which accumulated -- and which accumulated a number of human losses. 
Q.	How did you, then, arrive at 100,000?  What is your source, as an expert? 
A.	There are several sources, and I refer mainly to James Gasana's source in his testimony before the French parliamentary committee.  He keeps figures on victims in a very detailed manner.  I cannot find a direct reference, but he conducted a study and presented the issue of victims on several occasions, and he is somebody who is very well informed on the war and the trend, or the number of victims.  I think I referred to him in the reference section, page 58 of the French version, James Gasana, "The political violence in Rwanda".  It is a testimony that he presented on military operations conducted by France and OAU in Rwanda between 1990 and 1994.  And then there are other sources as well, but that is the one I noted. 
Q.	Did Gasana base his source on official records?  Is Gasana's source official? 
A.	Gasana is somebody who knows -- is conversant to the political situation in Rwanda.  He has been a minister during that period.  He's a specialist in the field of development.  He's somebody who is very well informed on these issues.  And I believe that he even published a book later on on these events.  So he is somebody who is very conversant with the situation in a very profound manner. 
Q.	How many were Tutsis and how many were Hutus out of this hundred (sic) civilians?
A.	This is a general figure.  There were no details.  They were Rwandan victims.  They were civilians and not soldiers. 
Q.	Witness, I refer you to the historical background of the interethnic relations on page 5 of the English text, and page 3 of the French text.  I draw your attention to the second paragraph, starting from line four.  We're now dealing again with the Gihanga myth, and here you talk about the myth being prepared.  On the one hand it was created, now it's being prepared.  And my question is, how is a myth created and at some point being prepared, as you've represented here?  And I draw your attention to this sentence:  "The legend which is carefully prepared by the reigning intelligentsia is structured in such a way that the Gatutsi has all the qualities".  Can you tell the Court how it was created and then is now being prepared? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where are you reading counsel? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Line four, that's page 5.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the English?
MS. OJEMENI:
In the English, and page 3 in French. 
MR. HINDS:
Line four, which paragraph?
MS. OJEMENI:
Line four -- please, can you -- I'm addressing the Court.  Mr. Hinds, I am addressing the Court, please.

MR. HINDS:
Counsel, I'm asking, which line of which paragraph?
MS. OJEMENI:
It is the same thing the Court has asked me, the same thing the Court has asked me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is exactly what we are trying to find out.  Can you sit down, Professor Hinds?  Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, it's line four of paragraph 2 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Paragraph 2, okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
-- on page 5.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are there.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And the sentence that starts with, "The legend", which should be the "myth", "which is carefully prepared by the reigning intelligentsia is structured in such a way that Gatutsi has all the qualities".  And my question is, how is a myth created and now is being prepared? 
A.	In my mind, there's no contradiction.  In the first case, in the introduction I said a myth was created, and in this second part, which goes into detail, I'm saying that it is carefully prepared.  When I say "prepared", I mean built up and structured, and so on and so forth.  So there's no contradiction.  I don't know how it's understood in English, but in French there's no problem of contradiction between the fact that it was created, created by human beings, not God, such that I'm saying that it was carefully prepared.
Q.	Because you agree with me that a myth develops over time and is not prepared at any fixed point in time like a report written by a committee, so saying that it is elaborated by the intelligentsia gives a false sense of how myths grow up.
A.	I don't know.  It depends on your references.  But what I call the "intelligentsia" is the totality of the dignitaries who were the -- who were the thinkers of the group, and I'm saying that this myth was selected and structured such that they satisfied the objectives that they had in mind.  There's no contradiction.  

In any event, in the French report which I have, there is -- it is clear that the myth was prepared carefully.  When I say "carefully", it means that they put in all the care to bring the -- bring it together and build it.  And when I said the "intelligentsia", I'm talking about the thinkers who bring it together and put to the public, but what I mean is that they maintain the same structure.
Q.	So when did this preparation or the selection that you refer to, that it was selected and structured, when was it done? 
A.	Like anything, everything that has -- that relates to oral tradition, particularly myths, there are no dates, because the objective is to -- myths normally refer to origins or to time immemorial so there's no way of determining the dates. 
Q.	What is your source for this?  What is your source for saying that it was selected and structured? 
A.	I did not talk about selection, I talked about elaboration, construction and so on, and this is the result of the work of a certain intelligence, in the sense that I'm saying that it was built up, it was elaborated, it's a myth, it has a structure, it has a content and it has an objective.  These are elements that any analysis can bring out. 
Q.	Witness, you agree with me that if a myth grows, one can't say that it was prepared.  Is it the same thing; is that what you are telling the Court? 
A.	I really do not see the question, because what I said is as follows: that the problem of myths is that those who use them want to keep them intact.  They want to maintain them intact.  They can adapt them, they can possibly adapt them to time, to circumstances, still to safeguard their interests, but a myth will always be a myth, and it makes reference to a certain situation, to give a certain explanation, or make reference of a given situation to time immemorial.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If you follow counsel's question, you can have a myth at the beginning, as you did testify in your testimony yesterday.  What counsel is trying to find out, if we understand her correctly, if you look at the paragraph the way it has been put, "The legend which is carefully prepared by the reigning intelligentsia", so at least there is a people identified with regard to the structuring of this legend, and give that kind of attribute that you mentioned in the paragraph.  Now, the question is -- of course, you have already explained the time factor might not be easy to determine, but my trying to understand, if there is that element of preparation -- sorry, counsel, does that remain a myth at that stage where you have people using it consciously, maybe for whatever advantages one might wish to draw from that?  Does it remain as a myth? 
A.	It would no longer be a myth if you had a date.  That is the problem of a myth.  If it's a myth, that goes back to the origins.  It would no longer be a myth if it had a date.  And, specifically, the fact of not having a date to it takes away all possibilities of attempting to find its origin, because myths refer to the original person.  So those who created the myth, those who formulate the myth, removes himself from the myth, because you don't say the myth was elaborated by so and so, otherwise you destroy the intended intention. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the element of preparation and restructuring also do away with the myth?  What does it do to the myth, whatever the date, if you disregard the question of date?  Conscious preparation, will that erode or put a stop to the myth and maybe you have something else?  What do you say to that, witness?  We are aware of the oral causes, and what have you, but that element of preparation at some stage -- I don't know. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not clearly understand the question.  I don't clearly understand the question.

	1145H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, Counsel. 
BY MS.OJEMENI:
Q.	Your Honour, I presume the Court has taken note of -- or do still -- because I still have questions on this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  What was your  --
BY MS.OJEMENI:
Q.	I asked the question on how it was created and he answered that all the same, but I then asked when the event of elaborating the myth; when did it happen? 
A.	Myths as part of traditional -- as part of oral trading in the case of Rwanda have no dates.  Those that are more recent might have dates, but since they are found in myths, myths that refer to the genesis of a certain situation of Rwanda, the inhabitants of Rwanda, dates are not given, they are not determined for the simple fact that if somebody were to place himself between the one who is listening to the myth and the creation of the myth, that automatically destroys the value of that myth, because it will mean  -- the fact of the myth saying that so and so will do this and so and so will do  that, that is a ascribed to God.  In Rwanda there are several myths, fables which do not have dates in oral trading. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, in this paragraph -- in this statement that I have read out, you gave the indication that it was prepared or elaborated by reigning intelligentsia, so who are you referring to? 
A.	I am making reference to the influential members of the Court, those that are referred to as Abiheru (phonetic), those are the ones who are the custodian of fables and myths and so and so forth.  These are people who are close to the power, because here the idea is to give information that would underpin the ideology of the power.  That is why I made reference to the intelligentsia, these are people who were the thinkers and given a certain line to the society. 
Q.	You would agree with me that if these people prepared this myth, the myth is no longer created by God as you claimed.
A.	I did not claim that God created the myths, or that Gihanga created the myth.  I said that those who installed that myth ascribed it to God as having said so and so, they explained by saying that it is God who said do; it is Gihanga who said so.
Q.	We are talking about one myth, isn't it, the Gihanga myth? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I draw your attention to the fourth line from the word "quality" that I just read out -- that is the statement that I read previously and I draw your attention to the fourth line in the English text.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am still referring to second paragraph on page 5, and it should be line 9 of the English text.  And I read, "Some myth finding Gahutu and Gatutsi to be so different".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page?
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 5, still on the same page but down the statement I read earlier, the fourth line. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Here you stated that some myth finding Gahutu and Gatutsi to be so different attribute different ancestors to them.  So how many myths are we talking about, on the one hand it is Gahinga myth, which other myth are you referring to here? 
A.	In actual fact, the Gahinga myth has various variations.  What I am referring to here is another version of what is referred to Gahinga myth, depending on where he gets it, because I said that this was a myth which had become popular, generalised.  It is just that at a given time there were modifications which tend to present Gahutu and Gatutsi as different.  So it is in that sense, but otherwise, it is still the totality of the same myth which explains the difference between the various components -- ethnic components of Rwanda. 
Q.	Witness, you have been talking about this myth and your explanation of this myth is in terms of the ethnic groups, that is the Hutu, the Tutsi and the domination of Tutsi over the Hutu; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	At one point, did this myth now have several branches like you have stated? 
A.	I did say that these were popular myths which are therefore within the general area of oral tradition.  These myths may vary depending on where you recorded them, and with time they could change in terms of their presentation and depending on the individuals or the intention they could be modified, but there is not a code or a book which has been -- which is in print regarding the variations, because these myths are things that circulate in the population, and if you want to collect them, you will realise that with time, some aspects -- some portions have been modified, but the core, the essential part of it remains, and depending on the situation in Rwanda, there are versions, various versions of the same myth which have been collected and which will indicate that Gahutu and Gatutsi are not of the same father.  These are myths that you find among people who do want to recognise the fraternity between the Gahutu, Gatutsi and Gatwa.  So these are variations that do exist. 
Q.	So, Witness, where did you get your source, I mean for this variation of this myth?  How did you come about it as an expert? 
A.	I must probably repeat by saying that these myths which have been translated by fable or legend were going round.  But let me give you an example which is in the book, "Inter-ethnic Relations" collected by a missionary who found six variations of the same myth in the region in which he found himself, that is, he goes to somebody and ask him to recount the Gahinga myth.  That person gives the version which he knows and which goes round in its environment.  He goes to another source and ask him to recount the myth of Gahinga.  So there are variations.  There are certain variations which do not recognise the Twa and other variations that mention them.  So these are facts which are linked up to the myth itself, which is in possession of people and who recounted the way they want.  They might overlook a certain detail.  They might leave out a certain specific group, but through all these variations, the general orientation remains the same. 
Q.	Does any part of this variation, this variation of the myth, ascribe the qualities that Gahinga myth itself had ascribed to Gatutsi, to Gahutu?  In effect, my question is, is Gahutu in any of these variations recognised as more superior, more power -- powerful over Gatutsi; yes or no please? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So in effect, we are still talking about the same Gahinga myth; am I correct?
A.	Yes, we are talking about the myth which referred to Gahinga and which talks about the inequality. 
Q.	Why did you not bring the attention of the various myths?  Why didn't you bring them to the attention of the Court when you were testifying in your examination-in-chief yesterday? 
A.	If I recall correctly, I think I did say that there were variations, but I made reference to one that was reported by Bigirumwami (phonetic), but I think I mentioned this, the case of this missionary who recorded at least six variations in the region in which he was. 
Q.	Witness, you just mentioned it, so the report will speak for itself, but you do realise that your duty here as an expert is to enlighten the Court of the history of Rwanda as stated in your report, don't you? 
A.	Yes, but I do not see what that has to do with the myths.  I said that yesterday, I mentioned that there were variations to the myths.  I mentioned this.  That can be checked.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MS.OJEMENI:
Q.	Can this myth create a social system, the myth of Gahinga?  Can it create a social system? 
A.	These myths, I said, just if I can explain the inequality among the groups in Rwanda.  It explains, it justifies that there is an inequality because the common father wanted it to be so and ultimately God wanted it to be so.  That is how I can answer your question or how to explain the relationship that existed among people. 
Q.	Can you then answer my question in reference to page 6, the first two lines, the result -- the first line, the result of this myth is that in the Rwandan elite society, the Imfuro would not share a certain number of things with the Muhutu or with the Mutwa, leading to the phenomenon of Kunena, 
K-U-N-E-N-A or social repulsion, which entailed refusing to share a meal using the same drinking straw, using the same milk jug, sharing an accommondation and so on and so forth; can you explain that? 
A.	I would explain that in the following manner:  This myth established the inequality in such a manner that the Mututsi was seen as someone who was noble.  He was superior and so on and so forth, which means that the Mututsi was indignant in having to share, for instance, sharing a meal because there was an inequality in their status, and there was this impossibility in having to share.  The phenomenon of Kunena is meaning that the other one is not worthy to eating with me, to drink with me and finally what happens is that the person is either expelled to the outside until the meal is over, or the others withdraw to another place in order to eat, that is what happened.
Q.	Do you then agree with me, in that in the circumstances that you have just explained, that the myth can only justify a system, but not create a system? 
A.	I juxtaposed on purpose a certain number of verbs which mean to create, in the meaning of trying to maintain the myth explained for those who didn't know.  It created and maintained the awareness of inequality, but otherwise, myths are constructed from the outset in order to justify, explain and to perpetuate a status quo. 
Q.	So, in effect, my statment is corrent, isn't it, that it justified the system  and does not create a system? 
A.	I think it is a matter of terminology, because as I have said, the myth establishes in the minds of the persons hearing it.  It creates in the mind of the person that impression and reinforces that impression.  In fact, it justifies and explains and these are levels which are not identical.  If you want to remain at the social level, that would be it.  But if you were to go beyond, to the level of the conceptualisation by society, these are myths which were in, the new generation going to understand this new meaning, this content of the myth as being a natural state. 
Q.	Witness, still referring to this social repulsion that you said the myth had created, in the same paragraph, you stated that the marriage -- the phenomenon applied also to marriages which explained why it was impossible for mixed marriages to take place except for people who were able to make amends.  My question now is, are you saying that there were no inter-marriages except for amendments for people who want to make amends? 
A.	I am saying that mixed marriages were limited.  I would say it was necessary, at least, to marry someone who was of a higher level, you needed yourself to be worthy, and that is why a Hutu could not go to ask for the hand of any Tutsi girl.  The Hutu had to be worthy, either he had to be rich and accepted, because it wasn't merely sufficient to be rich, or you must have accomplished something either at war or in other spheres of life.  Otherwise, as I have said somewhere in the report, Hutu could marry a woman amongst the Tutsi who was inferior in status to himself, that could happen, but often the idea of Hutu-Tutsi domination remained and you will see this later.  The mixed marriages were an exception or were dependent upon certain factors, particularly the wealth or the exceptional accomplishment of an individual. 
Q.	Does this phenomenon also explain why Hutu military officers were not allowed before 1990 to marry Tutsi women? 
A.	Which link is there with the myth, because here we are talking about the myth. 
Q.	It is the same thing that I am asking, you correct me if I am wrong.  You either say yes or no, that it doesn't support my assertion.  So if you understand my question, answer it.  If you don't, then I will repeat it. 
A.	I have followed your question, but there is a leap forward which confuses me a little, if you could repeat your question, I think maybe this will be linked to what we are discussing.
Q.	You were referring to the impossibility of mixed marriages, and I am asking whether this particular phenomenon that you have just described also explains why military officers were not allowed to marry Tutsi women prior to 1990? 
A.	I cannot link the two factors because they are not of the same nature, because in the first instance, we are dealing with the impossibility or the difficulty of existence of mixed marriages between Hutus and Tutsis, and this is linked to the prevailing idea involving worthiness or unworthiness; worthiness of being able to share a meal, be able to become a member of such and such a family.  But now, when we are talking about the Hutus and Tutsis of -- Hutus of 1994 being able to marry Tutsis, I think this is a different context, a context which is possibly linked to the events of 1959, to the effect that there were the armies of the monarchy who were fighting against the young republic; that army was so essentially composed of Tutsis, the army of the young republic which was composed mainly of Hutus, and we are also referring to distrust that there was at the time, maybe it was a distrust which continued to persist, but I do not know to what extent.  I don't know how far it extended.  I don't think I can be as rigid as that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is true, is it correct to say that military men were not allowed to marry --
MS. OJEMENI:
Hutu military men.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That Hutu military officers were not allowed to marry into -- or to marry a Tutsi girl or a Tutsi woman; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
I had heard mention of that, but I never verified that.  I never checked it out because I never saw any official text which could testify to the same. 
BY MS.OJEMENI:
Q.	Likewise, you never saw any official text to the myth, the variation of the myth that you told the Court today; isn't it? 
A.	But once again, I am saying these are phenomenons which are linked to different contexts.  The case of the myth which is a situation where there are no written texts which are verifiable.  As to the reference to Hutu soldiers in the 1990s, this is something which belongs to the more recent history, because I don't know what one can say about this, because there were also Tutsi military officers.  I am sure that they were not obliged to marry Hutu women.  But what I am trying to say is that these two contexts are different, and I have indicated in which context this impression of mistrust developed. 
Q.	Witness, you would agree with me that as an expert, that certain facts are -- they don't need to be written before society takes knowledge of it.  There are certain facts that are common knowledge, isn't it, in the society? 
A.	There are facts which happen that we get to notice, but once we are talking about the world of law and the written word, normally there are traces which are left and which can be verified. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you are aware of the ten commandments of the Bahutu, aren't you?  This is anti-Tutsi statement published in the Kangura of December 1990.  In it Hutu men are told not to marry Tutsi women.  Aren't you aware of this? 
A.	At that time, I read these famous ten commandments, but I no longer remember the context in which they were written in Kangura.  There was, indeed, the existence of these commandments -- the ten commandments, but one needs to see the context within which they were written by that journalist, and maybe it would also be necessary for us to refer  -- I don't know whether he referred to the ten commandments of the Tutsis which had been circulated in the '60s.  

I think that it is within that framework that you need to place these ten commandments, otherwise, I read the newspaper at any given time during that period of time.  I do not remember exactly the motivation which encouraged the journalist to write these commandments and the context in which they were placed.  We need to bear those in mind when you are talking about the time.  Maybe what I can say is that, he was not an authority for him to be giving -- or handing down commandments, but I think there was reference to the ten commandments of the Batutsis in the '60s, and we need to find out whether he is making a direct reference to them, and we need to find out also why he is talking about commandments but otherwise, I do remember them. 
Q.	Witness, why are you being selective in your illustrations in your report, because it looks like what you have testified so far, your focus is on RPF-Tutsi, and in this particular context on intermarriages, you are giving the impression that it is the Tutsis who are refusing to marry the Hutus, when in actual fact, it is the Hutus who are refusing to marry Tutsis.  Could you explain that to the Court? 
A.	The first point as to why I gave the impression to lean to one side, it is not that I am biased as such, but I wanted to orient my attention to aspects which are not genenerally taken into account, otherwise, there have been other reports which were written and which emphasise what the Hutus did, what they did not do, what they ought to have done; but these reports never refer or hardly ever refer to things that happened in reality.  I didn't want to say that nothing bad was done on that side.  What I wanted to do was to bring to the awareness of the Tribunal another aspect of the events, the situation as it obtained at that point in time.  

Now to go back to the second question as to why I give the impression by saying that it was the Tutsis who did not want to marry the Hutus, whereas it was rather the Hutus who didn't want to marry Tutsi women.  I think that in the case of military officers, this is an isolated case in society.  

To illustrate this, I will give reference to the testimony of the Nyetera, which I mentioned regarding the mixed marriages.  This gentleman, I said that he was a Tutsi, and this is why I was interested in his testimony.  This gentleman states that there had been mixed marriages, relationships, affairs or whatever you want, but mixed marriages, and he states specifically that what happened was the following: Often it was the Hutu men who married Tutsi women and rarely would Tutsi men marry Hutu women.  

Setting aside the millitary context in Rwandan society, mixed marriages or relationships were referred to by this witness, and he said that there were Hutus who married women rather than Tutsi men marrying Hutu women.  The numbers were higher in relation to the Hutu men.  Maybe I can give you a reference, it was in the background. 
Q.	I will get to that in a minute, Witness.  Witness, it is very comfortable for you to rely on the statement by Nyetera, who is a Tutsi, isn't it?  At least that illustrates the position of the Tutsi, isn't it?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe before that, Counsel.  In your previous answer, I would like to understand.  You say in comparing your report you wanted to rely or put emphasis on issues or matters that were never talked about.  I didn't follow you, and is that what you said? 
THE WITNESS:
I said that I was trying to speak about a vision which brings out facts that are normally minimised.  I wasn't going to repeat everything because there were things which have been said repeatedly on several occasions, which I will not discuss or dispute, because there are people who are interested in the analysis of such aspects.  But what I did was to bring in a point of view which wanted to bring out certain other factors which are often minimised and yet they do exist. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
With reference to other matters that are known or what?  It is rather complex here.
THE WITNESS:
There are facts which occurred.  I will give the example of the war, especially victims or persons who died, the violation of the rights of individuals who were victims of these conflicts.  Rarely is there a mention made of the civilians who were victims of conflicts, but when one sees the conditions under which they died, one realises that there have been violations of human rights, and the situation of these people is not really taken into account.  And when one speaks of the infringement of the individual rights, there is mention made of Tutsis who were attacked or killed, but when there is a problem regarding the Hutus, especially in the occupied territory, there is a kind of silence or somewhat an indifference.  That is why I brought up these elements knowing fully well that there are other people who presented the situation of matters as they happened on the other side, that is was my effort. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Go on, Counsel. 
BY MS.OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you relied in reference to my previous question regarding why you mentioned that or you suggest in your report that Hutus married Tutsis, but that Tutsis refused to marry Hutus.  You relied on a statement made by Nyetera; am I correct? 
A.	Yes.  In order to illustrate that point of view, I didn't say that they refused.  I said that they were few.  The marriages were there, but there were less frequent in one group and more frequent in the other.
Q.	And the statement by Nyetera is on page 22 of your report, isn't it?  That is the English, I am referring to the English text. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. Page -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 22. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Is that what you are drawing the Court's attention to, the intermarriages that A.T. Nyetera made reference to.  If it is, could you tell the Court, and I will get back to that in a minute.  In that report, the Tutsi talks about intermarriages with Hutus and the Tutsi is Nyetera, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Nyetera is pro-President Habyarimana's government, isn't it? 
A.	I do not know.  I don't know anything about that. 
Q.	In 1990 up to 1994, he was closely linked with Habyarimana's government, isn't it?
A.	That is what I am saying, I don't know anything about that.  I don't know anything about his private life.  All I know is that he provided testimony. 
Q.	During that time you were reading papers, and you were listening to the radio, weren't you?  Between the period of 1990 to 1994, you were listening to the radio and you must have heard Nyetera being linked up with Habyarimana's government and the Akazu in particular? 
A.	I never spoke about Nyetera.  I don't know what his political development was. He was never a public man, in other words, someone whom the media who have been able to speak about at that point in time. 
Q.	In what context did you know Nyetera, in what context? 
A.	I knew Nyetera as a civil servant, I didn't know him personally.  We did not work together and, furthermore, he was someone who was never in high public office for me to be able to know him.  I do not know this person personally. 
Q.	So why did you choose -- I mean, all through your report, his statement -- you relied on his statement in the conclusion that you drew in your report?  How could you have done so as an expert without knowing the person -- I mean, without knowing Nyetera very well, I mean in terms of intelligence, in terms of his capability as somebody to rely on his statement, I mean as an expert, you must believe in your conclusion?  So how did you arrive at choosing Nyetera as your source? 
A.	Nyetera was testifying before the European parliament, and I think he also testified before the Belgian parliament.  He is someone who knows Rwanda, because he lived there for a long time and he lived there through all different regimes.  So his testimony, I read it and I found it very relevant, especially given the fact that he makes a very in-depth analysis of everything he says.  Having said that, I do not know whether for an expert to be able to use a report, he must know the author of said report personally.  

Furthermore, if I were to have him heard as being a member of Akazu, whereas the Akazu was said to be training people who were extremists, but he is someone who was adequately educated and he followed the history of that country.  He was in certain services.  He was not in high public service, but he was someone who was aware of the Rwandan situation.  I don't know what his links with the Habyarimana government were, but that is not important.  What is of essence here is what he says and the relevance of what he does say.
Q.	Witness, what is important really is the fact that he is a Tutsi, and he supports your ideology, the line you are toeing, your position in support of the Hutu, that is what is important here.  And as a Tutsi, it gives you a good basis for relying on his statement in support of whatever position that the Hutus adopted in terms of events of January to July -- that took place between January and July of 1994.  That is what is important, isn't it? 
A.	No, what is important is that on very sensitive points as that, I am giving the testimony of somebody who cannot be considered as a Hutu extremist, who is saying something which is counter -- which runs counter to the truth.  And then, I don't know Mr. Nyetera could work in an anti-Tutsi manner, because simply he is somebody who presents things the way he sees them and who has the courage to say them.  That being said, I wouldn't see any advantage that he could draw from supporting the Hutus who are no longer even in power today, and I wouldn't see -- I don't know how he had any advantage that the Hutus would have extended to him for him to be able to plead their course in a situation like this. 
Q.	Witness, in this statement, it is stated that the Tutsis should remember that after 5th July 1973, none of them was ever persecuted as a result of their ethnic background.  Of course, the focus is on Tutsis and it shows or it suggests that the Hutus did not persecute the Tutsis after 5th July 1973, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So coming from somebody who is a Tutsi, whom you know as a civil servant and he is educated, of course, he advances your cause in this report, doesn't he? 
A.	No, that is not the way I look at things.  I positioned myself in the following framework.  Is what he is saying true?  Were there some violence after 1973?  Were there persecutions by the state against the Tutsis after that period?  Were Tutsi deprived of their rights during that period?  Did the government in the speech of the government authorities -- do they have any posture that marginalises the Tutsis?  It was in relation to these questions that I decided to take note of his testimony.  It is not because he is a Tutsi who says something that supports my position; it is the answers that he gives to those questions that I raised. 
Q.	Witness, according to you, you are not aware that Nyetera has ever been linked to the Akazus nor did you know that before -- between 1990 and 1994, he was pro-Habyarimana's government.  Given that fact that I have given you, the basis -- the background that I have given you, are you surprised to note that this statement that I have read coming from a man like Nyetera -- are you surprised as a professor or as a consultant; as an expert, are you surprised that such a man should make this kind of statement in support of the Hutus? 
A.	No, I am not surprised, because what he is saying is relevant, and he gets (sic) close to the Akazu up until 1990.  So, I don't know, and besides, I don't know about this Akazu.  People talk about them, but it is a very flashy idea.  But for me, the issue is to know whether what he is saying reflects the truth, whether what he is saying is the truth.  

Now regarding his personal relationship, I don't know about that, and that is not what we are interested in.  What we are interested in is what he is saying, the relationship between what he is saying and the reality, the truth and the determination as to whether there is some level of relevance. 
Q.	In this particular -- Nyetera still goes on to say: "On the contrary, thanks to Habyarimana on his tolerance policy.  I can give the names of some Tutsis, economic operators."  Can you now understand the basis for this comment, the fact that he is close -- he was closely linked with Habyarimana's government? 
A.	This passage does not suggest that.  It does not suggest that, but one should rather see whether what he is saying is true or false, whether indeed there was tolerance and whether the names of the Tutsi economic operators that he is giving, if he did mention those names, whether they are real names or fictitious; if these people in fact prospered in the field of business in the  country, and if they prospered after 1973, that is the issue.  The issue is not to say that, well, he is saying that there was tolerance, people became rich and therefore, he is close to the person who was in power.  The idea is to see if what he is saying is true, whether there were a lot of Tutsi economic operators prospered, and who could not have done so previously on account of the existing politics at the time, but who were able to do it now because of the new policies towards the Tutsis. 
Q.	So what were your findings in respect of that assertion?  What were your findings and what source did you rely on in respect of the assertion in the statement that I have just read? 
A.	Can you repeat the question precisely, so I can give you a precise answer?
Q.	You said that one would have to find out or confirm Nyetera's assertion that Habyarimana's -- or thanks to Habyarimana on his tolerance policy.  I can give the -- then you said one would have to find out to know whether those people were really economic operators, at least to find out the truth about this statement, and I am now asking you as an expert who has relied on this statement in his report, what were your findings?  Could you share that with the Court, and what source did you rely on to come to this conclusion?
A.	I did not mention the names that Nyetera referred to, but we can check this in the annex.  He in fact gives the names of Tutsi economic operators and the field in which they operated, which leads me to consider that as being relevant, and as I said that earlier on, there was a policy of tolerance where you realise that there was no tension, there was no persecution in the various political statements made by the president, ministers and other authorities.  One does not see any comment which marginalises -- any statement that marginalises the Tutsis.  And then one could check from that list whether those people were actually in business, that can be found in the annex of Mr. Nyetera.  I believe that is Annex No. 2.  Annex No. 2, we could check and in fact the list is not complete. 
Q.	Witness, we don't need to check anything.  I am just asking you, you relied on this assertion in your report to buttress your point that, with respect to marriages, Tutsi men rarely married Hutu women.  And I am asking you, how did you -- what were your findings, at least for you to refer to this statement in your report, you must have gone a step further to verify what Nyetera said before putting it in your report, and what were your findings?  Could you share it with the Court?  If you didn't do any finding, tell the Court?  Or did you just rely on the source of Nyetera without actually confirming with other -- or comparing it with other reports?  If you didn't, say so.
A.	Well, I had no access to marriage registers given the ethnic condition, but I considered the testimony to be relevant because it reflects the facts as I know them, otherwise we have to refer to the marriage register, to check if what he is saying is correct, but this is something that can be verified.  There were intermarriages.  There were some who remained in the country; there were some who went into exile.  It is a fact that one could verify. 
Q.	Witness, you realise your role as an expert in this Tribunal, that you cannot make any statement in an abstract.  You have to talk with data, you have to buttress what conclusion you arrived at or sources that you relied on with concrete facts.  Are you then telling this Court that because you had limited access to material that will assist you in preparing this report, that because of that limitation, you could not confirm this statement on page 22 of this report as I have read out? 
A.	No, that is not what I want to say.  What I am saying is as follows:  That each time that you -- or that kind of remark you referred to or the references, which means that you need about a hundred references to confirm one fact, that is not the way in which research is done.  You make a point and then you look for somebody who has made an analysis.  You look at the conclusion he arrived at, and you cannot use that conclusion, but you cannot not ask that each time there is a point, you have to list a series of references, because each element -- each reference comes from somebody, comes from someone who makes an observation or which he has taken from somebody.  

So what you are suggestig to me is not something which is practicable, that for each line, I have to have 10 references, 10 quotations to indicate that you have gone through that area.  What I concluded there is something I consider to be relevant, because the person who analyses the facts is somebody who knew the country, who lived in the country and who knew all the environment, particularly the Tutsi environment where he himself comes from.  I do not see any reason why he'll falsify facts in relation to the Tutsi just so to defend a regime that belongs to an ethnic group that he does not belong to. 
Q.	Witness, do you realise that you -- whatever position you take on this report you have to justify it, you have to, at least to a certain extent, show that you also believe in what you are saying as an expert.  This is a situation you'll agree with me that the intermarriage relation that you have described in this report is an integral part of your report, and as an expert, you should have justfied this with data, ratio, percentage of women you are talking about, percentage of Tutsi men you are talking about, I mean, as an expert, this is what is expected of you.  Could you explain the source, the main source that you relied on in respect of the marriages? 
A.	Once again, let me revert to this assertion of Nyetera for the reasons that I have given, but otherwise, if you are talking about percentages of marriages, I think these are things that you have to go and check in the country today to see, to get that kind of data on marriage.  But what one should look at is that in relation to the ideology of equality, the ideology of openness, we now see that people can marry from across the ethnic line, Tutsis marrying Hutus.  Today I said that there were rarely Tutsi men who married Hutu women, but it does happen.  But what I am saying is that now, there are less barriers than there were previously. 
Q.	Now, Witness, on page 6 -- we went back to 22 because it has something to do with page 6, but now we are still on page 6, second paragraph.  In line 1, you said the myth while popularised was imposed on everybody, and was considered to be historical data.  Now at what point was this myth imposed on everybody, when on page 9, you had talked about some parts of Rwanda not being conquered until 20th century.  So this myth couldn't have been imposed on everybody. 
A.	I think in answer to this question there are certain considerations to be made.  If Rwanda -- when I said this myth was imposed to everybody, I meant all those who were within the Rwandan kingdom, the Rwandan kingdom as it was centralised under the authority of the king.  The region that you are referring to on page -- I don't know, but the regions that did not have the same system were regions which were not completely -- which had not yet been completely integrated under the authority of the Rwandan kingdom when the Europeans arrived in Rwanda.  These regions were and parcel of Rwanda today, but in those days, those regions were not under the authority of the King's Court, there were more or less autonomous regions where archaic system that we referred to had not yet been extended, and therefore, those regions as it had in Rwanda, which was under the authority of the King's court. 
Q.	Witness, do you realise that your report is full of contradictions, and in saying this, I will refer you to the same page 6, your phenomenon of Kwihutura?
A.	Which page would that be in French?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you assist, Professor Bompaka?
BY MS.OJEMENI:
Q.	Page 4, and that is the last paragraph on page 4.  I have been directed to the second paragraph, page 4 French and then page 6, last paragraph of page 6 of the English text, the phenomenon of which Kwihutura -- here you defined this Kwihutura, which is spelt K-W-I-H-U-T-U-R-A, you defined it as Hutu leaving their rank to join themselves to Tutsi.  

In the French version, it is even clearer.  The contradiction is very clear in the French version because you said Tutsi should rally themselves with Tutsi (sic).  And this contradicts the phenomenon of Kunena, which is spelt K-U-N-E-N-A, on page 7 of the English text, the Kunena, the phenomenon is described there.  And the phenomenon of Kunena suggests that Tutsis reject Hutus.  My question now is, can Tutsis -- how can Tutsis make alliance with Hutus, while also rejecting them?  Can you explain? 
A.	Before I answer that question, I hope that since you are talking about contradiction, that the previous point is not the contradiction.  I maintain that it is not a contradiction that there were territories that were outside the Buhake system and for whom the Gahinga myth did not apply.  

Now to come back to this point, the phenomenon of the Kwihutura, to indicate what that meant, I said that it was not enough to want to live the Hutu condition.  It is not enough to wish it, and it was not enough to be rich, in other words, you need to the co-opted by the Tutsi class, by the nobility to be able to move up to that class.  It means that when someone for reasons of merit or for reasons of his wealth has been accepted by the nobility to be part of that class, what happens -- that passage from his ethnic group to the other stage, that passage of leaving his Hutu condition or becoming a nobleman, that officially he had become noble, he had been nobbled and officially had become a Tutsi.  But if he officially became a Tutsi, the phenomenon of Kunena does no longer apply to him because he has changed his condition, he has changed his social group.  Now where is the problem?  The problem is that sometimes he is referred to as a Hutu and sometimes as a Chihuture.  It could be said that, yes, he is a Hutu but he is Chihuture   and from the social linguistic or psycho-linguistic standpoint, it means that he was still a Hutu.  In other words, he cannot mention Tutsis among his ancestors, his lineage, but since he has been co-opted, he has been accepted for specific merits which exceeded what was expected from a Hutu.  From then on, the phenomenon of Kunena does not apply to him theoretically, but there are frustrations.  I emphasise the ambiguity of his condition, by saying that in principle -- in theory, being a Tutsi, he should align his views with those of the Tutsis, but in actual fact, sometimes he had problems because on the one hand, he is supposed to share everything with the nobility, but he has brothers who remain Hutus with whom he still has ties.  So  it is an ambiguous situation for him.  There is no contradiction between the phenomenon of Kunena and a phenomenon of Kwihutura, as I have it here. 
Q.	Witness, using  your analogy in explaining the myth, Kwihutura  whereby a Hutu crosses over to Tutsi and becomes accepted as a member of Tutsi even though he is still a Hutu; using that analogy, you agree with me that the same situation continued up to 1994, where Tutsis had to change their identity to be Hutu in order to escape being killed by Interahamwes or soldiers; am I correct? 
A.	Well, I am not aware of that.  I don't know those details, but what I am saying is that with the advent of republican system, there was no superior ethnic group or inferior ethnic group, but now whether somebody devises a strategy to save his skin is something else.  Hutu could also effect Tutsi identity to save his skin.  But the first thing is to present yourself as being a member of that group if you feel threatened, but it is nothing institutionalised; that is an individual incident, you still remain what you are, but you change your identity just so as to save your skin.  That probably happened, but it is not the same level, it is not on the same scale. 
Q.	Does that also explain why Tutsis changed their identity to Hutus after the killing or after the attack of the RPF in 1990, and also in 1993?  Does that explain why Tutsis changed to Hutu ethnic group to escape being killed by Hutu or more particularly the Interahamwes and soldiers? 
A.	Once again, let me say that we are in a different context.  The phenomenon of Kwihutura was accepted and it operated in the system, and people moved from one group to the other, whereas this change that you are talking about were specifics that people used to save their lives.  It can happen everywhere, it is possible.  I was going to give an example on the current war.  It is possible that Iraq soldiers would identify themselves as Saudis -- as people from Saudi Arabia or Kuwait.  It is a way of saving your life in a specific situation, but that you do in a very discrete manner, but that has nothing to do with what we are dealing with here.
MS. OJEMENI:
Just this question, Your Honour, I wouldn't touch it again.
MR.PRESIDENT:
 Yes.
BY MS.OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, does that then -- the paragraph I referred you to on page 6, that talks about Kwihutura, you are definite that Hutu crossed over to Tutsi ethnic group, but in terms of Tutsi, it is possible, you are not too sure, it could have happened.  Are you telling this Court that it was not common knowledge that Tutsis crossed over -- some Tutsis crossed over to the Hutu ethnic group between 1990 and 1994 to escape being killed by Hutus? 
A.	I have no data on this issue, but what I do know is that in a war situation, when somebody finds himself before a danger, whether somebody is a Hutu or Tutsi, the first thing that can save you, you do that.  If you find yourself before a Hutu or two Hutus who can kill you, you present yourself as a Hutu and try to be part of their ideological trend.  If you find yourself before the RPF people, you present yourself as a Tutsi, if it is possible.  If it is not possible, you present yourself as somebody who belongs to an ideology which is close to them and which supports them, that is something instinctive.  It is a way or a method of survival, and then when you get to the other side, you say, well, I managed, I tricked you and I managed to get through.  It cannot be compared to this phenomenon of Kwihutura, which was institutionalised, whereas what you are referring to is an individual tactic which people might use to save their lives.  

In the Bible, when the Israelites were fighting those of Samaria might use that to be able to get through, because otherwise, you are easily identifiable.  So this is something, it is an individual strategy; the Hutus did it, the Tutsis did it.  And there were other things that they probably wouldn't have done to get through sticky situations.
MS.OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned Counsel.

Witness, Professor, still we urge you to be very brief.  I am sure you could outline whatever you want to outline in a brief manner.  

We are on page 6, I don't know how far we go. 
MS.OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I do have a lot of questions.  This man is an expert and I really need to see that justice is done in this case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will see how far we go.  Yes.  We will adjourn these proceedings and resume at twenty to three.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned. 
	(Court recessed at 1310H)
	(Pages 30 to 44 by Sithembiso Moyo)










	(Court resumed at 1440H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The proceedings are resumed.  

Yes.  We were wondering, Counsel, whether we are going back to the earlier debate we had on this issue.
PROFESSOR HINDS: 
I have accepted the norm.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Thank you.  

Yes, Ms. Ojemeni, learned counsel for the Prosecution, you can continue your cross-examination.
MS, OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we go back to another area of contradiction in your report, and I draw your attention to page 7, second paragraph, which is the last paragraph on that page.  I draw your attention to the sentence, that's the fourth -- fifth line from the bottom of that page.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page?
MS. OJEMENI:
Seven in the English text.
THE WITNESS:
Where is it in the French, please?
MS. OJEMENI:
I'm afraid I don't have no assistance to that effect, perhaps the interpreter can assist us.  The sentence starts with "Tensions", line 5 of the English text, page 7 starting from the bottom of that page. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
These are atrocities. 
MS. OJEMENI:
"Tensions between the Hutus and Tutsis".
PROFESSOR HINDS: 
I think it's page 5, Your Honour, first paragraph at the top of page 5.
MR. PRESIDENT:
French?

PROFESSOR HINDS: 
French, page 5, top of the first paragraph..
MR. PRESIDENT: 
 Okay.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You have told us previously that the Hutu -- sorry, on page 9, I'm making reference to page 9 and page 7 of English. 
MS. OJEMENI:
So, I am drawing his attention to page 9, and then I would link it up to page 7.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which paragraph on page 9? 
MS. OJEMENI:
On page 9 is the third paragraph, the mention of the word, "Ubuhake" is highlighted.  This is the system of serfdom. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You have told us previously that this suggests that Gihanga myth imposes -- was imposed on everybody.  That was where we adjourned.
PROFESSOR HINDS: 
 Does the witness have reference to page 9?  In French, it's page 7, the second paragraph from the top.  Page 7 in the French, second paragraph.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I will take it again, sorry.  I was actually referring to page 6, not page 9.  When we adjourned we were on page 6, Your Honour.  And I am drawing the witness's attention to the topic we discussed -- I mean, he testified on before we adjourned, and that's in second paragraph on page 6, where he stated that the myth was widely popularised -- which was widely popularised was imposed on everybody.  And on page 7, it's suggested here that the Hutu of Gisenyi, Bugoyi, I believe it's in Gisenyi did not accept Gihanga myth.  Can you then explain the contradictions between these two statements?  On one hand, the myth was imposed on everybody, and on the other hand, the myth was not accepted by some group of Rwandans?
A.	Yes, thank you.  I will explain to you what's involved.  The paragraph that you mentioned in page 5 -- at page 5, in the French, there was a typographical error.  It wasn't a tension between the Hutus and the Tutsis.  There was a typographical error there.  

Now, as to the matter of contradiction, that does not exist.  There is no contradiction because the region I referred to, the region of Bugoyi, Bugoyi is spelt, B-U-G-O-Y-I, at page 7 in the English.  This is a region which the royal powers had not dominated completely.  It's a region which was not yet completely affected by the UBOHAKI; in other words, the system which was operative elsewhere in Rwanda.  It was a peripheral area, and that was why all these regions in the north and those in the south towards the préfecture of Cyangugu, these regions -- the population in these regions had not yet accepted the UbuhakeI system because there were following another system, what was known as UBUKONDE.  Ubukonde is spelt, U-B-U --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
 The witness missed the K, I believe, he go down to say, O-N-D-E.  
THE WITNESS:
This is a system which was different from the UBUHAKI system where the land was considered as common property, and there was the chief which would allocate land to each family.  So here, when we are talking about this on page 6 in the French, in areas which were already controlled by the monarchy, that was the centralised powers, but these regions which were peripheral had not become under the control, and were not under the system of the UBUHAKI.  And when the Europeans came, the monarchy had not yet conquered all the regions, which can be seen in the present day map of Rwanda.  So, there is no contradiction, all there is is the fact that in the areas controlled by the royal court, that system of UBUHAKI existed, but the areas which it had not yet controlled, there obtained another system.  So people did not understand; did not follow; did not wish to follow the UBUHAKI system.
Q.	Witness, you agree with me that you did not elaborate that in your report.  You are just testifying to those facts now?
A.	No, it's quite clear.  The last passage I have just mentioned.  I said that when he Europeans arrived, the places which were not centralised did not follow this regime; in other words, there had not been a time for the kingdoms to impose this system to people who lived on the other side.  I think this is quite clear.
Q.	Now, Witness, I draw your attention to the first paragraph on the same page where you talked about atrocities committed by the Tutsi kings, and then down the same page --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
 Which page?
MS. OJEMENI:
I am talking of page 7.

We were on page 7, Your Honour. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You made mentioned of the king, Rwabugiri.  Rwabugiri is spelt, R-W-A-B-U-G-I-R-I?
PROFESSOR HINDS: 
Your Honour, could the -- as we go forward, could counsel give us the line numbers, because I am totally lost in terms of where she is at this point.  I thought we were with tensions, where it was five lines from the bottom, and now I'm just trying to find it.  So, if she could just give the line and page number in the paragraph as she is pointing to various things, it would be helpful to me so I can follow where we are.
MS. OJEMENI:
Mr. Hinds, I have finished with the last paragraph that I have mentioned earlier on,  and I'm now moving on to assertions in that particular page, on the page.  I'm not talking about any particular line, but I am talking about the topic, this, in summary, what the page depicts, and I am drawing his attention to a particular name of the last king before I ask my question.  Probably if you wait, that would throw more light on where I'm going.  So, you just -- I'm now drawing his attention just like you did yesterday, you asked him to summarise.  So in order to move the proceedings forward, I'm just making reference to pages and to summarise what is there.  The witness is enlightened enough, educated enough to say that I am not summarising it correctly, but I am drawing his attention to certain facts on this page.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
It has nothing to do with the witness.  I am saying I just -- you mentioned a name of a king or someone, if you could just give us a reference, then I would know where you are.  I am not talking about the witness.  I am confused, not the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
 Yes, I think Counsel is saying she is addressing issues pertaining to page 7, and she has mentioned the name of a particular king or chief, Rwabugiri on that same page.  Of course, Rwabugiri appears -- the name Rwabugiri that could be on the third line in the second paragraph. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Yes, I found it, Your Honour.  I just found it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, Counsel, please.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness --
A.	What page is it, please?
Q.	We are still on page 7, which should be page 5 of the French text.  And I am referring to a particular name, Rwabugiri, and I presume this Rwabugiri was the last king of Rwanda, a Tutsi king of Rwanda.  Am I correct to say that Rwabugiri was the last Rwandan king?
A.	Are we on page 4 of the French version?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You locate it?  Which page is that?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is page 4 in the French.  Page 4; in the last paragraph of that page, line 3.
THE WITNESS:
The questions as to whether Rwabugiri was the last king.  Is that the last question?

BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Yes.  I said that I presume you were referring to Rwabugiri who was the king, a Tutsi who was a king and then I will ask you the question.
A.	No, he was not the last Tutsi king.  He was not the last king because the monarchy was abolished in 1959; 1959.
Q.	Was he the last king in the 20th century?
A.	No, not at all, he belonged to the 19th century, rather, because I mentioned that he died in 1896, because that's towards the end of the 19th century.
Q.	Am I correct then to say that he was the last Tutsi king in the 19th century in Rwanda?
A.	No.
Q.	And he was a king; was he?
A.	Yes, he was a king.
Q.	Are you familiar with the name Bishingwe spelt B-I-S-H-I-N-G-W-E?
A.	I don't say that I know Bishingwe, but I know something close to that word, which is KIBISHINGWE, but if you say Bishingwe, I don't know.  I know Kibishingwe, but I said that it is close.  Therefore, I am guessing that you may be referring to Bishingwe.
Q.	Witness, you are aware of the alliance between Rwabugiri and this man called Bishingwe who was the leader, Hutu leader in Ruhengeri, whereby the king; that is, Rwabugiri, and Bishingwe waged war with the king's troops.  That was the alliance that they had, are you aware of that in the Rwandan history?
A.	Yes, I know about that alliance between Rwabugiri and Bishingwe.
Q.	You are aware that in -- during such wars, Tutsis and Hutus were killed.  There was no exception.  There was nothing like the Tutsis killing the Hutus, or the Hutus killing the Tutsis?
A.	Yes, but what is true is that in reality, Bishingwe acknowledged the military superiority of Rwabugiri and they fled into the volcanoes.  They didn't engage in fighting, but there were negotiations later.  There was no battle because Rwabugiri was by far superior.
Q.	Why did you not give such examples in your report, rather, on this page, you suggested that Tutsi were killing Hutus in the 19th century?
A.	I didn't mention the case of Bishingwe and the community of the ABARASHI, because the fighting did not actually take place, whereas in other regions there was fighting which took place.  And I did not see the interest of mentioning that specifically, because they were able to reach an agreement momentarily, and later on there were combats afterwards when there was a revolt after Bishingwe, but during Bishingwe's time, I did not need to mention that there was any killings of the population because that did not exist at that time.
Q.	What existed then, because as an expert dealing with the history of Rwanda, such facts or such wars, talking about war in Rwanda, such incidents or the alliance between a Tutsi and a Hutu should form part of your report.  Why did you not talk about it?
A.	There is a mountain of information and I couldn't mention everything.  I referred to matters which raised problems for the future.  Now, the specific case of Bishingwe did not cause any problem because there was no negative implication on the population or in the history of the country.  What I said is that the BARACY of Bishingwe avoided fighting against Rwabugiri.  They fled into the volcanoes, they knew forest of the volcanoes and Rwabugiri insisted.  So there were negotiations and there was an understanding.  There was no problem.  On the other hand, I mentioned the problem of his son, with the royal court; his son, Rukara, whom we see later on.
Q.	Witness, I draw your attention to page 8 now.  That is the English text and the topic is "Under the Germans".  I draw your attention to line 2, under the topic stated under the Germans.  Are we there?
A.	Yes, I can see where you are.
Q.	In this first paragraph you talked about slavery.  And could you define the word "slavery" as it's used in Kinyarwanda?
A.	I could not determine -- define the word slavery in French, but I refer to the specific term in Kinyarwanda which translates these facts, because slavery is already English or Esclave is in French, and this emanates from different experiences.  These are words in different languages, but now if we are to deal with the case of Rwanda, if one were to be referring to Umugaragu, when you are dealing with a woman, it's Umuja.  Maybe I can spell that; it's spelt U-M-U-J-A.  When you are dealing with a servant or slave who is a female, you referred to that person as Umuja.  If it is a man you are dealing with, then it's UMUGARAGO. 

Now, the relations that exist in this situation are dependency relationships which are quite striking because Europeans noticed these relations and described them.  So, I didn't define the terms "slavery" or "Esclave" because that's French, but the word "UMUGARAGO" and the term "UMUJA" are concepts which refers to this society where there was a total dependence of some individuals upon others, and that's why I have not defined the concept slavery or esclave in the French.
Q.	But in your view, Witness, there were slavery relationships between the two groups; that's Tutsi and Hutu?
A.	Those relations existed and that's how the first observers described them.  They described them as they saw them, the relationships of total submission.  We consider the person who was not completely subservient was subjected to lashings.  In Kinyarwanda, it's KIBOKO, and this is corporal punishment.  This was -- he was -- could alternatively be banished and removed from the property.
Q.	Witness, how many slaves were there in Rwanda in 1900, for instance?
A.	I would not be able to answer specifically to this question, or precisely to this question, but I will answer you in the following manner:  As I have already indicated, society was structured in such a manner that each individual depended on someone else, and at the bottom of the pile, there were those who were exploited outrageously and that constituted the masses of Hutu and possibly poor Tutsis.  But, once again, there is no sense.  The system was such that there was a generalisation of the system.  The system worked in such a manner that there were slaves who were subjected to other people and this went down the pyramid right up to the bottom level, and you may have seen this thing exist in the relationships between father and son.
Q.	So, Witness, that means that this particular paragraph of the conclusion on the slavery, which I have just drawn your attention to on line 2 of the first paragraph on page 8 of the English text, that you have no basis as an expert in arriving to that conclusion that there was slavery relationship between Tutsi and Hutu; am I correct?
A.	That is not true.  I would say that this is a relation of dependency, domination and total submission.
Q.	You agree with me that in Rwanda in 1900, there were few slaves called Abaga.  Abaga is spelt 
A-B-A-G-A?
A.	Abaga, I know the term Abaga, which referred specifically to sale or UMUGAVU, which referred to a male servant, but I don't know about Abaga.  ABAGA, ABAGAGU are the whole population developed or evolved in this system.  There was no ABAGAGU or ABAGA.  There was a mass of people, and each one, each individual was under the domination of someone else.
Q.	Witness, I will suggest to you that on this page, page 8, your assertion is to the effect that all Hutus were slaves to the Tutsis; am I correct?
A.	You are correct in saying that, but you need to put in a nuance, because if we are looking at this text, you should not have to also refer to the American situation or the situation in India.  The Rwandan situation established in a definite way.  It doesn't operate in the same manner because when you speak about slavery in English, one tends to refer to these big countries, but what happened in Rwanda does not lead one to think about these other elements given the image which was transmitted of a well-structured kingdom, and these bad aspects do not appear in that system.  The terms which I have already mentioned, UMUGARAGU, UMUGA, in other words, and Shebuja; in other words, the female and male servants and the boss referred to a system of domination, exploitation and exploitation or domination of groups, the groups involved.  And since the Hutu constituted the dominated group and the Tutsis the dominant group or domineering group, given what I quoted as references or made by people who noticed this system in place at the time.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, may I crave your indulgence to request the witness to spell all the Rwandan words that is used for the benefit of the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the stenographers.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Could you spell UMUJA, and before that the names that you referred to in the slavery?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
 But before he does that, is the construction you have given, is it an interpretation of your -- of how things -- how you perceive things or how you understand them with regard to the relationship between the Tutsi and Hutus at that particular period in time?  Is it a factual statement or is it an interpretation, this submissive and slavery relations?
THE WITNESS:
These were facts which were attested to show the quotation passages or quotations which existed, but also including books which existed on the history of that time.  But maybe when you move from one language to another, if you move from Kinyarwanda to French or Kinyarwanda to English, words from the Kinyarwanda which operate within a linguistic system, within a specific linguistic system, the words which translate them in French, do not often reflect the same connotation.  That is the problem.   I think that is why, moreover, these terms are used either in English or French as they appear in Kinyarwanda, because there is this impression of lack of faithfulness where there is a strict translation. 

Now, when I am talking about relations, submissions and slavery, this was the relationship between the UMUJA, UMUGARAGU and the SHEBUJA, which translated the total dependency which was established between them.  The SHEBUJA could take or expropriate the property of his UMUGAGURU and use them for himself, for his own purposes.  So when you move from one language to another and you use terms, there are absolute connotations, or which either become eroded when you move to another language or other connotations which are introduced, but these are different terms.  And that's why I gave the example of slavery in relation to America, at a given point in time one cannot compare the two types of slavery or the two terms, because they were operating in two different social linguistic modes.  

Now, for UMUJA, let's start with Umuja, I had spelt it, it was spelt U-M-U-J-A, and that is when we are dealing with the female individual.  Then Umugaragu is spelt U-M-G-A-R-A-G-U.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I am sure the witness missed out the second U.  It's U-M-U-G-A-R-A-G-U, as it is spelt earlier.  The other term, which is Shebuja refer to the master or the boss.  Shebuja is spelt S-H-E-B-U-J-A. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, what is then Abaja?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Your microphone, please, Counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	What is Abaja?
A.	Abaja is the plural of Umuja, slave or servant.
Q.	There were a few of them in the 20th century; isn't it?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	Now, Witness, I draw your attention to page 9, first paragraph in the English text.  The first paragraph starts with the word, "MANIRAGABA", page 78 in parenthesis.  Witness, have you seen it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	In this particular paragraph that starts with, "The atmosphere is therefore tense with the Tutsis, on one side, and the Hutus, on the other side," which is a continuation of your assertion on page 8.  You suggest that all Tutsis were kings in the 20th century.  Now, my question is:  Are there no poor Tutsis?  Are all Tutsis in control or in control or more powerful than the Hutus?
A.	I must say that, first of all, the quotation; the observation of the facts at that time.  Now, the question as to whether all Tutsis were kings, I think there again, there is a problem of social structure.  The social structure being such that -- let me say that the Hutus were at the bottom of the social strata and the Tutsis shared the kingdom the way they deem fit.  Obviously, there were some of them who did not have kingdoms, they did not have an important estate, but this went on all the way through the hills, all the chiefs were almost exclusively Tutsis.  Whether there were poor Tutsis, yes, there were poor Tutsis, but it was an accident, it was a fatality.  That is something that could happen to anybody, but the trend was that the commanders were exclusively Tutsis from the top to the bottom, and the Hutus were at the bottom, relegated to positions of labourers, hewers of wood and so-on and so-forth.
Q.	Now, Witness, were there no Tutsi -- Hutu chiefs in the 20th century?
A.	Which period of the 20th century?
Q.	Up to beyond 1959, were there Tutsi chiefs, yes or no -- I mean, Hutu chiefs, yes or no?
A.	Maybe I should take it right from the beginning.  Regions which were not yet under the centralised system of the kingdom were under Hutus up until the '30s, the 1930s, but when they were integrated into the centralised kingdom, the case of Bugoyi, the case of Murera, the periphery of Ruhengeri, particularly the region that you referred to, as these regions were integrated into the centralised system, the Tutsi king -- the Tutsi kings would replace the Hutu chiefs.  The Hutus should be replaced by Tutsis.  And at that time, there were not many Tutsis in the region such that progressively the chieftancy all the way to the hills were shifted -- or moved onto the Tutsis.  When you follow the evolution all the way to 1959, I think I gave an example, in 1959 when out of 43 chiefs, there were two Hutus and 41 -- there were two Hutus and 41 Tutsis.  The trend was that power was exclusively or almost exclusively Tutsi, and the Hutu chiefs that we found in 1959 were chiefs who were -- who were put there during the colonial period because there was some kind of awakening that was beginning to come out.  And that is how come those Hutu chiefs were place there.
Q.	Witness, are you then saying that before the Germans arrived that there were no Hutu chiefs?
A.	Once again, I said that in the regions that were under the domination of the royal court, the chieftancy went to the Tutsis, or possibly to the Hutus that we saw -- Tutsis who have moved up to a higher social class but, otherwise, chieftancy went normally to the Tutsi.
Q.	But after the arrival of the Germans, the position changed; isn't it?
A.	There was no change.  What kind of change are you talking about?
Q.	For more Hutus than the Tutsi -- more Hutu chiefs than the Tutsi chiefs?
A.	No, I am not sure if we understand each other.  When the Germans came -- when the Germans came, they helped the royal court to control the regions which were even outside authority of the royal court and, progressively, the Hutus who were chiefs of those regions were progressively replaced by the Tutsis.  So, when the Germans came, they did not install Hutu chiefs.  On the contrary, they helped the court to centralise the kingdom, extend the kingdom to those regions which were outside the royal court and impose Tutsi chiefs.
Q.	Witness, we move on to page 10 under item 2, under the Belgians.  That's for the English text.  Under this paragraph you talked about the Hutu chiefs and at the same time, at the beginning of the paragraph -- I mean, at the beginning of this same page, you are talking about Hutu slavery.  I noticed that you all, through the -- your report, you did not discuss, and even in your testimony yesterday, you did not discuss or describe the Hutu chiefs as part of the early 20th century social/political system.  It's a bit confusing.  Can you explain that?
	(Pages 45 to 54 by Haruna Farage)
























	1530H
A.	I think it is the same question that is coming up with the same answers.  I said that when the Europeans came, that the evolution of Rwanda was such that there were peripheral regions which were not yet under the authority of the royal court or where the royal court had not installed its chiefs or, if they were installed, they had difficulty imposing themselves because sometimes there were uprisings.  That is why, in these regions, these were regions that were led by chiefs, we talked about Hutu sub chiefs.  They were under Hutus and were not under the hierarchical system that we referred to.  Sometimes, when I make reference to these regions and you look on the map, you find them on the map of Rwanda today -- I think that is what is causing the confusion, but a centralised kingdom did not have the same boundaries as we have in Rwanda today.  I think that is what is creating some of the confusion which is coming up, which you see with some people who did not know the situation of Rwanda at that time. 
Q.	Witness, on page 13 under the item, "The role of the school," you use this to illustrate the imbalance between the Hutu ethnic group and that of the Tutsi ethnic group.  And on page 15, you analyse the disparity.  Why did you not use the same analysis in illustrating the situation in 1994 where such a system was prevalent, and in terms of schools, the Hutus had the upper hand in 1994?
A.	Your question refers to 1994, so you want me to answer the question in relation to 1994.
Q.	The position in 1994 - perhaps, let me stretch it further from 1993 to 1994, when the Tutsis were deprived of education and the ratio was lower -- that of the Hutus was higher than the Tutsis, why did you not use the same chart to explain the situation that was prevailing in 1993-94 in terms of school, the role of school?  You illustrated the disparity; you concentrated on only when the Tutsis were more educated than the Hutus.
A.	I will answer by saying that I do not have data figures for 1994.  But regarding the university and the situation that prevailed in 1985 to 1988, I will look for it.  In the French version, this is on page 27; this has to deal with higher education in 1988.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not on) 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, this is in the report, but I limited myself to higher education because I was dealing with a specific issue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What could be the equivalent page in the English text?  Professor Hinds, what will be the equivalent page in the English text?
MR. HINDS:
I am trying to find it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Page 37.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.
THE WITNESS:
Here I was dealing with a specific issue, and I was trying to give the figures which were available on higher education -- higher university education, and I referred to the data that was -- that I was given at a specific time.  On the figures for the national university, the major seminary, which was a private institution, there is IAMSEA, there is ISCPA; that is -- they are all public institutions, and that is the last but one.  I took all this data to illustrate the situation at the higher university level because secondary education was much more important.  

Now, when you look at the data, you realise that for the National University of Rwanda, which was the most important institution with the highest number of students, when you look at the index of disparity, Hutus constituted 0.99 and the index for the Tutsis is 1.19 and the Twa 0.11.  The index of disparity is the ratio between the percentage of the population and the percentage of -- in the institutions concerned, the percentage in the institutions concerned.  For example, you realise that the Tutsis are above one, 1.19, and the Hutus are 0.99.  It would have been logical or more rigorous if each time it was one, but there are a certain number of factors, such that it was always limited.  But we realise that at the National University of Rwanda, the Tutsis were not at all disadvantaged.  If you take private education, the major seminary, you see that the Hutus -- the disparity index for the Hutus is 0.65, which is below one, and the Tutsis are 3.53.  You see, that is much higher than one.  The Twa, I did not put anything because there was none.  IAMSEA is an institution of francophone countries which existed in Kigali, and there as well you see the disparity.  Hutus accounted for 0.64 and the Tutsi 4.20, and if we want to be rigorously mathematical, then it should be one, one, but it does not work that way.  UACC is the Adventist University for Central Africa; it is the fourth institution.  And there you see that the Hutus account for 0.83 and the Tutsis 2.53.  

The figures are there, the figures are there, which gave an impression of the representation of the ethnic groups in the educational institutions at that time.  We obviously could say -- I don't know if somebody will say that there was some control, the control of the state was with regard to the National University of Rwanda, but there as well we realise that, for example, there is no considerable imbalance against -- in favour of the Tutsis.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you agree with me that I limited my question to 1993 and 1994, I didn't go to 1988, 1985.  So please respond to my questions, because you understand them, and if you don't, ask me and I will explain.  So my question goes to 1994, and you have already told this Court that your terms of reference included 1994 and as a matter of fact on the page, on the title of your report, suggests that 1994 is the integral part of this report.  And I am sure that your -- the Defence team must have told you the temporal jurisdiction of this Court, so I am restricting you to 1993 and 1994.  Why did you not use the same analysis to show the disparity between the Tutsi and Hutu in terms of education?
A.	I gave the most recent figures which were available to me, and I must say that the policy had not changed in terms of exclusion after 1988.  And I will even say, at least for university education, that the policy of quota had been abandoned in 1990, 1990; that is to say, that admission was no longer done into the universities on the basis of quota, but on the basis of academic merit.  As well, the admission of students was not done -- which was done by the ministry, was no longer done on the basis of their ethnicity but on the basis of academic performance.  So, even if I do not have figures of 1994, at least the trend had indicated in -- at least for 1988, in the upper level of higher education, showed a higher level of openness when it comes to say admission.  So I will say that there was no change after 1998, the data of which we have seen.  The change in terms of state control or limitation, or control of quota, on the contrary, the trend was towards liberalism and the freedom for the institutions with regard to admission of students. 
Q.	Witness, you have told the Court --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And be brief, Witness; be very brief.  I know you can have a lot of words.  Answer very briefly.  We can follow you, if you understand the questions, very well. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you told the Court that you didn't have the data on the ratio of the education in 1994, now you are justifying your position by saying that there was no change, that the situation in 1988 continued up to 1994.  Does that then mean that you actually have the data of 1994 in terms of education, the disparity between the Hutu and the Tutsi ethnic group as regards education?
A.	No.  Taking -- I am saying that taking into account the liberal nature of the policies with regard to higher education in 1987, and taking into account the multiplication of private schools, there was an easier access for students of all groups, because there was no policy of restriction in the admission of students into schools.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What would you like to tell the Trial Chamber on this thing with regard to that kind of disparity that you showed on page 15 of the English text, because if you are to use the diagram you have drawn on page 15 and all the way through, and even one you have referred to, can you -- what would you like the Chamber to understand on this issue that -- with regard to the years 1993, 1994?
THE WITNESS:
I will answer the Court by saying that regarding the situation in 1994, I do not have data.  But let me add, as I have already said, that there was no change in the policy of admissions, a change in terms of limitation of admission of Tutsis into schools.  I have no data for 1994.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that you did not analyse the situation or the disparity between the Tutsi, an ethnic, as regards education in 1994, because the disparity is so wide between the Hutu and the Tutsi; the Hutu had an upper hand in terms of education?  The situation changed completely, and Tutsi were very, very low.  Isn't it true that it is because of that that you did not use - did not analyse the situation in 1994 as regards education?
A.	It is not true.  It is not because of that and it is -- the situation as you are describing it is not true.
Q.	What then is the disparity in the military or political scenes in 19 -- political spheres in 1994, the disparity between the Hutu and the Tutsi ethnic group?  As an expert, what was the situation in terms of the military and political spheres?
A.	I will not answer for what was happening militarily, but politically with multiparty system, political pluralism, I think in 1994 there was a very vast expression of all trends.  The multiparty system had brought about this possibility of -- for all trends to be able to express themselves and be involved in political competition.
Q.	Now, Witness, we move on to page 16, and I draw your attention to Kagame's book.  It is the English text, page 16.  Have you found the French text because I am looking for it?
A.	Yes, yes. 
Q.	Who was or who is A. Kagame?  Who is he?
A.	Kagame was a priest; he was a philosopher, historian; he lectured at the National University of Rwanda as well as other institutions, and he is somebody who has written extensively on Rwanda.  I believe he died sometime in 1981.  Those are -- that is the information I can give on this person.
Q.	So Kagame was a historian, wasn't he?
A.	Yes, he was a historian.
Q.	Are you aware that Nahima (phonetic), whom you testified in his favour, referred to this Kagame in his book and he said that he was thankful to Kagame for giving him so much information on the role of the Hutu rulers in forming the Rwandan state.  And here you are painting him as somebody who was in support of the Tutsis.  Are you aware of this fact?
A.	I am aware of this, but I am also aware of other criticisms against him.
Q.	Kagame was Tutsi, wasn't he?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So, in effect, if he could talk about the Hutu rulers, their role in forming the Rwandan state, he could not possibly have supported the Tutsi dynasty as you have stated in this paragraph?
A.	In this paragraph --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it a Tutsi dynasty or what?
MS. OJEMENI:
Tutsi dynasty, in this paragraph.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which paragraph?  
MS. OJEMENI: 
On the second paragraph; the paragraph is still in support of his assertion on the disparity index of the education.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The paragraph that starts with the Huguka newspaper?
MS. OJEMENI: 
No.  Inganji.  It's on page 15, on the second paragraph on the subject, the book "Inganji Kalinga". 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	In Nahima's book, he recognises Kagame as somebody who was very useful to his -- the contribution in his book, by giving him the role -- information on the role that the Hutu rulers played in forming the Rwandan state.  So my question is, if such a man could say this, in such a situation, to bring out the usefulness of Hutu chiefs -- the role the Hutu chiefs played in the forming of the Rwandan state, how could you then say here that this man supported the Tutsi dynasty?
A.	I think here we need to make a distinction.  There is Kagame from 1940 who produced "Inganji Kalinga".  That was at a certain stage in his evolution of the study of Rwanda.  Then there is the Kagame of the abridged version of the "History of Rwanda", which he published and which goes all the way to 1912.  I think that was published in 1915.  Indeed, what happened is that the Kagame of 1975 contradicts the Kagame of 1940 -- contradicts the Kagame of "Inganji Kalinga".  What you see in "Inganji Kalinga" he modifies, amends and corrects that, and incorporates it in an abridged version of the "History of Rwanda" and later on an abridged version of the history of Rwanda.  I referred to Kagame when he wrote "Inganji Kalinga" in the forties, and I believe I even mentioned it further on -- later on that this was due to the political changes or the presence of other researchers, that Kagame had to change what he wrote in "Inganji Kalinga" in the role of Hutu chiefs in the construction of Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that  is not indicated here, Witness, this change, 1975, or whereabouts.  Is it indicated?
MR. HINDS:
Yes, Your Honour, in the next paragraph.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, this can be found in the paragraph.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Where?
A.	I can read the passage, if you so wish.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go ahead.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Go ahead.
A.	It is in the same paragraph.  It is in the same paragraph where you have "Inganji Kalinga".  I wrote that this concern -- that after the change of the institutions in 1959 and the young university graduate researchers emerged, Kagame concluded that in fact these people who had been referred to as the Abahinza in 1940 were indeed Abami because in "Inganji Kalinga" this title was not recognised, and even better, that even the Tutsi kings went through this stage, when their kingdom was still tiny, and that the Hutu kings were rebaptised Abahinza after their kingdoms were conquered by the Nyiginya dynasty.  

So here I acknowledge that Kagame has changed.  And now what you are denying or what you are saying in "Inganji Kalinga" had been amended to get closer to historical reality.  So when I criticise him, I am not criticising Kagame from the beginning to the end, I am referring to this small book "Inganji Kalinga", which was written in Kinyarwanda, and I mention the evolution which led to a recognition of these old Hutu kings.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, my question is on what precisely he has read.  He has not said anything different. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, could you go on?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I draw your attention to page 17, first paragraph, under "Awareness of social discontent" where you stated that the Tutsis - "The Tutsi class adopted a hard line and a group of court loyalists gave the following response."  I am not going to go into the response.  My question is on the Tutsi hard line.  Are you then saying that all Tutsi class adopted a hard line?  What about the progressive Tutsi you talked about at page 18, the last paragraph of page 18 in the English text?  Can you explain?
A.	There is no contradiction.  What there is, in fact, is, the holder of the monarchy system in place was hostile to change; that amounts to the Tutsis.  There were progressive forces who were favourable to wider opening -- openness, to reforms, to the ideas of justice and democracy, but when I refer to progressive forces of the time, I am putting them in opposition to the conservative or traditionalist leaders.  It is not a contradiction.  

We have what held -- the feudal system as they existed.  We have seen what they said, and then we have the attitude of those who amongst the progressive Tutsi forces, because these existed, there were some chiefs who were able to see this problem and they were favourable.  So it's not a contradiction of -- by saying that there were traditionalists who held one position and there were the progressive forces who had another position.
Q.	Witness, we go to page twe --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We plan to take a break.  Will that be -
MS. OJEMENI: 
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We will take a break for 15 minutes and resume our work at a quarter past four. 

Until then, these proceedings stand adjourned.  
	(Court recessed from 1601 to 1620H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed. 

Yes, Counsel, please.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we were on page 17 when we adjourned, and I draw your attention to the last paragraph on page 17 of the English text.  I refer you to the first two lines on the last paragraph.  Could you tell the Court how many Tutsis you referred to that benefited from the feudal monarchy regime in 1959, and what is your source?
A.	I do not quite see the paragraph you are referring to because -
Q.	Page 17 of the English text.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What could it be the French text?  
MR HINDS: 
It would be page 12 of the French text. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Last paragraph?
MR. HINDS:
It will be page 12 of the French text.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Last paragraph?
MR. HINDS:
I am trying to locate it.   As soon as we do, we will let you know.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, it is the second paragraph on page 12.
MR. HINDS:
On page 12.
MS. OJEMENI:
Starting from the first line. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I would like you to tell the Court how many Tutsis benefited from the relationship you've just described between the Tutsi and Hutu from the feudal monarchy regime in 1959, and could you tell the Court the source for this conclusion?
A.	I do not want to give the numbers because it is not a matter of figures.  What I would say rather, is that, as we have already seen with the Germans and the Belgians, there was a policy of -- for the monarchy and a policy of the colonial powers of preferring Tutsis in all areas.  And what we see in this passage, as it is said, we see that the Batutsi and the bahutu are presented, and what is expressed is aimed at us, the bahutu and they, the Tutsi, the Batutsi.  So there is a division between the two groups, at least a dichotomy exists with regard to maintaining the regime in power which others are beginning to challenge, and others who want to go forward towards the reforms.  

Now, as to how many, I would say that most of the Tutsis benefited from that regime and the large part of the Hutus were victims of that system.  But the most important thing that you need to bear in mind is that there was an awareness amongst the people, both amongst the Hutus and the Tutsis, who wanted things to change in the interests of the country, in the interests of the groups involved.
Q.	Witness, my questions are very clear.  Is it fair then to say that you do not have any source for that conclusion and you have no data on the number of Tutsis that benefited from the feudal monarchy in 1959, as you have you have asserted here?
A.	No, I am not saying that I am not basing myself on no source.  I am basing myself on the policy as it was expressed, saying that we were privileged or advantaged, this group, the Tutsis.  The Germans and the Belgians had the same policy.  Institutions that they established, the schools and employment services also encouraged this policy which favoured one group and ignored another.  So all these factors have established a class, a group of individuals belonging to one group and who benefited from that policy.  I am saying that they do not benefit at the same level, but the policy as it existed made it that all the advantages went to this group.  And it's that -- what I am saying, I cannot say that it was 1,000 or 10,000, what I am saying is that there is this desire to orient one group towards the advantages, towards social wellbeing and to ignore the other group.  This is the way I can answer your question, otherwise the references are there.

1630H
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Would that I refer you to page 20 of the English text and I draw your attention to paragraph 3.  This should be 14 of the French text, paragraph 3 as well.  I draw your attention to the 400 years of feudality you've referred to in that paragraph.  Could you, then, tell the Court what part of the 400 years that the Tutsi ruled, because earlier on you've talked about the European helping the Hutu rulers to expand the Rwandan state.  So, could you tell the Court what part of the 400 years that the Tutsi ruled and, once again, could you tell the Court your source?  Be precise, even if you have the reference, would you refer the Court to your source?
A.	I've said that the Europeans helped the Tutsis and not the Hutus in order to set themselves up, I mean the state, in order to maintain them.  As to the famous 400 years, now, this is something which is advanced by all historians, that the Rwandan kingdom started to evolve in the 15th century; that is the emergence of that Rwandan state which is going to evolve from what is known as gasabo, spelt 
G-A-S-A-B-O.  That is why it was often said Rwanda was gasabo and, from there, somewhere there in Kigali préfecture, this evolution lasted 400 years, until the arrival of the Europeans.  And when I say Europeans, because you are asking me the question, what I mean is when the Europeans arrived they did not destroy the structures they found in place.  They did not destroy the monarchy system, they adopted -- I'm referring to the Germans to begin with -- they adopted the principle of indirect government, in other words, the use of structures in place.  

When the Belgians arrived they had time to bring in their administrators, so they worked together with the Tutsis and progressively, gradually they took over the decision-making powers, but amongst the Rwandans they preferred the Tutsi class, the Tutsi group, in terms of advantage and privileges that they could provide.  This is why I referred to the super position of the feudal colonial system and the monarchy, which subsists together with a series of structures linked to the monarchy, and then there is the colonial administration or structure which uses the traditional structures.  That is what I mean by the colonial superimposition, when I refer to the Europeans who helped the Hutus, as you said, but it was the Tutsis that they helped to impose themselves.  I'm, in fact, referring to the Germans who enabled King Musinga to beat a candidate who wanted to overcome him.  

It also refers to the Germans who allowed the Court, the royal court, to integrate the area of Ruhengeri, of Gisenyi, areas to the north in the volcanos, integrate these states in their unit state.  These are areas that were at the borders that we know right now, but which belonged to the Belgian colony, so there's a superimposition of the two systems: the colonial system and the feudal system are going to develop hand in hand in the management of the country and, obviously, they will be helping one another mutually.
Q.	So, Witness, does that, then, answer the question I've asked you?  My question was, which part was under the feudalism of the Tutsi, which part of the 400 years that you referred to in that paragraph, and which part now was under the colonial regime, as you've testified now?  If you know, say so, please, so that we can move forward; enough of the lectures.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
That's not the problem.  I've just mentioned what the problem was.  Tutsis reigned in Rwanda over an entity which is gradually going to expand and it is in the course of that development or extension that the Europeans arrived.  The Europeans arrived at the beginning of the 20th century, the end of the 19th century, and when they came the Rwandan kingdom was under construction under the Tutsi monarchy and the Europeans who arrived, as I have said, they are going to superimpose their way of government over the traditional monarchical system of government without destroying the latter.  So if you look at the situation there's the Tutsi monarchy, which sees the imposition of another structure, the colonial structure.  The colonial structure did not offer it independently of the feudal structure because it --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have been through that.  If you want to explain which of the 400 years where the Tutsis were in control, I think that was the advanced question by counsel.  If it is during the 400 years before the oncoming of the colonialists, you should say so or explain briefly.  We may be aware of the colonial setup in the rest of Africa at the beginning or the end of the 19th century, so can you answer the question?
THE WITNESS:
I would answer by saying that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know whether we have restated your question correctly.
MS. OJEMENI:
It is correct, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please answer so we can move on, very briefly, if you have understood the question; if not, counsel will put it back to you.  We have followed that part of the evidence you have given.
THE WITNESS:
I can respond.  Colonisation lasted some 60 years, from 1900 to 1959, and, obviously, the Germans arrived earlier, so it's roughly 60 years, between 50 and 60 years; whereas the monarchy lasted until that moment from the establishment of the Rwandan state.  There was no break with regard to the monarchy, it's up to 1959; whereas colonisation is from the end of the 19th century up to 1959.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And what is your source for this conclusion?
A.	I have already mentioned somewhere the conditions under which the feudal colonial regimes came to an end and then there are also historical facts which exist.  I mentioned, in fact, the case of Algeria --
THE INTERPRETER:
I'm not sure that's what the witness said.
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry, but I was not going to be looking for all the documentary evidence, in terms of history, but what I wanted understood was the development of the relationships between the locals and the Europeans.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Would that you are you referring to page 23 of the English text, which is page 16 of the French text?  Are you referring to the second paragraph on this page 23, which is the third paragraph on French text, line -- "The first line under the armed conflict and its effect on interethnic relations and a risk as seen in the previous chapter until 1990 the relationship between Hutu and Tutsi was cordial and relaxed."  Have you seen that?
A.	I've got the text.
Q.	Will you agree with me this statement is false, isn't it, in the light of our discussion of your testimony regarding the atrocities that were committed by the monarchy, particularly the -- your reference to King Rwabugiri, Rwabugiri.  Do you understand my question, that is: this statement is false?
A.	I stand by saying that it is true.
Q.	You recall your testimony earlier on in this document that the Tutsi king, Rwabugiri, committed a lot of atrocities and you referred to Tutsis killing Hutus and I asked you questions on that as well.  So you cannot say that the relationship between Hutus and Tutsis were cordial and relaxed until -- I mean prior to 1990.  You've also testified to other things that happened between the BaHutus and BaTutsis, so you can't say that the relationship was cordial and relaxed.
A.	I think that you need to consider that statement in view of what precedes it.  We are talking about interethnic relations as they developed and they include up to the period of 1990.  I'm saying up until 1990, and this is in reference to the previous part, because we had said there that there was a situation of peace and calm, that's what was in the previous chapter, and obviously when I say until 1990, this does not set aside what was said in the previous chapter.
Q.	You've also testified that even up until 1990 there was a quota system in terms of employment, schools.  How could that have been a relaxed atmosphere or cordial relationship between the ethnic groups that no one is dominating the other, how could such a situation be considered to be a cordial or relaxed atmosphere?
A.	Yes.  I didn't speak about the quota system in employment.  The quota system, in relation to education, what is referred to as regional or ethnic balance, in reality, this was a system which was set up when there was disparity noted between the places available, the resources, if you will, and the large number of candidates or potential students.  It was realised that there should be at least similar percentages in the admissions, as well as in the base population, and that is a situation which should not be ideal, it should not be the norm.  When there are a lot of elements; this is a situation or system which should not be allowed to persist.  But, as I have already said, in the case of admissions to university, the quota system there was never in favour of the minority groups.  Regionally speaking, it was a little more different, but at the ethnic level the objective of the quota system was not to stop others from benefiting from admission to schools, but it was to have them to operate in a situation which would allow all the groups to be represented.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would make it quickly, Witness, the question made reference to the quota system but you are not being asked to define, you know, to the extent that you have gone.  Could you please listen carefully to the question so that you can give precise answers?  We would like to save a bit of time.  Can you put the question back?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that the statement I refer to on page 23 of the English text, where you stated that a relationship between Hutus and Tutsis was cordial and relaxed until 1990 and my reason is that you have testified to the fact that the Tutsis were in control during this period you've referred to before 1990, I mean before 1990 (sic).

Secondly, the Tutsis committed atrocities and I made reference to a particular instance where you referred to the regime under Rwabugiri, which is on page 7, and I said that such a situation cannot be described as a relaxed and cordial relationship, particularly when a particular ethnic group, the Tutsi, according to your testimony, was dominating the Hutus before 1959, which falls within the period in question.
A.	I am surprised that we are coming back to this issue in those terms because I have said that when I say until 1990 it is not in relation to the point which comes prior to this.  The previous subject was the relationships in colonial era from the beginning of the arrival of the colonialists until later in 1959, and we are talking about the period 1973 to 1992 and, if I was speaking about this for the first time, this would mean that there is a contradiction but you need, also, to take in account this affirmation, this assertion comes after the development that appears in previous chapters.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, just a clarification.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, you agree with me that during this period in question, 1973 that you've mentioned, to 1992, the quota system was in place, quota system in relation to schools, jobs, in Rwanda; am I correct?
A.	I agree with you insofar as education is concerned and there, also, I specified under what framework.  As for the other fields, there was no quota system; therefore, I agree with you with regard to education and I wish to add that with regard to the quota system, it did not create interethnic tension in Rwanda.
Q.	That's in your view, it did not create, but given discussions we've heard of your testimony, so far, on the fact that at one time or the other one group, ethnic group, dominated the other group.  Are you now telling the Court that within this period there was no group that dominated the other, which group caused social -- I mean at least destabilised the atmosphere, the atmosphere can then not be qualified as cordial and relaxed?
A.	Yes, I maintain what I said by saying that this system, the quota system, with regard to education, did not create inequalities because its objective and its reality was not to repress any one ethnic group or the other, it was for a fair sharing of the resources and, as I have said, it was a measure which was valid for a limited period of time, given limited resources, also.
Q.	Witness, I have moved from the quota system and I'm asking you, based on your previous testimony on the fact that one group at any given time dominated the other, and I'm asking you, are you telling this Court that up until within the period before 1990 that Hutu ethnic group did not dominate -- using 1973 and 1990, now -- did not dominate the Tutsi ethnic group and, as such, you cannot describe such situations as a relaxed and cordial atmosphere, as you've done in this paragraph?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour, this has been asked and answered over and over again.  Just look at the next sentence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which sentence?
MR. HINDS:
It's been asked and answered and the witness keeps going over and over again, and I'm saying that's in the report, you look at the next sentence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let the witness say so.  Please answer that question, briefly.
THE WITNESS:
In fact, I think I've answered the question, unless it is required that I go back to it, but I am stating that between 1973, in particular, there was no philosophy about domination of the Hutus by the Tutsis.  I don't really want to explain this because I might take time in doing so, but I really want to maintain my statement, stand by it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take note of that answer.  

Can you go on, Counsel?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, why was the quota system introduced there?  Why was it put in place within that period?
A.	I've already said that in a situation of limited resources, in a situation where there is a big demand, what do you do, you need to have a policy of distribution which will not offend any group, a policy which will be as fair as possible, and I did say that the ideal situation would have been not to be reduced to that kind of option that we should have unlimited resources.  Now, what would have happened if this policy of fairness or balance was not introduced and that there were more Hutus than Tutsis, the difference would have been much bigger. 

Now, when we talk about domination, I don't know what we mean, whether it is statistical domination.  It is obvious that the group that is statistically in the majority will be more visible, but when you have this regulatory system, which prevents one group from taking up all the places or which prevents the statistical minority group to be overrepresented and the other group, the solution, the quota system is the -- it's not the best of solutions, but it is not to prevent one group from advancing but it is to prevent another group from taking over all the resources.
Q.	Within that period, Witness, which group was in the majority within '97 and 1990, which ethnic group was in the majority, going by your testimony a while ago?
MR. PRESIDENT:
What kind of majority, population-wise?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, ethnic, he just talked about it.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the Hutu in the population were in the majority.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I refer you to page 24 and -- of the English text and the first page -- the first paragraph on that page.  I draw your attention to the third paragraph, third line from the top.
A.	Which page in French?
Q.	Seventeen.  And I draw your attention to line ten of the English text. This should be --
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not on)
MS. OJEMENI:
English text is the first paragraph, line ten.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	The French text is paragraph two, the ninth line on paragraph two.  The English text says, "The first signs of suspicion emerged during the massive arrests of persons thought to be accomplices in the night of 4 to 5 October 1990."  My question is:  Who were these accomplices and who did they arrest?
A.	These alleged accomplices were the Tutsis and some Hutus and then they were arrested by the, then, government as part of this war of 1990.
Q.	Was this the same period that Tutsi educated men in Ruhengeri Préfecture were arrested and detained?
A.	The Ruhengeri Tutsi intellectuals, I do not know them; but I know at least one who was my colleague who was arrested during that period.  Otherwise, I do not know others who were arrested in Ruhengeri; but I know that particular one, it was during the same period.
Q.	Which ethnic group arrested them?
A.	It was the power, the then power.  I will not say the Hutu but I will say the government in power.
Q.	And how many of these Tutsis were arrested?
A.	Reference was made to a figure of about 5,000.  I don't have the exact figure, but it was in that order, 5,000.
Q.	Witness, I notice that you played this part down and in other areas you mentioned how the RPF killed Hutus and you mentioned the number, but in this sentence the Tutsis were involved and there's no mention of the number or even an indication of the people who were actually arrested.
A.	I'm not downplaying this aspect because in the absence of figures at least I referred to these arrests as being massive, and that should indicate that it was quite important.
Q.	Witness, I take you to the next paragraph on the same page, which says, "Officially there was an attack on Kigali."  Was there really an official attack and, if so, what is your source?
A.	I got this information from statements made by the military authorities of the time, these were statements that were put on the national radio and which were, therefore, within the public domain.  Now, regarding my opinion as to whether there was really an attack, I would like to -- I do not want to make a statement on this because I've never had an objective position on this situation.
Q.	What, then, is your view on it, on this subject.  What is your view?
A.	On this issue I will say what I think.  What I think is that there was a feeling of fear.  I don't know if there was really an attack.  I heard a statement, just as everyone did, but my impression is out of context, being what it was, generate fear, rather, and I do not want to say anything about this because I really don't know whether the attack took place or not.  But I want to revert to this official statement made by the military authorities of the time.
Q.	Witness, you were not sure whether there was an attack and you deemed this important to mention this in your report as an expert?
A.	I'm not sure.  I'm saying what was said on radio because there was the beginning of a trial and the people were released; so I don't know, I just don't know if there was an attack or not.  I can't say anything about that situation.  The only thing that I can say, that it was within an atmosphere of war that was starting within the country.
Q.	And, also, with the figure of 500,000 (sic) you give as the number of Tutsis arrested you also got the figure from media; isn't it?
A.	No, reference was made to this at the time.  These were estimates.  I don't have the exact figure, but I know it was in the order of thousands; I'm saying about 5,000, maybe it was more or less.  I'm not too sure.
Q.	Reference was made from where, I mean there must be some source and what is the source?
A.	The source was that there was, first of all, the radio, which gives the source by saying that there were arrests, and then this was discussed, but I am saying that I do not have the exact figure.  I read in the neighbourhood of 5,000.  I cannot remember the exact figure and I could not lay hands on it.
Q.	You read it from the paper, from the newspaper or from radio, you heard it from radio, where?  There must be somewhere.  How did you come about this figure?
A.	You mean the massive arrests?
Q.	I'm talking about the figure you just referred to, the figure of about 500,000, you said there were references here and there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that 500,000 or 5,000?
MS. OJEMENI:
5,000, I beg your pardon.
MS. OJEMENI:
I withdraw that, 5,000.
MR. HINDS:
Asked and answered.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, those figures were referred to in the newspapers, but I will say, once again, that I saw these figure in the newspapers but I don't have it in my memory and I don't have the document that has that figure which will enable me to give you the exact figure.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, we move on to page 25 of the English text and I draw your attention to paragraph two.  It's page 18 of the French text, paragraph two, as well, the third sentence.  "It could therefore be said that the conflict brought the Hutu-Tusi problem to the surface and reopened old wounds that had begun to heal."  Now, my question is this:  Was the killing of Tutsi right after the start of the war of October 1, 1990, was there killing of Tutsi?
A.	Are you talking about the period -- the years that followed?  I'm not too sure about the period you are referring to.
Q.	I am referring to the attack of October 1, 1990 and my question is this:  Was there killing of Tutsi prior to that?
A.	Before 1990?
Q.	October 1, 1990.
A.	Before that date, at least up until 1973, there were no killings of Tutsi.
Q.	How about the killing of 300 civilians in Kibilira of Tutsis, civilian Tutsis in Kibilira, 300 civilians killed by the army.  The spelling of Kibilira is K-I-B-I-L-I-R-A and is in the northeast of Rwanda.
A.	Is there a question?
Q.	I asked you a question whether there was killing of Tutsis prior to October 1, 1990, and you said no.  And then I referred you to the killing of civilian Tutsis which took place in Kibilira by the soldiers and Kibilira is in the northeast.  Are you saying you didn't hear about this killing, as well?
MR. HINDS:
Counsel, can we have a year if you have one?
MS. OJEMENI:
Can he answer, please?  I've already given you the time frame. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Before October 1, 1990.
A.	Are you saying that the killing of those people took place before 1st October, 1990.
Q.	Yes, that's what I'm saying.
A.	I do not have this information.
Q.	I said before October 1, 1990, sorry, before October 1 -- after October 1, 1990.
MR. HINDS:
Is it before or after?
MS. OJEMENI:
After October 1, 1990.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I repeat my question and my question now is after October 1, 1990, where there were subsequent killings of Tutsi civilians.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well --
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour, that does not contradict anything the witness said.  He said there was no killing between 1973 and 1990, so a part of this question made sense.
MS. OJEMENI:
Perhaps, when I ask my next question you will know that it makes sense, but I've withdrawn that, which means I've withdrawn my answer to my previous question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are starting all over?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, are you aware of the killing of Tutsis, about 300 civilian Tutsis, by the army in the northeast of Rwanda after the October 1st of 1990?
A.	I'm not aware of the identity of those who committed that, but I know that there was some ethnic violence in that region and that, indeed, there were victims, but I wouldn't know if these were exclusively Tutsis or whether they were Hutus, but I know there were victims, including Tutsis, at least I heard about it.
Q.	But in nowhere in your report did you mention that.  You've been talking about Hutus being killed but in your report there is no mention of this other group that was killed after October 1, 1990 or you didn't consider it important?
A.	No, that is not how it is.  I don't have the reference but I did mention the killings of civilian population, Hutu as well as Tutsis.  I'm sure, among others, I mentioned Kibilira and other regions like that, but that is in another place.  I did mention the killings of Tutsis.  I did not give details of each case.  I lumped them together, be they Hutu civilians or Tutsi civilians.  I did mention that aspect, which exacerbated the tension.
Q.	Now, Witness, I refer you to page 27 under item 4 of the English text and could you tell the Court your source for your assertion in this paragraph?
A.	Page 4?
Q.	English, paragraph 4, page 19, where the French is; where the English is, page 27, paragraph 2 item 4?
A.	Here I did not specify the source, but that was a mistake, it escaped me, but I was citing Gasana in the document, which I have given in the reference section.  He makes reference to this aspect.  I also made reference to Antonio Ntara, but Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu gave some information, as well, in his testimony before the French parliamentary committee, so it's a point that can be confirmed from other sources.
Q.	Witness, what is the first name of Gasana?
A.	James.  It's not Anastase, it's James Gasana, which we have in the reference section.
Q.	What's the ethnicity of James Gasana?
A.	I believe he's Hutu.  I have no precise information on that, but I believe he's Hutu.
Q.	Can you tell the Court your thoughts on the same page, item 5, page 20 in French text and is the first sentence on item 5.  Could you tell the Court your source for the 40,000 victims you referred to in Byumba?
A.	Yes.  There, again, I was referring to Gasana.  That can be checked. I made reference to some documents; it's James Gasana who provided that information and he analysed this situation extensively.
Q.	What was Gasana in 1994?  What work did he do?
A.	In 1994 he was no longer living in Rwanda, he was living in exile and that since 1993 -- since 1993 he went into exile and he was living outside the country.
Q.	Why did he go into exile?
A.	He was a minister and he disagreed with the policies of the government and he was afraid and, therefore, decided to resign and leave the country.
Q.	Witness, what was the source of Gasana; was there an official source or it was just based on his work?
A.	James Gasana is a consultant and a researcher.  He is someone who lived these events and had a network of information in the country.  He published a book, which I was not able to consult before writing this paper, but regarding the Rwandan situation he's not somebody who will invent, he's a researcher.
Q.	But you were in Ruhengeri during this period, and what was the official version of the number of victims?  What was the official -- as somebody who wrote the book, I'm sure you would have also tried to compare notes with the official census on this attack.
A.	Which book are you referring to, madam?
Q.	My question is, the 400,000 victims, what is your official version of this version of the number of victims?
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 40,000.
MS. OJEMENI:
40,000.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	40,000 victims killed in Byumba, as you stated here, what was the official version, apart from Gasana's version?
A.	There's no official gazette of victims which came out as the attacks went on.  There were also estimates made by a number of organisations, but there was no official gazette which would give data on victims; what I mean is a government version.  The attacks went on, and on each occasion, the data would change, but we find this figure or what we find with most researchers and NGOs, the figure that often comes up is around 40,000.
Q.	Witness, you realise that -- do you agree with me that there were some Bagogwe Tutsis that were killed around this time and there's no mention of these Bagogwes in your report in Ruhengeri, they were killed in Ruhengeri?
A.	I did not mention all the cases of killings.  I gave examples.  There were so many, so many.  So if I did not do that, it was not to downplay or to deny but what I did was to give examples.  It is not comprehensive data, I gave those as examples to illustrate the situation, but otherwise there were so many cases that I did not mention which, nonetheless, were true, they happened, it's not negligence.  It is just that what is important is to point out that these things took place and the fact that they took place exacerbated the interethnic tension.
Q.	Witness, we are talking about interethnic relations here and we are talking of a particular period, 23rd February 1993, and there were notable killings that took place around the same area of Ruhengeri that is mentioned in this paragraph.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, objection.  I think that the witness's testimony on direct spoke to February 8, he pointed out that there was a typographical error and so the Prosecutor, if she wants to acknowledge this, can then rephrase the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was 8th?
MS. OJEMENI:
I take the correction.
MR. HINDS:
It was the 8th.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Instead of 23rd.
MR. HINDS:
That's correct.
MS. OJEMENI:
I take the correction, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that was, indeed, what he said.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, it was even mentioned on the heading of the paragraph.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, my question is this, after this attack of 8th February 1993 many Bagogwe Tutsis were killed in Ruhengeri and what we are dealing with is interethnic relations in Rwanda.  My question is this:  You did not consider the killing of this particular ethnic group, which took place around the same area, at least to be mentioned in your report; am I correct?
A.	My analysis focuses on the country as a whole and I've already said that the conflict led to interethnic tension.  Those killings are part of the consequences of the conflict and I'm saying that I'm not denying this, just as I'm not denying the abuses and killings that took place.  The fact that I'm not mentioning them, it's not an intention to downplay them, it is just that I did not mention everything.  I did mention some examples so as to give the diversified nature of the situation.  I mentioned civilians, Tutsi civilians as well as Hutu civilians, and I said that all these were part of the killings of the civilians which created or, in any event, exacerbated the tension that was caused by the attack and that, specifically, it is when we saw that the attack brought about the situation of these which led to this regrettable and dramatic event.
Q.	So, in fact, Witness you knew about the killing of these Bagogwes, didn't you, in Ruhengeri?
A.	I don't know if it was in Ruhengeri or elsewhere, but I do know that there were killings of civilian Tutsi and Hutu, Ruhengeri, Mutare, Kibilira, it took place.  The problem is that I will not say that I know the details, but I have information which was available to the people that these killings did take place.
Q.	Now, Witness, let's go to the one you know the details.  We take the 40,000 victims, can you tell the Court how many of them were Hutus and how many were Tutsis?
A.	In this kind of conflict or situation as this it is generally difficult to take a head count on account of the scope of the attack, because this was an attack that went from Ruhengeri, the volcano region, all the way to the eastern region of Mutara, so there was no head count, at least none that I know of, which indicates that there were X number of Hutu and Y number of Tutsis.  What I know is that Hutus and Tutsi alike died, but more Hutu than Tutsi, and on account of the selective nature of the victims targeted by the RPF.
Q.	Witness, as an expert testifying on enter relations -- ethnic relations, you did not consider it necessary to find out how many Tutsis or Hutus were included in these victims, the 40,000 victims you've mentioned; is that your evidence?
A.	What we should note is that they were Rwandan victims of the conflict.  Now the details, the Hutus, the Tutsis, it might be interesting at another level, but what I observed, what comes out is that these victims, the 50,000 Hutus --
THE INTERPRETER:
Said the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
-- were innocent victims and that their death aggravated the interethnic relationship, and it is not that I am downplaying the distinction but we also need to look at some practical aspects, particularly the time allowed for the work.  You need to look at the time that the Tribunal accorded me to do this work and so on and so forth.  So what is to be borne in mind is that this attack, just as others, caused victims on either side but that the consequence, on account of the nature of the perception of the attackers, the consequence on interethnic relations were negative.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The translation that came through in your answer, Witness, was 50,000.  Is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
It's 40,000 which was killed, which is in the document.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What you are telling the Court, in effect, is that you picked up Gasana's book, just stated whatever is stated there without confirming how he got the number and you brought it to the Tribunal without any justification, apart from the fact it was stated in Gasana's book and that's your reference, that's your source; is that your what you're telling the Court?
A.	No, I'm not certain things happened in that manner.
Q.	You are telling the Court there was no official census on this particular attack, as to how many Tutsis were killed and how many Hutus were killed?
A.	None that I'm aware of.  If there was any that was done, I'm not aware of that.
Q.	Your Honour, looking at the time I just have on this paragraph; otherwise, I could just --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You still have questions on that paragraph?
MS. OJEMENI:
Just one question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can ask that question.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I refer you to the quotation within item five, where you made mention of weapons, grenades, bullets and chemical weapons used by RPF in conducting the attack.  Now, my question is what do you mean by chemical weapons?
A.	It is not my view.  I'm giving the view of the Ruhengeri préfectural committee to describe the situation of chemical weapons that were referred to.  It is obvious that those who mentioned it had reason to do so, though it is important, this I believe, the information which is there, on the conditions under which people died, how the victims died.  That is what I took note of.  The chemical weapons is not my opinion, it is the opinion of that committee, and what is important, as I said here, is the conditions under which the victims died.
Q.	Witness, here you're of the view that it is only RPF that killed, no other, not even the Rwandan army, not Interahamwe or any other ethnic group that killed, it was just the RPF; is that correct?
A.	We should see how the attack took place, it is the RPF that advanced deep into the country.  First of all, during that period there was no Interahamwe to be armed and then during that period the army did not attack the RPF-controlled area, it was the RPF that attacked.  I say that it entered deep into the country all the way to Ruendo.  I don't know if we've already seen Ruendo, it's about 40 kilometres from Kigali.  So the victims were civilians.  There were no victims on the side of the government because the government side was fighting the RPF and not the population.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, we can adjourn if it's convenient, a convenient time to adjourn.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can you give us an idea, for the sake of planning tomorrow, how long do you think you will still take?
MS. OJEMENI:
About three hours, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
About three hours.
MS. OJEMENI:
Tomorrow morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
By noon.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  But it all depends on how the witness answers, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have to have an idea.  We move fast, of course that means if by noon or thereabout you finish your cross-examination -- it is not easy for counsel for the Defence to have an idea how long he would then -- how much time he will need for re-examination.  We don't ask you to commit yourself, we just want to see when we might start the testimony of the accused, that's the kind of idea we want to have.
MR. HINDS:
Okay, let me share with the Court my thinking along those lines.  We would need some time to prepare Mr. Kajelijeli.  So after this witness -- I have not even been able to go back over to the prison, so, therefore, I would need some time, depending upon when that ends.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we would like, at least, to start the testimony of the accused on Thursday or sometime, even to get started because you know we are beginning to get behind schedule, as it were.
MR. HINDS:
Yes.  I would need a minimum of four hours between this witness's testimony and Mr. Kajelijeli.  No matter what they do, I need four hours to prepare.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, let's see, Counsel, if you are able to do it within a shorter period of time, that would be much better, but let us leave the three hours and see how much time the Defence will need from that time to do their re-examination, and we shall keep things -- we shall weigh things as they develop, but those are the concerns the Trial Chamber wanted to put across to the parties.
MS. OJEMENI:
You addressed me, Your Honour, that's why I stood up.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we'll adjourn these proceedings to tomorrow at nine in the morning.  

Witness, please be so advised.  

So until tomorrow at nine in the morning these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court adjourned 1738H)
