P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 1st of February 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same. 

Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
We are in open session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were there some problems this morning with the witness?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I don't know what happened there, but I'll look into it, but WVS felt that we hadn't communicated with them, and I'll have to look into that.  Obviously, I apologise for the delay, but it was a delay put to reasonably good use; I can add that this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we thank you for coming to give evidence at the Tribunal.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
I hear you well, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, to commence your testimony, the Registrar will administer an oath for you to tell the truth.  Mr. Registrar.  
(Declaration made by Witness 9/31 in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you'll be giving your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers who are designated for that purpose.  Mr. Hooper, the lawyer representing the Accused Rwamakuba, will be the first person to question you.  

Mr. Hooper.
  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you.  Mr. President, can we go into closed session for the purpose of going through identification details and other matters for the protection of the witness, which will take approximately 10  minutes -- 15 minutes?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  For the benefit of the public, we go into a closed session for about 15 minutes, where matters which may reveal the identity of this protected witness may be discussed.  We go into closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 8] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So you were just telling us that you knew -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, are we in open or closed session?  The lights are back on. 
MR. HOOPER:
We are now in open session.  We are now in open session. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you've told us who you are and where you lived and your knowledge of André Rwamakuba, a person you know, and you've said that you didn't see him at all in your area during the period of the genocide.  And can I ask you this?  Have you heard at -- in particular, at Gacaca, and we've heard particular details about the Gacaca that you attend, have you ever heard anyone make an allegation at those Gacaca hearings against André Rwamakuba?  
A.	In our Gacaca jurisdiction, no accusation has been leveled against André Rwamakuba and his name has never been mentioned before the Gacaca -- our Gacaca jurisdiction, and in any case its work has now been accomplished, and as and until that work was accomplished, his name was never mentioned. 
Q.	Now, when you say the Gacaca work has been accomplished, would I be correct in thinking you're saying that it's been accomplished at that cellule level and now goes to commune level?  Is that right or not? 
A.	Yes.  When all the information has been collected in respect of the people implicated in the genocide, and when we have the names of all the people involved, the perpetrators and the people who were imprisoned for no reason, all that information is collated.  All the documents are gathered together and they're taken to the regional office.  I don't know what is done with all those papers, but as far as our cellule is concerned, the work has been finished and the ledger, the record, given to the regional office. 
Q.	Now, was there a final report, and if there was, did you get the opportunity to hear it? 
A.	Yes.  When the final report was read, I was present. 
Q.	At any time did you hear the name André Rwamakuba mentioned? 
A.	No, I did not hear his name mentioned in the report. 
Q.	Now, can I ask you about some other -- some other names?  Have you heard of a man called Karasira?  
A.	In respect of the events that occurred in our area or in the Gacaca session?  Sorry, could you be more precise?  Could that question be put a bit more precisely?  
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Forgetting about Gacaca for a moment, do you know someone called Karasira, who indeed may have had some allegations made against him in respect of events during the genocide?  
A.	Yes, I do know.  Yes, I do know Karasira Matabaro. 
Q.	Do you know what his status is at the moment?  Is he in prison, is he out of prison, or what's the position? 
A.	He was in prison, but for the time being, he is free; he's at home. 
Q.	Do you know another man called Matabaro, Callixte?  Again, the same part of the name, Matabaro.  Do you know a man with that name and do you know if allegations have been in any way sustained against that man? 
A.	Yes, I know Matabaro.  At one point he was in prison, but he was released.  That's all I know as far as he's concerned. 
Q.	I'm going to pass up a piece of paper now with two names written on it, with a number against each name, and I'm going to ask about one of them -- well, in due course, both of them, but -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Show the Judges and the Prosecution.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Just before we move to this, I've asked you about your own knowledge about André Rwamakuba and I've asked you whether you've heard anyone at Gacaca mention or make any allegations against him.  But aside from Gacaca and aside from your own observations at the time, in the 12 years since, sir, have you heard anyone make an allegation against André Rwamakuba, that he came to your area to incite and participate in acts of genocide?  Have you ever heard such an allegation made?  
A.	In those cellules, no one has made any allegation against André Rwamakuba.  
Q.	Now, on that list there, you've spoken about the person whose name is at No. 1 on the list.  And I want to ask you now about the person whose name appears at No. 2, and we'll refer to him as No. 2.  Now, do you know No. 2, and very briefly, what can you tell us about him?  
I know that No. 2 is in prison.  That's what I know.  And his wife died a couple of years ago.  That is what I know. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can you pass the paper up again?  I'll put the full name down.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Right.  So looking at No. 2, do you know that man and do you know if you had any association -- and if you had any association with No. 1, and, very briefly, what you know about him?  
A.	I know that that person lived with No. 1.  They were, in fact, married.  The first had died -- the first husband had died, so No. 2 lived with No. 1 until they separated because one of the people was in prison.  But No. 1 also was put in prison, but No. 2 was imprisoned because he had been falsely accused by No. 1.  That is what I know. 
Q.	Do you know of a man called Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, and again, very generally, did you see him yourself at all during the period of genocide and have you heard allegations that he was present made, either generally amongst the population since then or, more specifically, during Gacaca hearings that concerned the school?  
A.	I know Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda.  He did not come to our area during the genocide and I confirm that he is innocent and did not participate in the genocide.  According to Gacaca, from what I heard in the Gacaca sessions, Kamuhanda did not participate in the genocide.  
Q.	Well, we're not over-concerned about him, but just dealing with that.  Now, let's come to the events of what happened in Gikomero, and let me take you to this.  We know that on the 12th of April there was a murder, a massacre, of refugees, Tutsis, who had collected at the Protestant school there in Gikomero secteur.  And do you agree with that, that there was such a massacre on that date? 
A.	That is correct, the people were massacred there.
Q.	Before the 12th of April, are you aware of any other killings, in the secteur, of Tutsis? 
A.	No.  There were no other massacres in our secteur before the 12th of April. 
Q.	And on the 12th of April, where were you and what did you see that's relevant to that massacre?  
A.	I was at home in ***************** cellule, and what I saw on the 12th of April was as follows:  I saw some vehicles arrive full of people.  They stopped in front of the ************* trading centre.  There were some tough, young people dressed in rags, some with soldiers' helmets but wearing shorts, civilian shorts.  They had an assortment of various weapons:  Some carried clubs; others, spears; whereas others had guns or machetes.  So when those vehicles arrived, I was in front of my house, the house where I lived at the time.  

There were Tutsi refugees in my house.  They had come from Rubungo.  And when those young people, those young men, arrived with their weapons, the Tutsis said, "Those are Interahamwe " because they'd already seen them in Rubungo.  So I turned back into my house to tell my wife and the other people there to flee the Interahamwe, and we fled into the back.  And those young men got back in the vehicles to go on to the second trading centre.  

And when we were going to cross the second road towards the place where the people were massacred, we ran into the vehicles -- we saw the vehicles with the assailants and they were shooting at the people, shooting at the people.  We fled towards Kibobo, and there we managed to seek some rest. 
Q.	Just pause there.  Thank you very much.  That was a good spot to pause.  Thank you very much.  Of course, this is being translated into several languages and we just need to take it a little slowly.  

So you flee, together with Tutsis, and are we correct to understand that your escape route took you up to and past the Protestant school where the larger concentration of refugees were?  
A.	There were indeed refugees at the Protestant school.  But we did not go that far.  We passed underneath it, below it, in the direction of Kibobo.  
Q.	Do you know someone called -- or did you know someone called Gashikizi, Edouard? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And I don't think this will be sufficiently identifying of you, but was he related to you, and do you know what happened to him? 
A.	He was my uncle, and he died on the 12th of April.  
Q.	Now, I don't think that sufficiently identifies you because of the amount of nieces and nephews he had, as I understand, a large number.  But perhaps I can just ask you this:  After that attack of the 12th, are you aware of any other attack in Gikomero secteur on Tutsi refugees?  
A.	There were no other attacks on Tutsis after that date.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that you fled and you fled to a place of safety.  Now, can you tell us where you went and who, in particular, you met?  And again, if you are going to deal with a particular person, can you refer to it by a number, the number on the piece of paper?  

So just -- can you carry on with your story?  You're fled, you're running away, you passed beneath the school, and what happened after that?  
A.	We went to the place named Kibobo, which is a valley.  There was also a ravine there.  Shall I give you the names of the people we met there?  
Q.	Well, as you're talking in the plural, can I pass you up a piece of paper and ask you to -- here's the piece of paper coming up, and if you could write the names.  If any of those people are people whose names appear on the list, you already have that as a number.  Can you keep the same number?  So if you're going to mention the person who's at No. 1, by all means write the name, but write "No. 1" against it so we keep the same number.  Thank you.  
A.	All right, I'll do that.  
Q.	So these are the names, I understand it, of the people you met on the 12th as you made your way to, or into, Kibobo.  So can we see that list, please?  Thank you. 

Now, while that's going around, can you just tell us -- carry on with your account of what happened.  So, you go down, and what happened, referring to the numbers that you now have on that list?  What happened?  Who did you meet and what was said?  
A.	When we got to Kibobo, I met No. 1.  He was with his sister-in-law. 
Q.	I'm sorry, is that a he or a she? 
A.	No. 1 is a lady.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Sorry, can you go on, please?  
A.	We stayed there, roughly, two hours. 
Q.	Now, you're fleeing from Gikomero, having witnessed the arrival of the Interahamwe, and you arrive at Kibobo and there is No. 1.  Now, are you in a position to let us know whether No. 1 had herself fled, as it were, with you, or was she already in Kibobo?  
A.	No, I believe she got there in the morning, or that she's been there for a few days.  But at any rate, when I reached there, I realised that she had spent some time there.  She didn't look like somebody who had just arrived there or who has just fled there.
Q.	Did you have any conversation with her?  
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	And what was that? 
A.	She asked me why -- she asked me why we were fleeing, and I said we were fleeing because the people were shooting at us. 
Q.	Now, you've mentioned that she was with her sister-in-law, and we know who that is.  You needn't -- you indicated a house earlier on, the second house.  Would I be right in saying that that person lived in that second house and was, in fact, married -- well, I'll say no more than that.  Is that right?  
A.	Yes, that person lived in house No. 2, and was married. 
Q.	And you mentioned her husband, and I don't again mention that name.  But the husbands of those two women, where were they on the 12th?  Were they in Kibobo or what? 
A.	Are you referring to the person at No. 2?  The person on No. 2 had one wife only, and his wife had fled with No. 1. 
Q.	The women, No. 1, and the woman from house No. 2, they're down in Kibobo, and they're related, as you've explained.  And now I'm asking about their husbands.  So No. 1's husband -- 
A.	Their husbands are brothers. 
Q.	And do you know where they were?  When you arrived in Kibobo, where were they; do you know?  
A.	The husbands had stayed behind.  These were important people, people with a certain degree of authority, people who had some power. 
Q.	Do you know if either one of them participated or is alleged to have participated in any of the wrongdoing that day?  
A.	I might say that, to date, he's in prison because he took part in those events.  If he's in prison, it is because he participated in those massacres. 
Q.	Did you hear either one of those men this day? 
A.	The man in prison came and called the person at No. 1 and the person at No. 2.  He was on a hill and he called these two people and he told them to come up.  So these two people went up and returned to their homes.  
Q.	Now, can you just tell us this:  On the hill, what kind of distance can people call, and do call, on the hill?  
A.	There is a valley, but as the crow flies, it's about 700 metres.  This person was on top of a hill and was able to call across to them over a distance of 700 metres, or thereabouts. 
Q.	Now, we don't live on your hill and don't have a lot of experience, but how common is it for people to shout like that from one place to another between the hills and the valleys, in your experience?  
A.	Yes, that's done.  There's no problem with that in Rwanda.  People can call out to other people.  A person on a hill can call out to a person in a valley.  That is something that is done. 
Q.	I've only got one, or perhaps two, questions to ask you further, and the first one is this:  After the war, are you aware if No. 1, the woman No. 1, was ever responsible for any killing?  
A.	Yes, she was highly responsible for the massacres. 
Q.	And these were massacres of what group? 
A.	She was involved in the massacre of Hutus, but she also killed a Tutsi. 
Q.	Now, I'm not going to ask you to provide names and details, but if anyone did want to ask you about names and details and circumstances, are you in a position from what you know to provide that information?  
A.	Yes, I can explain. 
Q.	Very well.  Thank you.  Those are all my questions, Mr. Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, do you know as yet which date this witness will be cross-examined?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, with reference to what was said the last time, I believe we shall cross-examine 7/14 on the 3rd.  If we conclude the cross-examination which we hope will not last long, we can start cross examination of this witness.  And on the 6th and on the 7th, we should be able to take the other two witnesses.  I think we should be able to stay within the dates that were indicated.  We understand, of course, that there are two other new witnesses that were mentioned by the Defence.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I don't know, Mr. President, if this assists.  I've sent an e-mail this morning, which I'm afraid counted for some of the delay in starting, but I thought it would be helpful to all the parties to have it and, basically, we know that tomorrow, as far as we know, we have a double video link which will deal with 5/7 and 5/16, and they will be followed by the three cross-examined -- the witnesses to be cross-examined in the order in which they were called, which is 7/14, 9/29, and this witness, 9/31.  It may be possible, in other words, on Friday to deal with 7/14 and 9/29.  I don't know how long the cross-examination will be.  And if that's the case, then on Monday we'll have the remaining witness or witnesses, or part of any cross-examination that may have begun on Friday, and as I understand it, it's only 7/14, 9/29 and 9/31 who falls to be cross-examined.  I must say I'd -- I was a bit anxious in case I had omitted someone.  

There's also one witness who is to be recalled, if in fact certain prison documents can be recovered, but that's not going to take very long.  And on the e-mail, I'd also indicated the position as of yesterday afternoon, to my knowledge, what the status was of each of those witnesses.  And I've removed from the list 9/32, 9/21 and 3/15.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue on another date as you have to respond to questions put by the Prosecutor.  Those questions cannot be put today and it is likely that they will be put to you either on Friday or on Monday, but you'll be notified by the registry when you have to return to complete your evidence.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you're going to be excused now.  During this interruption in your testimony or any other interruption of your testimony, you remain a witness of the Tribunal and you are not to discuss the case or your evidence with anybody at all.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That includes Defence counsel and the representatives of the Defence counsel.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
All right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are excused now and you may go.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
(Witness exited courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are advised by the Registrar that the -- in order to start the video link tomorrow morning, we will commence at 9:15.  So the session tomorrow morning will commence at 9:15.  

We take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1033H)
