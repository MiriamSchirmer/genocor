P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. KOUO:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, 3rd July 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The appearances are the same.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have returned to Arusha, and I would like to greet the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Welcome back, Mr. Weyl.  

Ms. Hounkpatin, last week you had indicated that your client wished to say something to the Court.  We are ready to hear him.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

So, I will ask Mr. Ngirumpatse to make his statement.  And in order to facilitate things, I would like the registrar to provide a copy to the interpreter's booth, French. 
THE ACCUSED NGIRUMPATSE:
Mr. President, I thank you for giving me the floor today.  

Before I make you aware of the subject of my speech this morning, I would like to underscore that what I will say only concerns Mr. Joseph Nzirorera and myself.  Édouard Karemera, who is present today, may perhaps have something to say, because he was not in a position to participate in our talks.  

Mr. President, in the course of our trial, which was annulled by the Appeals Chamber, we promised then -- the then Bench to participate and assist in our trial, right until its conclusion.  Today we are still in that frame of mind.  We also know that no one has the monopoly of the truth, and that without the truth, there is no justice.  That is why we feel that all the allegations levelled at us by the Prosecutor must be subject to a contradictory or adversarial debate by the Chamber, even though the public may support such charges.  Therefore, there must be debate.  

Mr. President, our absence from the courtroom in the last few days was a result of a decision taken on the 16th of June 2006, which we do not want to comment on today.  However, we would like to express the shock we experienced, or felt.  It is natural, when a person is in the dark, he needs some time to adapt.  Not just to react without upsetting himself, but also in order to find the way out of that darkness.  This period of adaptation is all the more necessary given the comments that we were made aware of over the last few years, when, at the peak of our despair, we noticed -- we said to ourselves, "We will remain in darkness forever, and there is no hope."  

This is all the more serious for us because we are convinced that the trial is not a matter of opinion, but a process of bringing material evidence.  Therefore, we call on your wisdom and vigilance of the Court to make a decision -- or, rather, to make a ruling on the decision of our opponents.  

The lack of a translation in French of the decision has also created uncertainty.  We were informed of efforts deployed to conclude the translation, and we take note of this.  However, we would like to remind the Court that French is one of the working languages of the Tribunal, and that this decision, given its importance and its impact, should have been provided to us simultaneously in the two languages.  This would have saved a considerable amount of time and resources.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, at this stage I would like to take the liberty of reminding you that in 1633, Galileus was sentenced to life imprisonment for having affirmed that the earth turns.  It was only in 1992 -- I repeat, 1992 -- that the Catholic church, which had played a major role in his conviction, recognised its mistake.  Galileus only had his life to save.  In our case -- or, rather, his mind.  In our case it's not just our minds, but just -- or lives, but the lives of the whole people who have been condemned to infamy forever.  

Mr. President, before I close I would like to reaffirm our willingness to end this trial.  I would like to reaffirm that we have no major bone of contention with the court that you preside.  Assurances of a fair trial that we have -- that you have given to us since the very first days should continue to guide the Court's action.  Therefore, we sought to take the floor to explain that we needed time to reflect in order to assess whether the current circumstances still allow us to hope that this trial will be conducted in a legal and fair conditions (sic).  In this vein, we may still be struck by lightning, and we would call on you to be understanding if such a situation were to repeat itself.  

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

I think we can continue with the cross-examination, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry, Ms. Diagne, I recognise you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Well, Mr. President, I'm sorry for interrupting you.  I believe you have noticed this morning the presence of Mr. Édouard Karemera, and I have the honour of defending him in your august Chamber.  We exchanged some words, Mr. President, Your Honours, about his absence in this Court -- from the Court, rather, and I had taken -- or, rather, engaged to explain to him a little bit about our exchanges, and above all to convince him that even though he had a point, there was still a need for him to return so as to personally follow his own trial, which is a position he has always maintained.  

Upon my arrival here in Arusha, he told me of his anguish following the decision of the Appeals Chamber of 16 June 2006.  And he told me that he would have preferred to have that copy available -- a copy of the decision available to him so as to be able to assess it.  But given the absence of the French translation of the document, he had preferred to withdraw temporarily from the trial, without -- nevertheless, without seeking to obstruct the trial.  And he had given me and my co-counsel, Félix Sow, the power to continue to represent him in your Court, which power he immediately renewed upon my arrival in Arusha, because there was no way he would be held responsible or a party to the waste -- to wasting the Court's time.  

Therefore, together with Ms. Denis, having consulted with you, Your Honour, Mr. President, I understood there were difficulties that everybody faced at all stages.  And I also understood that efforts had been made to obtain the decision as quickly as possible.  And I, myself, assured him that I had confidence in the Chamber and in promises that I -- had been made to me, and therefore that he should not worry at all; that I was certain that the process of translating the decision was under way, and even accelerated.  So that all concerned parties, including myself, should be able to take cognisance of the French translation of the 16 June decision.  And I also told him a few days ago that I had the impression that all efforts were being deployed, not just with a view to obtaining the decision, but all other decisions that certainly concern him.  So that all efforts be deployed, so that all the parties to this trial should be in a position to defend themselves consistently and rightfully.  

Therefore, Mr. President, I would like to thank him before you, Mr. President, because following our discussion, he promised to come before you whilst he awaits the decision.  And therefore I will be his spokesperson in asking you to understand why he took such a stance, why the scarcity of versions in a language he understands for decisions that are important to him makes him nervous.  Therefore, he seeks your understanding and wants to tell you that he never sought to obstruct justice and the conduct of this trial.  

Therefore, once again, I reiterate that he is asking for your understanding, and is also asking for much more support from you for -- in terms of consideration of an issue that sometimes is taken a little too lightly.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  

As you have commented, the translation issues have -- are being taken seriously, and we expect that the matter will be settled very soon.  

Madam Registrar, could you bring in the witness, please.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, while we are bringing in the witness, I would like to take this opportunity to offer some exhibits which are excerpts of transcripts which were used during the cross-examination of this witness.  

The first would be marked as D. NZ163.  I have provided both the French and the English versions to the registrar and the Prosecutor.  And 163A would be the French, 163B the English.  It would be the transcript of the **************2003 in the Bagosora case, page 42 for the French, and 43 -- excuse me, 44 for the English.  

Exhibit D. NZ164A is the French transcript of the Bagosora case on the**************, page 12; and 164B, the transcript of pages 13 and 14, in English, of the *************2003.  

And, finally, Exhibit D. NZ165A, the French transcript of the **************from the Bagosora case at page 29, and 165B, being the English transcript of that same day of page 31.  

So I would ask that exhibits D. NZ163, 164, and 165 be admitted.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, good morning.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began giving evidence in this trial.  Your cross-examination will continue by Mr. Robinson.
THE WITNESS:
I am ready, Mr. President.
WITNESS XBM
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, (Kinyarwanda spoken)?  
A.	I am very well this morning. 
Q.	Do you need something from the registrar? 
A.	Yes, I need a sheet of paper.  And I hope that it will be given to me.  
Q.	Witness XBM, we were discussing, when we were last together, the events that took place after the meeting, or the ceremony on Mount Muhe, in approximately September 1993, when the participants from the meeting had gone to the cattle market at the Kabari trading centre.  And you had explained the address made by Barayagwiza to the people at that trading centre concerning paying for cows.  And I was about to ask you what had occurred next at that trading centre, particularly with respect to the distribution of weapons.  So, can you tell us what occurred at the Kabari trading centre concerning distribution of weapons? 
A.	After that the arms were distributed, the weapons were distributed.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us the persons who were distributing the weapons?  
A.	Barayagwiza and Anatole Nsengiyumva.  
Q.	And what was the vehicle that brought the weapons from which they were distributed? 
A.	The weapons had been brought in a jeep in which Colonel Anatole was also travelling.  
Q.	And can you give us the names of the persons who unloaded those weapons from the jeep?  
A.	Yes, those weapons were unloaded from the jeep.  In fact, there weren't many weapons, and I can remember the names of some of the people who unloaded those weapons.  
Q.	Can you give us those names, one by one?  
A.	I'm going to give you four names.  There was Ntigambe, Bukware, Bunoti, and Neretse. 
Q.	Can you spell Ntigambe for us, please?  
A.	You could even ask your clients, they're Rwandan, they know very well.  But, however, I shall give you the spelling.  N-T-I-G-A-M-B-E.  Ntigambe. 
Q.	Is his name Emmanuel? 
A.	I think you should make do with the name that I've just given you.  Ntigambe.  I don't think that the name Emmanuel has any importance.  
Q.	Well, I'm wondering if it's the same person as a man named Emmanuel Ntigambe who was living in Kabari trading centre in 1993.  
A.	I think we've already addressed the most important issue.  His Christian name is not important.  The name that was given to him by his parents is Ntigambe, and I think we should pursue and come on to the other names now.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, I want to put it to you that my investigator has contacted a man named Emmanuel Ntigambe who said that he was living in the Kabari trading centre in 1993, and that he has never assisted in the unloading of weapons, nor did he have any knowledge of any distribution of weapons in the Kabari trading centre by Barayagwiza or Anatole.  Would you like to comment on that?  
A.	I think there is nothing surprising if your investigator gave you that information.  The person he talked to might have given him different information from that that you have, and your investigator might have told you that that never took place. 
Q.	Now, with respect to Bukware, which is number 21 on the spelling list, is that person now deceased?  
A.	As I told you, in Rwanda we are not interested in Christian names.  Only close friends do that, ie, people who frequent each other on a daily basis.  If you know the surname of a person, that suffices.  I can see that you are wasting your time when seeking to ask me questions about the Christian names of those people.  
Q.	The person Bukware, is he now deceased? 
A.	I think you should ask God that question.  God would know where that person is.  It is no concern of mine where that individual is for the time being.  
Q.	Do you know whether or not Bukware is deceased or alive?  
A.	I think I've answered your question, Counsel.  This is not part of my remit.  I am not supposed to know who is still living or who has deceased.  Unless you were to tell me that his name never existed, or he never existed in himself, I don't know.  This is not part of my remit.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, it is part of your remit to answer questions to the best of your knowledge.  So, to the best of your knowledge, is Bukware alive or deceased?  
A.	I don't know whether you're laying a trap or not.  You seem to be insisting.  As I said, I am not hold -- or held to giving information that I do not have at my disposal.  These event occurred in 1993.  We are now in the year 2006.  So, I would not be in a position to tell you whether that person is alive or not.  And what is more, I do not see the importance of your question.  I don't know whether this is in fact a trap, this question.  I see that your question is of no importance, so I don't think you should dwell on it.  
Q.	The person Bunoti is number 22 on the spelling list.  To your knowledge is he alive or deceased?  
A.	Amongst the names that I gave you, Ntigambe, Bukware, Bunoti and Neretse, I think you must have sent somebody to conduct investigations about those people, because of course it is of more interest to you than it is to me.  I told you what I lived through in 1993.  Whether those people are alive or not today -- well, as I said, you could ask that question to God.  Whether those people are still alive or not, I have no idea.  It is very difficult for me, therefore, to answer such a question.  
Q.	Now, the first -- the fourth person that you mentioned, can you spell his last name for us?  
A.	Neretse is N-E-R-E-T-S-E.  Neretse.  
Q.	And this person, do you know his Christian name? 
A.	As I already said, I am not in a position to respond to such a question, because I do not know Neretse's Christian name.  All I know is that he is Barayagwiza's nephew.  
Q.	Do you know whether or not, at the time, in 1993 -- do you know where he was living?  
A.	Who are you referring to, Counsel?  
Q.	Neretse.  
A.	I did not know which area he resided in.  All I know was that he was Barayagwiza's nephew.  Our paths used to cross, and I knew that he was in charge of guarding Barayagwiza's residence.  
Q.	Witness XBM, I want to put it to you that my investigator has also contact (sic) this gentleman, who we know to -- know as Jean Neretse, and he has told my investigator that in 1992 he was imprisoned at Gisenyi prison, and he was not released until the 30th of June 1994.  And therefore he could not have participated in any unloading of weapons at Kabari trading centre in 1993.  Do you have any comment on that?  
MR. LAHAIE: 
With your leave, Mr. President, we would like to be able to make a reference to a document or -- in order to refer to the document that he's talking about.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, there is no document.  As you know, this information came to light very late in the process because the Trial Chamber allowed the Prosecution to go far beyond the pre-trial brief and elicit evidence of matters that we had no notice would be part of this trial.  And so I asked my investigator, at very short notice, to contact some of these people, or try to, and he's provided me with this information on a very short notice.  And I don't have any documents to give to the Prosecutor.  

However, at such time as we file our pre-Defence brief, they will have access to the statements taken from these witnesses, who will likely be testifying before the Trial Chamber.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness XBM, I'm asking you to give us any comment you would like to make on the fact that our investigation and our contact with Jean Neretse has indicated that he was in prison during the time you say he was unloading weapons at the Kabari trading centre.  
A.	Earlier on I said that Neretse was Barayagwiza's nephew, and that he was in charge of guarding his residence.  As you are well aware, Barayagwiza was a high-ranking member of the CDR political party, and that person was a member of his close family.  So, I cannot give you information as to what his uncle did.  There is nothing surprising about this.  Which means that your argument does not hold any water. 

What I do not comprehend, however, is the fact that you, as a lawyer, have elected to use such a procedure in order to lead your investigation, and defend your client in such a manner.  You have decided to talk to people who cannot give you correct information.  I know that those people can easily change their mind when promises are made to them.  I have nothing against those people; they have never been neighbours of mine, so it would not be in my interest to give their names and to accuse them of acts that they did not commit.  I am not the only one to say this.  Other people would be in a position to provide you with this information.  There was a great distance separating the area where I lived and the area where those people lived.  I can give you their names, and you can contact other people who could give you this information.  But, I see that you are trying to lead the Chamber astray, and you want to actually recount what happened in an untrue manner. 
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, during your direct examination, and in your interview with the OTP, the Office of the Prosecutor, you gave four names.  So, we tried to contact the four people to see, as a test, if you're telling the truth.  The two people who were contacted said you're not telling the truth.  The other two people, as far as we know, are dead.  So, can you give me the names of any other people that were involved in unloading the weapons, and we will go and try to find them and we will see what they say.  
A.	I told you that I cannot give you any further information because I see that you are a specialist on the subject, and you are also very good at refuting the information that I give you.  So, you are telling me that you questioned those people.  And I know that I gave the names of the people who unloaded the weapons; I gave those names to the Tribunal.  So all you need to do is to follow up that lead and find out whether those people received weapons or not.  I would ask you to please no longer dwell on this issue.  
Q.	Was one of the people who unloaded the weapons named Ruhura, the younger brother to Barayagwiza?  And that's spelled R-U-H-U-R-A.  
A.	Yes, that young man is one of the people who unloaded the weapons.  
Q.	And are you aware that he was killed in Mudende in 1996? 
A.	Who are you referring to, precisely, Counsel?  
Q.	Ruhura.  
A.	I am not aware of that fact, and I don't know where you got that information from.  Might he have died after you questioned him, or after you met with him? 
Q.	Actually, I got that information from Mr. Barayagwiza's brother, by the name of Faustin Gakombe, G-A-K-O-M-B-E.  And he told us that he was living in the house of Barayagwiza in Kabari in 1993, and that he was the brother to Ruhura.  And he told us that Ruhura never had a weapon, and never participated in unloading weapons, to his knowledge.  And he also told us that Ruhura had died in Mudende in 1996.  Would you like to comment on that?  
A.	I think that I have not come here before this Trial Chamber to explain what happened, or the circumstances in which those people died in 1996.  What is more, when you are a liar, you like to meet other liars and collaborate with them.  Ruhura says that he never received weapons.  I think that it is indeed disgraceful that he had -- he had somebody killed, a woman Tutsi by the name of Kanoli (phonetic) from Gatsinzi.  She was a Tutsi lady from Gatsinzi.  You can ask the Kanoli family that question, and they will be able to give you the circumstances of their daughter's death.  If they give you the name of the person who killed their daughter, then you will have access to the truth.  If you go to Rwanda in order to question people, some people will be able to tell you the truth, whereas others will tell you untruths.  If you go to Rwanda to say, "Well, give me information with a view to saving my clients", well, some people will just tell you lies.  
Q.	Witness XBM, I'm going to move away from the people who unloaded the weapons, and now ask you to turn your attention to those who received weapons on that day at the Kabari trading centre.  And I would like the registrar to give you a blank piece of paper and have you write down for us the names of those who received weapons on that day.  
A.	I have no problem with writing down the names of those people, but I think it is a waste of time, because last time you asked me to give you those names, and I provided the names of the people that I was with during the ceremony of the RTLM foundation when we were in the Kabari trading centre as well, I think I gave you about 20 names in all.  I think I told you the number of people involved in unloading those weapons, even if the arms were more numerous than the number of people actually unloading them.  But, if you insist, then I can once again write down those names on a piece of paper.  However, I think that I have already given these names to this Trial Chamber.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, the list that you wrote down last week was the list of those persons present at Bigirimana's bar, near Bigogwe military camp, in June 1993 after the CDR rally in Ruhengeri stadium.  And I'm now asking you to write down the names of those people who received weapons at the Kabari trading centre in September 1993, after the ceremony at Mount Muhe.  Now, it may be that some of those names are the same, but nevertheless I think it's important for you to give us an accurate list of the persons who you claim received weapons.  And we can check, and if you're telling the truth, then that will be for your benefit.  If you're not telling the truth, then the Trial Chamber will have that information.  So, I would ask you to cooperate with us and to write down the names on the piece of paper in front of you.  
A.	The problem is that some people left weapons in the Congo, whereas other people gave those weapons over to the state.  So, I do not know whether you still want to come back to this issue.  The population no longer wants you to dwell on the fact that they had access to weapons; you are going to put some people in danger.  However, you have so much -- so many issues that you might have forgotten the details, or maybe you don't quite understand what I'm saying to you.  As I said to you, when we were in Bigirimana bar, I have already provided explanations, and I have nothing further to add on this subject today.  I told you that the people whom I mentioned to you, who were at the Bigirimana bar, were the same people that we had said were going to receive weapons.  If you have a list which is different from that list, well, in that case ask me questions.  However, the names of the people that I gave at an earlier stage are those people that we selected at Bigirimana bar, and those were the same people who were going to receive weapons.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction from the Kinyarwandan booth; "Those were the same people who received weapons." 
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the witness could be provided with D. NZ161, which is the list that he previously drew up. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness XBM, you now have in front of you the list of people at Bigirimana's bar that you drew up for us.  And I would like you to tell us if they all of those people were present at Kabari trading centre and received weapons. 
A.	I told you that with reference to the number of people whose names I wrote down on this piece of paper, the group -- or the number of people who received the weapons is far higher because there were lots of arms to receive.  I am going to write down the names of the people whom I can remember. 
Q.	Well, looking at Exhibit 161, did all of those people -- were all of those people present at Kabari trading centre and receive weapons? 
A.	I told you that we selected those people so that they could receive the weapons.  During the distribution some people were present at the centre, whereas others were not.  But weapons were taken to the place where those people were located. 
Q.	Well, right now I am interested in compiling a list of those people who were present at the               Kabari trading centre and received their weapon at that place.  So, why don't you start by looking at the list D. NZ161 and telling us the names of all of those people on the list who were also present at   Kabari trading centre and received a weapon there? 
A.	At any rate, I was not responsible for delivering them to them.  I am giving you names of the persons I managed to see.  Unless those people deny the allegations and say they were not present at the  Kabari centre, in that case I am prepared to accuse them of having received the weapons. 
Q.	Well, the first step is to find out clearly, from you, who were the persons who you say received the weapons at Kabari trading centre.  So, in order to complete that first step, I would like you to read the names from the list, and choosing only those who were present and received a weapon at            Kabari trading centre.  So, could you do that first for us, please? 
A.	I would like to explain to you, and I would like you to understand when we were at Bigirimana's house and Bigirimana's bar, I gave you the names of those people.  And those who received the weapons in September, those names I had also given you.  There were about 50 people involved.  So, go to Rwanda, carry out your investigations.  If it turns out that what I am saying here is true, then I would advise you to resign.  

I want us to make a wager, you and me, because I am certain that I am telling the truth, so let's make a bet.  If it turns out that what I am saying is the truth, in that case, I would advise you to resign from your position. 
Q.	Well, Witness, I can't do my job unless I first receive clear information from you, and that is what we are going to do here this morning.  So, tell us clearly, from looking at the list of Exhibit 161, which of those persons received weapons at Kabari trading centre in September 1993? 
A.	Let me tell you something, you are like Thomas in the bible; you deny everything, you accept nothing.  I am telling you things from the point of view of an eyewitness, but you are denying everything I say.  You are a foreigner.  I do not understand why you do not accept my version of the truth. 
Q.	Witness XBM, at this time, I am just asking you questions,and it will be for the Trial Chamber to decide if you are telling the truth or not.  But you are not helping your situation by not answering the question.  So, I think if you'd simply answer my question, you will do everyone a better service.  So, can you please tell us which of those people on Exhibit D. NZ161 received weapons at Kabari trading centre? 
A.	In terms of making your task easier, I am doing all in my power to ensure that you can do your work.  I left Rwanda for that purpose.  I left Rwanda to come and assist the Court.  I am not with my family.  I had to leave my family in order to tell the truth.

Now, regarding people in Rwanda who are in the habit of inventing things, of making things up, I am not one of those people; nor am I so intelligent like those who fabricate things.  You are saying that you want to know the truth.  Unless you remove your robes -- you see, lawyers always disagree with witnesses, are always against what witnesses say.  Now, as for the facts, I am narrating the facts,         I -- whose truth or veracity I am aware of. 
Q.	And in that spirit then, can you tell us which of the people on Exhibit D. NZ161 received weapons at the Kabari trading centre in September 1993? 
A.	Listen, I told you that all of those people received weapons.  Which of those people are you claiming did not receive weapons?  If you think one -- several of these people received weapons thereafter, say so.  I don't understand how we can make progress if you continue like this. 
Q.	Is it your testimony that every person who is listed on that paper Exhibit D. NZ161 was also present at the Kabari trading centre in September 1993 and received a weapon there? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the witness has said that several times. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, with all due respect, I think the witness has in fact said that some of those people on the list received their weapons later, which is the reason I am asking that question, so that we can have some clarity.  So maybe the witness can tell us, and clear this up once and for all.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did all of the people who are on Exhibit 161 receive weapons at Kabari trading centre in         September 1993 on the day of the ceremony at Mount Muhe? 
A.	I explained to you, that all of those people received weapons.  As for those who received weapons in their respective homes, I did not draw up a list so as to know who had received a weapon from his house.  And I told you, moreover, that the list had been pre-established.  All of those people had weapons, and all of those people received them in September.  

In Kabari itself, all members of the population could see this when Barayagwiza arrived at the market square and told the people to purchase Tutsi-owned cattle at a poor price -- low price.  So do not keep asking me the same questions.  Don't ask me for detailed information. 
Q.	Were there any other people, besides those that are on that list, who you can recall seeing at the  Kabari trading centre receiving weapons?
A.	That number is enough for you to pursue your investigations.  I told you that those who received the weapons were more than 50.  I am not here in court to help you conduct your investigations. 
Q.	Witness XBM, I'm going to go in Rwanda and contact the people that you say who were in the      Kabari trading centre and who received weapons.  And I want to give you the opportunity to give me the names of any people that you think could help support your testimony.  

Now, you have written down some names.  And I want to ask you, as a final question on this subject, is there any other names you would like to give us who can support your story that weapons were distributed at Kabari trading centre? 
A.	I think I made a suggestion to you which could have helped in saving time, because we have dwelled at length on just one question, and we could have moved onto other questions a long time ago.

There is no problem.  You can go to Rwanda to carry out your investigations.  They will welcome you, the witnesses will gladly welcome you.  But I would like to tell the Court that it would be better not to waste precious time by repeating the same questions.  But I would like to ask you, if you go the Rwanda you should invite me to go with you, so in this way I will be certain, know what you are asking people.  

Moreover, if I had time, I could give 50 or so names.  If, following your investigations, it is found that I am telling the truth, then I would ask you to resign from your career as a lawyer.  If you find that I am lying, then I am prepared to go to jail for that.  

The United Nations set up this Tribunal for any old task -- to do its work, rather, so you should not be wasting Court's time.  I think you are wasting time for nothing.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, I think I have given you the opportunity that I am required, in fairness, to give you.  And I am going to move on to the next event, which is a meeting that you claim to have attended at Umuganda stadium in Gisenyi, and a meeting at which you claim you saw Mr. Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera and Karemera.  Now, can you tell us to the best of your recollection when that meeting took place? 
A.	That rally took place either in October or November.  I did not take note of the date.  I did not know I would be asked about this; it was between October and November. 
Q.	When you were interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor about this meeting in 2003, you told them, specifically, that the meeting took place on the 27th of October 1993; did you not? 
A.	I would also like to ask you not to dwell on this question.  But I believe that I said that I think the rally took place either in October or November.  It was merely an estimate on my part.  If they did not note that I had said October or November, I should not be blamed for it.  But I am here to tell you that as far as I can remember I think it was between October and November.  I am here now, so you should take what I am saying today.  I was not Ngirumpatse chairing that meeting at national level. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm going to have the witness shown a document, and, perhaps, this will be a good time to take our mid-morning recess if you would like?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We'll take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1103H) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  At this time I would ask -- Mr. President, at this time I would ask the registrar to retrieve from me a statement in French that this witness gave on the 26th and 27th of February 2003, and provide it to the witness.  And I'm going to direct his attention to the last paragraph on page 7, which also is on page 8 in the English version, the first paragraph. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness XBM, directing your attention to page 7 of your statement of the 26th and                    27th of February 2003.  You say that, "The third rally I attended was organised by the MRND party on         27th October 1993 in the Umuganda stadium, Gisenyi."  So it is true, is it not, that when you were interviewed by the Prosecutor you provided a specific date for that meeting? 
A.	I think I explained that question to you.  I only provided you with an approximation.  I did not give you the exact date.  So, I do not know whether you are asking me the same question in order to throw me off.  I have already told you that the political gathering had taken place either in October or November.  And that is, indeed, what I told the Prosecutor.  And I do not know whether he decided to mention the precise date.  But I have always told you that I only provided you with an approximation. 
Q.	But I'm interested in what you told the Prosecutor on the 26th and 27th of February 2003, because what they have written down here is that the rally took place on the 27th of October 1993.  And you signed your name to the bottom of that page indicating that that information was correct.  So, did you tell the Prosecutor the meeting was on the 27th of October, or did you tell the Prosecutor something else? 
A.	I don't know what you are getting at.  I think that you just do not want to understand what I am telling you, whereas the others do.  I told you that it was not I who organised the MRND meetings.  Understand me, and have a look at the date at which I gave the statement and the date at which the gathering took place; ten years had elapsed, which means I was not able to remember the precise date.  I only provided an approximation.  

You tell me that I appended my signature to that document; I did, indeed.  But unless you were to tell me that that political gathering did not take place, I do not think that it is the date that is of interest, I think it is, in fact, what happened.  And if you refer to what was said during that meeting, I do not think that that is of interest to us.  I took part in that gathering, but nothing bad was said on that occasion. 
Q.	Witness, we are going to go step by step concerning this gathering, but the first step is to try to determine when it took place.  Now, the Prosecutor is reporting that when they were interviewing you in February of 2003, you told them that it took place on a specific date, the 27th of October 1993.  And they even used that date in their indictment in paragraph 25.2.  The indictment is very specific that, "On or about the 27th of October 1993, this meeting took place."  Now, do I understand you correctly that you did not tell the Prosecutor that the meeting took place on that date, but you simply told them that it took place sometime in October or November 1993? 
A.	I would like us to understand each other.  I think that when the Prosecutor questioned me you were present, as were most of the people in this Chamber.  In response to his question I said that the meeting had taken place between the months of October and November.  I remember that very well, I said between October and November.  

I do not know, therefore, whether it is an impression that you are under, i.e., that I gave that date.  I gave an approximation, October to November.  I think that I mentioned the month of October with a view of saying that it was approximately, around the month of October.  I took part in that meeting personally.  I know what was said during that meeting, but I did not give a precise date as to its occurrence; I gave an approximation.  When I was questioned by the Prosecutor, I said that the meeting had taken place either in October or in November.  That is what I said, Counsel Robinson. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer the interview report of the 26th and 27th of February, the French being D. 166A and the English being D. 166B -- D. NZ, sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ166A and D. NZ166B admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness XBM, I am going to read to you what you testified to about this at the Bagosora trial on the **************2003.  And I'm starting on page 80 of this transcript.  And the question that you were being asked by the Defence counsel at that time, beginning on line 15:  

He said: "We will talk about the meetings.  You said that Colonel Bagosora was present at the meeting on the 27th of October 1993; is that right?  And you said; "Yes, that is correct."  

And the lawyer said: "Now, there is a question I want to put to you, in all of your testimony this morning, or even in previous statements, you gave just two dates, 27th October 1993, and we will be coming back to it, and 25th of May 1994, and then on the rest you seem on shift a lot.  Can you tell us what you specifically remember, just those two dates?"  And your answer was, "I think you should commend me, congratulate me for remembering those dates.  It is important for me to remember those dates."

And the lawyer asks, "But my question is, how come you remember specifically those two dates, that is what I want to find out?"  And you answered: "But those are the dates I remember.  Do you want to compel me to remember dates that I can't remember?" 

And then the president intervenes.  And he asked, "Are you able to explain to us why you remember exactly those two dates?  What is it that assists your memory there?"  And then your answer was, "I remember the first date, while I was in Ruhengeri there was an accident there and one of my neighbours was involved.  I went with him to the meeting.  We had gone to the stadium and the vehicle took a bend in the stadium, and the young man fell off; the vehicle ran over him.  We took him to the hospital.  So I can't forget that date because it is on that date that that accident occurred."  And you continued: "Now the next meeting at Umuganda stadium meeting, again, there was an accident.  And a young man's legs were amputated because of that accident.  So I cannot but remember them, talk about them."  

And later on, in line 22, the Defence attorney says: "So, I understand you properly, you remember the 27th of October 1993 because there was an accident, correct?"  And you answered: "I told you so.  There was a very important rally which was attended by many authorities."

So, Witness XBM, you insisted when you testified in ********of 2003 that you remembered that this meeting at Umuganda stadium occurred on the 27th of November 1993; did you not?  
A.	Well, with reference to that event, as far as Defence counsel in the Bagosora trial is concerned, well that person asked me questions on the subject of his client.  And his client did not refute the answer that I gave.  What is more, I think that Defence counsel did not give you the remit of interpreting for them things that they cannot understand, and questions that they forgot to put to their client.  So, I do not think that we should dwell on this issue and use information that was produced in another           Trial Chamber as to the date on which -- at which this meeting took place.  

Yes, that is true that on that day, a young gentleman was wounded.  He got out of a vehicle, he was wounded.  He was then transferred to a hospital in Gisenyi.  I think that that incident occurred on the day of the meeting.  That question was not put to me on that specific day for me to go and check whether it was, in fact, that exact date.  That person is still alive, even if they are an invalid, they are still alive.  So, in brief, with reference to the political gathering that took place in Gisenyi, I only provided you with an approximation.  

There were different political meetings that took place.  If I gave you the date of October or November, and had I told you that it was the 27th of October, as you see, that was towards the end of the month.  So, I think that you should not push me to lose grip in details.  I just provided you with an approximation.  Unless, of course, you tell me that that political meeting never occurred.  And if you manage to prove that it did not, very well.  I only provided you with an approximate date.  And when the Prosecutor put question to me on that subject, as you say, he asked me why, specifically, I remembered those dates.  

You are asking me questions about the person who was wounded on the same day as the political meeting.  That person is still alive, and you can contact them.  I know that that person did not take part in the political meeting because they were wounded, and they were transferred to the hospital.  They might be in a position to provide you with the documents that were issued at the hospital, and then you will be sure of what happened.  So, do not base your arguments on what I said about what happened in the year -- in that year, and what I said in the year 2003. 
Q.	So, what is the name of the person who was injured on the day of the meeting at Umuganda stadium? 
A.	I think that his name is not a secret.  I think that if you go and put the question to him, you will be -- you could -- his name is Reuben Munyambonera.  You can keep what he says to you secret. 
Q.	Can you spell his name for us, please?
A.	Munyambonera is spelt M-U-N-Y-A-M-B-O-N-E-R-A. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness XBM.  Now, can you -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
At this time, Mr. President, I would like to ask that document number 9 in my packet of exhibits be shown to the witness.  It is a calendar for the month of October 1993. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, I have placed before you a calendar for the month of October 1993, and you can see that the 27th of October fell on a Wednesday.  Did this rally that you attended occur during the week, or on a weekend? 
A.	It is very difficult to give you a precise date, but what I can say to you is that the political meetings during that time were usually organised on the weekend.  But it was also possible for meetings to be organised during the week.  It depended on what a specific political party wanted to do.  
Q.	Now, you previously stated that this meeting started at around 10 a.m. and ended at about 3:30 p.m.  To the best of your knowledge did this meeting take place during the week or on a weekend? 
A.	I think I gave you a full answer.  You asked me whether that political meeting was held over the weekend or during the week, and I would not be in a position to tell you that.  All I know is that I took part in that meeting.  And, of course, that meeting occurred 12 years ago.  So, it is very difficult for me to say whether the political meeting was held over the weekend, or during the week.  I think that you are well aware of the fact that it is very difficult, or not that easy to give specific information of that type. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would offer the calendar as Exhibit D. NZ167. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ167 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness XBM, we have had evidence in this case that on the 20th of October 1993 the president of Burundi was assassinated; and that, thereafter, President Habyarimana declared a period of          ten days' mourning for that president, during which normal activities, such as party meetings, were not held.  Can you tell us whether or not the meeting that are you speaking of took place before or after the assassination of the president of Burundi? 
A.	That is the reason why I told you that in view of the time that has elapsed, I have only provided you with an approximation.  I said that it was either in November or October.  When you say that the Burundian president was killed on the 20th, yes, we did hear that information over the radio.  And               President Habyarimana then ordered for there to be a period of mourning.  However, people still went about their ordinary business.  So people were just to be aware of the fact that the president had been killed, and we were to give that president a thought.  But that does not mean that the Rwandans did not carry on with their ordinary activities, whether it be the schools -- primary schools, for example, carried on.  And the civilians went to their work place as normal. 
Q.	Do you recall any discussion at this meeting of the death of President Ndadaye of Burundi?
A.	You know, at a political rally many people take the floor, and, yes, you have just explained it.  You said that according to the information at your disposal, the rally started at 10 and ended at about 3 p.m.  So that it lasted about four or five hours, which proves that it is not possible to remember everything.  One can only remember some of the issues dealt with, so that it is very difficult to remember, if at all, the issue of President Ndadaye's death was raised during the rally.  If I am not in a position to specify this, you cannot use that to conclude that I did not attend the rally. 
Q.	You told us that the bourgmestre of Rubavu commune -- that is R-U-B-A-V-U -- took the floor first at this meeting.  Can you tell us the name of the bourgmestre of Rubavu who spoke? 
A.	I think even you realise or understand it is very difficult to answer your questions, yet you are putting it anyway on purpose.  That person was bourgmestre of the commune, and that was enough.  Everyone knew him in his capacity as bourgmestre, so that no one needed to wonder what was his name.  He was bourgmestre, everybody knew that.  So there was no need to be overly concerned or curious as to his name.  I know that at that time I knew it, but right now, I cannot recall it. 
Q.	And you told us the second person to speak at this meeting was the préfet of Gisenyi.  Can you tell us the name of the préfet of Gisenyi who spoke on this occasion? 
A.	He was the préfet's representative.  It was someone who had been appointed to represent the préfet.  The Gisenyi préfet, at the time, was -- I do not remember the name of the Gisenyi préfet. 
Q.	Well, the person who spoke at the meeting, what was his name? 
A.	He took the floor on behalf of the préfet.  I did not pay attention to find out his name.  He was a well-known person in Rubavu commune where the rally was held. 
Q.	Now, in your statement of the 27th of February, on page 7 and page 8 of the French, and page 8 of the English, you say that, "The bourgmestre of Rubavu spoke.  He welcomed the authorities present, and he asked the préfet to make the introductions."  And then you can look at the -- find that on the bottom of page 7, and the beginning of page 8 where you say, "The first person to speak was the bourgmestre of Rubavu, and then he asked the préfet to make the introductions.  And the préfet only introduced the dignitaries, and urged the people to do as they were about to say."

Now, is it your testimony that it was not the préfet who spoke at this meeting, but some other person representing the préfet?  
A.	I have just told you it was a representative of the préfet who spoke in place of the préfet. 
Q.	And when you testified in the Bagosora trial, on page 18, on the ************2003, at -- at line 1, you again testified that the bourgmestre of Rubavu welcomed the visitors and then he called on the préfet to introduce those who had come to hold the meeting.  So, why have you said that the préfet of Gisenyi was present in your statement to the Prosecution, and in your testimony at another trial, and are now telling us that the préfet of Gisenyi was not present, but it was only a representative? 
A.	If you wish to understand you would.  I have just said that the representative of the Gisenyi préfet spoke.  For instance, you are representing your clients here, which means you represent their interests.  If they lose the case, it will not be a matter of concern to you.  The representative of the préfet, therefore, said what the préfet would have said. 
Q.	Now, Witness XBM, you have told us at this trial, during your direct testimony, that among the authorities present was Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva; is that correct? 
A.	Colonel Nsengiyumva never denied that.  He never denied this fact.  Now, as for Anatole Nsengiyumva and Bagosora, don't bring this in again until the appeal stage.  Don't ask me questions about Anatole and Bagosora again.  

I think that regarding the testimony I gave in that case, no one refuted those allegations.  So do not use that as a way of distracting us.  They have their own counsel and --  who are representing them; do not represent them here, therefore. 
Q.	Witness XBM, perhaps one reason why Anatole Nsengiyumva didn't refute your claim that he was present at this meeting was that you appear to have never made this claim before testifying in this trial.  And I have asked you to look again at your statements on page 7, when you list all of the authorities who were present at the rally.  You would agree, would you not, that you make no mention of       Anatole Nsengiyumva in your statement?
A.	All I know is this, you have just said that Anatole Nsengiyumva never refuted these allegations.  However, that does not mean that Anatole Nsengiyumva never read my testimony prior to my appearance in a Trial Chamber.  So do not rehash the Anatole issue here.  
Q.	Well, on page 7 of this statement, and page 8 of the English, you say that the prominent figures at the rally were Augustin Ngirabatware, number 68 on the spelling list, Édouard Karemera, Joseph Nzirorera, Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Wellars Banzi and the préfet of Gisenyi, correct? 
A.	Do you not think that those people whose names you have cited are all officials?  
Q.	Well I'm noting the absence of Anatole Nsengiyumva.  And turning to your testimony at Nsengiyumva's trial at page 18 of the transcript of the **************of 2003, you were asked by the Prosecutor: "And who were these visitors who had come to the meeting; do you remember them?"  And you said:  "Yes, I remember them."  

And the question:  "Can you name them?   And you said:  "I would name Ngirabatware who came from Kigali, even if he hailed from Gisenyi préfecture.  I would also name Édouard Karemera, Joseph Nzirorera and Colonel Bagosora.  There was also Ngirumpatse, who was that chairman of the party."  

And you never named at any time during the trial of Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva as being one of the person who attended this meeting; isn't that correct? 
A.	That is not the question.  Do not bring in the issue of Nsengiyumva into this case.  You may have the list of those persons, and only remember five names, it depends.  The issue of Anatole is of no interest to us here.  If Nsengiyumva's lawyer is not concerned by this issue, I do not see why you should be concerned.  If you think I forgot Anatole Nsengiyumva, well his trial is ongoing.  You may ask that I reappear in the Court dealing with that case so that I say he was present.  
Q.	Well, Witness, I put it to you that Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Karemera and Mr. Ngirumpatse were never at any meeting of the MRND at Umuganda stadium in October or November 1993, and that Colonel Bagosora and Anatole Nsengiyumva were never at any MRND meeting in October or November 1993 at Umuganda stadium.  And that your inconsistencies concerning the date of the meeting, the identity of those who participated, are a result of the fact that you are fabricating these events.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	If you refute those allegations, one would say you were the supreme leader of the MRND and that you had organised the rallies, and that you say you had sent them on mission elsewhere. 
Q.	Is that your comment? 
A.	Yes, that is all I have to say to you, because Bagosora never denied these facts.  He never denied that he was at the rally.  I don't know why you are trying to cover for him.  Moreover, I have been in confrontation with you for more than two weeks.  I have tried in vain to make you understand things.  It would appear you are like a little boy in first grade; you do not want to understand.  

As for that question, I need other special measures or powers to make you understand it.  At any rate, I was not the only participant at the rally. 
Q.	So it would be really helpful to us if you could give us the names of any other persons that you can recall who attended that meeting.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, aren't you pushing this too far?  He has given you the names.  You have              suggested -- you made certain suggestions to him; in an indirect manner, he has refuted.  You don't think you can proceed?   
MR. ROBINSON: 
The last thing I would like to do is get the names of people who attended this meeting with him.  He said 3,000 people attended this meeting.  And -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He has given you the names that he remembers. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
He has given the names of the authorities.  And at the same time he says, of course they're going to deny being present at this meeting.  They are all in Arusha, they are accused.  But I think it would be useful to get the names of, for example, the people who traveled with him to the meeting, his neighbours, his -- the people he can say who attended so that we can show once and for all that this meeting is a figment of his imagination.  So that is why I am trying -- that would be the last thing I want to do about this meeting. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, having heard the exchange, Witness XBM, between myself and the Judge, can you now provide us the names of those persons who can support your testimony about the existence of this meeting, people who were present with you? 
A.	As for the names of participants at the rallies, even the clients you represent, these MRND leaders would not be in a position to give you names of participants to the meetings, and yet they are the ones who organised the rallies.  I went to the rally in my own capacity.  No one had invited me.  I thought I needed to go.  Now, as for other participants at the rally, these are residents of Gisenyi.  You, therefore, will understand that if they are residents of Gisenyi, then you should see them and question them.  I know that some of them are currently detained in prison.  
I think your colleague, Ngirumpatse's lawyer has a question.  I don't know if he wants to put his question. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Before that, Mr. Weyl.  

Witness, we would make a lot more progress if you could answer the questions directly.  If you remember the names of any other person apart from the officials, just say so; if you don't remember, say, "I cannot remember."  And I think we will make a lot more progress if you would adopt this attitude.  Okay?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I never refused to give the names of the persons, Your Honour, but I know that if I were to give the names, the lawyer wants to use those names to alter the facts.  Yes, I understand you are also asking him not to dwell on these same questions, but I have noticed that he has false information; that the information available to him is complete fabrication.  

If it were anybody other than Robinson I could volunteer information in the hopes that the truth will come out.  But the problem is that Mr. Robinson may use that information to go and disrupt people.  That is the problem I have with Mr. Robinson.  It is obvious even from his physic, if you look at           Mr. Robinson and hear the way he talks, you can see that he is capable of transforming the truth and disrupting people. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, when you give information, you do not give it for the benefit of Mr. Robinson.  You give it for the benefit of the Chamber, for the Chamber to determine what is the truth of the matter.  So take your mind away from Mr. Robinson and think -- focus on the fact that you are here to assist the Chamber and not Mr. Robinson.  Okay?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  That is what I have always asked for.  That is what I asked you one day when I was about to draw up a list, you said that Robinson would also consult the list.  So you should appoint a group, a Defence team that represents -- and a team that represents the Prosecutor so that they can go together with Robinson, so that Robinson does not upset people once he gets to the ground.  

Since I do not trust Robinson, moreover I did not know him before; he introduced himself at one point.  We had not met before coming to court.  When he learned I was in Arusha, he asked one Kalumo to tell me that he wanted to see me.  Kalumo is in charge of witness security.  He brought a document to me that stated that you, the Judges, had granted him permission to meet me.  I do not know the details of that document since it was drafted in English, but I signed to the effect that I agreed to meet him.  But when I met him I noticed that he wanted to mollify me, and that he wanted me to give a different testimony.  I found him to be dishonest.  

In brief, if I insist on my confidence in the Judge and lack thereof for Robinson, it is because I noticed that he wanted to upset me, and that he had no right to approach me before I appeared in this court.  In brief, I am prepared to give the names of persons who attended the rally.  But as I said, I wasn't the only participant at the rally.  However, I can remember maybe five people who attended the rally.  I do agree, but I agreed to provide the list to Their Honours.  So I will write down about ten.  But I ask you not to trust Mr. Robinson. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, with your permission, while the witness writes, I have been on my feet for quite a while to bear witness to certain emotion.  I do not know if the Chamber has the full English translation of some of the statements made by the witness, which end in certain repetitions and there are problems to -- that pose a problem to me as a lawyer.  I've heard Mr. Robinson qualified as a liar, dishonest.  I wonder whether you have heard the translation of these words.  I have also heard Mr. Robinson described as a little boy in first grade.  

I think it is a lot, and that it would be best for the Chamber to remind the witness that the lawyers we are, that is us, should be accorded a modicum of respect.  We are dealing not with witnesses, but combatants, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to give an answer to the lawyer. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
Regarding the explanations I am giving -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Be quiet.  The lawyer has addressed the Chamber.  And it is not for you to respond to that particular comment. 
(Pages 11 to 23 by Donna M. Lewis)








1200H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the Bench agrees with the comments made by Mr. Weyl.  Your rule as a witness is to give testimony and to answer questions that are put to you.  You are being extremely argumentative in the way of trying to discharge your function.  And I've indicated to you before that that is not necessary nor helpful.  In this particular case, during the last few minutes, you have been very disrespectful to the lawyers appearing before the Court - appearing before the Trial Chamber.  And we feel that it is our duty to insist that you observe basic standards of decorum in the way you speak about the officers of the -- in the Trial Chamber.  So we draw this to your attention now and require you to observe this in the future comments you make.  You may now write the list of names.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is not necessary to reply to me.  
THE WITNESS:
I have now finished with the list, Mr. President.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would move for the admission of that list as D. NZ168.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ168 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  Mr. President, now I've going to move to another meeting that this witnessed testified about during this incident.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Is this under seal or not?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, under seal.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So I'm going to make an effort which is usually -- has been almost uniformly unsuccessful, but I'll try again as an effort to save time, to suggest that I'm going to ask this witness about events in January 1994 in which he testified he had gone to a meeting at the Mutura communal office and that weapons were distributed by Mr. Barayagwiza.  We know that this meeting was not part of the notice he received in either the indictment or in the pre-trial brief.  I pointed that out to you, that somehow the meeting -- or, the evidence of this meeting was allowed under the rubric of cooperation between the military and civilian authorities, although I don't believe there is any testimony about military authorities being present at this meeting.  During the course of ruling on my objection, at this stage of the trial you reserved your ruling on the admissibility of these events.  And, so, before I spend the time that's going to be necessary concerning this meeting, I want to make a motion to strike the direct testimony concerning this meeting and give the Trial Chamber an opportunity to save time by avoiding the events of this meeting, if you feel that would be useful.  Otherwise, if you feel that, at this stage, everything that has already been discussed should be gone into in cross-examination, then I'm prepared to do that, but I wanted to at least offer the opportunity to save some time for the Trial Chamber on an issue that doesn't appear to me to have added to the Prosecution's case, but does add to our burden of cross-examination and producing Defence witnesses in rebuttal.  So, at this time, I make a motion to strike all references to the events at the Mutura commune -- the office, in January of 1994. 
MR. LAHAIE:
As a brief reply to that question, Mr. President, I think my colleague's motion is redundant because it's already been advanced.  And, as this Chamber has already gone through this in the examination-in-chief, I do not see why my colleague should not cross-examine on that subject because if that has been admitted into evidence, then it might be a good idea for there to be a cross-examination on the subject.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Did we reserve our ruling on this part, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Judge Short, you did. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we had -- we had intended to actually include this in our written decision in the indictment issue, but I can tell you that we have in fact allowed -- decided to allow testimony to be given.  We will be giving our reasons in due course, but that will be a decision that we have taken.  So you should cross-examine.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, very well.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, I want to direct your attention to the period of January 1994.  Can you tell us whether any weapons were distributed at the Mutura communal office during that month?
A.	Weapons were indeed distributed at that location, but I would like to give you further clarification.  Those weapons were not distributed on that occasion, they were just unloaded. 
Q.	And was there a meeting at the Mutura communal office at that time?
A.	Yes, something did occur, something that could be described as a political meeting.  It was a sensitisation meeting to describe the situation that was prevailing at the time, and also to give the measures to be taken, and it was a way of encouraging people to become violent.  I think you could describe that as a political meeting, indeed. 
Q.	And was it a meeting of the communal authorities, or was it a meeting of a political party?
A.	It was a meeting of the leaders of a political party, but there were also some members of the population present; but not many people attended that meeting. 
Q.	And the political you're referring to is the CDR; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And who was it that brought the weapons?
A.	Mr. Barayagwiza. 
Q.	And who was with him when the weapons were brought?  
A.	He was accompanied by soldiers, but I was not able to know their names. 
Q.	And in what vehicle were these weapons brought?
A.	It was the vehicle belonging to Mr. Barayagwiza.  It was a saloon car. 
Q.	Do you remember the colour?
A.	It was white in colour. 
Q.	And who was his driver?
A.	His driver was called Gakwandi.  
Q.	And is that the same person whose name was also Karasira?
A.	That is correct. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's item 26 on the spelling list.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were there any other persons who were in Mr. Barayagwiza's vehicle, besides him and his driver, that you are aware of?
A.	Everyone knew that it was Barayagwiza's driver.  With respect to anybody else accompanying them, well, we did not bother to find out their names. 
Q.	And do you know from where the soldiers were who came to Mutura communal office on this occasion?  Were they from Bagogwe camp, from Gisenyi ops?  Do you know where those soldiers were from?
A.	I just simply saw them at that location.  They were soldiers.  I did not know whence they had come.  I did not know whether they came from Bagogwe camp or from Gisenyi ops. 
Q.	And approximately how many weapons were unloaded from the vehicle at this meeting?
A.	There were 42 firearms.  So, there was just a handful of weapons, if you like. 
Q.	And how do you know there were 42?
A.	We counted them. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us the names of the persons who counted those rifles with you?
A.	I did not take part in the counting operation, but I was there whilst people were counting them, and I saw how the firearms were unloaded from the vehicle, and I took part in the counting operation. 
Q.	Just for clarification, because I think that answer had some contradictory information.  It may be the translation.  Did you take part in the counting operation or did you not?
A.	No, I did not take part, I was just present. 
Q.	So can you give us the names of those who took part in the counting of the weapons?
A.	I no longer remember their names.  I know that they were the leaders of the political parties. 
Q.	You mean the leaders of the CDR party? 
A.	Yes, influential members of the CDR party were there, as was the chairman of the MRND.
Q.	So can you tell us, then, who was the chairman of the CDR party for Mutura commune?
A.	I remember the chairman of the CDR party of the secteur that I'm a native of.  I knew his Christian name; however, I have forgotten it now.  I did not meet him on a very regular basis, and I never had a drink with him, so I have forgotten his name now.  
Q.	Well, just starting at the level of the commune, since this was a meeting at the commune office in Mutura, can you give us the name of any of the officers of the CDR party at the level of the commune of Mutura?
A.	Which representative or leader are you referring to, Counsel?  I told you that there was a chairman, but I did not remember his name.  
Q.	I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood, because I thought you were referring to the chairman at the level of the secteur in which you resided.  So, I'm perhaps not understanding you clearly.  I'm asking you now, at the level of the commune of Mutura, can you give us the names of any officers of the CDR party, the chairman, the vice chairman, the secretary, or the treasurer? 
A.	I have just told you that I only knew the Christian name of the chairman, but that I have forgotten it now, in view of the fact that it was so long ago now and I no longer see him any more.  With reference to the other leaders, those were people that I knew.  I could give you the name of the leader of the CDR at a secteur level and surrounding communes as well.  
Q.	Well, seeing that we're about to take our break for the lunch recess, I'm going to ask you to write down on a piece of paper, while we are on our break, the names of all those people you can remember in attendance at the meeting in January where these rifles were distributed, and, then, when we come back at two o'clock you can present us with this written list.  Do you understand? 
A.	As I have just told you, Counsel, once that list is drawn up by myself, I will hand it over to the Bench.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our luncheon adjournment now. 
(Court recessed from 1232H to 1432H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you can continue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Before I continue with the witness, Mr. President, I would like to just raise a scheduling issue with you.  As we're nearing the end of this witness's testimony this week, if at all possible, it would be our preference that we somehow obtain the testimony of Mr. Serugendo because I think once we leave at the end of next week the chances of him being here when we return in October seem to be not great.  So I was wondering whether or not the Trial Chamber could -- I know you indicated you would ask the registry for an updated medical report -- and I was wondering if also we could put some kind of a deadline on that so that we would be in a position to make some decisions as to who -- which witness we would be able to proceed with next.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
An inquiry was initiated.  I haven't got a response yet, but we will -- I will follow it up again.  
MR. WEBSTER:
As an addendum to that, I was wondering whether there was any news on how this could be managed by video link.  If the registry was able to comment on whether it's actually feasible to implement the video link from the -- Nairobi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The first issue is (inaudible). 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The first issue is the medical (inaudible).  His ability to be examined at all.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's true.  They go hand in hand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so that -- once the registry have been able to get an -- updated information, then we'll start managing the second issue.  The medical report did not look very good, so we have to wait until that is reviewed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness XBM.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Have you had the opportunity to compile a list of those present when the weapons were unloaded at the Mutura communal office in January 1994?
A.	I felt that the break was a time for me to rest and not to draw up a list.  I am ready to prepare that list here and now.  
Q.	Okay.  Why don't you do that and you let us know when you've completed your work.
A.	I believe that this number of names which I can recall will be sufficient.  I would, therefore, request that this list be handed over to the Judges because I trust only them, as I have already said before.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would request that this list be admitted as exhibit D. NZ179 -- excuse me, 169.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal?  
MR. ROBINSON:
To me it doesn't seem that it would be -- need to be under seal.  It is a list of people at the Mutura commune office.  It is a large commune.  It doesn't seem like it would lead to the identity of this witness, but if anyone has any other opinion I don't feel very strongly about that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ169 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, did you include the president of the MRND for Mutura commune in that list?
A.	I only remember the names of members of the CDR.  I did not include the name of the MRND president in Mutura commune, but I believe that his name is written down somewhere. 
Q.	And can you tell us his name? 
A.	Jean Damascene Ntamaherezo.  I think I have already mentioned his name.  And this is not the first time you're hearing that name.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's number 78 on the spelling list.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, you told us that the weapons were unloaded at the Mutura commune office, but they were not distributed at that time.  Can you tell us when they were distributed?
A.	I was an eyewitness to the unloading of the weapons, but what happened thereafter is unknown to me.  
Q.	Now, I want to direct your attention to another meeting which you have testified about, a rally of the CDR party after the death of the president of the party Bucyana.  Can you tell us approximately how long after Bucyana's death that meeting took place?
A.	One week after the death of President Bucyana. 
Q.	And where did the meeting take place?
A.	At the MRND palace in Gisenyi.  
Q.	Were there any MRND officials who attended that meeting that you saw?
A.	No MRND member was present at that meeting. 
Q.	And you've told us that Barayagwiza was one of the speakers; is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And Bagosora; correct?
A.	Yes, he also took the floor. 
Q.	And Anatole Nsengiyumva; correct?
A.	Correct.  
Q.	Did either the bourgmestre of Rubavo commune or the préfet of Gisenyi attend this meeting?
A.	No, they did not attend that meeting. 
Q.	And about how many members of the CDR were present?
A.	About 500.  Between 400 and 500 persons. 
Q.	And can you tell us briefly what Mr. Barayagwiza said at this meeting?
A.	He called on the participants at the meeting to understand that the CDR had agreed to join parliament, that is, the national assembly.  
Q.	Now when Bagosora spoke, did he make any reference to the Prime Minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana?
A.	Talking about Agathe, he said that she was opposed or against the interests of the state, and that because of her collaboration with the RPF Inkotanyi -- she often went to Mulindi where the Inkotanyi were based, so she would spend entire days at Mulindi instead of working in her office. 
Q.	And did Bagosora speak of any meeting between Agathe and some senior military officers of the Rwandan army?
A.	Yes, he talked about that.  He said that Agathe -- that Agathe had been attempting to convince the senior authorities of the country and bring them to overthrow President Habyarimana. 
Q.	And did he speak of any particular meeting she had had with any senior military officers?
A.	Yes, he said that the military had given a deaf ear to what she was saying, particularly those soldiers from the north as well as those from the south, but he didn't mention any specific names of the military officers who may have been consulted.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, I put it to you that the meeting that was convened between the Prime Minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and the senior military officers took place on the 4th of April 1994, two days before the assassination of President Habyarimana and, therefore, it was impossible for Colonel Bagosora to have spoken about this meeting one week after the death of Bucyana who was killed in February.  Do you have any comment on that?
A.	I don't know on what grounds you come to the conclusion that that was impossible, but all I know is that I was told that he had said so and I did hear it.  
Q.	Are you in a position to give us the names of people who attended this meeting along with you and heard those things said by Bagosora?
A.	I do not remember.  I do not remember their names.  
Q.	Can you give us the name of anyone that you came to the meeting with or that you left with?  And you can do that on a piece of paper if -- if giving that name would in some way contribute to revealing your identity.
A.	All I know -- and Bagosora can testify to this himself as well, since he's involved and since he's the one who took the floor -- all I know is that we were told to be brief in our discussions, but it would seem to me that you are rejecting the information that I have provided to you, that is why I believe that just mentioning the name of Bagosora should be sufficient.  As a matter of fact, when I testified in his own case he did not dismiss my testimony.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, you keep referring to that, but in fact after you testified in Colonel Bagosora's trial, he testified.  And during his testimony he said that the things that you had testified to were false, that he never attended such a meeting, that he never talked about Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and that all of these things that you have said at his trial were a pack of lies, so don't come back on the fact that Bagosora hasn't refuted what you've said because he has.  Now, I'm asking you to give us the names of people, if you can, who can -- who you were with so we can go and see, between you and Bagosora, who is telling the truth and who isn't.  
A.	There are very few people who can testify against themselves.  Bagosora did not entertain those allegations because he knew that it would be contrary to his own interests and that is why he did not provide the necessary explanations.  You see, the fact that people gathered in a hall and listened to a message is a fact, but I did not pay attention as to the people who were in the hall.  Now that meeting of the 4th of April purportedly held to overthrow President Habyarimana -- I believe that it might be best for -- for me to tell you, Mr. Robinson, that from the 5th of January 1994, that is, after President Habyarimana took the oath of office to become the president of the transitional government, that ceremony was cancelled.  And I would like to say that from that day on there was resemblance of an institutional void in the country.  So when you say that Agathe met with senior officers on the 4th of April, that is not my position.  All I can say is that several meetings were holding  (sic) across the country, be there with Nsengiyaremye, or Nzirorera, or Ngirumpatse.  Several meetings took place and announcements were made in that connection over radio and on television.  So there was an impasse in the country and we were all aware of that.  I, therefore, do not know whether giving you names or mentioning those names would be of any use to you.  While I do not seek to delay or obstruct anything, all I can say is that there are some people whom I saw.  But if I were to write down the name Robinson, for example, without knowing that person's native cellule or secteur, that would not be useful.  I may be able to give you the names of one or two people whom I might have met in a bar, or something of that nature, but the names of those who secteurs and cellules I don't know will not be useful.  
Q.	Witness XBM, you have told us that there were 400 or 500 people from your party in your préfecture at this meeting.  Can you name at least one of them? 
A.	I can name even two, but my problem is that I will not know their contacts, I will not know their cellule or their secteur.  So even if I were to give you their names how will you find out their secteurs to be able to contact them?  I am ready to give you the names and then it will be for you to do whatever you can do to find out what their addresses were.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Can you give us their names?  
A.	You see, it is difficult to provide the name of somebody who is not known in the area of politics.  So I think this matter relates to my safety and security.  So if you give me guarantees that my safety will not be at stake, then I will do so, but it is quite delicate to provide somebody's name particularly if that person is not known in the political arena. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, we can have you write down the name on a piece of paper and it will be maintained by the Trial Chamber under seal.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So if the registrar could give the witness a piece of paper.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And you can write down the names of people who attended this meeting one week after the death of Bucyana.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that that document which contains two names be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ170 under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ170 admitted, under seal)  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness XBM, can you tell us what Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva said when he spoke at this meeting?
A.	In his speech, he spoke and confirmed that there were not many accomplices in Gisenyi region, and that with regard to training dispensed to the youth, that that operation should be reinforced.  Given the presence of Bagosora, there was a need to find firearms and train the youths in the region. 
Q.	And to your knowledge, after this meeting, let's say from the beginning of March until the 6th of April 1994, was there any military training of youth conducted in Gisenyi préfecture?
A.	Yes, there was training organised and in various places. 
(Pages 24 to 32 by Roxane Meena)
















1500H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were these places military camps or were they within the communes of Gisenyi préfecture? 
A.	If my memory serves me right, there were military camps in Gisenyi, in fact, the camp in Gisenyi town is Bigogwe camp.  I think at Bigogwe training took place continually.  Now, it is very close to the tarred road, and maybe -- to exhaust this question -- one should speak to people who lived in the vicinity of Bigogwe camp***************.  

	There was also training provided at military positions or at the communal office -- communal offices.  This -- some training was given in vacant areas - lots, like valleys.  People were taught in those places how to handle weapons, among other exercises.  The young trainees were made to run every day; youths took part in the training, and even physically fit adults.  In short, the training -- the exercise was given and everyone in Rwanda was aware of it.  
Q.	Did you yourself take part in any military training? 
A.	I do not think military training is included in my file or in my statement.  Had I undergone any training, I would have mentioned it.  All I did was closely follow the training.  I was a witness to the training, but I did not undergo it personally.  
Q.	And how was it that, given the fact that you were young and you appeared to be physically fit, that you escaped having to go through this training? 
A.	That is my prerogative.  It is a question that relates to my private life.  I do not think it is essential.  
Q.	Witness, you have testified to many things that involved your private life when the Prosecution was questioning you.  Is there some particular reason why you can't tell us how it was you avoided military training? 
A.	In my view, perhaps in answer to you, I think you are still operating in the same strategy that is intended to delay the proceedings.  I want to make this clear.  First of all, as a person who had just left the MDR under duress, I was not trusted by those people.  I could follow everything that went on, but they did not trust me 100 per cent.  They would try to observe me and my development in -- within the party, so that perhaps in the end I would have been taken for the training.  I would have been fully entitled to it.  However, in my opinion, those people did not completely trust me.  
Q.	And did you receive a weapon? 
A.	Once again, you're backtracking.  And that is what I just said.  I said they were still observing me, they were still observing me to ascertain that I had completely switched sides, and as the situation -- by the time the situation deteriorated I had not yet received a firearm.  I think I have explained myself fully on this question.  
Q.	Now, turning to the assassination of President Habyarimana, you have told us that you learned of this while you were at your residence.  Did you fear for your own security as a result of the fact that you had been ***************************and you were not trusted by those in your CDR party? 
A.	Apart from me, every Rwandan citizen reacted in a certain way, but generally speaking, everyone was afraid.  
Q.	Now, in the morning of the 7th of April, you have told us that a policeman came to your house and summoned you to attend a meeting of political party officials at the commune office; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  And I believe we discussed this.  We have thrashed this out enough.  You may recall this.  It related to the incident.  If you want us to rehearse it, we can go on -- it will take 30 minutes to talk about the same story.  
Q.	Well, we haven't said anything during the cross-examination about the events of the 7th of April, but I'm wondering how it was that you came to be summoned to a meeting of political party officials when you yourself were not an official of the CDR party and you tell us you were not trusted by those who were.  
A.	Now I think I understand your question.  If I was summoned to attend the meeting, it is a situation that differs from 1993 when I was forced to leave my party to join another party.  It's quite another matter.  In 1993, there were no factions within the parties.  In February 1993, the MDR Power had not yet surfaced, nor had the PL Power and so on.  Therefore, in this framework, I was called and ordered to stop working for the MDR party, because at the time the parties were considered accomplices or collaborators of the RPF Inkotanyi -- Inyenzi.  

Subsequently, I was observed in my new party.  And following -- and therefore, what followed were many meetings within the party, which I attended.  So until 1994, the death of 
President Habyarimana -- that is, the situation was clear cut.  As far as factions within the parties were concerned, parties that collaborated, including the MDR and the PL, but basically -- oh, by the way, I had forgotten to mention the PSD, it was also involved with regard to the factions.  

So if we are to consider the fact that I was summoned, there are other members of 
the PSD - members -- although they were members of the Power faction, and also within the PL who were present.  So, if you wanted to join another political force -- and as you note the content of political speeches on the 7th of April, we were asked to put aside our affiliation to our respective parties in order to work jointly, irrespective of our political leanings, in order to fight the Tutsis, because it was now clear that the Tutsi was the enemy, and that for the time being, we should forget about our political affiliation.  
Q.	So are you telling us that on the morning of the 7th of April you were summoned to the communal office in your capacity as********************************? 
A.	Those are the people who know me, my capacity, or the circumstances under which I was summoned.  However, given -- given the situation, I noticed or -- that I was not being looked at with a mistrustful eye as was the case in 1993.  I believe that was the prevailing situation, otherwise nothing in particular occurred during that period.  
Q.	Witness XBM, I'm having a hard time understanding you, because you say you were summoned to a meeting of political party officials on the morning of the 7th, but you were not an official of any political party because, according to you, in 1992 you had resigned as*******************, and when you joined the CDR party, according to you, you never held any post with that party.  So I'm trying to understand in what capacity you were summoned to a meeting of political party officials.  Was it because you were ***************or was it because you were a CDR member? 
A.	These were party officials, but that did not prevent those leaders from summoning other persons who may have had ideas to contribute.  We met with the communal office, we were 76.  Our commune included 13 secteur.  Not everyone was a party leader, so it depended on the reasons given by those who convened the meeting.  
Q.	And you were trusted enough to be summoned to a meeting at which instructions were to be given for the killing of Tutsi.  Is that correct? 
A.	That's not how I see it.  It's not a matter of trusting anyone.  It was a message they wanted to put out as quickly as possible to the people; otherwise, I found myself at the meeting.  And I think that it was mentioned at length over the radio; everybody got to know the content of the speeches that were broadcast on radio.  It was no secret.  Perhaps in our case, given that we shared a border with the Congo, it was all the more important for us.  There was perhaps a need to inform the entire population so that they would be vigilant and ensure that no one crossed the borders.  And, besides, people expressed themselves freely on radio, inciting the Hutus to kill the Tutsis.  It wasn't addressed to anyone in particular; it was addressed to the whole population.  And, thereafter, some people executed the message or order given.  
Q.	Did you hear speeches or messages by authorities over the radio in which they instructed the population to exterminate the Tutsis? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I heard such messages.  I do not think it was limited to Rwanda.  Such messages broadcast on radio could also spill over beyond the borders of Rwanda.  
Q.	Can you give us the name of the authorities who broadcast messages in which they called for the extermination of the Tutsis? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, I am going to ask you to pay attention to what I will say.  The first person who incited people to kill was President Theodore Sindikubwabo.  He went to Butare, he held a meeting, and he said that natives of Butare seemed indifferent and that these indifferent people ought to die; these people who did not feel the situation concerned them.  As a matter of fact, these people felt that the Tutsis should not be slaughtered, and Tutsis as well were included in that number.  After he made that speech, the killings in Butare began.  Therefore, you will understand that these messages emanated from the top and all Rwandans kept in step.  If you read the transcripts of the speeches which were recorded, that is one of his speeches.  I do not personally have the speech, but I know the speech exists.  So we heard a number of speeches in that vein.  

Secondly, in one of the statements I gave -- it has not yet been put to me for comment, perhaps I should reserve my comments until we get to it -- but in that statement, I think there is mention of one of the Accused in this case, who, following a question put to him by a journalist named Gahigi, answered that the Tutsis should not be protected, that no one should rescue the Tutsis because the Tutsi had just killed their protector.  So the question related to the fate of the Tutsis.  That speech, it was actually an interview broadcast by RTLM.  

I also don't want to name the Accused in question before we get to that part of the file, but I know that one of these three Accused made such remarks.  He said that the Tutsis should -- had only themselves to blame because the reason they were being massacred at the time was that they themselves had just killed their own protector, the person who had protected them for such a long time who had constantly protected them.  And so, they had only themselves to blame.  He made those remarks and, once again, I repeat it is one of the Accused in this case.  
Q.	And that was not Mr. Nzirorera, correct? 
A.	I tell you that we have not yet dealt with that matter in this trial so I did not want to say who it was.  I tell you I am just touching on the subject because I know it may be raised at a later stage because I know that such an interview was recorded.  It was an interview with a journalist, and the document exists.  So, when one makes a speech or says something, one must be ready to answer for it.  
Q.	Witness XBM, I'm going to let the person -- the lawyer for the person who you're claiming made that statement discuss that with you.  But I want to at least establish -- because I've read your statement, 
	I know what you're talking about -- that you are not attributing that statement to Mr. Nzirorera, correct? 
A.	I see that you are trying by all means to make me say who it was.  I said I did not want to go into detail because that part of the file has not yet been mentioned.  If it were Nzirorera or anyone else, I think that we should let the person concerned deal with it because the recording exists and that person's voice is recognisable on it.  That person said, "Let the Tutsi die, let no one rescue them because they are the ones who killed their own protector."  Well, the person who said those things knows who he is.  
Q.	Witness XBM, I can tell you that none of the three Accused said such things.  We have the broadcasts of the RTLM, we have the broadcasts of Radio Rwanda, and this is a complete figment of your imagination.  And I am trying to be gracious and leave this to someone else, but I'm going to insist because you are not answering my question.  And if you want me to discuss this with you for hours, we can discuss it, but I've asked you simply whether or not it was Mr. Nzirorera who you claim made that statement.  You can answer yes or no.
A.	I told you that in my answer I limited myself, so don't argue about it.  This is a message, a speech, that was made on RTLM radio.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know who made the speech? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know, Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Please tell the Court. 
THE WITNESS:
Since that file has not yet been received by the Tribunal, I do not think it is necessary to say the name of the person who made the speech.  I am saying so because I know I made such a statement.  Apart from the interview, there was also a meeting held by that person.  There are other people who can testify to that.  I told you it is one of these three Accused, Mr. President.  It is not really difficult to give you the name, but my concern is that that document that has not yet been broached -- I do not think we will end the proceedings today, but if you should receive the document, I will then be able to give you more ample explanations about the document.  Otherwise, I do not think it's appropriate to mention the name before you receive the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Witness, as I told you, it is the Judges who determine what are proper questions.  The question as to the identity of the person who made the speech is a proper question, and it is one that you are required to answer.  So please give the name to the Court.  
THE WITNESS:
I think that you must excuse me.  For the time being, I will refrain from giving the name -- the answer.  I think the time will come and I will say the name, but I cannot say it today.  You will, therefore, excuse me; I will refrain from giving the name.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going to make a motion to strike the testimony of this witness.  I think he is so insolent to the Court that any credibility he has left at this stage is not worth even continuing the cross-examination when he won't answer a question after being directed by the Trial Chamber.  I think we should strike his testimony and move on to a witness that has a little bit more dignity.  
MS. DIANGE-MBAYE:  
Mr. President, obviously Mr. Édouard Karemera's team supports the motion by our colleague, 
Mr. Peter Robinson.  I think the Chamber cannot tolerate a moment more testimony by such a witness and we request you to base yourself on the law to decide to strike this witness.  Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
The same goes for the team defending Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  We ask you to take measures as necessary to ensure that the witnesses heard in this Court will ensure the efficacy of the work conducted here.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. LAHAIE: 
Very briefly, Mr. President, there are two matters underlying my colleague's motion.  The first is that I respectfully submit testimony cannot be excluded because the witness refuses to answer a question.  It is a question -- be it a question by the Defence, the Prosecution, or the Court.  So I do not think that the testimony is rendered inadmissible.  

Secondly, I think the Court can explain to the witness that when it puts a question to him, whether or not he agrees, he should answer.  It is obviously up to the Court to make an assessment based on the situation, will you lend credence to the witness in part or not at all.  It is a decision to be taken by the Court.  However, it is not a reason to exclude the testimony; it should be explained to the witness that he should respond to the questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lahaie, when a witness refuses to obey a direction from the Court to answer a question, what should the Court do?  
MR. LAHAIE:
I submit that it is a decision to be taken by the Court, but I do not think that legally speaking the fact that he refuses to answer a question by anyone renders his testimony inadmissible.  It is certain that it will give the Court reason to question the credibility of the witness, but if the Court wants to take other measures, it is free to do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, sit forward.  I'm directing you to answer the question:  What was the name of the person who made that speech? 
THE WITNESS:
Do you want me to write down his name or to say his name in public if there is no problem? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can say his name in public.  
THE WITNESS:
It is Nzirorera who said it.  It is Joseph Nzirorera, that one there, the one you see there.  And for this reason you heard the lawyer using all sorts of ruses to have my testimony excluded and doing all in his power to ensure that these charges are not brought against him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when you are sitting in this witness box in this court there are certain levels of decorum that I expect of a witness.  I spoke to you about one of them this morning, the issue of courtesy in respect for the lawyers who come before the Court.  

Now, this afternoon you have been challenging the Bench, and that is not going to be tolerated.  There are many things that the Court can do about it.  Up to now we have decided to persuade you to answer.  Don't let this happen again.  

We will take the mid-afternoon recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1542H to 1615H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, how much time -- more time do you think you need? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think I will finish sometime tomorrow morning at this -- at this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, we're now going to talk about the speech or interview that you claim that 
	Mr. Nzirorera gave over the radio, and I want to ask you when was the first time that you told the Prosecutor about this speech? 
A.	I discussed the speech of Nzirorera with the Prosecutor, who is prosecuting Nzirorera, for the first time on the 6th of September 2005.  
Q.	And where did that take place? 
A.	We met in Gisenyi town.  
Q.	And the individual that you spoke with, is that Mr. Webster who is seated to your right? 
A.	No, he was not the one.  
Q.	Who was the Prosecutor? 
A.	I talked to investigators from the Prosecutor's office in Kigali; they gave me their names:  
	Hamo and Mengalle.  
Q.	Can you spell those for us, please? 
A.	Those are not Rwandese names and I do not know how they're spelt.  
Q.	There's a man who has interviewed you in the past whose last name is Hamo, H-A-M-O, and his first name is Oumarou, O-U-M-A-R-O-U.  Was he one of the people? 
A.	The only name I know is Hamo.  I did not know what his second name is.  All I remember -- or the name that I retained is Hamo.  
Q.	And on another occasion you were interviewed by someone named Tidjani, T-I-D-J-A-N-I, first name Fadila.  Was that the other person that you spoke with? 
A.	No, I did not meet that person at that time.  
Q.	So the second person was someone named Mengalle? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Now, when you met them on the 6th of September 2005, did you sign a statement either on that day or any time thereafter? 
A.	I signed my statement on the same day.  
Q.	And was -- before you signed it, was the statement read to you in Kinyarwandan? 
A.	I was the author of the statement.  It was drafted in French and the document was given back to me so that I could review it.  
Q.	And was there an interpreter present during this interview? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you happen to recall the name of the interpreter? 
A.	Samson Demokarsi.  
Q.	Was it a Rwandan? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And can you spell the name for us, please? 
A.	D-E-M-O-K-A-R-S-I.  
Q.	Was there anyone else present at your meeting besides yourself, the two investigators and the interpreter? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, when you came to Arusha in 2006, did you discuss the broadcast of Nzirorera's interview with anyone here in Arusha? 
A.	No one, I did not meet any Rwandan. 
Q.	But what about persons from the Office of the Prosecutor?  Did you discuss Nzirorera's interview with any of them? 
A.	I only discussed the interview with those investigators about whom we talked a short while ago.  
Q.	Did anyone show you the statement that you'd given on the 6th of September here in Arusha? 
A.	No one, but I do remember signing a statement on the 6th of September 2005.  
Q.	And did the topic of that statement or the contents of that statement ever come up in your discussions with the Prosecutors in this case, either Mr. Lahaie, who's just entered the room, or 
	Mr. Webster? 
A.	This was distinct for the purp -- from the purpose.  This was to be distinguished from the purpose for which I came to the Tribunal on -- this time around, and so we did not discuss that issue.  
Q.	And what's the basis of your understanding that this was to be distinguished from the purpose for which you were here? 
A.	I do distinguish between the two because the statement of 2003 was made -- or, rather, the Prosecutor put questions to me in regard to the statement that I made in 2003.  And I answered the Prosecutor's questions in that connection and that is what I continue to do.  
Q.	And you understand that this is Mr. Nzirorera's trial, don't you? 
A.	Yes, I understand that all this is in connection with the Nzirorera case.  But, again, that is another issue.  We, first of all, dealt with the first part -- that is, the facts, and the second part which relates to the speech is something that I expected to arise within the context of what was said on the 
	6th of September 2005.  Now, if you are in possession of that document, then we can be able to talk about that issue.  
Q.	Did someone tell you that you should not discuss that issue at this trial? 
A.	No one.  In fact, I did not discuss it with anybody, but I know that the questions that are being put to me today flow from my 2003 statement.  I do not know whether that information of -- or the document of the 6th of September 2005 is available to you.  
Q.	Why did you refuse to answer the presiding Judge's question when he asked you who it was who made the statement on the radio? 
A.	I do not want you to pit me against the President of this Trial Chamber.  I did not refuse to answer his question.  I think I did answer his question ultimately following the explanations that were provided, because I did not quite understand that I could have mentioned somebody's name without any hesitation.  But after he explained the issues to me, I did answer his question, didn't I? 
Q.	Apart from this interview of the 6th of September 2005, has there been any other occasion in which you have mentioned the interview of Mr. Nzirorera to any authorities? 
A.	Which authorities are you referring to, Counsel? 
Q.	I'm referring to any representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor here at the ICTR or any representatives of the Rwandan government? 
A.	In fact, I did not have any discussions with the Rwandan authorities in respect of the statements I made.  I have not talked about this with anybody else.  But I have told you that I made my statement on the 6th of September 2005 to the investigators.

1630H
MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, thank you very much, Witness XBM.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have a motion to make.  I would like to do it outside the presence of this witness, so I think you would understand what that motion is going to be.
JUDGE BYRON:
Do you need to make it now?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, because it relates to material I'm going to need to continue my cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm going to have to ask you to leave again, Mr. Witness.
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, as I think you might suspect, the statement of the 6th of September 2005 has never been disclosed to the Defence.  It comes as a complete surprise to us, and, of course, a statement signed by this witness to the investigators of the Prosecutor would clearly be disclosed under Rule 66(A)(2).  
So I, at this time, make a request for the disclosure of this statement.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, unfortunately, Your Honours, I'm not aware of the existence of this particular statement.  As the witness has been testifying I've been feverously sending messages on my laptop to the investigators in Kigali and to other members of my team on the 4th floor for some feedback based on information that has just come to light, but I'm not aware of the statement, and neither is Mr. Gilles Lahaie.  So we'll look for it.  If it can be located we'll disclose to it the parties.  I've looked in ZyFILE and it's not there.  That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  It's quite possible, although I don't know how likely it is that it's something that could have been recorded and remained in Kigali by mistake.  I have no idea.  But we are looking for it as we address the Court and as soon as I get some information I'll report back to the Trial Chamber and, of course, the Accused.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, obviously I think it's not wise to continue my cross-examination on this topic until we have received the statement or confirmation that the statement doesn't exist.  So I can move on to other areas, and we could deal with this tomorrow.  

I have a second motion to make, however, and that is a motion to receive from the Prosecution any transcript or recording of an interview with Mr. Nzirorera on broadcast RTLM, because from all the disclosure that has been given to us there was no such interview.  And so if such an interview exists, certainly it should be provided by the Prosecution.  Or if there is no interview in existence, the Prosecution should also confirm that to the Trial Chamber.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, unfortunately the only thing I can confirm or the Prosecution can confirm to the 
Trial Chamber is that all the transcripts that we possess from RTLM have been disclosed on the Defence, as have all of the transcripts of Radio Rwanda, where any one of the Accused has made a statement.  As far as we are concerned, we have done a thorough search of the Radio Rwanda materials, and those have been disclosed as individualised per Accused.  We have not made a same search of RTLM, but all of the RTLM transcripts and recordings have been provided to the Defence.  And the Defence, actually, have been relying on those materials much more heavily than the Prosecution.  

So I'm assuming if Mr. Robinson hasn't located his client's voice on RTLM, then he is in a better position to state that conclusively.  So I can't give the Court any assurance.  We'll have another look, if we find anything we'll make it available, but as the Court and as, certainly, Mr. Robinson is well aware, the recordings and transcripts that we do have and that we have served is not the entirety of everything that was said and recorded in 1994.  The only things that we can disclose are the few that we ourselves have located.  All of that material has already been provided to the Defence.  That doesn't mean there was never a broadcast or an interview, but the documentation that we have does not include what Mr. Robinson is alluding to.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I think we can bring the witness back.
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. Witness, your cross-examination will continue now.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, that statement of 6 September 2005 has not been located and I'm going to move onto another topic, and if that statement is in existence we can discuss it when it is located, but can you just tell us approximately when it was that that interview was broadcast on RTLM?  First of all, the month.  
A.	The interview was broadcast after the death of President Habyarimana and if any of you are going to locate that document I am not ready to talk about it now.  I would like to have to deal with this later on because I have spent several days here already. 
Q.	Well, we're going to have to complete your testimony, so is there some reason why you don't want to speak about that now? 
A.	I've already spent a very long time here, and I think anyone should understand me, because I was not expected to spend this much time here.  You cannot spend one month away from your family without any news about them, particularly under the circumstances where you provide information to somebody who does not understand that there are pending and outstanding problems within your family.  Under those circumstances, one can only but desire to go back home. 
Q.	Well, Witness, I sympathise with your desire to go back home, and I'm happy to have you go back home as soon as we can complete your testimony.  But it would go faster, you would go home sooner if you answered the questions rather than delaying us by refusing to answer or saying you want to answer later.  

So, is there some reason why you don't want to speak about this interview with Mr. Nzirorera?  
A.	Yes, I have a reason.  And the reason is what I have just said.  You are putting questions to me on a statement which I made in 2003, but now we are not yet dealing with the statement of 2005.  I talked about it because you asked me whether any authority had spoken on the radio to incite people to kill, and I gave you the example of Sindikubwabo.  You asked me whether I knew anyone else, and it is at that point that I, somehow, referred to another official, another authority.  Now, if I were to provide explanations to you regarding the statement of 2005, I will need to spend a lot of time here to get you to understand what transpired.  And it is from my mouth that those words were spoken, that is that reference was made to another authority who made a statement of incitement.  You are not the one who initiated that statement.  So, I would rather you put questions to me about the statement of 2003.  

Now, about the 2005 statement, please, ask those questions to me later on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are now before the Trial Chamber.  The statements that you made to authorities before coming to the Trial Chamber is not the evidence on which we are going to judge this case.  There might be some form of reference, but the evidence upon which we read and judge on this case is the evidence given before our Court.  Now, the questions that you are asked, even if they might have some sort of connection to the statements that you made before, it is not the statement that you made before that is material to us.  We want to know what you have to say in this Chamber.  The question that has been put to you is a very direct and straightforward question.  We think it follows directly from things that you have already said, and the answer is required by us to do our work in adjudging this matter.  So, I have to ask you to answer the question.
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, can you tell us approximately when was the interview that you claim Nzirorera gave over RTLM?  We know it was in 1994.  We know it was after the death of the president, but approximately when?  
A.	It was in the month of April as well. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately how long after the death of the president was it? 
A.	Perhaps a week after the death of the president.  Not more than that. 
Q.	Now, I'm going to leave this for the moment while we see if your statement of 6 September 2005 is in existence and can be located.  I want to ask you a different topic now.  

Can you tell us whether or not you ever saw Mathiu Ngirumpatse in the year 1994?
A.	I saw Mathiu Ngirumpatse in Gisenyi in 1993.  In 1994 I saw him at the Nyamirambo regional stadium in January at a rally, an important rally organised by the MRND. 
Q.	And you yourself attended this rally in January 1994 of the MRND in Nyamirambo stadium? 
A.	Yes, I attended it, but I arrived late. 
Q.	And what was your reason for attending this rally? 
A.	I attended it.  Now, as to why I attended it, it was for personal reasons. 
Q.	Well, you were a member of the CDR party, you were living in Gisenyi, and you were attending an MRND rally in Kigali.  Can you tell us the nature of those personal reasons which caused you to be at that meeting? 
A.	I did not intend to attend that MRND rally.  It is just that I plied my business; I would ***************from my region or secteur to Kigali, just as I would do the same trip to Gisenyi.  Now, on that day, upon my arrival in Kigali, I noticed that the atmosphere was tense or heated.  There was talk of an MRND rally being organised in Nyamirambo.  It was said it was an exceptional meeting or rally because of the presence of one Mugenzi of the PL who also took part in the rally, and therefore, even nonmembers of the MRND were drawn, curious about the situation, because it was quite unusual to see Mugenzi aligning himself with the MRND.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you noticed --
MR. ROBINSON:
I didn't notice but I had an idea.  Let's see how it goes to my next question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, do you want to continue with this line?  
MR. ROBINSON:
In an oblique way, but I'm almost finished with this line.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, have you told anyone from the Office of the Prosecutor prior to today that you attended the meeting in January 1994 of the MRND in the Nyamirambo stadium? 
A.	No.  I haven't told anyone else.  If my memory serves me right, I have told no one else. 
Q.	Did you attend any other meetings of the MRND that you haven't told us about?  

MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I'm not quite sure what the Court's concerns were a few minutes ago, but the reason that we are in this area of the witness's testimony is because of an open-ended question that was put to him.  Now I have no objection to the open-ended question.  The witness can answer based on his recollection, and I assume we'll be able to deal with his evidence as it develops, but if Mr. Robinson is concerned or any of the other Accused are concerned about evidence coming forth in this trial that was not mentioned in the pre-trial brief or disclosures, then they should be very careful with the way they ask their questions.  So I'm just making that comment, but we expect to go back to this very issue in redirect.  So Mr. Robinson should take great care in how he elicits the evidence if he doesn't want to deal with it in re-direct examination.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, since I'm not going to have the opportunity for re-cross-examination, I probably should take a different tact that I was intending to take with respect to the -- my remaining questions in the meeting.  We know the content of the meeting.  So we have recordings of it, so I'm not concerned about eliciting evidence damaging to any of the Accused, but I am concerned about information that seems to be growing from that which was disclosed to us earlier.  And so I'm prepared to forge ahead, and I understand the risks.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So my question was whether there were any other meetings of the MRND that you attended that you haven't told us about? 
A.	Another rally took place in June, that was in June, if I remember well, it was in the month of May or June, and I don't quite remember.  It was in 1994, still.  On that day there was need to collect financial contributions to assist the soldiers. 
Q.	And did this take place in Gisenyi? 
A.	Yes, at the MRND headquarters in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Was it the MRND headquarters or the MRND palace from the time the MRND was a unique party? 
A.	The building was commonly referred to as "palace" -- the movement's palace, since "movement" was the first word in the abbreviation for the word the MRND.  So it was known as "the palace of the movement." 
Q.	And at this meeting of May or June in 1994 when financial contributions were being sought, did you see any of the Accused: Ngirumpatse, Karemera, or Nzirorera? 
A.	People were jostling at the time to give their financial contributions.  I did not see any of the three Accused -- at the time there was jostling.

1700H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you see Mathieu Ngirumpatse at any meetings organised by the CDR party?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you ever tell investigators Fadila Tidjani, T-I-D-J-A-N-I, that you saw Mathieu Ngirumpatse in a meeting which had been organised by the CDR party on the 8th of April 1994, a meeting at which militiamen were incited to work well? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, turning to the rally of January 1994 in Nyamirambo stadium, did you hear the speech given by Mathieu Ngirumpatse on that occasion? 
A.	There was a lot of noise as people applauded, so I did not pay attention.  We heard some words, but one cannot tell you of the content of the speech based on the few words that were heard. 
Q.	Now, did you see Joseph Nzirorera at any time in 1994? 
A.	Where would I have seen him, Counsel?  
Q.	Well, did you see him at the meeting in Nyamirambo stadium in January 1994? 
A.	The stadium was full at the time.  There were a lot of party cadres and even cadres from the PL.  As a result one could not see the authorities -- the officials.  The place was crowded.  Many people entered the stadium but were not even able to hear what was said. 
Q.	So I take it you did not see Joseph Nzirorera on that occasion? 
A.	I'm telling you of what I saw.  I say I arrived late.  There was a lot of noise.  And so I was not in a position to notice whether Nzirorera had arrived, whether he was there or not.  I cannot confirm it. 
Q.	Did you see him in Gisenyi at all in 1994? 
A.	In any event, Nzirorera was someone I knew very well.  The last time I saw him was as he crossed the border when he was heading to Congo.  That is when I saw him.  
Q.	Had you seen him in Gisenyi before that, after 6th April 1994? 
A.	I have just told you, I knew Nzirorera already, so that when I saw him, it was not on the occasion of a rally, except for 1993 when I told you I saw him at a rally in Gisenyi.  Otherwise, on other occasions I would see him -- like a person who would be moving through Gisenyi or Ruhengeri regions without any problems.  
Q.	Did you ever speak with Mr. Nzirorera in 1994? 
A.	No.  It's just that he was someone who was considered good natured and who would purchase beer for members of the public.  In that context I would see him. 
Q.	And did he ever purchase beer for you? 
A.	He would not buy it for people who he knew.  Everyone knew he was in the habit of doing it.  When you saw a vehicle filled with crates of beer, he would pay for it for members of the public to consume it.  However, he did not necessarily know the names of the people who drank the beer. 
Q.	And did you ever hear Mr. Nzirorera speaking other than on the radio?  Did you ever -- were you ever in his presence when he spoke? 
A.	I have just told you I knew him.  As to what he said, one would not recall.  He may have made -- one may recall what was said at rallies, but not what was said in conversation. 
Q.	Were you ever present when Mr. Nzirorera was having a conversation with other people? 
A.	I never spoke to Mr. Nzirorera, but I saw him speaking to other people. 
Q.	And where was that? 
A.	A long time ago, and it happened on many occasions from 1998 during electoral campaigns, 
	'83 -- a long time ago.  
Q.	Between the period 1991 through the time you went into exile in 1994, did you have any conversations with Mr. Nzirorera or did you hear him in conversations with others? 
A.	This is what happened: I saw him as he was speaking to other people.  As for the rest, you have not seen any mention in my statement to the effect that I heard what he said in the course of those conversations.  I think we should stop at that.  
Q.	Did the investigators from the Prosecution ask you if you'd ever heard any comments or statements by Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	They did not ask me questions about that.  
Q.	Now, I want to turn your attention to the events at Mudende university.  You were there on the 7th, the 8th, the 9th and the 10th; is that correct? 
A.	That is true.  Once again, we are dealing with an issue dealt with previously, and I thought I had given sufficient explanations on that question.  
Q.	Well, you've given those explanations to the Prosecutor, but now it's my turn to ask you about those events, and we haven't discussed those before.  Is it your testimony that the massacre at 
	Mudende university took place on the 9th of April, after Anatole Nsengiyumva had arrived? 
A.	Yes, that is my testimony.  What is more, I did not just explain it to the Prosecutor.  I think there was even mention of someone killed on the 8th.  This is a piece of paper on which a name is written.  This concerns the events of the 8th.  I was asked about the circumstances under which I'd left my house, the people killed -- or person killed.  I think even the Judges would remember this.  I talked about these events and I was not merely addressing the Prosecutor.  You were also included in those explanations.  
Q.	But it's your testimony that the attack on the people at Mudende university in which the soldiers came in a bus and began shooting at the people took place on the 9th of April; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And it was only after Anatole Nsengiyumva have -- had arrived that that massacre began, correct? 
A.	Yes, it was following his departure. 
Q.	Now, Witness XBM, you gave that testimony during the trial of Colonel Nsengiyumva.  And after you came and testified, there were two witnesses who came and testified for the Defence.  The first one testified with the pseudonym of YD1 and the second one with a pseudonym LK2.  And each of them testified that there were no attacks at Mudende university after the 8th of April, and one of them, LK2, was a gendarme officer who was present.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	It depends on the nature or identity of the witness and his motives for saying that, but I was not present when they gave testimony.  I do not even know their exact identity.  Therefore, it would be difficult for me to accept or lend credence to their testimony.  People were killed, buried.  I think that my testimony on its own is not sufficient.  People who live in the area surrounding Mudende can testify, which would reinforce the statements made by those people, together with my own.  
Q.	And, Witness XBM, isn't it true that the massacres at Mudende university were not carried out by soldiers from the Gisenyi ops but were carried out by members of the population, including Burundian students and wounded soldiers? 
A.	I never said those soldiers came from the ops Gisenyi.  Actually, they came from the ops Tamira ISAR.  They came aboard a bus.  Now, regarding the incidents regarding Burundian students, it happened in 1992.  The situation was pacified in -- and it continued in 1993, which led to the dispatching of gendarmes, who would intervene whenever the problem arose again.  So following the president's death, President Habyarimana, it should not be said that Burundian students killed their fellow Burundian students.  No, that is not it.  It should not be taken that way.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could you have the witness repeat his identification of the soldiers, because I didn't get that in the translation, where the soldiers had come from?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you repeat the place where the soldiers came from, according to you? 
A.	They came from the ISAR, ISAR Tamira. 
Q.	And can you spell that, Tamira? 
A.	T-A-M-I-R-A. 
Q.	Now, I'm going to read you a passage from a book called Leave None to Tell the Story.  It was published by Human Rights Watch.  It's author was a woman by the name of Alison Des Forges.  
MR. ROBINSON:
This is document number 11 in my packet of exhibits, but since it's in English, I'll just read it to the witness.  And it's at the bottom of 2 -- page 209, and talks about events occurring after the 7th of April 1994.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	It says:  "A large crowd, including Burundian students and wounded soldiers, took on the task of massacring hundreds of people at the campus of the Seventh Day Adventist university at Mudende to the east of Gisenyi town."  

Now, Witness XBM, is that information by Human Rights Watch and Alison Des Forges wrong?  
A.	It is hard to answer the -- that question.  It depends on their informants.  You are asking me to say if Alison Des Forges is providing false information.  I was not -- she was not present, rather, and obtained information from third parties.  The question, actually, should be why her informants gave her such information.  Moreover, Alison Des Forges has often been challenged when she makes statements or writes books or works that are published.  Very often the information is contested.  I don't know what else I can say. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, on the 8th of April there was a former bourgmestre named Ndabarinze who was killed; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And that's number 59 on the spelling list. 

Were you present when he was killed?  
A.	No.  I heard about it. 
Q.	There were also people killed on the 8th of April at a place called Busasamana.  That's B-U-S-A-S-A-M-A-N-A.  Were you present at those killings? 
A.	I wasn't there either.  I heard about those killings. 
Q.	I want to ask you about a meeting that occurred in Gisenyi that you've testified about before and you've placed it in May of 1994 in which a helicopter had arrived and people participated in a meeting involving Colonel Bagosora.  Do you recall that meeting? 
A.	It was in May and (unintelligible). 
Q.	Do you recall about what part of May that meeting took place? 
A.	Around the 24th or 25th of that month. 
Q.	And is there any particular reason how you recall those days -- dates? 
A.	What I'm telling you is that it was around the 25th, but I have no special reason that can guide me as to the date.  So all I am attempting to do is to recollect and assign a date to that meeting as best I can. 
Q.	And who was it who had come in the helicopter, as far as you know? 
A.	The helicopter landed at the camp, and it was difficult to know who had come aboard the helicopter, but later on, people found out.  Information circulated and people knew under what circumstances he had arrived.  But no one knew who was aboard the helicopter at the time it landed at the camp. 
Q.	But as you sit here now, who do you believe arrived in that helicopter? 
A.	It was said that he was the one who had arrived, but I did not see him alight from the helicopter because the helicopter landed within the military camp.  And as soon as the helicopter had arrived, a meeting held promptly thereafter, and then people understood that it is Bagosora who was -- who had arrived in that helicopter. 
Q.	And at this meeting I believe you told us that there were no politicians present, only soldiers, as far as the authorities were concerned.  Is that correct? 
A.	No, that -- that is not the case.  And that is not what is written in the -- in the documents.  Apart from him and Anatole, the others in attendance were youth and soldiers. 
Q.	And it's your testimony that you observed Colonel Bagosora give 500,000 Rwandan francs to Omar Serushago, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And at the time, that would be equivalent to more than $5,000?  
A.	I did not quite understand your question, Counsel.  
Q.	In 1994, do you know approximately what the rate of exchange was between Rwandan francs and US dollars? 
A.	No, I had no idea.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, was it your understanding that this money was given to Omar Serushago to purchase uniforms? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, Witness XBM, I'll put it to you that Omar Serushago has provided many, many hours of statements to the Office of the Prosecutor in this case and has never once indicated that he received any money from Colonel Bagosora.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	Well, one can remember many events and forget some, so put the question to him and he will talk to you about it.  Maybe he embezzled that money and used it for his own personal purposes. 
Q.	Well, you told us the money was given to him in front of 500 people, didn't you? 
A.	Oh, yes.  Yes, that is true.  That's correct. 
Q.	And I put to you, Witness XBM, that at the time of this alleged meeting Colonel Bagosora was not even in Rwanda, but was, in fact, in Kinshasa.  Do you have any comments to make to that? 
A.	Well, it is a good thing that you talked about Congo.  I was afraid you might refer to another country.  Well, maybe he had come from -- from Congo, or maybe he went to Congo after that meeting.  What I know is that I saw him on the 25th.  

Now, concerning documents, I do not know how he comes into possession of -- of documents.  In order to try to avoid these allegations, I know that it is the government of Congo which granted exile to them, and I am sure that the government can issue all manner of documents to justify whatever evidence they want to tender. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have one more area that I'm going to go into, apart from the issue of the radio interview by Mr. Nzirorera.  So would you like to take a break now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we'll take the adjournment now. 

Mr. Robinson, we are -- we are not going to get an answer to your question on the medical condition of Serugendo tomorrow morning. 
We'll take the adjournment.  
(Court adjourned at 1730H)
