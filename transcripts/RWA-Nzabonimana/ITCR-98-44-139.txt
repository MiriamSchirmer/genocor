MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you commence the -- open the proceedings please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.

Mr. Hooper, we had hoped to see Mr. O'Shea this morning.  What is his condition?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I spoke to him this morning, and I asked him not to come, so he didn't. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  But his condition is --  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, he seemed well.  He has got -- he seemed well treated and well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we are about to resume your testimony this morning.  I should let you know that you will be giving evidence under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began; do you understand?

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper will continue his question. 

Mr. Hooper.  

MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, thank you.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Can I come to that part of the evidence that you told us about yesterday that the Abakiga, you told us, were Rwandans from Byumba who had come to your region, you told us, fleeing the war.  And it would be right to say that they had settled in very large numbers in and around Gikomero commune, in many thousands of numbers; is that right? 
A.	Before answering your questions, I would beg you to tell me how many questions you are going to put to me so that I prepare myself to answer them, inasmuch as I have noted that you are -- that you are of a nature to tire me.  And how many questions do you have?  
Q.	Well, can I give you an approximate figure of about 28; is that all right?   It is only approximate though. 
A.	I will make the calculations, if it is 28 I will stop and I won't answer any more, and I would beg you not to repeat the same questions. 
Q.	Now, are you going to answer my questions this morning, or are you going to evade them? 
A.	I am not afraid; I shall answer your questions.  But I'm not very well, I don't feel very well, but I will answer your questions. 
Q.	And I don't think this will count as one of my questions, but why aren't you feeling well today? 
A.	I told you I am sick, even yesterday I said so.  Even at this moment I am speaking to you I have just seen the doctor.  I am starting to count.  That was the first question. 
Q.	Yes.  So have you come along to amuse us this morning? 
A.	I have come to testify. 
Q.	And you told us that the massacres in Kayanga started on the 13th of April.  And you told us that the day they started attacking people -- and this is my note when you were talking quickly, "the Abakiga went towards the Rutunga trading centre."  And we know where that is.  "And they came back with a sizeable number of refugees.  And Nyarwaya," N-Y-A-R-W-A-Y-A," shot in the air and said, 'You may begin.'  And the killings started." Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	And then you said, "The order was given by Nyarwaya but there had been a meeting, a secret meeting the day before."  You didn't take part in it, but a neighbour told you about it.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And, incidentally, who is the neighbour?  Is he still alive today? 
A.	Listen, he is not even my neighbour.  It is you who invented that he was my neighbour.  He was a conseiller.  And he was a conseiller at Rutunga -- in Rutunga, and that person is no longer alive. 
Q.	I think it was you who described him as a neighbour yesterday.  My note reads:  "I know because a conseiller, a neighbour, told us that whoever told what was said or done would be the first to be killed." But anyway, this chap is dead, isn't it, so we can't go to speak to him about what you say he told you.  That is right, isn't it? 
A.	I think you are mixing up what I said to you yesterday with what I am saying now. 
Q.	When Nyarwaya, the brigadier, the gendarmerie brigadier shot in the air and said, "you can begin,"  where was he when he shot in the air? 
A.	He was at the Rutunga marketplace. 
Q.	And were you there? 
A.	No, I wasn't. 
Q.	Now, let's go back to Kamuhanda -- oh, before I do that, I have forgotten to ask you something.  You were hidden and protected for part of a night by a man called Mukombe; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And he was a Hutu; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now he is dead, isn't he? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And I think you know how he died, don't you?  Can you tell us? 
A.	I don't know the circumstances of his death. 
Q.	I suggest that is not true.  I suggest that you were there when he was killed. 
A.	For the Court to accept your truth you have to prove that you were present there.  You continue accusing me of having killed people in Byumba.  I went to seek refuge in Byumba and on my return I learned that people had been killed, but not the circumstances under which they were killed or they had died. 
Q.	And how is it that you have not managed to discover the circumstances of how someone -- for example, Mukombe who protected you, how is it that you haven't been able to discover the circumstances of his death? 
A.	I don't know why you put such a question to me.  You must be doing it on purpose.  You know that there was a war.  And when there is war, there are belligerents on both sides.  How can I explain that, when I wasn't present?  
Q.	Have you heard that there were any Hutus who were killed by the Inkotanyi in April and May of 1994 in your area?  Have you ever heard of that? 
A.	I heard that there were -- there was fighting between the Interahamwe and the Inkotanyi.  And when bullets are flying around, Inkotanyi die, Interahamwe die, and the lucky ones, perhaps, will survive. 
Q.	So you heard, in fact, in Gikomero the Interahamwe confronted the RPF, the Inkotanyi, and fought with them; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is what I heard.  That is what happened. 
Q.	Have you learned or heard that in your area old people, women and children were also killed by the Inkotanyi, RPF; have you heard of that? 
A.	No, I did not. 
Q.	Have you ever heard of these two places where I suggest there were camps where Hutus were concentrated, one was called Makagote, M-A-K-A-G-O-T-E, and the other was called Cyaruhara, C-Y-A-R-U-H-A-R-A?  Have you heard of any of those places?  
A.	You are the first person to speak to me of those two places, I don't know them. 
Q.	Well, Makagote is but a valley, is it not, in Kayanga that runs down towards Lac Muhazi.  It is a        place -- you know that place very well, don't you? 
A.	The two names that you have pronounced do not exist there, otherwise, I know the Muhazi valley.  And if you hear that those two names don't exist in that region, would you accept that someone has lied to you, that someone has given -- been feeding you false information?  
Q.	Well, my pronunciation, fortunately, passes through the mouth of a Rwandese or the Kinyarwanda-speaking interpreter.  But even so, you don't recognise the name Makagote;is that right? 
A.	I told you that I don't know Makagote. 
Q.	And you have not learned or heard of an attack on the 15th of May in the Kayanga area on a concentration of Hutu men, women and children, where many hundreds were killed?  You never heard of that; is that right? 
A.	I never learned of that.  Why would the Hutu have gathered together there?  The Hutus were in their houses.  They had no reason to fear.  Why should they have gathered together in a camp?  
Q.	And you weren't one of those local Tutsis who participated in that killing, or were you? 
A.	Could you repeat that question, please, Counsel?  I should like you to repeat that question so that I fully comprehend it. 
Q.	Let me repeat it and rephrase it:  Did you, perhaps as an act of revenge, participate in the killing of innocent Hutus? 
A.	You are repeating practically the same thing.  I told you I am not a killer.  I did not seek               revenge -- vengeance.  I have the same neighbours, the ones I left are still there.  They are still my neighbours in the vicinity of my house.  Who told you that I was one of the killers?  
Q.	Is Kamanzi out of prison now? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Can I come back to Kamuhanda.  And this is the last matter or matters that I'm going to ask you about.  We visited this subject yesterday, and you gave evidence of being, as a Tutsi, and known in the area as a Tutsi, sitting at the bar at Damien or Daniel's, whichever name it was, when                                    Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda was handing out grenades and guns to Interahamwe, you sat there and you noted all of that.  That was your evidence.  Now, in the course of what you saw and heard, you gave evidence that Kamuhanda said this: "He told them that they were going to use those weapons to kill the Tutsi so that the Hutu majority would come and wonder what a Tutsi looked like."  Is that right, is that something you heard him say?  
A.	Where did you get this name of Daniel from?  I never mentioned Daniel. 
Q.	Well, there are two names that appear in the transcript; one is Damien and the other is Daniel.  Which one is it, this bar where you said you were at?  It doesn't really matter, just for the record. 
A.	It was Damien's drinking place.  I think you are embroidering. 
Q.	All right, Damien's drinking place, did you hear Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda say the words that I have just read to you? 
A.	Yes, I heard him say that. 
Q.	Now, I would like to come to your statement that you gave in the Kamuhanda case, which the Judges have.  And this was the statement that you made, and is dated the 29th of June 1999, so almost exactly six years ago.  Now when you made that statement would I be right in suggesting that the events that they relate, or you relate in the statement, were fresher in your memory then than they are today?  
A.	That is not correct, and moreover, you are not capable of speaking the truth.  I already noted that. 
Q.	Well, it is what you say that we are interested in, sir, not what I say.  So your memory is better now than it was six years ago, is that what you are saying? 
A.	Do you think I have been getting any younger?  I haven't been getting any younger. 
Q.	Well, just listen carefully, please, to the question I put to you a moment ago, and I will repeat it.  Would it be fair to say that your memory of events in 1994 was fresher and, therefore, better, in 1999 then it is now, a full six years later?  
A.	That is not a question to put to me.  If you have questions, put them.  I think you are dragging out the proceedings.  If you have questions to put to me, put them to me. 
Q.	Well, that was a question.  Can you answer it, please? 
A.	No, that is not a question. 
Q.	Well, I think the best way I can deal with this is to read your statement.  And you will bear in mind, as I do so, that the Prosecutor, who, to an extent, can look after your interest, also has the statement.  So if I put anything that is wrong or not balanced, that can be corrected in due course.  So I just want you to read -- to listen to what I say as I read from your statement.   It is the fourth paragraph in GAC 4 in English, and the third paragraph on GAC 8 in the French.

"It's in the prevailing climate of uncertainty, though I cannot give an exact date, but it was between the 8th and the 13th of April 1994 when the massacres commenced in our secteur that I met                 Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda at Kayanga trading centre." And you then relate how he was accompanied by a soldier and three civilians.  And that "While you were drinking bear at Damien's place in Kayanga trading centre, Kamuhanda called Damien and instructed him to bring the Inkotanyi in Kayanga so he could give them weapons."  You go on to say that, "Damien asked Kamuhanda if the distribution of weapons would not have disastrous consequences.  And Kamuhanda replied that there would not be any, adding that he had just distributed weapons at Rutunga, Ndaruka and the trading centre in Kayanga centre."  Just pausing there, is what you say in your statement, according to you, correct?  
A.	It is correct.
Q.	You then go on to specify, by name, seven people who received weapons directly from him.  And then over the page, at page GAC 5 it reads: "After the distribution, the people present asked Kamuhanda if they were to start work immediately.  The term "work" meant to kill the Tutsis.  He asked them to wait for the signal and the scheduled date.  He then left for Kayanga secteur, where I gathered he distributed the machete to the people -- he distributed machetes to the people."  Now, again, is that correct, sir? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So, there is your weapons distribution episode that you witnessed, or claim you did, in the bar, Damien's bar, with Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda.  And he disappears.  And you don't mention him again, and you don't see him again; is that right? 
A.	It is correct. 
Q.	And you end with that note that he left for Kayanga secteur, where you gathered he distributed machetes to the people.  Now, we come to the point that I'm interested in.  You say, "There had been distributions of machetes before that."  And there is a word left out of the English, but it's in the French, which is the original text, and that is -- it is the statement that you signed -- and that is at page GAC 9.  And there it reads, That before there had been another distribution of machetes, and then the next sentence is ((French spoken), which in English, I believe, is "thus".  

So, let's go back to the English and get a more accurate sense, as I understand it, of what this means.  "There had been distributions of machetes before that.  Thus, one night" -- so here now you are giving an example of how you knew it, how you knew there had been a distribution of machetes -- "Thus one night I was in a bar in Ntaruka centre, and somebody one called Etienne Kamanzi joined me there.  He was carrying a brand new machete and said this to me.  "You are Tutsi, what are you doing here?".  There was a minor argument and I tried to seize his machete, and we left the issue at that.  Etienne then asked the Hutu customers if they had received machetes.  They said they had not.  Etienne then informed them that machetes were being distributed at the Kayanga secteur office."  

Then you go on to say, "Refugees arrived on the 12th of April at the secteur office.  They came from Gasogi. They told you of massacres in their area, and they went on the Gishaka.  And a Tutsi called Seyanga (phonetic) is killed, the first one, I think.  And then you say, "The massacres of Tutsi started in our area on the 13th of April 1994 and went on until the 16th of April 1994; and is all of that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is correct. 
Q.	Right.  So it is in your statement of 1999 you refer to Kamuhanda's distribution of weapons that you witnessed, but you say that there had been distribution of weapons before that, and as a basis for your belief that that is so, you talk about Etienne Kamanzi and the incident at the bar, and how Etienne informs people that there is a distribution at the secteur office; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	No mention of Rwamakuba there, is there?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know if there was an answer to that.
MR. HOOPER:
It's more as a comment as a question.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me also put this:  It is obvious from your statement that the incident with Kamanzi was before any distribution of weapons by Kamuhanda.  That is obvious from the context in the way that your statement reads.  And that is right, isn't it, on your story that precedes it? 
A.	No, it is not. 
Q.	And if we couple this with your stated position which was that that incident with Kamanzi, with his brand new machete, the argument with you, and his telling people that there were machetes at the secteur office -- you told us yesterday that that was the last time you saw Kamanzi; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	But you also told us yesterday that that was the night before the massacres started; is that right? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Your story doesn't hang; it doesn't fit, does it? 
A.	You are trying to confuse me with the various events, but what I am saying holds water. 
Q.	And my 28th question:  Why is it, if you are giving this as the example, or the basis of your knowledge that there had been a distribution of machetes, and you are talking about Kamanzi.  Why is it that there is no mention of --  Kamanzi stood by the side of the road with a minister of the government called Rwamakuba with bags of machetes handing them out to the Abakiga; is it because you haven't thought of that story when you made this statement, because I suggest that is exactly what happened.  
A.	I'm not fabricating anything.  Counsel, I understand you, you are doing this deliberately.  What you are aiming for is to destroy my testimony that is clear.  It is clear that this incident took place.  It is not only the -- the people I have mentioned who provided weapons, other ones did.  Some were in my statement.  It is written that machetes were distributed.  And somewhere else it is said that their were other distributions of machetes, so I don't see what your problem is. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
A.	Thank you, too. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence is not yet over.  You will have to answer a few other questions from the Prosecutor.  Do you understand?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry, Mr. President, I have been neglectful again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Before I sit down -- well, stand up in order to conclude by seeking to submit exhibits, both statements in both languages of this witness.  But --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have the documents?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Apparently we do, I think. 

So the first matter would be his statement of the 29th of June '99 in English and French, marked GAC 2 to GAC 11.  And if that could be exhibit --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence, exhibit?  
MR. FRY:
D. 33A and B, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. 33A and D. 33B admitted)
MR. HOOPER: 
D. 34, can be this witness's statement of the 8th of November 2004, again, in both English and French -- just one moment, yes, A and B, 34A and B.

In terms of transcripts, we have CD of GAC's transcripts, but can I move those into evidence at a slightly later date, because they have been combined with the next witness.  And --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Niane --  
MR. NIANE:
No, Mr. President, I have no objection.  
MR. HOOPER: 
So, I will reserve that until just a little later.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Niane, do you have any questions in re-examination?  
MR. NIANE:
Yes, Mr. President.  Good morning, Mr. President.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	I would just like to come back to the few points which were raised during the cross-examination.  These points will only refer to the accused, Rwamakuba, which is why we are here today.  Witness, you mentioned a secret meeting which was held in Kamanzi's home and about which the former conseiller of Rutunga secteur, who is now dead, told you.  
A.	This meeting did not take place in Kamanzi's home, the meeting did actually take place, but not in Kamanzi's house. 
Q.	What did the conseiller of the secteur say to you exactly? 
A.	This meeting brought together the conseillers and the workers of the commune.  The meeting took place in Nduba.  This conseiller used to tell us -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm not entirely sure how this properly arises in re-examination.  This witness has not been asked about any content of this meeting at all. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know whether I am allowed to put the question, I have never seen the Prosecutor stand up to object when the Defence counsel was putting questions to me, so what is going on here. 
MR. NIANE:
I'm sorry, Mr. Hooper, but you did say in your cross-examination -- you mentioned a secret meeting which was held by Etienne Kamanzi.  And the witness answered that it is the now dead conseiller of the secteur who told me -- who told him about the meeting, because he himself was not present.

May I proceed, Mr. President?
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I'm just drawing -- making the point that, first of all, I didn't understand it to be at Kamanzi's at all.  My reference to it was a summary of his evidence in-chief in order to affect a chronology.  But the actual meeting itself has not been gone into at all.  And on that basis, I object to questions being asked at this stage about what happened in it that haven't been elicited in-chief.  And I do so, in particular, bearing in mind that I have had absolutely no notice of anything to do with that meeting and no will-say and no indication that it was even going to be touched on.  
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I repeat, that it was during the cross-examination that Mr. Hooper mentioned this secret meeting.  I never mentioned it in my examination-in-chief, and he is right about that.  It is he who brought it up.  So I would like to seek clarification on the matter. 

MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, it may be, I think, that perhaps Mr. Niane's recollection, perhaps, has led us to, perhaps, a misunderstanding between us.  But it was in examination-in-chief that this witness said "The order was given by Nyarwaya, but he had taken part in a meeting the day before where orders were issued.  Interahamwe, councilors and policemen took part, and they were ordered to not tell who had issued the order or who gave them."  I didn't take part.  I know because a conseiller, a neighbour, told us that whoever told what was said or done would be the first to be killed."  That was all said in-chief.  It hasn't been gone into other than to refer to it as the secret meeting. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Niane, there are two matters which concern you.  It seems that we can't recollect that there was any previous discussions about the content of the meeting.  And we are also concerned about the absence of any prior disclosure as to what the witness -- the absence of any prior disclosure of the content of the meeting.  So we think that the content of the meeting is a new matter which should not be introduced in-chief, that what happened at the meeting is a new matter.  
MR. NIANE:
Understood, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry. 
MR. NIANE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Understood, Mr. President.  I shall move to the next question. 
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us exactly what you were told about the position occupied by André Rwamakuba when you saw the boy at the ceremony to lay the cornerstone for the school.  What exactly did you hear about the position occupied by Mr. André Rwamakuba? 
A.	He said that Faustin Munyanzesa was the minister of secondary education, and that he was in the company of André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Did he tell you what position Mr. André Rwamakuba occupied? 
A.	He told me that he worked in the ministry of health. 
(Pages 1 to 10 by Donna M. Lewis)









1000H 
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	We shall now return to the last time you saw Mr. André Rwamakuba, between the 10th and 11th of April.  Could you repeat to the Trial Chamber the circumstances under which you saw him for the last time?  
A.	I said that Rwamakuba went past us and that we were on the road.  A few moments later, we caught up with him; he was standing in front of Kamanzi's house.  They had already taken out a bag of machetes, and there is a lady called Anatalie who asked for six machetes for her Abakigas and she got these machetes.  We went on our way and these people -- we left these people there.  
Q.	Do you confirm that André Rwamakuba was, indeed, present when the lady received the machetes? 
A.	Yes, I do.  He was there.  
Q.	Thank you.  You referred to a rally in the school yard opposite the secteur office.  Can you confirm that when you talk about the secteur office and the school yard, you are referring to the same place?  
A.	Yes, it is the same place, I explained this.  I explained that there were the school buildings, then there was a piece of land of a hectare.  On the other side, there was a road and the secteur office was on the other side of the road.  So the road goes through the secteur office -- between the secteur office and the buildings that belonged to the school.  
MR. NIANE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no further questions in re-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Now, Mr. Witness, it's now about five minutes past 10, and your evidence has come to an end.  I thank you for coming to give evidence and you are now excused.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, and I wish you a nice day.  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, while the witness is being got, I am reminded that there is a need to clarify our -- to submit exhibits in relation to previous witnesses.  The first matter is the exhibits for Witness GIN, including a CD of transcripts - or, five CDs of transcripts, I think.  So, we are going to need -- I think they all have to go in, including the statements that we referred to -- introducing exhibits, but these relate to GIN, and as far as I know, no numbers has been given to any GIN exhibits yet.  I think the tick list has gone in, but the documents that are to go in are her statement of the 3rd of February 1998, under seal.  The English one there, which is A, and the French will be B -- that will be 35 at this stage, 35A and B; Witness GIN statement of 1998.  Investigators interview report dated 27th of March 2002, again, under seal, which should be D. 36.  Report with accompanying certificate, all dated 27th of 
May 2003, D.37, under seal; D.38 is the interview report dated 13th February 2004; D.39 is the Prosecutor's notice of additional evidence in the case of Karemera and Others, dated 23rd of April 2004.  D. 40 is a list of names under seal produced by Witness GIN in the case of 
Karemera and Others.  

Then I seek to move Exhibit D. 41, a photograph that was shown to GIN, which she did not seek or wish to recognise which was a photograph of purporting to show the secteur office at Gikomero secteur; and a photograph which purported to show the view taken from the secteur office looking back towards the Gikomero secteur trade centre, D. 42; and the CD will be -- of transcripts of GIN in the case of Karemera and Others, in the case of Kamuhanda on various dates reflecting her testimony in those cases, and that includes both open and in closed session material, and so it's under seal.  Insofar as the closed session testimony is concerned, and that is D.43.  Thank you.  

So, is that satisfactory, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
They are all admitted.  
(Exhibit Nos. D. 35A and D. 35B admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 36 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 37 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 38 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 39 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 40 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 41 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 42 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 43 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
And, Mr. Fry, the exhibit numbers are confirmed.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, the numbers are confirmed, and I wanted to ask a question about Exhibit 33A and B, and 34A and B, are those to be under seal, Your Honour?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registry, I agree.
(Exhibit No. D. 34A and D. 34B admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
That leaves two matters that we inquire about.  

Witness GLM produced a tick list, we believed, and so did Witness GII, and we understood that had gone into the registry, but it is not with them and we can't identify it.  And so, we inquire whether we can tender or produce a tick list for GLM and GII, which will conform with the evidence and will conform with the records that we will have, so that we have a physical exhibit in respect of that, and we will produce it and in discussion perhaps, with the Prosecution to a satisfactory extent?  We will produce a tick list indicating the witnesses -- that those two witnesses had respectively acknowledged as knowing in their evidence.  We won't do that now, we will do that once we have managed to reach an agreement with the Prosecution.  There is no point being -- there is no objection in principle to that course being followed.  
I understand that -- yes, thank you for reminding me.  The statements that have been put in for GAC are unredacted and should be under seal, which will be Exhibit 33A and B, will they?  Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Mr. Hooper.  It is so ordered.  
(Exhibit No. 33A and B admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, the next witness is available?  
MS. FALL:
The witness is waiting, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
(Declaration made by Witness GAB in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have just taken the oath to give evidence, and you will now be asked questions by the Prosecutor.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS GAB,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Madam. 
Q.	I shall begin with checking your identity.  You are a protected witness.  I will therefore be having a document shown to you that bears the particulars pertaining to your identity and you will then tell us whether the information is correct. 
MS. FALL:
Could the registry please assist?  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, do you see your name on this list?  
A.	Yes, I see my name on this document.  
Q.	And your date of birth?  
A.	Yes, I see it.  
Q.	Your nationality?  
A.	Yes, it is also correct.  
Q.	Do you see your ethnicity indicated here?  
A.	There is no problem with that; it is okay.
Q.	And your present occupation as indicated; is that correct?  
A.	No, that item is incorrect.  
Q.	Could you make the correction, please?  
A.	It is done.  
Q.	And the reference to what you were doing before in 1994; is it correct?  
A.	Yes, it is correct.  
Q.	And the information on this document concerning your place of birth and the place where you presently reside and the place where you resided in 1994, are those items correct?  
A.	Yes, no problem with any of that.  
Q.	Witness, please write down the date on that document, put the date and sign it.  

Witness, I think you told us that there was a mistake as regards your present occupation, but I do not see any correction.  Did you correct it or not?  
A.	I saw that my occupation in 1994 was indicated, but there was no room to indicate my present occupation, which is why I did not mention it.  
Q.	With the help of the registry, I ask you to correct the item which indicates your present occupation and put your correct present occupation, and I think the registry can help you to do that now.  
A.	Thank you very much.  
MS. FALL:
Registry, have you shown the document to the Defence?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.  

MS. FALL:
But I haven't moved yet, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)... or there is something else you needed to do?  
MS. FALL:
Well, I hadn't yet officially requested that it be placed -- that it be admitted as evidence and placed under seal and as Exhibit number 51, but that is why I wanted this to be explicit because I realised yesterday already that someone had said 15, which would be 15, and when I read the French transcript from yesterday, I did see P.15, so that is a correction that will have to be made to yesterday's transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, is that sufficient notification?  
MR. FRY:  
Okay.  The next Prosecution Witness (sic) is 51.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exhibit?
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, Exhibit number 51. 
(Exhibit No. P. 51 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, the Prosecutor has drawn attention to an error in the transcript of yesterday, is it sufficient notification to make it corrected?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, we will fix that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, have you ever testified before ICTR?  I am referring to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha.  
A.	Yes, I have testified before the ICTR. 
Q.	Can you tell us on what date, or if you can't, give us the precise date at what period of time?  
A.	I testified in 2001, that was the first time I was called and in the same year 2001, I also testified a second time before ICTR. 
Q.	Can you tell us in which trial you came to testify?  
A.	I testified in Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda's trial.  
Q.	Witness, have you testified before any court in Rwanda?  
A.	I testified before a Gacaca body by way of providing information, so I was providing information to the Gacaca judge.  
Q.	Can you tell us if at the present time you have provided information on certain people?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Would you be in a position to give us the names of those people?  
A.	If -- I can do it, if it does not place me at any risk.  
Q.	Witness, if you feel that this can place you at any risk, don't do it then.  
A.	I don't think there is any risk.  I have provided information and I do not see that there is any problem with my talking about them.  
Q.	If possible, could you please give us the names of the people about whom you provided some information?  
A.	I, first of all, provided information on André Rwamakuba and Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda.  I also mentioned Pascal Ndengejeho, I mentioned Martin Ndahiriwe.  Those are the main personalities about whom I gave information and about whom I had sufficient information to provide.  
Q.	Witness, did you meet the investigators of ICTR, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I did.  
Q.	Can you tell us where you met them?  
A.	We met in Rwanda, that is -- that is to say that they found me at home.  
Q.	If it is possible, can you tell us how many times you met the investigators of the Tribunal?  
A.	We met three times.  The first time was in 1999, and it was in connection with the Kamuhanda trial.  The second time, I met them at the end of 2004, and this was in connection with the André Rwamakuba case.  I met them a third time in the beginning of 2005.  On that occasion, I provided supplementary information on the Rwamakuba case.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think perhaps it would be a good time to take a small break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor.  

Mr. Witness, we will take a break for about 15 minutes, and then your testimony will resume.  
(Court recessed at 1036H) 
(Pages 11 to 16 by Sithembiso Moyo)
	





(Court resumed at 1115H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall, we can resume now. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, before the break I put a question to you in respect of your encounter with the ICTR investigators.  You told me that you'd met them three times.  The first time in connection with the Kamuhanda case and the two other times in connection with André Rwamakuba and his trial; is this correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Let me backtrack a bit. Your first meeting was in 1999 in connection with the Kamuhanda trial.  Did you, at that time, refer to André Rwamakuba, yes or no? 
A.	No, in my statement at that time I did not mention André Rwamakuba to the investigators.  The investigators questioned me with respect to Kamuhanda only. 
Q.	When you saw them again in respect of André Rwamakuba could you tell me rapidly?
A.	I did not understand your question.  
Q.	Let me put it to you again.  When you saw them again, as you have told us in connection with 
	André Rwamakuba, can you tell us under what circumstances it occurred? 
A.	At the end of 2004, I was interviewed by the investigators in connection with André Rwamakuba, in the André Rwamakuba dossier.  They put questions to me in connection with that dossier and I answered their questions.  I don't know if you want me to speak in greater detail as to the tenor of the interview. 
Q.	No, Witness, I just wanted to ask you under what circumstances they came to see you? 
A.	They came to see me and said they wanted to take my statement in respect of that person's conduct during the 1994 genocide. 
Q.	Do you know, Witness, why they came to see you personally? 
A.	I did not understand why they came to see me, but they asked me to explain what the Accused's conduct was and I explained to them. 
Q.	Witness, you told us that you saw them twice.  Did you make a statement? 
A.	Yes, I made a statement which was taken note of by the investigators. 
Q.	Did you sign that statement? 
A.	Yes, I signed it. 
Q.	Have you -- did you re-read or was that statement read to you before you signed it? 
A.	Before signing the statement, I myself tried to read it to the best of my knowledge, but the investigators also read it to me. 
Q.	And after it was read, did you make any changes to the statement? 
A.	I did not see any mistake in the statement. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, have you heard of André Rwamakuba -- have you heard him spoken of? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you -- can you tell us under what circumstances? 
A.	In fact, I knew him before I heard him talked of.  I heard him talked about at the ceremony where President Habyarimana was present and that was at the communal office and that's when I heard him spoken of. 
Q.	Could you tell us when that event took place? 
A.	It was before 1994, during the years preceding 1994. 
Q.	And can you tell us how you heard Rwamakuba spoken of on that occasion? 
A.	The pupils and the students had gone to do cheerleading for the president and other dignitaries who came to our commune, and that is when I heard André Rwamakuba spoken of. 
Q.	Was it the only time you heard him spoken of? 
A.	I heard him spoken of on that day, but as I told you, I knew him; I had already seen him physically. 
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances then you had already seen him? 
A.	I saw him when he came with the former minister, Faustin Munyanzesa on the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone at a place where they were building a primary school and I was a pupil at that school. 
Q.	Can you tell us at what period that was? 
A.	It was in 1992, but I do not remember the date or the month -- the day or the month. 
Q.	Can you specify which primary school we're talking about? 
A.	It was Rutunga primary school in Rutunga secteur and that is my place of birth, my home -- Rutunga secteur, which is rather the adjacent secteur to my home secteur --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the interpreter.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you told us that you were a pupil at that school.  How old were you at that time? 
A.	I was 15 at the time. 
Q.	And you do remember well what happened on that day? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	So you are telling us that you saw one André Rwamakuba in the company of the minister who was officiating at the ceremony.  Can you tell us the name of that minister? 
A.	Please forgive me, but you did not correctly repeat my answer.  I told you that on that occasion it was the laying of the keystone, the first stone -- foundation stone where they were going to build at Rutunga primary school.  It wasn't an inauguration as you seem to have just said. 
Q.	Well, thank you, Witness, for correcting me.  So who was officiating at the ceremony of the laying of the first stone or the foundation stone? 
A.	As regards that figure, it was Minister Faustin Munyanzesa who was, on that occasion, accompanied by André Rwamakuba who was there in his capacity as a native of that commune. 
Q.	Witness, you told us it was the first time that you saw him, so how did you know it was a person named André Rwamakuba? 
A.	We were students at that place and we had to receive our guests -- welcome our guests who had come to do something important for us.  We were called to assembly and we greeted the visitors beginning with the minister and, subsequently, Dr. André Rwamakuba was introduced to us as someone who was a native of Gikomero commune. 
Q.	Witness, in your answer you told us that he was introduced to you as Dr. André Rwamakuba.  Is that your recollection as to how he was introduced? 
A.	If my memory serves me right -- right, the minister was introduced first and then the members of his delegation and the name and function of each was -- and -- and they told us the name and function of each one.  That's how the introduction or presentation took place. 
Q.	Witness, did you know whether there were other figures of authority apart from the minister, 
	André Rwamakuba, at this ceremony? 
A.	On that day, no other figures of authority were introduced to us.  The two people whom I have mentioned were the highest authorities who came for the ceremony to lay the cornerstone. 
Q.	Apart from this instance, which you have just told us about, did you have any other opportunity to see the man named André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I saw him again in 1993; however, I no longer remember what month it was.  This was during a rally that was organised in Kayanga secteur, a rally of the MDR Power party. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us where the meeting to which -- the rally to which you are referring took place? 
A.	The rally took place in the Kayanga school yard or the yard of the Kayanga primary school and this school is next to the secteur office for Kayanga. 
Q.	Witness -- Witness, did you attend this rally? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	If you remember, can you tell us what the objective of this rally was? 
A.	The main objective of the rally, according to what was said, was to sensitise members of the MDR, Hutus in general, to the fact that their enemy was the Tutsi, the Tutsis who had attacked Rwanda. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, apart from the presence of André Rwamakuba, are you aware of the presence of any other figures of authority at this rally? 
A.	There were many figures of authority.  Rwamakuba was not the only personality that attended.  There were party representatives at secteur and commune level.  So Rwamakuba was not the only figure of authority who was present at this rally. 
Q.	Witness, do you know whether there were other representatives of other political parties apart from the members of the MDR? 
A.	I was just a bystander at this meeting, so I did not check to see whether there were representatives of other political parties.  Furthermore, I was not very much in the know as to political activities, so I did not seek to find out whether they were representatives of other political parties present. 
Q.	Witness, are you aware whether any speeches were made at this rally?  
A.	I heard a speech during which the authorities who were present at the rally were introduced.  After the introduction, the MDR Power representative said this, "Militants of MDR and Hutus in general, our enemy is the Tutsi who collaborate with the Inkotanyi."  When I heard these words, I felt myself to be under attack and I left immediately. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.  I'm not trying to slow you up too much, but I didn't get that last answer.  Couldn't write it down; it was too long to do so.  Could you repeat it for me, please?  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, would you be so kind to repeat your last answer. 
A.	I was asked whether any speech was made at this rally and I answered that at the rally the authorities who were present were introduced and the secteur representative for the MDR introduced the figures of authority who were present.  They included Rwamakuba and after he had done that he said this, "Militants of MDR Power and Hutus in general, it is the Tutsis who have attacked Rwanda and the Inyenzi- Inkotanyi" and, all the Tutsis who were there on that day, began to leave one by one.  That is when I myself left. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whether on that day at the rally André Rwamakuba took the floor? 
A.	I do not know whether he spoke or not.  When I heard them saying that the enemy was a Tutsi -- was the Tutsi, I immediately left. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whether after this rally there were incidents in your secteur? 
A.	There was conflict between the Hutus and the Tutsis because the Tutsis had just realised that they might be killed as this had been said in public.  So there was conflict between the Hutus and the Tutsis. 
Q.	After these two meetings that you have just told us about, Witness, did you have occasion to see 
	André Rwamakuba again? 
A.	I saw André Rwamakuba during the 1994 massacres and I cannot forget this occasion; I saw him in 1994. 
Q.	Witness, before we dwell on the circumstances under which you saw Mr. Rwamakuba for the third time, let me ask you this.  Would you be able to recognise André Rwamakuba if you were to see him again? 
A.	Yes, I can recognise him, this is someone I know. 
Q.	Now, to return to the circumstances of the third time you saw him, can you tell the Trial Chamber how you saw him for the first time?  "Him" is actually André Rwamakuba, of course.
A.	After the massacres began in Gikomero commune -- actually, the massacres began on the 
	12th of April 1994 in Gikomero commune. They began in Gishaka parish in Gikomero commune.  There were refugees, many refugees who had sought shelter at this place and these refugees were killed. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I shall ask you to slow down a little to enable the Defence to take notes and we'll take it in stages, if you may.  So you are telling us that it was during the massacres that occurred in Gishaka parish in Gikomero; is that what you said? 
A.	Yes, that's what I said. 
Q.	So can you tell us on what date these massacres took place? 
A.	The massacres began on the 12th of April 1994, in Gishaka parish. 
Q.	Witness, did you say the 12th of April 1994 at the parish?  How come you can give us such a precise date? 
A.	The reason why I cannot forget this date is that my mother and my four younger brothers had sought refuge at this parish and were killed there.  That is why I will never forget the date. 
Q.	Do you know whether there were many people who had sought refuge at this parish? 
A.	Many people had sought refuge at the parish.  There were Tutsis who had come from various communes of Kigali-rural and who met people who had come from Gikomero.  So there were many different people from many different places who met at the parish. 
Q.	Witness, were you present when the massacres took place at the parish? 
A.	I was not there but there were refugees who survived the massacres at the parish and I heard them say what had happened at this place, and when I -- and when I tried to find out where my mother and younger brothers had been killed, I learnt that they had been killed at that parish. 
Q.	Witness, in one of your answers you told the Court that refugees and Tutsis had been massacred.  Are you aware, whether apart from the Tutsis, there were other people of different ethnic origin at the parish? 
A.	Actually, there were many people who were seeking refuge at that time, but most of them were Tutsis.  Even if there were people of different ethnic origin, they were a minority. 
Q.	Now, let us come to your "meeting" with Rwamakuba.  Can you tell us the exact circumstances of this meeting? 
A.	When the massacres began in our secteur on the 13th of April 1994, I was supposed to go and herd the cows that were at home.  So in the morning, at about 8 o'clock my father came to meet me in the field where I was with the cows and he said to me, "The massacres have started in our secteur.  They have started burning houses; they have begun to kill people. You must be strong and fend for yourself because our fate is sealed."  At about 2 p.m. --
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry --
THE WITNESS:
An Interahamwe called Frederick Munyandamutsa -- 
MR. HOOPER:
This is significant evidence and I'm trying to keep a full note of it.  Could you control the Witness, Madam Prosecutor, so that I can keep pace with that.  I got as far as "You told me the massacres had started in our secteur."  Thank you. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. Hooper, you will grant that I'm doing my absolute best.  I'm sorry that I cannot control the witness's speed of speech, so I am going to ask him again.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is for Mr. Hooper who is taking down what you're saying very slowly, so please take it easy so that we'll take it in stages.  So that Mr. Hooper can take his notes, I will ask you to take it very slowly so that we shall not be interrupted at every turn.  

So Witness, please resume from the point where you were talking about the day of 13th of April, which is, indeed, a very important one. 
A.	On the 13th of April in the morning, I was supposed to go and look after the family livestock.  At about 
	8 o'clock in the morning, my father came to meet me in the farm where I was herding the cows and said that the massacres had begun and that they had started burning houses.  And he said to me, "Everyone must seek refuge where he can.  The situation is very difficult; you must be strong." 
Q.	Mr. Witness, please catch your breath.  This will give Mr. Hooper the opportunity also to finish taking his notes. 
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	Yes, just a minute.  Mr. Hooper is not taking notes, he is consulting something or other.  Now, proceed, please. 
A.	At about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, an Interahamwe called Frederick Munyandamutsa came and told me, "It's all over for the Tutsis.  We're going to kill you now and eat your livestock."  I said nothing to him because I didn't see that anything else could be done. 
Q.	Proceed, please. 
A.	At night, I tried to hide along with other male children of the family, including Kaganzwa.  We tried to hide in the sorghum fields while heading for the centre of Kayanga. 
Q.	Witness, please, don't take it too quickly.  We can do this in stages, so we shall come back to the Interahamwe whose name is Munyandamutsa, if I noted it correctly, who threatened you.  Witness, did you know this person before? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
Q.	So Witness, you're telling us that they had started burning houses and you had been warned that they were killing Tutsis.  How come this gentleman didn't kill you? 
A.	It is thanks to the good Lord that I survived.  I could see the houses burning and he said that it was all over for us, and he added that they would take our livestock.  I found that he was mostly interested in our cows.  Thanks to the good Lord, I was able to escape this -- these threats. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Munyandamutsa is spelt M-U-N-Y-A-N-D-A-M-U-T-S-A.  

BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So Witness, you said you went into the sorghum field with two other people.  Can you tell us who these people were? 
A.	I was with a young man called Nteganzwa Rubiyodogo (phonetic) and another gentleman called 
	Ferdinand Nsengiyumva.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Ntaganzwa is spelt N-T-A-G-A-N-Z-W-A.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us where these people are? 
A.	These people were killed at the health centre. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nsengiyumva is spelt N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you told us that you went into hiding, but you weren't told Kayanga centre (sic) -- Kayanga health centre.  Can you tell us when you arrived at the health centre? 
A.	I got to the health centre at night.  I did not note the time when I arrived at the health centre.  We weren't checking our watches because we were not sure of seeing the next day, but I did arrive at the health centre at night. 
Q.	When you arrived at the health centre, what did you see there? 
A.	When I arrived at the health centre, I saw the patients who were receiving treatment.  They included my four aunts and their children.  There were also many other refugees. 
Q.	Witness, did you meet your father there or not? 
A.	I didn't find him there.  I think that he too was trying to get to the health centre, hiding all the way, but unfortunately, he was caught and killed. 
Q.	When did you learn that your father had died? 
A.	I learnt the day after I arrived at the health centre. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what happened afterwards? 
A.	We spent the night at this place.  The next morning at about 8 o'clock, we saw the deputy director of the health centre, called Etienne Kamanzi arrive; he was accompanied by Interahamwe.  They went to all the wards where there were patients.  They began by taking out the people who were in the wards, including the refugees and they put us in the courtyard and told us that no one had the right to move from there. 
Q.	Witness, you say that he was accompanied by Interahamwe.  What are Interahamwe? 
A.	They're criminals who were wearing -- were carrying signs.  They had weapons such as clubs dripping with blood as well as machetes and spears.  This is what in -- identified them as Interahamwe -- that is, in addition to the uniforms that they were wearing. 
Q.	Can you tell us what uniforms the Interahamwes were wearing, Witness? 
A.	The Interahamwe uniform was a Kitenge uniform. 
Q.	For those who do not know what a Kitenge is, could you please tell the Court? 
A.	This is a piece -- this is fabric, which is generally worn by women.  Women wear this cloth in the form of wrappers and the Interahamwe had made shirts out of this fabric. 
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell us what happened when Etienne Kamanzi arrived.  You say that he was the deputy director of the centre, how do you know this? 
A.	His superior was there.  He had been the director before that and we learnt that he had been transferred and I knew that Kamanzi was the assistant to the person who had been transferred.  It had not yet been officially declared that he had become the director of the health centre. 
Q.	Witness, you can proceed. 
A.	Working with the Interahamwe, Kamanzi took us out of the wards.  Along with the other refugees, they placed us in the yard of the health centre and they told us that a communiqué had been issued to the effect that no one was to leave that place.  So they told us -- he told us to sit down at this place and that no one was to move. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us where you were at that time? 
A.	At that time I was with the refugees; the sick people. 
Q.	And all that time you were with the refugees? 
A.	At about 10:00 four vehicles arrived on the spot and I saw Rwamakuba and also Rutaganira, the bourgmestre; Nyarwaya, the brigadier and the accountant. 
Q.	Please continue. 
A.	I also saw the school inspector and when I saw those people, I tried to run away.  I went down the side of the building to find a hiding place. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us where you hid? 
A.	I hid in a sorghum field near the health centre. 
Q.	When you were near the health centre, can you assess the distance from where -- the point where you were hidden and the health centre? 
A.	Between the point where I was hidden and the health centre, the distance was equivalent to the distance between where that man is sitting and where you are sitting at this present moment. 
Q.	Which gentleman are you referring to?  Who are you referring to? 
A.	I'm speaking for the counsel for the Defence -- counsel for the Defence who has spoken on several occasions, who has asked me frequently to stop or to slow down in my testimony. 
Q.	And what happened subsequent to that --
MR. HOOPER:
For the record, can we put a distance to that, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, do we have a scale or map of the court? 

We do not have with us the chart for courtroom 2.  We have the measurements of courtroom 1 and courtroom 3, but I suspect the registrar will be able to get the information during the course of this morning.  So I think you can proceed and we can get this measurement at a later stage. 

Mr. Hooper. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, Mr. President, this is the English booth.  In answer -- could you ask counsel just to hold on for a second because in the witness's answer -- in answer to the question -- in the answer to the question, I can't remember what the question was.  The answer was the witness saw four vehicles, one of which was a military vehicle, and we -- we omitted to say that.  So I don't know if, for the record, you wish the question to be put again and the witness to answer it again.  I'm sorry, sir. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President, and I think it would be very useful for both parties. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you gave us the name of people who were in André Rwamakuba's company.  Did you know those people personally? 
A.	They were figures of authority, so I knew them but some of them I couldn't recognise -- some of the people in the group, I couldn't recognise in view of the circumstances.  I felt under threat -- in view of the events. 
Q.	So Witness, you told us that Rwamakuba was there and other figures of authorities and apart from all those people who were there, any other people? 
A.	Yes, there were the future victims.  There were also soldiers and many Interahamwe too. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what happened after the arrival of Rwamakuba and his convoy? 
A.	After his arrival at that place, he said the following:  "Everywhere I have been, they have began to work" -- and "work" meant to kill -- "so what are you waiting for?" 
Q.	Witness, when you quote those words to us, is that word for word what André Rwamakuba said? 
A.	I am repeating his words as he spoke them. 
Q.	Witness, from the place where you were, could you hear everything that was being said?
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping) 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I could hear -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Given the nature and importance of this evidence, that she doesn't lead the witness, please.  Thank you. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I don't see how I was leading the witness, but I will -- I want to be as conciliatory as possible with Counsel Hooper.  I will be as careful as possible. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the question, for example, "Could you hear everything that was said?"  Is a leading question and that was the last question asked or implied question I could hear that was said. 
MS. FALL:
The witness answered that he could hear.  He gave us an example of what he heard.  He reported to us what Rwamakuba said and I then put the question, "Could he hear everything that was being said?"  He could answer that by yes or no -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Fall, that is the definition of a leading question.  A question where the answer is "yes" or "no" is a leading question. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will put the question anew.
BY MS. FALL:  
Q.	Witness, was it possible to hear what was being said? 
A.	I have made a solemn declaration to speak the truth and I note that there has been an exchange of words, but what I can say is that I witnessed those events and I'm testifying as to events that I witnessed. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us after having heard what Rwamakuba said, as you have told us, what subsequently occurred? 
A.	Brigadier Nyarwaya then spoke and he answered by saying that they hadn't begun to kill because they did not have enough material -- material for the task.  And he went on by saying, "We are ready."  And after that brigadier's explanation, saying they did not have sufficient material, Rwamakuba took out a pistol and waved it in the air, "Here is the pistol; the Interahamwe are present.  The material is available; I don't see why you continue to raise that question while everything is ready." 
Q.	Witness, did you personally see Rwamakuba wave that pistol in the air? 
A.	He himself showed the pistol I'm referring to and when he was doing that, while he was doing that, I saw him with my own eyes. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, what happened after that gesture by Rwamakuba? 
A.	After that, we began -- they began killing those people in his presence -- in the presence of the military and the Interahamwe.  Those people were attacked with machetes and clubs, bludgeons.  Some were shot and all those people were still there when they attacked those victims. 
Q.	Witness, you have referred to victims.  Who were the victims? 
A.	We were at the health centre; we had sought refuge there. The majority of people were Tutsi and it was the Tutsi who were killed.  And they were saying the following, "These people must be killed so that in future, a Hutu who is born asks what a Tutsi looks like." 
Q.	Witness, the sentence you have just uttered, did you hear it for yourself? 
A.	I personally heard that sentence uttered from where I was in the sorghum fields and I was -- then had the impression that I would end up killed myself. 
Q.	Witness, you tell us that you stayed all that time in the sorghum fields.  Weren't you afraid of being found and therefore being killed? 
A.	Well, you must understand from the beginning of the killing I was afraid until the time I  -- right up to the time when I got up to the health centre and the people were killed, I was still afraid. 
Q.	Witness, while those events were unfolding, can you tell us where André Rwamakuba was? 
A.	The people were being killed and at one point he got back into his vehicle and left.  But the people were already dead when he left and with the other vehicles they left in the direction of Gikomero. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us, if possible, how long André Rwamakuba stayed after the beginning of the killing? 
A.	It was -- it wasn't fighting, but the people who were attacked did not defend themselves.  And as to the length of time, I'd say he stayed there from 10 o'clock to noon, quite some time and subsequently left the place to go on his -- to go on his -- to continue on his way. 
Q.	Witness, you tell us between 10:00 and 12:00.  How can you be so specific? 
A.	You know, when we're at home around 10 o'clock there is already sunshine and as the hours pass one can estimate the time in respect of the sun's position.  And that is how I can say it was between 10:00 and 12:00, but I'm referring to the position of the sun and as it changes position with the passing of the hours. 
Q.	Witness, can you specify -- can you state that the killings stopped after Rwamakuba's departure? 
A.	The killings stopped when they had finished killing those people, some two hours after, but that was because the people that had to be killed were alread- -- had -- had been killed. 
Q.	Can you tell us after André Rwamakuba's departure, who were the people who went on killing? 
A.	There were the Interahamwe and the soldiers who went on killing people after André Rwamakuba had left. 
Q.	Witness, after those events, what did you do? 
A.	After those events, I stayed in the sorghum field and so then I became hungry towards evening time and I went to dig up cassava tubers and that is when tubers -- and that is when I past near the bodies that had been piled up in a hole.  I went on my way until I arrived at Rutare, a place that was secure and where the RPF -- that had been occupied by the RPF fighters. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whether there were any survivors among the victims at the health centre? 
A.	In truth, the people I found there as well as those that had accompanied me had been killed.  I saw the bodies, their corpses, the remains of their corpses at the time of the reburial ceremony held after the war. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us at what time that reburial ceremony took place? 
A.	That ceremony took place in April 2004 on the 13th. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whether you were present at that reburial ceremony? 
A.	At that ceremony, I did take part in the exhumation and then the reburial. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us approximately, if you know, how many victims there were at Kayanga health centre? 
A.	I did not count the victims at that time, but I can estimate the number of people killed at 100.  100 people, approximately.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President, at this point I have no further questions to put to the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, too. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor. 

Mr. Witness, we will take a break for lunch now.  We will resume at 2 o'clock.  During this adjournment, as during any other adjournment while you are giving evidence, you remain under the same oath as a witness, and you are not to discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We will resume at 2 o'clock.
THE WITNESS:
Quite, Mr. President.
(Court recessed at 1231H)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Wow, I must have had a good lunch time.  Thank you for reminding me.

MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. Hooper, sorry.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Witness GAB, I've got a son about your age, and I cannot begin to imagine the grief and loss you sustained in April of '94 for the loss of your mother, your father, your brothers -- it's beyond imagination.  And I'm sure my heart, as well as others, goes out to you, and I want you to know that and to understand it, and best of all, to believe it.  

Now, you know I represent André Rwamakuba, the man you accuse of participating in the slaughter of some of your family, and I think you well understand and comprehend what my job is, what my task is this afternoon in representing him.  

You are studying at the moment.  What subject are you studying? 
A.	I am studying the science of education, pedagogy in general. 
Q.	Well, I wish you well in that.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	Now, back in 1994 you were just a young lad but you were a student and you were studying.  I think it's right to say you weren't studying locally or -- am I right in thinking that you were studying away from home -- staying away from home, and April '94 you'd come back for presumably the Easter holidays, would I be right in saying that? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  It was during the break -- the vacation.  
Q.	Now, there is a little exercise, I'm afraid, I'm going to invite you to do which involves me passing up a list of names and inviting you to put a cross to the column to the right of them if you know them or you think you know them.  If you don't know them or you don't think you know them, obviously, leave a blank.  

And you put a cross against number 1, number 7 and number 10.  Thank you, very much.  
A.	Thank you, too. 
Q.	Now, if I can come to the first of the names you have indicated, which is number 1.  We are not going to refer to the names out loud in court if we can avoid it.  So dealing with number 1 -- if you have the list in front of you just to remind you which one you have indicated.  Do you have that list there or -- it's coming back to you now.  And if you can look at that -- can you indicate -- let me know how you know that person, please? 
A.	Regarding that person named as number 1, I know him because they were the authorities -- the consellier in my secteur.  That is how I got to know that person. 
Q.	And can we drop down to number 7?  How do you know that person? 
A.	Regarding number 7, I know that she was the accountant in my commune. 
Q.	And number 10? 
A.	He was the school inspector in my home commune. 
Q.	And the other names, I'm not going to go through them all, they don't ring a bell with you, you don't -- looking at those names briefly again, please, there is none there that you've heard of or think you may have heard of?  You just look at the list again.  Just run your eyes over it for me just to confirm that that's right.  
A.	You've given me enough time to look at the list when I had it before me and you asked me to mark those names that I recognised and I therefore did mark those names I recognised.  And those are the names I know.  The other ones I do not know. 
Q.	Well, look at number 8, for example, are you sure you don't know that person, a person who is a Tutsi like you, lives in the same cellule as you, the cellule that you grew up in and lived in all your life, apart from when you were away at school.  You say you don't know that person? 
A.	My cellule -- the cellule where I resided was very big and according to the layout of the cellule and the way the houses are built there, we could live in the same cellule but not all of us know each other. 
Q.	How many people in your cellule, approximately, including young people and old people? 
A.	Inasmuch as it is not my task to make a census of the children or the members of the population that lived in the cellule, I couldn't put forward a figure regarding the number of inhabitants in my cellule. 
Q.	Well, that's helpful.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	Now, you talked about participation in Gacaca.  You've testified before Gacaca body by way of providing information in respect of certain people, and you named Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda and André Rwamakuba as among the people that you've given information in respect of; is that correct?  And if so, when did you provide that information to the Gacaca process?  Thank you.  
A.	Yes, that is, indeed, what I have testified to -- that's what I have stated.  Before the Gacaca proceedings we are still at the information-gathering stage.  The trials have not yet began, but it is true that I have already provided information in that regard. 
Q.	Yes, well, you told us that this morning and I merely asked you -- that you also said this morning, as I understood you, that you'd given information in respect of André Rwamakuba and 
	Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda.  In respect, let's concentrate on Rwamakuba, where did you provide that information and who to? 
A.	The Gacaca tribunal began work this year, 2005, but they had began in 2004.  In 2005 the collection -- gathering of information began and I appeared before the tribunal -- Gacaca tribunal assembly when -- where I provided certain items of information. 
Q.	Now, I'm sure when you are studying and one of your professors or teachers asks you a question you try and answer it as directly as you can.  So I would like you to do the same for me.  So the question was, when and to whom did you provide evidence in Gacaca proceedings in respect of 
	André Rwamakuba?  Can you answer that question, please? 
A.	I did take note of the date, but I must tell you that the Gacaca tribunal met and it was before that tribunal that I provided the information. 
Q.	Well, my last try at this.  Who was the responsable to whom you gave evidence in relation to 
	André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I am a protected witness to date, and if I give you the name of the person to whom I provided the information, I risk compromising -- revealing my identity.  I've told you that I have been before the Gacaca tribunal composed of the president and the assessors and it was before them that I provided the information.  That is what I have stated and that should be sufficient. 
Q.	Yes, I'm passing you up a piece of paper and inviting you to write the name of the person that you gave information before Gacaca in relation to André Rwamakuba.  Can you please write that person's name on the piece of paper?  It will be kept under seal and no one but the present parties will know what you've written.  

Thank you very much.  
A.	Thank you, too.
MR. HOOPER:
And may that piece of paper with the name written on it, in due cause, be entered into evidence with its appropriate exhibit number which I think is D. 41 -- 42 -- 44, sorry.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted into evidence as D. 44, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 44 admitted, under seal)  
MR. HOOPER: 
And while we are on it, I'm reminded the tick list can go in, please, as Exhibit D. 45.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the tick list admitted as D. 45, under seal.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  
(Exhibit No. D. 45 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you mentioned, in fact, in respect of Gacaca proceedings, that you'd given evidence in respect of someone called Pascal Ndengejeho and Martin -- or Martin Ntehirewe.  I think were the two names.  Can we just deal briefly with this?  The first name, Pascal Ndengejeho, what part did he play in the -- in the history of events that you witnessed?  Just very briefly, where does he fit in the account?  Thank you.  
A.	Thank you too.  In truth, at the present time, I am testifying in the Rwamakuba trial so you should put questions to me on Rwamakuba.  As regards Ndengejeho, when the tribunal considers it necessary to provide information on that person, they can call me and only then will I provide information to the tribunal.  For the time being, I think you should stick to the Rwamakuba matter. 
Q.	Well, I think I can understand you wanting me to stick to a narrow track here of Rwamakuba, but I'm not going to be doing that.  And I'm inviting you just to explain in the context of your evidence today, where Pascal Ndengejeho fits into your story, a person, you tell us, you've given evidence about in Gacaca proceedings and we know that the Gacaca proceedings are open and public proceedings.  So can you just very briefly help us and just tell us where he fits in and then we can move on.  Thank you.  
A.	Counsel, it would appear to me that you do not want to accept my explanations.  You want to insist on asking me questions on Ndengejeho.  I am talking about Rwamakuba, and when the time will come when you will be asking me questions on Ndengejeho or when it will be his turn to stand trial, I will give you the information necessary.  For the moment, we're talking about Rwamakuba. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the rules which -- and procedures which govern the way these trials are conducted, and it is our duty as the judges to assess whether the rules are being broken or being complied with.  Now, the question of what is a proper question is a legal decision for us to decide, and we will be controlling the questions that are asked to make certain that no questions that are improper or illegal are put to you.  If you feel uncomfortable with any question and we do not initiate control, you may ask us our opinion, but our rule on the matter is final and you will have to abide by our decision on that.  We have not decided that this question is improper so you ought to answer it.  Do you understand?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So -- so where does he fit into the story, where does he figure? 
A.	Does your question have to do with the category of questions within which the person concerned has to be dealt with?  
Q.	Who is he?  What did he do? 
A.	The truth be told, I saw him just as I used to see Dr. Rwamakuba.  I did not know what his duties were.  He took part in the massacres as the Interahamwes did.  I think that should be enough explanation to you. 
Q.	Well, who was he?  Can you help me with that, please? 
A.	But I have just told you.  He was a killer, just like Rwamakuba and other persons, who were carrying out the same activities. 
Q.	Well, was he an important figure or was he just an ordinary farmer?  Where does he fit in to the story? 
A.	I did not know what was his occupation, but since he used to move about in a vehicle, and that this was not common for most of those in my region to ride a car, and on top of that, I used to see him going about or travelling with high officials, I therefore presumed that he was an important personality without necessarily -- necessarily knowing his profession. 
Q.	Did you see him participate in any killing, and if so, when and where, please? 
A.	Between the 13th and the 15th April 1994, he came with Rwamakuba.  I believe they were together.  He is one of the many people that I was unable to recognise.  However, he was with all those people. 
Q.	His name doesn't appear in your statement about Rwamakuba, but now you say you saw this man with Rwamakuba.  So I seemed to have stumbled on something here.  When was that?  When did you see him? 
A.	I saw him between the 13th and the 15th of April.  I have told you that Rwamakuba himself came with the bourgmestre, the accountant, the brigadier and the school inspector.  Rwamakuba was with other people.  And later I learnt that he was also with Pascal Ndengejeho. 
Q.	And so now you've put Pascal Ndengejeho in the picture; is that right? 
A.	He was there. 
Q.	How do you later find out that someone's there who you don't recognise at the time?  Can you explain that to us, please? 
A.	When you come out of a war and that you were affected in one way or the other by the war, you hear stories that are told about the events.  I personally saw Rwamakuba, and other people who knew Rwamakuba and who knew Ndengejeho, said that Rwamakuba was with Ndengejeho.  That is how I came to learn that he was with Ndengejeho.  And as I have just said, he was with many other people that I couldn't recognise at the time of the events.  And I'm giving this information concerning him just as I would give the same information concerning some other persons -- some other persons if I were to learn subsequently that those persons were present as well at the time of the events. 
Q.	So you've learnt subsequently and that since you made your statement about André Rwamakuba in November of last year, that Pascal Ndengejeho, whoever that may be, was with Rwamakuba.  You've learnt that from other people.  I'm going to pass you up a piece of paper.  Can you write down the names of the people who gave you that information? 
A.	It will not be necessary to give me a sheet of paper.  I'm going to explain the following to you:  When we -- we exhumed the remains of the genocide, the witnesses in their own relations of the stories also talked about Ndengejeho, Pascal, as one of the persons who were involved in the events.  But I cannot recall the witnesses or the name of the witnesses who mentioned Ndengejeho's name since there were many people at that burial ceremony. 
Q.	Yes.  That may be -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Reburial ceremony."  The interpreter stands corrected.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	That may be.  I'm asking you to write down the names of the persons who told they saw Rwamakuba with Ndengejeho.  Is that something you can do or not? 
A.	I know Rwamakuba very well.  As far as Ndengejeho is concerned, I learnt of his existence during the burial -- the reburial of the remains of the victims of the genocide.  But there are many other persons who gave testimony during the reburial ceremony and I did not retain the name or the names of the persons who mentioned Ndengejeho's name, so I am in no position to give you the name that you are looking for.  I would therefore request that you content yourself with these explanations I've given. 
Q.	I'm just going to ask you one more question on this.  You see, your evidence was this, a moment ago, that a number of people had told you that Ndengejeho was seen with André Rwamakuba.  I'm not particularly bothered about Ndengejeho, it's Rwamakuba I'm interested in and I have invited you to write down the name of just one of these witnesses in respect of Rwamakuba.  And would I be right in saying you can't write even one name down? 
A.	I took an oath to say the truth and I am telling you the truth and my truth is that I know Rwamakuba since I have met and seen him.  I have seen him face to face; no other person saw him for me.  I therefore do not need to mention this on a sheet of paper.  I am telling you that I saw him. 
Q.	Can you give me the name of one other person who saw Rwamakuba at the Kayanga health centre other than you? 
A.	In my statement I talked of persons that I met at the scene and the people -- of people who were with me.  And amongst those people there was no survival (sic).  I do not know even under the circumstances in which I saw Rwamakuba I saw -- some other person saw him.  If there is another witness, well, then such a witness can come and give his explanations, if such a witness survived the same place as myself.  But to the best of my knowledge, all those who were there at the time died.  There was no survival (sic) with the exception of yours truly. 
Q.	All right.  Coming back to the Gacaca point, I asked you to write down the name of the person to whom you'd given evidence relating to Rwamakuba and the word you wrote down was Inukoyurukiko (phonetic) which I thought to be the name of someone, but I understand it's the name of no one, it stands for the phrase "the assembly of Gacaca."  So let me ask you again, are you in a position to provide me with the name of the person that you gave evidence relating to André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I would like to ask a question, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may address your question to me.  
THE WITNESS: 
I am here as a protected witness in this Trial Chamber.  As concerns the Gacaca tribunal, if I were to talk about it, well, that information may get to the knowledge of other persons from my village, and this may jeopardise my security.  I know that the Defence has carried out investigations on this, but I would like to request that the Defence counsel refrain from asking me to give the names of persons because this may jeopardise my security.  I have merely told him that I spoke to the assembly of the Gacaca tribunal of my cellule, and I think this should be sufficient for him.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is not the only occasion when there is a protected witness for our Tribunal, and there have been a number of rules and procedures which have been developed to accommodate the status of a protected witness.  Now, the reason why you are asked to write the name rather than to express it publicly is that that is a way of controlling the information and making it confidential.  So we permit that device to be used in our Tribunal, which, in our view, will not compromise your security in any way.  So we think that that is something that a protected witness should do when requested.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, here is another piece of paper, and this time, can you write the name down and not something else, please? 
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And can that be -- once it's been shown to everyone, can that be given the exhibit number of D. 46, please?  
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you, Counsel.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Thank you.  And just so we're clear, can we call that someone to whom you've given Gacaca evidence recently, is that right?  
A.	Yes, it may be so considered. 
Q.	Now, let's come to the events at the Kayanga health centre.  You've described what happened and how you viewed the murder of about 100 people over several hours from your concealment, and that obviously must have been a terrible thing to see.  And I -- would I be right in thinking that those were, in fact, the -- many though they were -- the only killings that you saw yourself with your own eyes during the period of genocide? 
A.	Yes, that was the only massacre scene I was witness to. 
Q.	It was about 100 dead including relatives, aunts and cousins, children, and all supervised by someone who was -- you came to know was a minister in the government as well as an important local person, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	I know that that person was a medical doctor.  As to the fact that he was a minister, I wasn't aware. 
Q.	But you became aware, didn't you? 
A.	I heard people say so. 
Q.	And you've provided a long statement, for example, in the case of Kamuhanda concerning, in detail, events in your area.  That statement was provided in 1999, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And there was a later or perhaps several opportunities for you when you met investigators to discuss your evidence and, indeed, you gave evidence here.  You came here for a period of time, but didn't give evidence and was returned to Rwanda, and then you came back and gave evidence in 
	October of 2001.  That's right, isn't it? 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think the date was **************** 2001.  You are not giving the precise date and I think I can do that for you.  Those are the dates you are referring to.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And, indeed, on the ************* 2001.  Is that right? 
A.	That is not correct.  I no longer recall.  I know that I came during that year, but I can no longer recall on what date and in what month. 
Q.	Well, perhaps that is a detail at this moment that doesn't worry us.  Now, how is it, in all those -- all that time you never mentioned the eyewitness massacre that you claim you saw?  How is that possible? 
A.	This is the reason where for I didn't talk about it at that time.  This was a file concerning a single individual and questions were put to me on that, and I provided answers.  We were talking about 
	Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda.  I do not see why I ought to have talked about some other person, whereas questions were put to me concerning Kamuhanda. 
Q.	But, you see, you were talking about events that you witnessed and yet somehow you managed to step over seeing 100 people butchered over several hours, the only killings you ever saw, and you never mentioned it to the investigators:  "Oh, by the way, I witnessed all these people being killed."  You never mentioned it.  
A.	Talking about the Kamuhanda trial, I gave answers to questions that were put to me, and you will find my answers in the statement.  And when another official came and asked me questions on a specific topic, I provided answers to the questions. 
Q.	You see, I am suggesting it's out of all reason and belief for you never ever to have mentioned such a thing to somebody investigating events in Rwanda, if you'd really seen it, if you'd really been there and witnessed it.  
A.	If you followed the Kamuhanda trial, would you have learnt that I did not give testimony at that trial concerning events that I was a witness of and that concerned him? 
(Pages 29 to 37 by Gifty C. Harding)





















1530H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, we will come back to that in some detail later, the Kamuhanda trial and your evidence.  It is right to say you gave evidence, of course, in the Kamuhanda case in respect of attending a meeting where Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda was present and, therefore, you could recognise him; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Without wasting any time, I gave my statement in 1999.  You, you are lucky to have that statement.  You can't read it, but in a few words I answered questions that were put to me and that concerned him. 
Q.	And I am just summarizing your position then, as I have seen from statements and transcripts; first of all, that you had seen Kamuhanda at the political rally and were, therefore, able to recognise him, you gave details of what was said.  And, secondly, that you had been playing football when Kamuhanda had arrived the day before the genocide started with a white Hilux vehicle full of guns, machetes and grenades, some of which he distributed.  Those were the two key parts of your evidence.  Am I right in suggesting that? 
A.	I can no longer quite recall all of that because it has been quite a while, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, did you know that the Trial Chamber in its judgement rejected your evidence as not being credible on those two issues, the central issues of your evidence; did you know that? 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I would like to make a statement.  He is coming back to this problem of the Kamuhanda judgement.  I believe -- well, all of the parties -- you made a ruling which has become a public decision, and that judgement I invite the entire court to read it.  And I think we can refer to the terms of the judgement and at what time that the parts thereof were deemed not to be credible.  So I don't think he should come once again to talk about that judgement.  I think all of the parties have that decision.  And we should look at the reasons wherefore the parts of the judgement were not deemed to be credible, and why Counsel Hooper is putting forth the position that he is. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, if the objection is that I am putting forward something unfairly, I am quite content to read the judgement on this witness.  But what I am doing at the moment is asking this witness if he knows, coming to give evidence here today, that his evidence was found incredible and not truthful with respect to all of the key areas of his evidence in Kamuhanda.  And I fail to see the position of my learned friend in rising to her feet, again, in respect to this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would think that the question about the witness's knowledge is permissible.  I would not think it would be allowable to read the judgement to him, or to read sections of the judgement to him. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I won't do so.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, did you know that, that the Chamber, having listened with care, no doubt, to your evidence in the Kamuhanda case, found that you were not truthful and not credible on all of the key aspects of your evidence?  Did you know that before you came into this Court? 
A.	Concerning the Kamuhanda trial to which you are referring, by saying that my testimony was deemed to be incredible, I am aware that the Trial Chamber scrutinized my evidence.  I know that Kamuhanda was sentenced to life imprisonment.  I do not believe that the Judges convicted him whereas he was innocent.  I have come back here to give testimony in a different trial because I have been requested to do so. 
Q.	The question I'm asking is whatever other evidence was available to the Chamber, laying that aside, did you know that in your case they rejected your evidence as not being credible?  Did you know that; yes or no? 
A.	When the judgement was passed I wasn't present.  But as for me, I was satisfied with the -- his conviction. 
Q.	When did you come to learn that André Rwamakuba had been a minister; when did you first learn that, can you recall?  
A.	I learned that he was a minister when the trial of the former prime minister of the government, the Abatazi government began.  That is when I learned that Rwamakuba was a minister of that prime minister's government. 
Q.	Now, let's come to your evidence which, as you put it a moment ago, goes like this, "I know André Rwamakuba very well."  Now, can we just explore that.  Now, in your evidence this morning, you said You had heard him talked about in relation to the communal office and Habyarimana.

Now, first of all, I think you will agree that that is not something you have ever told anybody about until you got in the witness box today; is that right?  
A.	Can you please repeat your question, I didn't quite understand it. 
Q.	You said in your evidence this morning that you had heard of André Rwamakuba, you had heard him talked about in the context of something to do with the communal office and a visit by               President Habyarimana.  First of all, did you say that?  Am I correct that you did say that? 
A.	Yes, I did say so, and I confirm that. 
Q.	Can you also confirm that the first time you ever said that to anybody was in the witness box this morning; you did not mention it to anyone before then? 
A.	I said that when I was asked under what circumstances I heard mention of Rwamakuba, but that is not what is in my statement. 
Q.	So, do you agree the first time you ever mentioned that was today in your evidence, this morning? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you explain what you meant when you said that you had heard him talked about in that context?  Can you tell us what that was about, please?  
A.	I must explain to you that as a pupil, and the other pupil who went to receive the dignitaries.  I had the opportunity to see the people there.  The president's delegation was introduced, each individual was presented to the assembly, introduced.  And the pupils who had been there -- were there, spoke to me of it.  But I can't tell you much of Rwamakuba on that occasion because I wasn't there, but I knew him on other occasions.  
Q.	As I understand it from your evidence this morning, that was the first time you had come to hear of him; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  It was the first time I heard his name mentioned without seeing him. 
Q.	And for some reason the name stuck in your memory, did it? 
A.	That name will never, until the end of time, be out of my memory. 
Q.	Setting aside the traumatic statement, is that the first time that you heard the name Rwamakuba, and why did it stick in your memory then? 
A.	For a name to remain embedded in someone's memory depends on what you do, whether it is for good or for ill.  If one -- if someone does something bad, their name remains embedded in your memory.  If someone acts for good or for ill, the name remains embedded.  So it all depends on what the person whose name you recollect did. 
Q.	Well, he hadn't done anything then, even on your evidence.  But what was this occasion that you didn't go that you heard from other pupils that did; what was the occasion that President Habyarimana came all the way to Gikomero to do?  What was that? 
A.	I cannot tell you on what date it was, it was a long time ago.  I can't give you the date or the period during which he came, but the fact is that he did come to Gikomero. 
Q.	Yes, I haven't asked you for the date.  I asked you what was it about.  Answer the question, please. 
A.	I told you that I remember that he came there but I don't remember why he came or the date.  But, in any case, he did come there. 
Q.	Of course, the president himself comes you tell us, President Habyarimana.  And you mentioned this morning the communal office, I don't know if you have forgotten that this afternoon.  That is what you said this morning.  Was it something to do with the communal office? 
A.	I can't explain it.  I'm not a politician.  I don't know why he came, but the main thing is that I know he did come there; the pupils went to welcome him.  But I don't know why he came there. 
Q.	The pupils went, but you were one of the pupils who didn't go to welcome him; is that right? 
A.	That is correct.  I did not go to greet -- to welcome to president at that time. 
Q.	You weren't at that ceremony, whatever it was; is that right? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
MR. HOOPER: 
I think we lost something there. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we got mixed up with the microphone, I'm sorry.  Perhaps they can repeat the question and answer. 
MR. HOOPER: 
If you can remember the last answer, interpreter.  
THE WITNESS:
I did answer, Counsel.  I said the following: I answered counsel in saying I hadn't been to welcome those authorities, those figures, which is why I said I had heard that he was there.  If I had been present I would have said that I saw him.  That is why I answered that I heard that he had been there. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In the Kamuhanda case, on the ********************, at page 40, you were asked of Kamuhanda:  "How do you know him, how exactly did you know him?" And your answer was, "I knew him during the inauguration of the communal office.  I was a primary school pupil at the time and he came.  He was present.  He was actually accompanied by the president of the republic.  Question:  If you see him here today can you identify him?  Answer:  Yes, I can identify him."  And you point out the man in the spectacles.  So what do we have here, do we have President Habyarimana coming to open two communal offices?  And if that is facetious, it is reflecting your testimony I'm afraid. 
A.	Did I ever tell you that he had come for that purpose at that place, or is it something that you are inventing, you are adding to my narrative?  
Q.	You referred to President Habyarimana, André Rwamakuba and the communal office this morning; something you didn't go to yourself, but you heard of Rwamakuba from fellow pupils who did attend.  Now, we have a clear piece of transcripted evidence where you told the Court not very long ago that you were present at the inauguration of the communal office with President Habyarimana and with   Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda, as a consequence of which you could recognise Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda and, indeed, you pointed him out in court. 
A.	I should like to put a question to you, Counsel.  If we are speaking of Rwamakuba, let's speak of Rwamakuba.  If you want to speak of Kamuhanda, let us be specific and speak of it, because I think that there is some confusion between the two trials -- two matters. 
Q.	Did you attend President Habyarimana's inauguration of the communal office; yes or no? 
A.	It was a long time ago, I do not remember. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	I, equally. 
Q.	Let's move on to the next opportunity of meeting this man, Rwamakuba, you know so well.  Already, your first opportunity, and that is the laying of the foundation stone for the Rutunga primary school in 1992, which you told us he attended and you attended, together with the guest of honour, I take it, who was, you told us, prime minister --  sorry, not prime minister, minister.  And you provided the name Munyanzesa in 1992. 
A.	Yes, that is correct, in 1992. 
Q.	Did you know when it was in 1992?  I know it is a long time ago. 
A.	Those are details that I did not closely follow.  I had no interests in it.  I wasn't a school director or principal, I wasn't a school inspector.  Why would I bother to memorise all of those details?  It is moreover a stroke of luck if I can even remember the year. 
Q.	But in the Kamuhanda case, you said it was at the end of 1992, so does that sound about right to you? 
A.	Well, you must understand it was 1992, let's recall the year.  I didn't give any day or month, but it was the year 1992; let's stick with that.  It was events that I witnessed.  You have to make do with what you read in documents here and there.  But, in any case, you were not present at that time there. 
Q.	And Munyanzesa was minister of information at that time, was he not? 
A.	That I don't know.  I told you that I didn't seek to know whether such and such, a public figure, did this or that or the other.  I learned that he was a minister, but I didn't seek to know of which ministry -- or in which ministry he worked. 
Q.	Did many people attend this ceremony? 
A.	Yes, even the pupils, who were very numerous.  And at that precise time the authorities had come to visit the pupils at the school. 
Q.	So, approximately, how many people, with the pupils, would you say were there? 
A.	Well, as to the numbers, the number of students at the school, that is the information that the school principal could provide, just as a teacher can tell you the number of pupils in the class that he is in charge of.  As far as I am concerned, I'm not in a position to give you the number of pupils. 
Q.	Well, you were attending this school, this primary school at that time, you told us, and you are now studying education.  How many pupils were there, do you think? 
A.	Had I known that I was to answer your questions, I might perhaps have paid some attention so as to have an idea -- to have an idea as to the number of pupils, but I don't want to make a guess at this juncture. 
Q.	All right.  But there were the pupils there, and were there also other authorities there -- were there many other authorities there?  
A.	There was the minister, Dr. Rwamakuba, our school principal, as well as the pupils.  You can refer to my statement, I think I indicated who were the public figures, the authorities that I saw.  And there were no others, apart from those I saw. 
Q.	And there was a stone laid?  Where was that stone laid?  Where was the foundation stone that they put there, which part of the site was that? 
A.	It was in Rutunga secteur, and the laying of the foundation stone was in Rutunga secteur.  And now there is a primary school there, it still exists. 
Q.	And what happened, were people sat down or standing up?  What was going on at this inauguration? 
A.	Normally, when such public figures or authorities are welcomed or when there is a meeting, I think you know what the usual practice is, you know in this Court when one has the floor, one stands up.  At the time it was more or less the same procedure. 
Q.	Well, see, I can't speak about these meetings.  You were there.  I mean, were people sat down or stood up; what was the position? 
A.	If you would like, what I am saying might intend to -- and rather than complicating my life, I didn't know I would be put such questions on so many different things that occurred during the ceremony.  If you like, you could, perhaps, please content yourself with what I have stated. 
Q.	Can you describe André Rwamakuba to us, please? 
A.	Rwamakuba is of medium height, he is not fat.  I know there is a distinctive sign that I cannot forget, distinctive characteristic I cannot forget.  He has thick lips.  I think that his -- a sailiant characteristic as far as he is concerned. 
Q.	Thicker lips than your own? 
A.	I'm beginning to realise that you want to attack me.  The best thing would be to bring him here to the court; otherwise, my lips are not as thick as his. 
Q.	Right.  So he has thicker lips than you have.  That is your answer, noticeably thick lips, a distinguishing feature of him that you remember, a striking feature? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	All right.  Let's come to the next opportunity.  And we notice 1992.  We know how old you would have been in 1992.  Incidentally, approximately, how long was André Rwamakuba there at the school on that occasion that first occasion that you had a chance to see him? 
A.	I don't know if you are going to concede to my request, but I tell you that I didn't have a stop watch to time the time he was there.  I didn't know there was going to be a genocide and questions would be put to me.  All I can tell you is that I saw him personally at that place, but the details you are seeking, I cannot provide you for the reasons I have given. 
Q.	And he was introduced as a native from the area.  Do you know where he lived? 
A.	At the time it was said that he was a native of the same commune as I, Gikomero.  But, in fact, he lived in Kigali and he would come from Kigali in the minister's company. 
Q.	Do you know where he lived in the commune, where his family was from? 
A.	Yes, even today I know where his family lives. 
Q.	And is that something you have learned since, from talking to other people, perhaps, even people who are witnesses in this case? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you spoken to anyone who you know to be a witness in this case about the case? 
A.	I have met no one.  I have spoken to no one concerning this trial.  Even the witness who came before me, I have only seen that person when I came here, so I haven't had to meet anybody whatsoever who is a witness in this case. 
Q.	All right.  Let's come to the political rally.  Which year was this rally held in? 
A.	If you listen to my evidence keenly, I think I said that there was a meeting -- rally, rather, in 1992. 
Q.	And you know which month that was in? 
A.	When I give you an answer, do I say it was in this year or that?  It is easy for me to remember the year, unless one were a politician to have an interest in the business, I think you can also remember the date and the month.  So I would like to crave your indulgence here because I cannot remember the date and the month. 
Q.	I mean, was it early in the year or late in the year; can you help us to that extent? 
A.	If I could remember, I would tell you.  I would have told you if the month was January, February or March, but I have explained to you that I don't have a recollection of the dates and the month.  But I know that it was on the year that I mentioned that it took place. 
Q.	You see, you told us that you realized, as a consequence of what was said, that the Tutsi could be killed, as it had been just said in public.  So it was, obviously, a very striking and frightening occasion for you.  Can you remember how close to the start of the genocide that that meeting took place; was it a year and a half before, beginning of  '93 that is, was it just a few months before, can you help us a little better? 
A.	I have told you that it was 1993, since the genocide took place in 1994. 
Q.	Can you help me as to this:  What other meetings, if any, do you remember took place in 1993 in Kayanga, political rallies, that is? 
A.	I cannot remember, that is what I told you.  I was not a politician at the time nor was I a member of a political party. 
Q.	Did you go to any other rallies, for example?  Were you interested enough to attend other rallies? 
A.	You know, it is not a matter of having a certain interest in a political party, the idea is to see things that were happening.  If I had been a member of any political party, probably I would have been interested in any political activities.  But what I am telling you is that I was not a member of any political party whatsoever. 
Q.	Well, why did you go to this rally then? 
A.	A short while ago I explained to you that there were public events.  This was happening in daylight.  People went there, and it just occurred to me that I could go there to go to where the rally was taking place just as was the case with other curious persons.  And those are the circumstances under which I found myself at the meeting or rally scene. 
Q.	And then having attended the rally, you presumably were shocked to hear what was said.  And, indeed, you told us you left realizing then that the Tutsi could be killed; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I think that you have understood it well.  And you may also advise your client to ask for pardon for what was done.  And I think you are beginning to understand.  In the same connection, you can also talk to your client so that he can ask for pardon for what he did.
Q.	So, that was the first time you, as a young lad, really, you realised that Tutsis could be killed as a result of what was being said at that meeting.  Now, did you go to any other meeting, any other rally?  Was that the only one you went to? 
A.	I have told you that even at that rally, I did not go to take part in it.  I went there out of curiosity.  I did not remain there for a long time.  But after realizing what was being said and not being a member of the party that had organised the rally, I left the place. 
Q.	Well, did you go to any other rallies was the question, or are you saying by your answer, "Well, I wasn't interested in politics and I didn't go to other rallies.  I happened to fall into this one and that was it."  Is that where we are at in your evidence? 
A.	I attended no other rally and I think I have already said so.  And even then, the one I went to I only went there out of curiosity.  When you are a member of the political party you may feel the need to go and attend the rally. 
Q.	All right.  Now, this rally, the one rally you went to was an MDR Power rally.  Was the word "power" actually used at the time of the rally or was it a word that you used to describe the rally from what you have learned since; which is it?  
A.	Well, some time had passed when people were saying that there was a party called MDR Power.  I think what they meant was MDR Parmehutu.  I don't think there is a problem there.  It was probably known that the MDR Power existed.  And, besides, the term "power" was used during that rally. 
Q.	The word "power" was used during the rally; that is right, is it? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	I didn't get an answer to that.  Was that yes or -- confirming -- I'm sorry.  I will ask the question again.  The word "power" was used in that rally; is that correct? 
A.	I answered by telling you that that term was used during that meeting. 
Q.	Now, I understand that the word power only entered the political vocabulary in Rwanda in late October of 1993.  And if that is correct, then, presumably, this meeting was after the end of October of 1993, in November or December, or perhaps even later than that.  Would you accept that, or would you dispute that? 
A.	I have told you that I did not -- I wasn't aware of dates, but I do maintain that that term was used, and that was in 1993.  I would like to request you to, you know, make do with what I have said. 
Q.	And you say there were other authorities there, of secteur and communal level, but you weren't in a position to know who they were; is that right? 
A.	The problem is not to know the name, or to have mentioned those names in the statement.  The important thing is that those authorities -- officials were there. 
Q.	Now, I suggest the only MDR party rally that was held in Kayanga secteur and held at the school at any time in 1993 was a rally that was held in June of 1993.  And among those who attended was       Faustin Twagiramungu, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, prime minister -- later prime minister, Anatase Gasana, who was foreign minister in October 1993.  Twagiramungu was prime minister, of course, under the Inkotanyi RPF government of '94, '95, '96.  Is that the rally that you attended?  
A.	If that had been a meeting that I had attended I would have mentioned Twagiramungu's name and Uwilingiyimana's name, as well as Gasana's name.  But I would like to appeal to you to consider to talk about what concerns Rwamakuba.  If I did not mention Twagiramungu, or Gasana, who was a neighbour, that is because he or they were not at that meeting.  I realise that probably at the time you were a member of that party.  You probably may help me there. 
Q.	So, what about this meeting I am talking about, the one in June with all of those people there with whom you seem to know.  Do you remember that meeting? 
A.	For some time now, I have been telling you that I cannot recall the dates and the month.  And I talked to you about the rally that was held in 1993.  I cannot give you the month in which the meeting or the rally was held, nor the date.  But I would like that you accept the fact that such a meeting was held.  I believe you, indeed, are defending the interest of your client.  But what I know is that he cannot confess to the crimes that he committed.  And all you are doing is to assist him in defending himself and you are doing it as best as you can.  And -- thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, could you come to a convenient place for the break. 
MR. HOOPER: 
This is as good as any.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is convenient? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will take a short break now. 
(Court recessed at 1625H)
(Pages 38 to 46 by Donna M. Lewis)


















(Court resumed at 1650H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may resume now.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Witness GAB, we were talking before the break of the one political rally you attended in 1993.  I can't remember you told us the date, and as I recall, there you said that there were other authorities there.  You are not in a position to tell us who else was present by name; is that right?  
A.	I answered in the negative while specifying that the only person I recognised was Rwamakuba and that is in my statement.  If I were able to identify the other people I saw, I could have mentioned them in my statement, but that was not the case.  
Q.	And just to remind ourselves that you heard a speech.  I wasn't clear who gave the speech.  Can you remember who gave it, the one that was militant or of parties and MDR in particular, the enemy is the Tutsi, that speech?  Can you remember who gave that?  
A.	That speech was given by the MDR representative in the secteur.  It was he who stood up and spoke and said inter alia, pronounced -- uttered, inter alia, the words you have just said, and when I left there he was still speaking.  
Q.	Why didn't you go to any other political rallies at this time or in 1993 or so, why not?  
A.	I gave him my reasons.  I said that I was a student and I was young and I explained that I wasn't a member of any political party and I added that I did not have the time to be concerned with politics.  
Q.	I am going to read part of the transcript of the ***************** 2001, in the case of 
	Jean Kamuhanda, which will be found at page 44 and onwards, and I am going to read certain passages from this.  
A.	I have a question to put.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have done all I could to explain to counsel for the Defence that he has had the opportunity to read the Kamuhanda dossier.  But I, as far as I am concerned, testified in that matter four or five years ago and I should like to ask, therefore, I should like to ask Defence counsel to concentrate on the matter before us now, the Rwamakuba matter.  I do not understand why Defence counsel wishes to insist on Kamuhanda.  If he is defending Kamuhanda, he should tell me so that I understand clear that I am testifying in Kamuhanda's trial or in a joint Rwamakuba-Kamuhanda trial.  In my opinion, the Kamuhanda trial is over and we are in Rwamakuba trial, and I think we should rather concentrate on the latter.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, that was a -- thank you very much for your enquiry.  As I mentioned earlier, the issue of what questions are permitted is a legal issue and certain questions concerning prior statements made by a witness are permitted.  There, the answers to those questions sometimes assist the Court in deciding on the quality of the testimony in the current case.  So your answers to those questions will assist us in deciding how much of your evidence today should be believed.  So the questions are permitted for that purpose.  So you will have to answer them.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sir, may I ask you please, Mr. Witness, to listen carefully as I read parts of this transcript out to you and then I will invite your comment.  

Page 44, you were asked this question in the Kamuhanda case.  "Question:  Can you tell the Court of any such political meetings which you attended?"  "Answer:  The meeting -- I would refer, for example, to a meeting organised by the MRND party in our secteur.  In fact, it was the very last organised."  And you go on about MRND and CDR, who were present and the dispute between them.  You said -- and this is only in ************ 2001, "The meeting took place in August 1993.  Did you attend this meeting?"  "Yes."  "Where did the meeting take place?"  "The meeting took place at the Kayanga secteur in the Gikomero commune."  "Did you see the people who spoke at this meeting?"  "Yes."  "Did you hear what they said?"  "I more specifically followed statements of concern to me, or which seemed to be of concern to me.  In short, I followed the statements made.   "Who are the people who spoke at this meeting?"  And you say, "Thomas Mabango, he spoke and he complained about there being" -- and this is at page 46, "There were a lot of accomplices in reference to the Tutsi.  And, finally, the population did not have the means to protect themselves.  Then Rutaganira spoke, you told the Court, and he was introduced -- sorry, he introduced the officials of the MRND party at the communal level.  He introduced the vice president of the MRND, Marisa, Celestin.  Then he introduced Mathias Rubanguka who was the accountant of the commune, and he also introduced to members of the population the guest of honour who was on that day, Mr. Kamuhanda.  

And you go on, and you say there was some dispute between the MDR and the MRND.  Then we noticed you say, that there was some scuffle between the MDR and the MRND, particularly those who were saying they were the MDR -- who were opposed to the killings.  And you add, "And based on that meeting and pronouncements, we knew that at all costs we were going to be killed."  You relate a speech by Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda, where he said that to the crowd that "their fate" that is, the Tutsis, is being decided, and you said, as we have just learnt that from what was said we understood, you said, "We Tutsis or Tutsis were to be killed."  
MS. FALL:
I am sorry, I think Counsel Hooper is going -- reading a bit too fast and I can't follow.  I have the document before me and I can't follow.  When he said "our fate is sealed" was it the question put to the question or the answer?

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you provide perhaps, Mr. Hooper, a copy for the French booth?  
MR. HOOPER:
I am afraid not.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I have the French version and the French booth interjects that they do not have it.  It is page 61 of the French.  "Question:  When Mr. Kamuhanda at that meeting said the fate of those people has been considered and their fate is sealed, what did you answer?"  That is where I lost -- I didn't quite catch the answer.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I quoted on those pages from page 44 in the English; it is all there to be read.  I will pick it up again at page 48, if that would assist you, and that is from the point where the bourgmestre Rutaganira has introduced the officials of the MRND. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, my concern is, what really is the question being put to the witness?  I am not certain if you actually read the materials on the transcript.  I mean are we going to admit it into evidence?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we would be more interested -- I would be more interested in the -- what is the inquiry you are making of the witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
Let  me -- I am putting the witness in the picture.  Let me say just on page 55 having recited who gives speeches.  He talks about a request that was made to Kamuhanda to provide rifles and Kamuhanda says that he would speak to the higher authorities about that, giving the witness, I hope, a tone of this rally that he said he attended.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And the question is, Mr. Witness, where is this rally gone now in your evidence?  Why haven't you mentioned it?  You have forgotten your evidence, haven't you?  
A.	When I was questioned in respect of that rally, it had to do with the rally in which or which was attended by Rwamakuba and not Kamuhanda.  In the Kamuhanda case, I was asked to explain -- to talk about the rallies which he attended and that is what I did.  

Now, as concerns Rwamakuba, I explained -- I talk about a rally at which I saw him and what he did during that rally.  Thank you.  
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, I asked you about five occasions to the point of tedium to everybody, whether you had attended any other rallies in 1993, why you hadn't attended any other rallies in '93, et cetera, 
	et cetera, and you gave us your reply, that you hadn't attended any other rallies.  
A.	In my answers, I kept telling you that I am a witness here in the Rwamakuba case, and I also stated that I am here to give answers to questions that concern Rwamakuba, and in my statement concerning Rwamakuba, I didn't talk about Kamuhanda  and vice versa.  I, therefore, explained what concerned Rwamakuba in his case here.  Thank you.  
Q.	I will ask you again.  Why, when I carefully asked you questions as to whether you had attended any other rallies, did you say no, not at all, no interest in politics, this was the only rally I attended?  Why did you give that answer when it wasn't true?  
A.	You are claiming that this is not true, but that is not my opinion.  What you are doing there is to defend your client.  It's as if you were the one who is accused, and you are doing all to exculpate your client.  You are not there to give testimony on his behalf.  I am giving testimony as an eyewitness.  I am not telling you what was reported to me, and I have taken an oath before giving my evidence to the effect that I was going to tell the truth and that is what I am doing.  Thank you.  
Q.	You also told us that as a result of what you heard at the MDR Power rally, you, for the first time, realised that you the Tutsis could be killed, and yet here we are, looking at the Kamuhanda transcripts at page 50, when you say, relating to the meeting that you talked about there in August 1993, "And based on that meeting and pronouncements, we knew that at all costs we were going to be killed."  So is that two meetings which you attended where you learnt that you were going to be killed for the first time or not?  
A.	No, let's understand each other.  I am under the impression that you are insisting on that question.  Do we agree that there were massacres?  
Q.	Can we go then to the -- to your evidence of the events in '94, and I well understand that whatever I may be submitting about the content of your evidence and its truthfulness, that the background of these events and your evidence is the death of your family.  I am very aware of that, and I am very aware whatever you say about Rwamakuba, how deeply, deeply hurt and upsetting going through this evidence must be.  

As I understand the position from your evidence this morning, on the 12th of April at Gishyaka parish in the commune of Gikomero, where I accept that there was a massacre of innocent people by Interahamwe, you told us that among the people who were killed was your mother and your four younger brothers; that is correct, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, that is true and there were neighbours who were also killed there. 
Q.	I accept and fully what you say about that.  When did you come to hear about your mother and brothers having been killed then?  Was it that day or was it another day?  
A.	I learnt of that sinister news on the day following their death. 
Q.	And was that -- and who brought you that news, can you remember?  
A.	The persons who had survived the massacre were able to escape from there, we met them the next day, and those are the persons who told us that there are people who had died, but as I have said already even those survivors went to the health centre and were victims to the massacre that took place there subsequently.  
Q.	I quite accept that.  So basically, once you got to the health centre on the evening of the 13th, it was then that you met refugees who had escaped -- survivors who had escaped from Gishyaka, who were able to tell you what had happened with your family.  Is that a correct summary of the position?  
A.	No, I didn't pay attention.  I arrived at the dispensary during the night, but don't ask me to tell you the date.  All I know is that I got there at night between the 13th and the 15th.  
(Pages 47 to 51 by Sithembiso Moyo)





























1715H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right, I hadn't understood that we had a span of dates like that.  I thought your evidence has, in fact, been very clear, that the Gishaka massacre was the 12th and that on the 13th, a day you'd never forget, as you've told us, you eventually made your way to the Kayanga health centre arriving at night and that the next day, Kamanzi gets you out and everyone out of the health centre and then later the same day, you've told us that Rwamakuba and others arrive and a massacre takes place.  Now -- 
A.	No, you haven't captured my statement faithfully. I have said that the massacres in the Gikomero commune began on the 12th at the Gishaka parish, not far from the Gikomero communal office.  Massacres continued and in my Kayanga secteur, the massacres began on the 13th, but the truth be told, I did not give you specific dates as to my arrival at the dispensery.  I told you that I hid myself but that I got to that place between the 13th and the 15th, and I'm going to reiterate, that the massacres began in my secteur of origin on the 13th and as far as I'm concerned, that is an immutable fact, but I did not say that I got to the dispensary on the 13th because I didn't give a specific date. 
Q.	Well, I'm afraid I think you did because we can trace your evidence and I'll just put it to you the once, that the massacres began in your secteur on the 13th.  You talked about your cows and the Interahamwe who came to tell you it was all over for the Tutsis, and how you made your way with two other people and you got to the health centre at night.  Are -- are you saying that you spent two days or more going from where your cows were pastured to the health centre? 
A.	After the start of the massacres on the 13th, everybody tried to flee.  And as far as I'm concerned, in the morning I learnt that the massacres had begun and my father told me that everyone had to defend himself like a man.  What this means is that we needed to look for -- to go into hiding.  

As far as I'm concerned, I didn't find a hiding place, but around 2 o'clock, I met the Interahamwe and Munyanzesa who told us that the fate of the Tutsis had been sealed and that they were going to eat our cows. 

Personally, I had no other choice.  I started going into hiding. I did not go directly to the health centre.  But between the 13th and the 15th, as I have told you already, and I think you also find this in my written statement, I arrived at the health centre.  Don't ask me to give you the precise date of my arrival at the health centre because you will not find that in my statement -- in my written statement; that date hasn't been mentioned anywhere.  You are the one who is making that declaration, not myself.  
Q.	Well, I -- I dispute that, but I'm not going to go into that.  Do you have your statement with you? 
A.	No, I know from memory what I said in my written statement, but I do not have the document with me.
Q.	When was the last time you had an opportunity of looking at it, the statement?  
A.	I'm not in a position to tell you the date on which I had the statement before me.  But I know that in Kigali, people came and read my statement to me and on that occasion, I saw my statement thereafter.  I saw the Prosecutor who prepared me -- for me to come and testify here.  But, in the meantime, I haven't seen the statement.  But what I'm telling you reflects what I said in my written statement. 
Q.	Can we agree on this, that the Gishaka massacre on the 12th, you can give a precise date about because it's the -- a date you cannot forget, as you told us this morning, that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	I agree with you. 
Q.	Can you remember where you spent that night -- the night of the 12th?  Was it at your family home? 
A.	Counsel, after the death of the president, President Habyarimana on the 7th of April, I did not sleep in a house.  I slept in the open air trying to save my skin.  That is how things happened.  I believe that the last time that I slept inside a house was before the 7th of April.  I am talking about the last time before that period, that was before the 7th of April. 
Q.	All right.  "When the massacres began in our secteur on the 13th of April" -- this was your evidence earlier today -- "I was supposed to go and herd the cows at home."  And then you said, "To look after the livestock."  So is that what you did on the morning of the 13th?  The day the massacres started in your secteur?  Did you go to your home to look after the livestock or did you go with the livestock from your home to a pasture? 
A.	I told you, if you listened to my evidence, that on the 13th in the morning, I took a stick with which I led the livestock to the pasture, because we didn't have a shepherd.  But I didn't later brought back the cattle home because the remainder were on the grazing land.  I was trying to escape at that time, so I left the livestock on their own. 
Q.	The morning of the 13th, sir, you went to look after the livestock.  Where were the livestock? 
A.	The livestock that I had to take to pasture was at home.  I have told you that I spent the night outside our residence trying to hide myself.  So in the morning of the 13th, I went and took the livestock from our house to take them to pasture, that is what I did. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that.  That's clear now, thank you.  And how far away from your home was the pasture?  Can you tell us?  Is it possible?  Can you measure that in metres?  100 metres, 500 metres, a kilometer?  What sort of distance is it, approximately?  I don't mean every -- to the metre, but approximately? 
A.	In Rwanda, everyone has his own piece of land and if you have livestock, you should use your own land as grazing land or pasture.  If you have other work to do, you do it on your own land.  What this means is that I let our livestock to my parents land -- going from our house.  But don't ask me for the distance that separated our house and the specific portion of our land to which I took the livestock.  If I knew that such a question would be put to me, I would have measured the distance before coming here in order to be in a position to give such a distance to you.  Thank you. 
Q.	Look, you're an intelligent young man.  You're at college; you're studying education.  I'm sure you can do better by way of an answer than that.  How far approximately, approximately was this pasturage from your home?  It's a simple question and it has a simple answer.  Can you provide it, please. 
A.	Your question is simple and I think I've given an answer to it.  I didn't make things complicated for you.  I gave you an answer to the best of my knowledge.  I cannot give you an estimate if I can't do so -- unless I would want to lie and that would be perjury, which is punishable. 
Q.	I don't want to perjure -- 
A.	And I believe -- I think you should take my answer as I gave it to you. 
Q.	Well, you -- you haven't given an answer.  Now, you were playing football you told the Court in Kamuhanda.  Let -- how far away is it from your home to the pasturage, if you measured it in football pitches?  How far would that be?  Five football pitches, ten football pitches, one football pitch?  That sort of distance, if that helps you.  It probably complicates it, but let's try it that way. I'm sure you can give us some idea of how far the cow pasture is from your home.  
A.	I'm not a footballer as you tend to claim.  I have told you that at -- while I'm talking to you, as I'm talking to you now, I'm a witness in this case.  But my profession is student.  I am not a statistician and I am not responsible for estimating the dimensions or sizes of lands of different people. 

If I knew that you were going to put that question to me, I would have prepared myself to answer you by measuring the distances in order to give them to you.  I cannot give you specific dimensions -- precise dimensions because in the event that I will give you a precise dimension and that you proceed to measure it, and in the event that you found that the dimension I gave you was not correct, you would say that I have lied.  Thank you. 
Q.	I don't think I would say that.  But let me ask you in a different way.  Walking from your home at a moderate pace, how long would it take you to get from home to the cow pasture?  Approximately?  Not to the minute.  5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, half an hour, an hour?  Can you help me, please. 
A.	Counsel, you do not want to accept my answers -- my explanations.  But I am trying not to be mistaken in my answers or to lie.  At the time of the events, I wasn't wearing a watch to be able to measure the time that it took me from our house to the pasture land. 

I am going to go home after giving evidence here, and I can promise you that once I return home, I will measure that distance or try to assess the time that it would take me from point A to point B and you'll have such information.  I do promise you that and I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must recall that although you are answering the lawyer's question, the evidence is coming to the Court and we will be assessing it. So you are not answering counsel, you are answering the Court through the questions put by counsel. You must understand that. 

Mr. Hooper, how much longer do you intend to be? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, that was 15 minutes on how far from home to the pasture.  And I'm not going to conclude this witness tonight, unless we're going to sit very late. I'm afraid -- I had hoped to conclude him today; we've had certain interruptions and the rest of it.  

But I'm going to be another hour and a half with him, I'd have thought at this rate.  But I will no longer pursue the question of distance of the cow pasture, unless by tomorrow morning, Mr. Witness, perhaps you could give it some thought.  Turn it over in your mind and perhaps come back with a sensible answer tomorrow.  That's my last request of you tonight, and I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Witness, with the President's leave. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, do you have an idea how long your next witness will be? 
MS. FALL:
I will not take much time.  Mr. President, I think 20 to 25 minutes maximum will be the time that I will take. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, you didn't get my question.  It's not the re-examination but it's the following witness.  
MS. FALL:
I have been briefed and I think it will take us one hour to conclude the examination-in-chief of the next witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Yes, we will take our adjournment now. 

Mr. Witness, we are going to take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.  As I mentioned to you earlier, during this or any other adjournment while you are a witness here, you are still a witness and you are not to discuss the case with anyone during the adjournments.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.
THE WITNESS:
I have understood very well, Mr. President. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I don't want to talk about it in open court but just thinking ahead of Thursday and Friday, and whether we could have some indication at some time perhaps through the registrar or as to what the position might be.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we should have been in a position to give a firm answer today, but we will be able to do so tomorrow morning.  But it's likely that what we said, we will stick to. 

Yes, we will adjourn until tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1734H)
