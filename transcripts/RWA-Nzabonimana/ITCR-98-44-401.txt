MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 4th of February 2010, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning, and I remind you, as I have done each morning, that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth.  

Mr. Webster, you can continue.  
MR. WEBSTER:
	Good morning to the Court.  
JUVÉNAL KAJELIJELI,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And to you, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, we were talking about your -- I believe we had gotten to the point of discussing your appointment as bourgmestre, but I want to take a slight detour and address something that we had talked about a bit yesterday.  
You recall you told us that you had arrested Musafiri once back in 1992, but you had never arrested Dusabe or Dusabimana.  That was your testimony from yesterday; am I correct? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Mr. Prosecutor, you forgot a detail.  What I said was this:  I got Dusabimana arrested as well.  And if you go over the records of yesterday, you would find that detail. 
Q.	I may have been mistaken and, in fact, now that you say it, I do recall.  You told us that his parents or Nyiramakuba was complaining about him abusing his younger brothers and asked for your assistance.  That's what you are referring to, right? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you are correct. 
Q.	So that was my mistake, and my apology for that.  But I'd like to take you back to your testimony on the 17th of April 2003 when you were testifying before Trial Chamber II in your own trial.  

Do you recall this exchange?  And I will read it.  I apologise to the French booth.  I don't have the page reference in French, but I will read slowly:  

Question: -- and this is in cross-examination from Ms. Ojemeni -- "Witness, you know Dusabimana, a relation of Joseph Nzirorera, don't you?"  

Your answer:  "Yes, I know him."  

Then there is a further question and answer about who he is, spelling of his name, that he was a retired soldier.  

And then the question:  "Where is he now, do you know?"  

Your answer:  "He's dead.  But I do not know where he's buried, but the information I have is that he's dead."  

Question:  "He was also an instructor and Interahamwe himself.  He was an instructor for the Interahamwe training.  He was an Interahamwe himself; isn't that correct?" 

And your answer, Mr. Witness, is:  "What I've already told you is that I do not know anything about his training.  Another thing I know about him, if you allow me, is that one time I arrested and detained him when he had harassed Tutsi women who were at Byangabo.  At that time I was bourgmestre, and that was in 1992.  That's all I know about him.  I even had to" -- and then there's a blank.  Apparently there's a gap in the translation -- "and his parents had to bring 4,000 to pay the fine.  All this is recorded at the commune.  He spent three nights at the bourgmestre (sic) and got out after being fined 4,000 francs because he had harassed Tutsi women."  

So now that I've reminded you about your testimony from April of 2003, do you remember anything more about when Dusabimana was arrested for harassing Tutsi women back in 1992? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I think the person who took the records made a mistake and noted that it was defending Tutsis.  But I arrested him because he had attacked Tutsis.  I, by the way, contested that fact in a long memo that I -- to my Defence counsel and who protested because of the poor translation.  That was never corrected, and if it has not been corrected to date, I believe that what I am telling you today is what is true.  And, by the way, the interpreters acknowledged that they made a mistake on that issue. 
Q.	You remember that particular point as being a point in controversy for the translation and the interpreters, Mr. Witness, the fact that you had arrested Dusabe for harassing two Tutsi women back in 1992? 
A.	Yes, I would like you to have that corrected.  The problem was not Tutsis.  The problem was with members of his family.  There was no problem with Tutsi women.  It had to do with a problem between him and members of his family. 
Q.	But the part about you keeping him in jail for three days and requiring a fine of 4,000 francs, that was not incorrectly transcribed.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	Thank you.  We were authorised to detain anyone only for as much as seven days or get such person to pay a fine.  So we opted for getting him to pay a fine, and we set him free and he left. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, are you sure that that particular arrest had nothing to do with the incident that is described in D. NZ652 that I read to you yesterday?  This is the report by a responsable de cellule who accuses Dusabimana, Musafiri and Niyigaba of harassing two Tutsi women apparently in Byangabo.  
A.	I repeat what I just told you a few minutes ago, and that is what is true.  So please take note of that. 
Q.	But one last question to you on this issue:  When you describe someone as harassing women, aren't you really referring to raping them?  Isn't that what you refer -- isn't that how you refer to rape of women when you want to be delicate about it? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I am bound to tell the truth here.  If he had raped women, that would have been in his file and that would have been a serious offence.  He was not arrested because he raped any women.  There was a criminal investigating police who -- inspector who could have sued him for such a crime.  Had that been the case, he would have been arrested and detained in Ruhengeri.  But he was not arrested for any such crimes.  It was for something else. 
Q.	And you still maintain that Iyamuremye was never arrested for rape back in 1992, and 
Rugumire -- Rugumire, excuse me.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I said that Rugumire was a bandit who was wanted by the security officials.  He was on the run, and we could not arrest him because he permanently was in hiding.  Whatever the case, at the time we never heard anyone talk about someone having raped any women.  I already said this before.  And I worked in close collaboration with security officials, and I knew the security situation within each secteur.  I never had to attend to cases of rape or sexual harassment while I was in office as bourgmestre.  Thank you. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We'll go on to something else now.  

So let's move back towards the month of March 1994.  And I believe you told us that you went to the bureau communal in Mukingo on the 8th of April and that following the 8th of April, the very next time that you went there was on the 26th of April.  Is that your evidence, or would you like to clarify that?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I just said I went to the Mukingo communal office on the 8th of April 1994 in the afternoon.  And I said that I returned on the 9th of April 1994 when we went to bury the bourgmestre who had died.  And I returned there on a third occasion when elections had taken place on the 26th of April 1994.  I recall those dates very clearly, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  So you did not participate in the meetings that took place at the bureau communal between the 12th and the 24th of April.
A.	No, I did not attend the said meetings, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
Q.	And on the 26th of April you just happened to pass by the bureau communal and discovered the fortunate circumstance of an election being organised? 
A.	I said I had -- I was working on my own.  I opened a business.  I had workers dealing in firewood.  And when I was going past the communal office, I noticed that elections were taking place.  And so out of curiosity I went in just to see exactly that which was happening. 
Q.	You noticed that from the roadway, that elections were taking place inside the bureau communal? 
A.	Well, I saw a car of the préfecture, and I was curious. 
Q.	I'm sorry.  I missed your last answer, Mr. Witness.  Could you repeat it for me, please.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I was on my way, and I saw this vehicle that was belonging to the préfecture office back there at the communal office.  And out of curiosity I stopped.  I just wanted to know exactly whether there was anything new, whether anything was amiss or something that was out of the ordinary.  And so I went in there, and I found a crowd of people.  And the technical committee was there, the development committee of the commune was there, and many other civil servants were there.  There were quite many in number.  I stayed there for quite some time, and then instructions were given concerning the said elections.  That was what happened. 
Q.	Now, you yourself were a member of the communal development council when you were bourgmestre.  But after you were removed from office in March of 1993, you didn't have any credential to be a member of that council; isn't that so?  Or you can clarify that for us.
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	And you were not a member of the technical committee or any of the bodies that were associated with the communal development council after you left your office -- after you were no longer bourgmestre.
A.	You are right. 
Q.	And the elections that were being held, were these elections of the communal development council itself, or were these general elections of -- for the entire commune? 
A.	It was the extended communal development council, which was made up of the technical committee as well as chiefs of services at communal level and leaders of religious groups and all other persons that were needed.  All these persons were there present on that day at the communal office. 
Q.	But you had no status to participate in the extended communal development council, did you? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I took part at that meeting on an observer basis, and I presented my candidature, as everybody would do.  We asked for the requirements to be able to field one's candidacy.  And I was not the only one to do so.  And there were other persons there who were not members of this communal development council.  

My candidacy was upheld.  They explained the required conditions.  And I realised I could submit my candidature and I did so.  I therefore submitted my candidature without any problem.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	You had a very different way of describing the functioning of the communal development council when you testified back in April of 2003.  But I'm not going to trouble us with that.  But in any case, I'll remind you that when you testified in April of 2003 you said nothing about you having any status or any capacity to participate in that body for the election.  You described how a bourgmestre could be chosen, and you seemed to suggest that only persons who were on the commission had a vote or participated in selecting candidates for the post of bourgmestre that could then be submitted to the minister of the interior.  

Do you want to comment on that? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, what I said concerning the elections has not changed.  And what I said at the time is what I am repeating today.  These elections took place.  They indeed took place.  And you'll find that in many testimonies here at the Tribunal you know exactly what happened.  And, by the way, there are people who attended those elections who came and testified here.  And the representative of the préfet during those elections did a report, which is in your keeping.  I do not deny that report, at least the content of that report, and government council respects the results of those elections.  

So, Mr. Prosecutor, I don't think we should dwell overly lengthily on this and waste our time.  All I require or all I seek is that the Judges should understand that the said elections took place in conformity with the law.  That is all I have to say.  And I thank you, Mr. President.  I thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, we are fortunate to have quite a number of documents that address the issue of that election --  not the election but your appointment in Mukingo.  And these documents were not available to the ICTR back when you were being tried.  And I'd suggest to you that the first time you've reviewed these documents was probably this past weekend with Mr. Robinson, because most of them were never addressed to you or copied to you.  Is that so, that you are really referring to documents that you saw for the first time just this past weekend? 
A.	Counsel, you surprise me at each time.  You just sent the documents to me when you sent the other documents to me.  So when I answer you, I am basing myself on the pieces of information in my keeping.  I never had time to read all the bundle of documents.  But I do not need all the documents to be able to recall the unfolding of those elections.  

And the government council did not endorse the decisions of that election if those elections did not take place.  And so if you do not accept that those elections took place, well, that's up to you.  So far as I am concerned, these elections took place, and that was the only procedure in place at the time.  It was impossible to become a bourgmestre without having submitted your candidacy and without having been elected. 
Q.	In any case, we can agree that Ndisetse participated in the meeting because he had the capacity to do so as a conseiller and as one of the former bourgmestres.  And Niyoyito was there at the beginning, but he left in disgust after it started because he was being removed as bourgmestre.  Are we agreed on that?  
A.	Thank you, Your Honours.  All the said persons attended that meeting and participated in those elections.  In fact, they also signed the decisions taken at the end of that election.  They did a report and forwarded it to the préfet who, in turn, sent it to government, and government decided to respect the decision -- or the outcome of those elections and, by so doing, they contradicted the latter decision that had been taken by the préfet.  

The government decision was the only one that was respected or held, because it was based on the wishes of the population as expressed in the election.  There was no other meeting to change the results of those elections.  And even if that had taken place, that would have been illegal, especially as after those elections a report which was forwarded to government council was done.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, once again -- 
A.	If any other decision had been taken, it would have been illegal. 
Q.	Your responses are too long.  We are going to go through all of this.  You will be able to tell us everything that you are trying to say right now.  But if I ask you a question, just respond to the question and let's move on, and we'll cover all of this ground in due course, all right?  

Now, you just told us that your election was the voice of the people.  Didn't you just tell us that those who were voting were those who were on the communal development council?  That's quite a bit different than suggesting your election was the voice of the people.  Wouldn't you agree?  A brief response, please.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I am referring to members of the population, because those who had participated in those elections officially represented members of the population.  There were chiefs of services present, and what they did was done on behalf of the population, and nobody protested.  
Q.	Well, you are right about one thing, because Niyoyita and Ndisetse both testified in this trial, and they were both consistent on one point, which is that you got the most votes.  But according to Niyoyita, that was information that was told to him because he did not stay for the entire meeting.  He was not there for the voting.  Someone informed him about the results of the election afterwards because he left in disgust.  And what Ndisetse says is that you got the most votes but that the commission did not recommend your appointment because of your horrendous human rights record and because of your previous removal.

So my question to you now, Mr. Witness, is:  How did you know what the CDC recommended?  You were not a member.  I presume you didn't author the minutes of that meeting.  How do you know what the commission recommended? 
A.	Thank you.  Mr. President, Your Honours, after the elections -- after elections all over the world, particularly in developed countries, the counting is done as the elections go on, and the ballots are counted at the end.  And I wanted to know this because I wanted to know exactly how many votes I got so as to know whether I had been elected or not.  And if I had been elected, I had to prepare myself consequently.  And, by the way, nothing stopped me from seeking to know exactly the contents of that report, because it was in my interests just to make sure that nobody cheated me.  It was important for me to know the results of those elections. 
Q.	In any case, according to a document that we have in evidence, which is identified as P. 402, which is a memorandum signed by Préfet Basile on the 29th of April -- not May, as you suggested -- the 
29th of April, he appointed Semahane because the commission -- or the communal development council sent him three names, of which he could choose one, and he doesn't say anything about an election in his memorandum.  And I believe you have reviewed it already.  I can place it before you so you can look at it again, but I don't think it's worth the trouble of actually reading it again here in trial.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could pass this document to the witness so he can satisfy himself.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But at the second or third paragraph you will note that the préfet doesn't say anything about elections.  He simply says that the commission did what he instructed them to do, which is to send him 
three names of which he chose the most appropriate candidate.  

Then the next document we have is already admitted in evidence.  It's identified on our record as 
P. 403, and this is another memorandum of Préfet Basile.  And here we see that on the 11th of May he is reacting angrily, because some people were complaining about his choice.  And this is a memorandum that he's directing, once again, to the authorities in Mukingo commune.  

And he says at paragraph 1 -- or article 1 of that memorandum, scolding, in fact, the recipients of this memorandum, "The préfet did not request elections, as those who spread the intrigue stated.  If I put Semahane, Célestin, in that post, it is because he fulfilled the most requirements.  Other explanations will be given to the population in a meeting, if need be."  

And what I would suggest to you, Mr. Kajelijeli, is that the intrigue that he's referring to is intrigue that has its source in you.

Do you wish to comment, or should I continue with the next document?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the decision taken by the préfet on the 29th April 1994 -- 29th April 1994, the Prosecutor does not add anything by saying that these intrigues were -- or you said myself.  That's not in the memo.  

Please, the Prosecutor should stop intimidating me, and the Trial Chamber should restrain the Prosecutor from harassing me.  I am here as a witness, and I am entitled to rights, just as 
Prosecution witnesses have rights.  

If people have copies of that memorandum, let them read it carefully.  That decision by the préfet states that Semahane was appointed as bourgmestre -- as interim bourgmestre.  And so he was not appointed bourgmestre, as the Prosecutor would have us understand.  If he was interim bourgmestre, then it was because he was waiting for the supreme authorities to take a final decision to that effect.  

The decision of the préfet was taken, and even if people were not happy, even if unhappy, Semahane was appointed interim bourgmestre until the moment when I was appointed bourgmestre by government.  As for me, when I was appointed bourgmestre, I was not just interim bourgmestre.  I was the bourgmestre to replace an interim bourgmestre.  This document and the other which you will produce will not help the Judges in understanding the situation and will change nothing regarding the fact that I was appointed, I, Kajelijeli, as bourgmestre.  

There was an official system that was put in place for the appointment of bourgmestres, and it was that system that was implemented.  Thank you very much, Your Honours. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Kajelijeli, the word intrigue is not my invention.  I'm not using that word to accuse you.  I am simply repeating the same word that appears in Préfet Basile's memorandum.  So he is the one that's accusing you of intrigue.  

And we see that quite clearly when we look at his letter of the 19th of May 1994 to 
Prime Minister Jean Kambanda.  And this also is a document that is already in evidence.  It's identified in our record as P. 404.  And it's a document that I'm sure you have reviewed because you even referred to your own correspondence, which is referenced in this letter.  And I will read, in French, portions of this document, once again dated the 19th of May, addressed to:  

"Your Excellency, the prime minister:  I have the honour to provide hereunder further information on the letter which Mr. Kajelijeli, Juvénal, earlier wrote to you on the 5th of May 1994 with respect to the appointment of the new bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune and which was copied to me."  

Then the préfet goes on to describe the circumstances of meetings in opposition to the former interim bourgmestre, and he states again in French:  

"Given the circumstances, I asked the said council to meet urgently and to present me 
three candidates, one of which I would choose in accordance with -- based on his competence in accordance with article 16 of law number" -- which he identifies.  

Continuing in French:  

"I had asked to choose the candidates to be chosen from the staff of the commune.  But overriding this recommendation, the council also included Mr. Kajelijeli, Juvénal, former bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune, who had been removed from office and who presently has no role, neither in the administration of the commune nor in its bodies."  

Then he goes on that he appointed Semahane.  And here is the paragraph that I think should interest us most, Mr. Witness, and it's the first paragraph on the second page of the letter, and again I will read in French:  

"It's very unlikely that the unhappy group which is trying to impose Mr. Kajelijeli, Juvénal, as bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune is the action on behalf of the population.  Rather, they may have an avowed interest in defending -- wish to defend by trying to be involved in the management of the commune.  In spite of the initiatives of some people who orally contest, or in writing, I would like to confirm to you that the activities of the Mukingo commune are going on normally under 
Mr. Semahane, Célestin's, rule, as I had written before."  

So, Mr. Witness, wouldn't you agree with me, this letter from the préfet of the 19th of May 1994 casts a very different view or picture of the election process and the appointment process than you've been telling this Court? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, for giving me the floor.  I would like to inform the Chamber that yesterday we talked about political parties in the opposition, political parties who were opposed to the power in place.  

The préfet referred to by the Prosecutor did not carry out his duties as required of a préfet in a democratic system.  He was a préfet who was a member of the MDR.  And when he came to the préfecture, he installed a dictatorship allowing him to appoint Semahane as bourgmestre.  When I learnt about this, I considered it as being unfair, and I referred to the prime minister to the effect that I had been a victim of intrigues, since it is the prime minister who had the ultimate decision to take with respect to the decision of the préfet and the decision of the electoral group in view of taking a satisfactory decision for the population.  

So what I am saying is that what you just read there is a letter from someone who is in an opposition party, whereas we were for a neutral democracy that respected the interests of the entire population.  The préfet had no right to take a decision that was against the instructions with regard to the election of the bourgmestre.  Therefore, the préfet had no local standing to contradict the decision of the electoral group.  

So irrespective of whether the Prosecutor is happy with that, that is the decision that was taken, and it respected legal existing texts.  And, as you know, you have legal bodies that can decide on such issues.  So the Prosecutor should not waste the time of the Chamber by referring to those elections.  This is not a time when we are going to challenge the decisions of the election group.  The Prosecutor cannot do anything. The decision was taken, and it was respected, and it is also -- it also respected the existing and applicable legal instruments at the time.  
Q.	Didn't you tell us yesterday that you had no known political affiliation; you weren't a member of a party and you weren't known to be a member of any party? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I would pray you, Mr. President, to be patient with me as you have always been, and I know you continuously assist witnesses.  I think that that letter which the Prosecutor has just read should be considered as proof that Kajelijeli had no place in the communal authority.  The Prosecutor stated before that I played a role in the decision -- of the decisions taken by the commune.  This letter, Mr. President and Your Honours, should be considered as evidence that I had no role to play within the commune.  And the préfet was impudent enough to appoint somebody to a post to which the person was not elected. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, what I was bringing your attention to was the contradiction between the logic of your response of five minutes ago and your previous statement that you had no known political affiliation, because you blame Préfet Basile for not appointing you because he was with the MDR and a party of the opposition.  Opposition to what?  You told us that you didn't have a political party.  And your argument would only make sense if Semahane was also a member of the MDR.  Is that what you are suggesting?  Was Semahane a member of the MDR? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, if you were to read the minutes of what I said yesterday, then you said I said that Semahane was a member of the MDR party, and I stated that when -- with the advent of multipartyism in Rwanda, a ministry of communal development was published -- published 
something -- published a notice forbidding bourgmestres from participating in political activities.  

When I was bourgmestre in the Mukingo commune, I was neutral.  I had no political agenda belonging to any political party.  And when I put in my candidacy for the second time, I was still neutral.  I was not a militant of any party.  That is the answer I am giving.  And if you accept it as it is, that would allow us to save some time. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the evidence in this trial so far comes from two Defence witnesses who claim that you were not recommended by the commission because you were unacceptable.  You were still an embarrassment because of your horrendous human rights record and the fact that you had already been removed.  That's Niyoyita's testimony, and that's Ndisetse's testimony.  And here we have the letter -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I hesitate to intervene, but I think Mr. Webster has really mischaracterised the testimony of those two witnesses.  There's nothing that they said about embarrassment or reprehensible conduct.  If we look at the transcripts of their testimony, you will find nothing like that.  So I think Mr. Webster needs to rephrase his question to track more closely what the witnesses said if he is going to put that to this witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That may be a fair comment, but I don't have the transcripts in front of me.  But just for the record, I'll refer whoever reads the transcripts to Ndisetse's testimony of the 23rd of November 2009 at 
pages 24 and 25 and 24th of November at pages 29 to 30 and Niyoyita's testimony of the 
29th of November at pages 11 and 12.  

But perhaps I emphasised unduly or placed their words in stronger terms, I'm not sure, but I'll heed 
Mr. Robinson's caution.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In any case, they both testified, Mr. Kajelijeli, that the commission did not recommend you.
A.	I would comment that I'm not surprised, since you're the one who is saying that.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm not surprised that the Prosecutor is saying such things, because the testimonies of the witnesses referred to by the Prosecutor did not use the words that he just used.  Yesterday we talked about the term "tarnish someone's image," which is what the counsel for the Prosecution is doing.  

Mr. President, Your Honours and the entire Chamber, the commission had nothing to say with respect to elections that had already been conducted.  And the préfet who appointed Semahane was duty of ultra vires.  They had elections and they probably had to wait for the results of those elections.  

And I would like to inform the Chamber that there was only one commission, the electoral commission.  Semahane did not have to be -- did not have to be appointed because the commission, 
electoral commission, had to respect the existing regulations.  And if such testimonies were made by those witnesses, then they must have been mistaken because they may have spent too much time in prison.  The préfet had no power to appoint Semahane as préfet on a permanent basis.  Rather, it was the outcome of the elections which had to be forwarded to the minister of the interior, which then had to ask the government -- the cabinet to ask the president of the republic to make -- issue a
presidential decree, which is what was done.  

With regard to everything else, the decisions that were taken were of no value.  We have intellectuals here, the President of the Chamber, Judges who assist them and who know electoral processes in their country.  The Prosecutor cannot try to change electoral decisions that were taken and to make them seem to be what they did not -- what they were not indeed. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, you are right about one thing, and that is that the interim government did overrule the préfet and reappointed you anyway, even though that was not his recommendation and it was not the recommendation of the communal development council, which is as much a commentary on your usefulness to them as their bad judgement.  

Now, did you ever speak directly to the MDR -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I think you are becoming too argumentative.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  All right.  I will reformulate and try to move more quickly.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did you ever speak directly to Jean Kambanda?  Was there ever any communication other than your letter of the 5th of May in regard to this issue that you wanted to be appointed but Préfet Basile refused to appoint you? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, for listening attentively to my testimony.  I do not know Kambanda.  I heard about him.  I heard that he was a member of the MDR.  I sent him a letter of protest.  You do not want to read it to the Bench for them to know about it.  And I noted that I know Jean Kambanda through the papers, and then I met him in exile.  Otherwise, I didn't know him in Rwanda. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, do you have a copy of that letter of the 5th of May 1994?
A.	You didn't send it to me. 
Q.	The question was:  Do you have a copy of it?  
A.	I don't have it. 
Q.	And the Prosecution also does not have a copy of that letter.  If we had a copy of the letter, certainly it would be a part of the record, but we don't have it.  You and you alone can tell us what its contents were.  So your response is that you never discussed this issue personally with Jean Kambanda.  Were you aware that Jean Kambanda was in Ruhengeri on the 6th of May 1994?  It may have been in Ruhengeri town, or it may have been Mukingo.  You can tell us if that's the case.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I just learnt about this from the Prosecutor.  I have continuously told the members of the Bench that I had started my own private business and I was no longer involved with what was happening in the Mukingo commune.  I had no control.  I did not monitor who came and went in the Mukingo commune.  I had my own private business, which did not allow me to be aware of everything that was happening in the Mukingo commune.  Thank you.  I did not see Kambanda at the date referred to by the Prosecutor. 
Q.	In any case, there's some documentation of a pacification meeting that was organised by the interim government on the 6th of May in Ruhengeri where a whole delegation from the interim government was present to deliver a message of peace to the people of Ruhengeri.  The message couldn't have been very effective if even you didn't hear of it.  You're telling us you didn't even hear of this meeting that took place on the 6th of May? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I have continuously said that the Ruhengeri region was a region that was at war.  Everyone was getting ready to flee.  And I wasn't in a position to monitor everything that was happening.  I would like to confirm to the Bench that I was not aware that that event happened.  I was not aware of it. 
Q.	There's also some documentation to the effect that President Sindikubwabo was in Ruhengeri on the 29th of April 1994, and this is contained in another memorandum from Préfet Basile where he attaches a summary of his activities with President Sindikubwabo on the 29th of April 1994.  Were you aware that Sindikubwabo was in Ruhengeri in late April 1994?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Yes, indeed, I learnt that he went through Ruhengeri, but I learnt this over the radio.  Personally I was not part of the people who welcomed him.  Hence, I am unable to comment about his trip through Ruhengeri.  Thank you. 
Q.	Do you know if he passed through Mukingo commune? 
A.	I already answered your question by stating that I was unaware of his stay in Ruhengeri.  Thank you. 
Q.	Did you have -- did you ever have any direct contact with the minister of interior, Karemera, in regard to your frustration at not being appointed bourgmestre? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, there was a procedure, and I honored that procedure.  I wrote -- meaning that I know Karemera only in Kigali prior to the war.  And at the time his office was in Kigali.  During that period when I presented my candidacy, I did not meet his excellency Karemera.  Rather, I met him while we were in exile.  He is here in this Chamber.  You can ask him.  I did not meet him.  Thank you. 
Q.	What about the minister of defence, Bizimana?  Both he, Bizimana, and Karemera were present in Ruhengeri around the 18th or the 19th of April.  Did you see either one of them at that time? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to pray you to assist me in answering the Prosecutor.  Either he doesn't want to hear what I am telling him or I am poorly interpreted.  I am stating that during that time I was conducting my own private business to -- in order to feed my family.  I couldn't go here and there for business that was of no interest to me and which could actually go contrary to my interests.  You are talking to me about Karemera's trip and the minister of defence's trip.  Well, at the time I was not interested in their movements.  Thank you.  
Q.	There is evidence in this trial that your appointment was discussed in cabinet meetings of the interim government on the 10th of April -- excuse me, 10th of June and the 17th of June.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	I would like to inform the President of the Chamber as well as the Judges assisting him that I never heard about that meeting and I couldn't have learnt about this.  As a matter of fact, it was not part of the pieces of information I had access to.  With respect to the cabinet meetings, I am basing myself on documents, and I would like to read those documents if they are in the keeping of the Prosecutor. 
Q.	In any case, minister of interior Karemera kept a diary or a notebook of his meetings with the cabinet.  And the copies are admitted in evidence at P. 227 and P. 225, and each of those address the meeting of the 10th of June and the 17th of June.  But they are just bullet points.  He is not very descriptive of the discussions that were held.  

But we also have at our disposal the diary of another minister who participated in those meetings, and here I refer to a document that's in our bundle.  I believe I handed it out two days ago.  It's towards the end of tab 3.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I have copies for the Court and for Mr. Kajelijeli, if Mr. Issa would assist, and I have tabbed it for easy reference.  The Defence and the interpreters already have a copy.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And I'm looking at the page which is identified by K number K0243647, and this is the notebook of the minister of planning, Augustin Ngirabatware -- and it was seized from him pursuant to a warrant several years ago -- in his handwriting, and he writes in regard to the meeting of the 10th of June, Mukingo, and I will read in French:  

"Interim bourgmestre appointed by Préfet Semahane.  Whereas the preselection had taken place, Kajelijeli had been in the preselection.  Kajelijeli, who had been elected in the preselection.  The locals asked for the return of Mr. Kajelijeli, Juvénal, should be considered."  

So Mr. Ngirabatware seems to represent things in the same way that you do, Mr. Kajelijeli.  Would you have any idea how he would get that information, since that's not what was included in Préfet Basile's memoranda? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, and you gentlemen who are assisting the Accused in this trial.  It's only now that I learnt about the existence of this document by Ngirabatware, and that document is very important as it answers the questions put forward by the Prosecutor.  

I was appointed bourgmestre subsequent to elections, which is what that document says, and that was said pursuant to the directives of multipartyism.  No one had to be appointed by an individual.  The préfet had no power to appoint someone as bourgmestre without going through that electoral system.  That is what Ngirabatware is saying, and that was what indeed happened.  

And you said that that was dated on the 10th in the diary of the minister.  I had written a letter to the prime minister on the 5th of June.  When the recent expected government had a cabinet meeting, all participants sent agendas to examine it prior to the meeting.  So it isn't surprising that you found that in Ngirabatware's diary because I had already sent a letter to challenge that decision to the prime minister.  Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
Q.	But, Mr. Kajelijeli, couldn't Joseph Nzirorera have been helpful to you in your quest to be appointed bourgmestre? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, the counsel for the Prosecutor and you, the members of the Defence team.  At the time we are talking about, Nzirorera could not have been of any use to me as he was not a cabinet member.  I had already won the elections, and he hadn't taken part in the elections, meaning that you mentioned that name because you are trying to accuse us in the same case with the sole intention of tarnishing our images.  

But I would like to confirm before this august Trial Chamber that Nzirorera had no role to play in those elections, and the Prosecutor from the onset acknowledged that I had been elected, I had won the highest number of votes and that the bourgmestre had been elected.  So the process had been respected, and Nzirorera did not have to intervene because everything had been done in accordance with the law.  It is the préfet who tried to -- not to respect the law.  He tried not -- he tried to violate the law, and the hierarchy did not allow him to do so.  

In a democratic setting when there is a problem, we resort to the judiciary, but I did not have any need for any form of assistance from whomsoever during these elections.  Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
Q.	In any case, Mr. Kajelijeli, after reviewing all of the documentation that had been signed or transmitted from or through Préfet Basile Nsabumugisha that was produced actually as these events were happening after having reviewed those materials, the Office of the Prosecution went back to 
Préfet Basile and asked him about those documents.  And that conversation or that interview is documented in an interview note of the 3rd of December 2009, which is also included in the bundle of exhibits that I distributed.  It's at the very beginning of tab 3.    

And I'd like to read you a portion of what Préfet Basile had to say about that whole issue.  And here I am reading from -- I believe it's the third page of the English text.  There is no French translation:  

"The ministry of interior had requested three nominees for the post of the bourgmestre of Mukingo.  Préfet Basile forwarded to the ministry of interior all names of those who had presented their candidacy together with their votes and clearly indicated that Semahane was the preferred choice because he fulfilled all criteria.  

"In spite of a lot of pressure from Kajelijeli's group, Préfet Basile did not send his name as it was not an appropriate choice, and moreover, he was not supported by many people except his group and the youth.  

"He," referring to Kajelijeli, "was also not supported by the council, and he was at the fifth or sixth place in the voting.  But Kajelijeli was appointed by the government, and how he was appointed was a state secret.  The government imposed him on the population of Mukingo commune.  

"Préfet Basile explained that he sent a letter to the government with his recommendation of the first three names and also recounted the proceedings of the commune development council."  

And then he goes on to discuss other things, including that Préfet Basile came to know about the Amahindure in April of 1994 as soon as he started functioning as the préfet of Ruhengeri.  They were in Mukingo and Nkuli communes.  When the government started the civil defence programme, then those Amahindure got involved in the civil defence programme in those two communes.  

Préfet Basile explained that he attended Kajelijeli's swearing-in ceremony most probably on the 26th of June 1994 and that it was his responsibility to present the administrative head of the préfecture.  At that time civil defence people carrying wooden guns did a march past, and they were well trained and disciplined.  Joseph Nzirorera was there.  He does not remember whether or not Joseph Nzirorera spoke.  
So that's the most recent information that we have from Préfet Basile.  And what he says is that you were imposed -- you, Mr. Kajelijeli, were imposed on the commune contrary to his recommendation, contrary to the recommendation of the communal development council, and imposed by the interim government for reasons that he does not know.  

Do you have anything to say about that?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Prosecutor, Defence team, you need to help me to get the Prosecutor to understand my statements.  You're saying that you interviewed Basile on the 
30th of November 2008.  

But why did you interview him when he had testified here?  He spoke about me for a long time, and I am using his statement because it contradicts all the allegations you have levelled against me.  You and the Rwandan authorities, you have put him in difficulty, in a position which forced him to say that which he said.  Mr. President and Your Honours can read the testimony of Basile before this Trial Chamber.  And he talked about me, Kajelijeli.  He said how I was appointed and that I did not play any role in that which happened in the Mukingo commune in his testimony.  

What he says contradicts what you have just said, and his testimony has more value than your interview.  When you go to Rwanda and you want people to tell you what you want to hear, pressure is put on the people and they (inaudible) other items.  Basile and the Rwandan authorities were not at ease.  That said, he said what he said for his own safety.  And so it would be necessary that the Judges would base themselves on his testimony.  You have computers; you have records.  You realise that Préfet Basile talked about Kajelijeli.  And I continue to say that you should not base yourself on the interview of Mr. Prosecutor.  

And, by the way, you should recall that he was in the opposition and, therefore, you cannot devote much value to the interview which Basile did with the Prosecutor.  
Q.	In any case, Mr. Kajelijeli, your account and your analysis of the process is on the record, as are the documents and the testimony of other witnesses.  And the Chamber can go through it and make its own assessment of the value of the information and whether it is consistent in any way.  

But I am curious about one thing that you told us in your direct exam with Mr. Robinson.  At one point you mentioned that you had a grudge against Joseph Nzirorera because he didn't congratulate you on your election.  Do you remember when you said that around two days ago? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I did not say it exactly as you put it, that I was not happy because he did not congratulate me.  But I did not talk about his behavior.  I said I was at the swearing-in ceremony, and I don't think your description, the way you put it, is accurate.  That's not what I said.  
I said that he should have been happy and he should have congratulated me but he did not do so, even though he was right there at my swearing-in ceremony.  But I think that even his mere presence at that ceremony was enough for me.  So please, do not read some other meaning into what I said.  He was there, and I was happy that he had come all the way.  And so please, do not lend any other connotation to my statements.  And please, I would like you to correct that because that is not what I intended to say.  I did not talk about his behavior.  He behaved himself very well.  And all along he has behaved himself only too well.  I have nothing to say about that. 
Q.	Well, I understood you to be saying something very different, Mr. Witness, because my recollection is that you were being asked by Mr. Robinson if you had contacted Mr. Nzirorera for his assistance to get you appointed before the reinstallation ceremony on the 26th of June.  The way the questioning was developing, you claimed that you had been elected but you could not be seated.  And Mr. Robinson asked you if you had contacted Mr. Nzirorera to get his assistance in getting your appointment confirmed.  And your response to him was that no, you didn't contact Mr. Nzirorera.  At that time you even had a grudge against him because he didn't congratulate you.  

And it's on page 43 of the draft transcript.  I can read it so that I cannot be accused of misrepresenting something.  This is my characterisation.  But let me read exactly what it says, starting at line 21 on 
page 43 of the English text.  And this is the transcripts of Monday, the 1st of February:  

Question:  "Now, did Joseph Nzirorera have anything to do with your appointment as bourgmestre by the cabinet?"  

So clearly this is before the 17th of June.  

The answer:  "Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I'd already heard it said that Nzirorera supported me, but my answer was as follows, namely, that the people who said that lied.  Nzirorera was not a cabinet member or in any case did not attend their meetings, and I had bore a grudge against him at that time because he did not send me a message of congratulations.  I worked on my own, and he had his business issues."  

So it seems that you are addressing yourself to the period between the 26th of April and the 
17th of June, Mr. Witness.
A.	Please replace the answer which I just gave you and with my own answer.  My current response should be used to replace that which was given to you on the 1st of February 2010.  I don't think the interpreters understood exactly what I was saying.  That was not what I set out to say.  I could not say that because he attended my swearing-in ceremony, and I'm only very, very happy that you have noted this, failing which that error would have abided in the transcripts and people would have lent meaning to what I said and which I did not in fact say. 
Q.	Well, that's your characterisation now, and I think you are trying to backstep, because clearly the implication of the response you gave on the 1st of February was that somehow Nzirorera knew of your election.  So my question to you is:  How would Nzirorera have learned of your election if you didn't tell him? 
A.	Thank you.  The elections did not take place behind closed doors.  This was in public.  Each 
candidate -- each person voted behind closed doors, after which the ballots were counted and names were put on a list, and it was impossible for Nzirorera to ignore the fact that elections had taken place in Mukingo.  Even if he was abroad, I think that these elections were broadcast over the radio.  

It was a region that was at war, and people would have wanted to know whether these elections took place without any problems.  And so it was not necessary that I should go out to look for him specially and tell him that, "Look, I was elected."  Everybody got to know that elections had taken place.  And that was a sign that democracy had begun working smoothly in Rwanda.  And but for the war and the bloodbath that followed, that would have continued.  

It was not only Rwandans who got to know that I was elected.  Even foreigners got to know the results of these elections, and they knew that I had been elected. 
Q.	Well, your response is on the record, and it remains for the Judges to decide if they are convinced by your response.  But I must say to you that it sounds rather farfetched to suggest that the elections of the communal development council in Mukingo commune would be broadcast on the radio and communicated internationally, which is just what you have told us.  But, in any case, we will move on.  

Let's talk about the reinstallation ceremony that took place on the 26th of June.  Now, you told us that Nzirorera attended this reinstallation ceremony.  Did you invite him, or did he just turn up? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  It was the préfet of Ruhengeri who chaired that ceremony.  It was an official ceremony.  And the préfet, among the people that were at the head 
of -- that were chairing that ceremony, it was him who invited the various authorities and who handled issues of security at that ceremony.  

It was the préfet who invited the communal authorities under Semahane to organise that ceremony.  I played no role in preparing the events.  Once you have not yet sworn -- taken an oath of office, Mr. President, Your Honours, you're not officially in office and you cannot sit in the office for which you were elected.  So how could I have been able to invite whosoever?  It was the conseiller and the officials who took charge of the invitations and all those who were invited to the ceremony. 
Q.	Well, let's go back to the interview note that was taken from Préfet Basile on the 3rd of December 2009, because on the fourth paragraph of the third page he talks about the installation -- reinstallation ceremony.  And he was asked about the presence of Joseph Nzirorera.  And he told us that 
Joseph Nzirorera was there.  He came because he was a native of Mukingo commune and an influential person and secretary general of the MRND.  The former préfet doesn't say anything about inviting Joseph Nzirorera.  

And he goes on to say that Joseph Nzirorera was not a part of the administration.  It seems to me that if it was the préfet that invited Joseph Nzirorera to be present, that's the type of information he would have provided when we spoke to him back on the 3rd of December 2009.  I may be wrong.  But that's the reasonable proposition I am putting to you.  

So I will ask you the question again:  Did you invite Joseph Nzirorera, or did he just turn up?  Were you surprised to see him when he appeared at that ceremony on the 26th of June?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  It was the préfet who chaired that ceremony.  It was highly attended.  There were many people, many people that I did not know.  And Nzirorera came there.  It was his right.  He hailed from the Mukingo commune, and he would come there.  I also noted that many refugees were in the region.  There were members of political parties, such as Munyarukiko.  If the préfet told you that he did not invite Nzirorera, well, Nzirorera had the right to come.  This was taking place in his region.  But as for me, I did not send out any invitation cards.  

And I'd like to ask the President as well as the Judges to accept my testimony as such.  I had just been elected, and I did not send out any invitation cards to whosoever. 
Q.	Do you know if he made a special trip from Gisenyi?  Or did he just happen to be staying in Mukingo in late June when this ceremony took place? 
A.	I cannot remember.  I really cannot remember.  I'm sorry about that.  There were many people who came for that ceremony.  Many came by the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi roads.  But whatever the case, it's difficult for me to tell you exactly from where he came.  I really cannot recall. 
Q.	And prior to the 26th of April when you saw him at that ceremony, when was the last time that you had any substantive conversation with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Before that date I did not have time to talk with Nzirorera.  I was very occupied with my own activities.  We were in a war-torn period, and people had lost their heads and exactly did not know what to do.  

When I was answering Counsel Robinson's questions, I said that I met him around the 12th of April when he had taken his family away and they fled to Mukingo.  And after that he immediately returned.  I myself was seeking the best way and means of helping my family because we were in a period of war and there was little time to sit down to talk or chat.  Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Q.	So if I understand you correctly, on the 12th of April you didn't have much of a conversation with him.  You just noted the fact that he was in Mukingo and he had brought his family from Kigali.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	Yes, thank you. 
Q.	So prior to the 12th of April, when was the last time that you had any meaningful conversation with 
Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Before the 12th of April I did not meet Nzirorera often.  It was a war period and I was very, very busy.  I do not know the availability of Nzirorera.  And in any event, so far as I am concerned, I did not have time to sit down and discuss with him. 
Q.	Well, in your testimony on Monday when you were answering questions from Mr. Robinson and when you were testifying in your own trial back in April of 2003, when you were asked about the times that you encountered Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo, you left us with the impression that you had only seen him maybe three or four times over the course of the previous three or four years.  You talked about very specific events, a marriage, a funeral, opening a university.  You almost enumerated four or five occasions that you had spoken to Mr. Nzirorera between the period 1990 and the 26th of June 1994.  

Do you maintain that evidence, or do you want to tell us about other times that you have talked substantively with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  This is further clarification which you just provided.  You talked about a date before the 12th of April.  That was not precise.  You talked about 1994, April 1994.  And so during this period I maintain what I said, and thereon, in my response to Counsel Robinson, this was a very delicate and difficult period, and we had little time to sit down to chat.  

As I said earlier on, this was a war-torn period, and the infiltration of the RPF did not allow people to feel free and to be able to go out and about and to sit down and chat.  

I also indicated the circumstances in which (inaudible) and Nzirorera had travelled over to the region.  They could have come there at a time I personally was not available.  I, therefore, pointed out to the Trial Chamber the various occasions on which I could see Nzirorera.  But if you know some other occasions of the kind, then you can tell the Trial Chamber about them. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Kajelijeli, this is your evidence, so all I'm doing is giving you an opportunity to clarify the record.  So these are really open-ended questions for you to fill in all of the gaps, if there are any.  But based on everything you have said so far, my understanding from your responses is that you saw Joseph Nzirorera on the 26th of June 1994.  We haven't yet gotten into the issue of if you spoke on that occasion.  

You saw him on the 12th of April 1994, but you didn't have any substantive conversation with him.  So I'm not even considering that 12th of April 1994 encounter as being of much value.  And prior to the 
12th of April 1994, you have told this Chamber or Trial Chamber II that you saw him three or four times over the previous three or four years, and you mentioned very specific instances of a wedding, a funeral, the opening of a university, the opening of a school.  I don't think there were more than four or five, at the most, specific instances in which you had any substantive interaction with Joseph Nzirorera.  

So now is your opportunity to fill in the record and tell us about when you met him and the nature of your relationship if it goes beyond that.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, excuse me.  I -- forgive me, but I have the feeling that the Prosecutor is saying that we saw each other on the 26th of April 1994.  Unless I am mistaken, I would say it was on the 26th of April that elections took place and Nzirorera was not there.  Are you claiming that Nzirorera was there during the elections?  I am saying no.  On the 6th of April 1994 should not -- should not be included.  I did not see Nzirorera on that day.  

In answer to Counsel Robinson's questions, I said that he came to Mukingo when he brought his family and that at that time I was involved in my own private business and we didn't have a chance to chat.  During my trial I told the Chamber that whenever we saw each other it was often for sad -- during sad events and that during the war there wasn't any happy event which could have brought us together.
(Pages 1 to 22 by Claudette Ask)



















1030H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
The happy events I referred to were before the war.  But when the war broke out, you didn't have anymore projects which were commissioned.  

So if you're expecting further dates from me, all I can say is that Nzirorera was free to visit his commune.  It would be surprising for someone to have taken notes with respect to the dates when Nzirorera visited his home.  If someone did so, then that person had a secret mission.  I didn't make notes.  You don't monitor someone when they have the right to visit their home area, their native area.  

I'm surprised that the Prosecutor is talking about it.  You have the right to visit your native area.  That will be my answer to Counsel for the Prosecution.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, thank you, Mr. Kajelijeli.  And I assure you that Mr. Nzirorera did not have the right to return to his native area.  That was not my question.

My question to you was how many times you had substantive interaction with him. 

And let me clarify the dates because I think there may have been some mixup when we were speaking with each other just a few moments ago.  I'm not referring to the 26th of April.  I'm referring to the 12th April when you said you ran into him and he had brought his family from Kigali, so it's the 
12th of April, I'm just repeating your own testimony, the 26th of June, when you were being re-installed as bourgmestre, and then the three or four times during the period 1990 up until the 12th of April when you saw him for various public functions or family events.  And based on your testimony, that would include four or five events over the prior -- or over a four-year period.  

So you've had an opportunity to elaborate upon that and I assume you've done so.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So at this point we can take the break, Your Honour.  I see the time.  And I can assure the Court that when we return, it shouldn't be too much longer before I complete. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mister -- "too much" is rather vague. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It will certainly be under an hour.  We will finish before the end of the morning session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Kajelijeli. 

THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution is insinuating by talking about the 26th April that is the day when elections took place.  I did not see Nzirorera on that day.  Nzirorera came on the 26th of June during the oath-taking ceremony.  That date needs to be understood.  Nzirorera did not come on the 26th of April 1994 on the year of the elections.  He came on the 26th of June when I was being sworn into office.  That should be understood. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1034H to 1057H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you.  So, Mr. Kajelijeli, I think your concerns have been addressed by your last statement, the clarification on the dates.  I realise that dates can be very difficult for the interpreters.  But we're all clear that I was not referring to the 26th of April.  I was referring to the 12th April in terms of your encounter with Mr. Nzirorera when he took his family from Kigali to Mukingo.

I'd like to talk to you a bit about the 26th of June, which was the ceremony for your reinstallation.  First of all, there's been a number of dates that we've used to identify that particular event.  With some questions or some exchanges, we've said it was the 22nd, we've said it was the 26th, maybe it was the 25th.  

Can we agree at least that the day that you were reinstalled is the same day and the same event when there was a march past of the Amahindure?  

Are you waiting for me, Mr. Kajelijeli?  Or -- 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, well, Mr. Prosecutor just mentioned speaking.  He mentioned some dates.  I did not find any question in what he said.  March past of Amahindure.  To me there was nothing like a question in what he said. 
Q.	Well, let me rephrase it.  I'm trying to confirm through your testimony that the ceremony where you were installed as the bourgmestre was the same ceremony or the same event where there was a march past of the Interahamwe, because we have mentioned several different dates and I want the record to be clear that we are talking about one incident, one single event, the march past of the 
Interahamwe -- excuse me, the Amahindure, and the ceremony for your reinstallation as bourgmestre.  

So you can agree, or you can tell me, no, these were separate incidents. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  You are referring to Amahindure, but in other project 
it's -- they are referred to as Virunga Forces.  

On that day I told Defence counsel that there was a march-past ceremony and there also were some students or people who also marched past.  It was not only the Amahindure group that marched past.  There were also students who were involved in the ceremony.  And those who marched past were happy, were very excited on that occasion. 
Q.	That's all I was trying to clarify, Mr. Witness.  

Now, did you have any substantive conversation with Joseph Nzirorera on that day? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  On that day a reception was offered after the ceremony in our honour and Nzirorera attended that reception.  At the end of the reception Nzirorera left.  
	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Thank you. 
Q.	Can you remember any of the things that you discussed with him that day? 
A.	I recall that we had a general conversation.  We exchanged courtesies.  There were other people in the hall who did not go substantively.  I just thanked him for having come for the ceremony.  We also talked on the problems of people who were fleeing and gunfire in Kinigi and the fact that many refugees were missing in that area.  So we just talked about problems that people were facing at the time.  Thank you.  
Q.	So it was not a lengthy conversation or nothing too involved; is that your evidence, Mr. Kajelijeli? 
A.	I was not the only one talking with him.  There were many other people around who had come for that ceremony.  For example, there was, right there, the préfet.  And considering the rank of Nzirorera at the time, it was the préfet who was supposed to talk with him so that they would be able to discuss the problems that were facing the people.  

I did not have any special moment to talk with Nzirorera.  I had just been sworn in and priority for me was to know exactly the problems that the populations were facing.  I did not have enough time to undertake a full-blown conversation. 
Q.	And this is when you saw him at the location where the ceremony took place, or this is when you saw him at the reception, the conversation that you were just referring to? 
A.	At the swearing-in ceremony I was not seated by him.  I could not talk to him.  After the ceremony we were led to ISAE, in a hall which had been prepared for the said reception.  There we shared some drinks and I did not have a substantive conversation with Nzirorera.  

The préfet was there.  There were other invitees also present.  I took the floor to thank all those who had shown up for that ceremony.  If anyone told you that there were any other speeches during that ceremony, that person would be lying.  The main topic was the ceremony, exchanging congratulations, because the ceremony took place properly.  

Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Your evidence is clear.
Can you tell us how many Amahindure there were in the march-past exercise, approximately? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  It is rather difficult to state exactly the number of persons that marched past.  They were marching past.  There were also students who were marching past.  And as a matter of fact, when you talk about march past, it was rather a sort of manifestation or, rather -- well, these persons did not just manifest whatsoever.  They just walked past.  The people were gathered there in an Indian file.  

People had dressed properly.  The students were dressed in their school uniforms and they walked past the invitees.  I'm not in a position to give you a figure, but I would say there were about 80 of them.  These were people who were very, very neatly dressed, students in their uniforms.  

In all honesty, I cannot tell you the exact persons who marched past us in an Indian file.  Thank you.  That's it. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Kajelijeli, I can appreciate that you can't give us an exact number, but you told us 80 persons, and you were also speaking about students.  And my question is really directed to the recruits who had been trained as Amahindure who were walking past and carrying wooden guns.  That's really where my attention is directed.  So if you just think of those persons and give us some approximate of how many there were. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  A rough estimate of these persons, the Amahindure, at about 80 in number. 
Q.	Who did you recognise among the Amahindure who were marching past? 
A.	It was difficult to know their names.  I was an invitee, so to say.  I could not put names to faces.  I cannot lie to the Judges here that I recognised this person or that person.  

As you know, we had spent 16 years in exile at least, far away from Rwanda.  And so I cannot tell you that I could remember faces or names.  I just told you that there were about 80 in number.  But I think that in the documents that you forwarded to me, there are some witnesses who narrated this incident and maybe you could refer to those documents.  Apart from that, as for me, I really did not recognise anybody. 
Q.	But you were involved with the training of the Amahindure, weren't you? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I was never in the military to have been in a position to impart any training whatsoever.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the answer which was given to you by a witness who testified before this 
Trial Chamber.  His pseudonym is ANU.  And he said that Kajelijeli could not have given such instruction because he did not have any knowledge on that domain and I think that in a testimony he answered your question.  The witness stated that I did not participate in that training, and this was a Prosecution witness.  

And so please consider that I did not have what it took to be able to provide such training.  And I call upon the President and the Judges alongside him to recall that Amahindure was just a project, and a project which was supposed to be included in civil defence such that to later on belong to the army.  I was a civilian and I did not participate in that training. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Kajelijeli, I'm more than happy to suggest to the Chamber that they should rely on 
	ANU's testimony about who was present among the Amahindure in late June 1994, because he does provide a number of names.  But I'm giving you the opportunity to tell us who you recognised among the Amahindure.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the witness in question said, and that is true, that Virunga Forces was a project, was in gestation.  

And the Prosecutor sent a document saying this project began on the 10th of June 1994.  And from the 10th of June 1994 up to the date when that group of Amahindure marched past to welcome visitors, I wish to confirm for the trial -- the President and the Trial Judges that this project was, rather, in its boarding stage and early stages.  And members of this group just came together for that march past in particular.  

And I'm saying this, referring to the documents which the Prosecutor communicated to me, and which mention of the Amahindure project is mentioned.  On page 10 of that document, the president of Virunga Forces, or Amahindure as you refer to them, is mentioned.  And the president says:  "If our project is executed, the results will be satisfactory."  And he corroborated that which was said by Witness ANU, where he said that this project was launched on the 10th.  I did not have any contrary information to those two testimonies.  

And, Mr. Prosecutor, maybe I should avail myself of this opportunity to thank you, because you just said that the testimony of Witness ANU should be looked into very, very carefully, given that he contradicted many, many Prosecution witnesses, for example, the issue concerning my presence at the 
communal office and concerning the training courses which I did. 
Q.	Let's focus on the question that I've asked you.  Be responsive to the question and we'll finish quite quickly.

Witnesses that have appeared in this trial, both for the Defence and the Prosecution, give several different accounts -- mention a number of different names of persons that they identify among the Amahindure or the Virunga Force that were marching past on that date.  But two names come up with consistency, the name of Musafiri and the name of Dusabimana.  Don't you remember Musafiri and Dusabimana from the ceremony that day being among the Virunga Force? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I said I was not interested in identifying those who were marching past or trying to identify their names or their faces.  I said we had arrested Musafiri much before departure on exile, because this was a criminal.  I swear to you, and I swear insistently, I did not pay attention to the faces of the persons marching in front of us.  And, you know, this is 16 years ago.  And I really -- in fact, I cannot tell you how my children look because I don't know exactly how they look now.  

I have already given you sufficient answer concerning these persons.  Thank you. 
Q.	Well, you've already looked at a notebook that was attributed to the Virunga Force.  It's a notebook, it's handwritten, recounts a number of meetings that took place to organise the Virunga Force.  That's one of the documents that you received from the Prosecution, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's correct, Mr. President, Your Honours.  And, Mr. Prosecutor, that's correct. 
Q.	And you agree that the first entry is made on the 19th of June and that you're listed as one of the main organisers of this organisation, that you have core responsibilities, the comments you make over 
	three or four different meetings is taken down.  
A.	If you give me the floor, Mr. President, Your Honours, I would say that when Defence counsel was putting questions to me I explained the inception of that project, which was launched or initiated by its president, Bernard Ntabahwana. 
Q.	I didn't ask you to explain anything.  I asked you one question.  Did the notebook that you have reviewed, which is identified on our record as D. NZ669 -- did it accurately record information about your participation in organising the Amahindure/Virunga Force?  

So we'll talk about the organisation, but right now I'm only concerned about the notebook.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  That notebook was not considered authentic.  But I confirm that I was present.  And on some occasions in putting in place that association, some pioneers or founding members of this group testified before the Trial Chamber here.  Thank you. 
Q.	You're not disputing the authenticity of this notebook, are you? 
A.	I did not dispute that document.  I did not contest the authenticity of that document.  I acknowledge it. 
Q.	Can we agree that the meeting that was held on the 19th of June was not the first meeting that was held to organise the Virunga Force? 
A.	I told you this happened 16 years ago.  You can consider it that way.  But we're going to focus on the contents of this notebook.  And I think that I acknowledged before the President and the Judges of this Trial Chamber that I was present during meetings for the creation of these forces, which was supposed to ensure the safety of the people.  I have accepted that. 
Q.	Okay.  But what I'd like to suggest to you, Mr. Witness, is that the training for the Amahindure started far in advance of the 10th of June or the 19th of June.  In fact, it started at least as early as the 
	19th of April and probably far in advance of that.  

But at least with regard to the 19th and 20th of April, we do have in evidence a memorandum from Édouard Karemera, before he was appointed minister of interior, when he was on a mission with the minister of defence, Augustin Bizimungu.  And in that memorandum he talks about thousands of people being trained in Bagogwe and Ruhengeri when he made a mission to Ruhengeri on the 
18th - 18th to 19th of April.  Are you disputing what Karemera said in his memorandum? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, please help me so that I can testify in a clear manner.  The Prosecutor is reading Karemera's letter, a letter which he has not forwarded to me.  But that would not stop me from telling you what I know about that letter.  

During testimonies before the Judges witnesses confirmed that these projects had begun since June 1994.  And as a matter of fact, this group or this project was never guilty of aggressions of any crimes.  And if the Prosecutor says that these assertions began on the 19th of April, well, that is his statement and I do not agree with that.  

And I wish to insist and confirm that, Mr. Prosecutor, you just mentioned a date which was given during Basile's testimony.  And it was nothing at the time to know exactly that which -- whatever happened at the communal office.  I was a private citizen.  I did not often go to the communal office in Mukingo.  

If there are people who wrote the letter which you mentioned, I know nothing about that.  All I know is that this assertion or this project started on the 19th of June.  I cannot tell you what Karemera wrote to the authorities who were there in office at the time.  At the time.  And you did not communicate this to me and I cannot make any statement on that document. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, I understand your response to be that you have no basis to dispute whatever Karemera says in his memorandum, but you yourself didn't see the training taking place in April 1994.  Have I understood you correctly? 
A.	If you are talking about Amahindure or Virunga Forces, this began on the 10th of June 1994, and witnesses confirmed that fact.  By the way, a Prosecution witness confirmed that fact.  And so I do not agree with your summary.  I never got to know anything about Karemera's letter.  I was not working at the communal office. 
Q.	In any case, it's identified on our record as P. 199.  It's signed on the 20th of April 1994 and at paragraph 2.3 by Mr. Karemera.  And I believe it's also -- it is signed only by Karemera, even though it mentions the presence of the minister of defence.  It says that:  

"In Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfectures it seems the appeal to organise a (inaudible) resistance was immediately followed by concrete actions.  Thousands of young people are currently training in Bagogwe and Ruhengeri.  The major concern is to make the necessary supplies available, including the rifles and munitions they will need as soon as the training is over."  

And then it goes on.  But in any case we can certainly provide you with a copy, if you'd like to have one.  

But you keep insisting on the 10th of June, and I'd like to direct your attention to another document that we have.  And please don't assume that the Prosecution's position is that this started in April.  This started long before April of 1994.  But I simply wanted to bring to your attention the memorandum from Édouard Karemera which is dated the 20th of April.  

I'd like to direct our attention to a broadcast from RTLM, which was made on the 3rd of June 1994.  It's included in the bundle, and I believe it's section 4.  I'll read very slowly.
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could show this to the Chamber and pass it up to Mr. Karemera.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And what I'm passing up to you, Mr. Witness, has been highlighted so that we can find the passages that are important easily.  

I'm sure you know Valérie Bemeriki.  She's the journalist that is organising the program or the broadcast that was made on the 3rd of June.  And she is welcoming a journalist called Bernard Hategekimana.  

Looking at page 12 of the English text, which would be page 19 of the French text, and I've tried to find the relevant portions in the Kinyarwanda text for you, Mr. Kajelijeli, she says that the journalist, 
Bernard Hategekimana, went to Ruhengeri to the combat zone.  He observed the situation as regards the fighting and the roadblocks and listened to the views of the local population.  

And she then passes the floor to him, or the microphone to him, and he says:  

"Thank you, Valérie.  I can tell you that I went to Ruhengeri the day before yesterday" -- obviously referring to the 1st of June -- "not a single Inkotanyi is there at this time.  It is our armed forces who are there and they are well positioned.  I urge all Rwandans to rise up as one man and follow the example of Ruhengeri, where the local populations was determined not to allow infiltration by the enemy."  

Now, that's a loaded sentence.  You can tell us what you understand, but let me finish reading the passages that are important to us.  Towards the bottom of page 12 of the English text: 
"I commend the people of Ruhengeri for not being afraid of the Katioucha shells that are fired upon them.  The people are now used to that and are now going about their farming activities as usual.  They have weapons but are requesting more."  

And continues:  

"Some people fled the region because of the fighting which made the zone unsafe.  When they reached Ruhengeri, they did not remain idle.  I visited the people of the communes of Mukingo and Nkuli, for example, a man named Bernard Suku started a project to assist the local population.  The project is called Amahindure Lava Flow."  

And then it continues.  

So I'm not suggesting to you that the Virunga Force started on the 1st of June, but you must admit that at least Bernard Hategekimana is talking about it as early as the 1st of June and talking about them already having weapons but wanting more and them not remaining idle and them not leaving a single Inkotanyi alive.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Prosecutor has just read a document to you, and the document is contradictory.  When the journalist said that they were launching bombs against the people and that they were the Katioucha bombs against the population they were carrying out, this was done by the Inkotanyi.  

And that the now initiated project, that goes in line with what I said, a project meant to assist the people to ensure their own security.  And it is said by Hategekimana.  He is reporting events he witnessed.  I did not meet him.  He said that happened in June.  I can't say where this journalist (inaudible), but before this Chamber witnesses stated certain things and the Prosecutor acknowledged the fact that the people who were marching had wooden -- rather, they were using pieces of wood that were carved out like weapons.  

If the journalist says that these people had weapons, it is not true.  He was just trying to make his report to look important.  The truth is what I am telling you today.  And if you were to conduct investigations, you would see that I am saying the truth.  

And your witness, Mr. Prosecutor, Witness ANU, stated this project had began on the 10th of June in confirming what Bernard Ntabahwana, the president of the project, is stating because he, indeed, says that he is initiating a project to ensure the safety of the population at night.  

It is the same thing that I'm stating here before this Trial Chamber.  I do not contradict myself.  Therefore, I agree that the president of this project was Bernard.  And I believe that you met him, Counsel for the Prosecution.  So what you'd rather do is tell the Bench what Bernard told you.  But I'm in agreement with you, this project began in the month of June and you have the proof.  Your witnesses stated so, and the Defence witness said the same thing.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist once again.  I'd like to hand up to you, Mr. Witness, D. NZ669, which is a copy of the handwritten notebook.  And if Mr. Issa would show it to the Bench.  Parts of it are highlighted simply so the witness can find the passages that may be important to us. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In any case, Mr. Kajelijeli, you were contacted to begin working on this project of Virunga Force as early as the beginning of June 1994, if not before, right?
A.	I haven't read this document yet, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	I'm asking you a question that you should be able to answer based on your recollection of the events.  We'll get to the document.  I just wanted to pass it up to you.  
A.	Would you be so kind as to repeat your question.  I didn't quite understand it.  I was reading the document, and I didn't really pay attention to the question you asked. 
Q.	You were contacted by the interim government or by some authority to start organising the 
Virunga Force/Amahindure, some time in early June.  And this was before you were appointed bourgmestre on the 17th of June.  

So my question to you is in what capacity were you contacted to start this project? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President and Your Honours.  My answer is as follows:  You had authorities in the Mukingo commune, Semahane and others, and that project could not begin without their authorisation.  Suku Ntabahwana was the president of that project and he's the one who discussed it with the bourgmestre of that commune and told him that -- told him that it was feasible.  I met him.  But I am not the one who launched that project.  

And, as a matter of fact, your witness, ANU, stated that I knew nothing about military actions.  So I could not have launched this project without being its president.  So this is -- the person was 
Bernard Suku Ntabahwana, who asked me to be the president of honour.  If that is true, it happened at the time I just had been elected bourgmestre.  But I was not the person who initiated this project, because I was not its president. 
Q.	Well, I'm not suggesting that you were responsible for the military drills, Mr. Kajelijeli.  

If we go by the contents of that notebook, you were responsible for ideological training which is consistent with what other witnesses have said.  But the point is that you were contacted to organise this program.  And if we look at the contents of that notebook, it seems that you had a leadership position given the number of times your comments are recorded as having some significance.  And all of this seems to have started before you were even appointed bourgmestre on the 17th or sworn in on the 26th of June.  

So you've given us your explanation.  I'll go on to something else.

You said you didn't have weapons -- 
A.	I'm sorry. 
Q.	You said you didn't have weapons.  But if we look at the bottom of page 7 in the English text -- and I think I've marked it for you in the French and Kinyarwanda -- I'm sorry, in the Kinyarwanda -- you seem to be discussing the procession that's going to be held on the next Saturday, which by the calendar would be the 25th of June.  And then we've been using the date of the 26th.  We don't know which date it is, but it really doesn't matter.  We're talking about the same event.  

"The chairman spoke about the procession which had been planned to take place on Saturday in honour of" -- and we don't know what is there.  You can tell us what the "honour" was.  Perhaps it was of your reinstallation.  And someone says that they would like to have 60 guns and that the others would be given pieces of sticks.  And your intervention is as follows: 

"We should not forget that everybody is prepared to fight the enemy and that it's not easy to obtain 
60 guns," which I assume to mean that people are busy with those guns.  You can't use them for the procession.  

And then you go on: 

"So we have to use other didactic equipment.  With regard to attire, they should wear ordinary clothes.  As for the procession, they will leave from here and stop at Mukingo", and then it goes on.

But what interests me is the comment of Augustin Mfitimana.  And he wisely intervenes by saying: 

"I think that it is inappropriate to mention, on the one hand, that we need guns and, on the other hand, to show them that we have them in large numbers."  

What do you make of that, Mr. Kajelijeli? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  At the inception of this project we didn't have weapons, and that is the truth.  We indicated on that day of the -- that day of the march past, the day of the swearing into office, we asked the commune leaders, and nothing could have been done without the authorisation of the bourgmestre.  And even the locals who took part in the march past did so after the authorisation of the bourgmestre.  

These people that you are referring to did not have guns.  They wanted to show that subsequently that group was going to become important.  But with regards to the period we are talking about, they didn't have weapons.  And as Préfet Basile said in his testimony weapons had to be distributed by those who had the authorisation or who could purchase them.  But the goal of the project was to ensure the safety of the people.  They didn't have weapons, and I didn't see any.  

You questioned Basile, and you heard what he said.  This was an ordinary project and those people committed no crimes.  They had barely started and as you saw in that document, and -- but 
Préfet Basile had also said it, that that project had just been initiated and it did not have equipment. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Kajelijeli, your response is on the record and I'm sure it will be consulted at the appropriate time when the Chamber is considering all of the evidence in the case.

Your reinstallation on the 25th or 26th of June, we don't know the date with certitude, was probably the largest public gathering in Mukingo commune since the 6th of April, not so? 
A.	That is so, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	And would you say that several thousands of people had gathered for that occasion? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, during my testimony I stated that the members of the population, in the areas that had been occupied by the RPF, had sought refuge in Mukingo.  That day was an unusual day and they were in attendance.  So during that ceremony you had more than 1,000 people.  We didn't count them.  In any event, you had people from Mukingo, as well as people who had sought refuge there.  In any event, they were very many. 
Q.	And it was the first time, since the 6th of April anyway, that national authorities such as 
	Joseph Nzirorera were present at a public gathering in Mukingo commune.  You agree with me on that score too, wouldn't you? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, that was not the first time that the authorities were taking part in a major event.  Prior to the war there were significant events during the commissioning of projects.  Authorities would come to support us.  

That was not the first time that high-ranking officials were attending such an event.  So before the war, during the peace times, we used to organise such ceremonies.  Even when I was bourgmestre after the war when there were facilities, the authorities would come.  This wasn't the first time that a large number of members of the population were attending.  Of course, their number had increased because of the presence of refugees.  Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  But what I'm suggesting to you is that it was the first time since 
	the 6th of April 1994 that there was a large public gathering with representation from national authorities like Joseph Nzirorera.  So I'm really only talking about the period after the 6th of April 1994.  
A.	Let's talk about the month of June, and not April.  I can't talk about 6th of April 1994.  I am talking about a specific date in June, the 26th of June 1994.  We are not talking about what happened before the 26th of June 1994.  I am talking about a specific, precise date. 
Q.	And my suggestion to you is that on the 26th of June 1994 when this event was organised, it was the first event of its size that would have included national figures since the war began again on 
	the 6th of April 1994.  It's a very simple proposition.  
A.	I didn't see any high-ranking officials, as you want the Chamber to believe.  You had Nzirorera.  You had a préfet who was chairing the ceremony.  And, yes, indeed, that was the only event I attended during that event during that period. 
Q.	And you know of no other such event that took place prior to that event during the period after 
	the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Even if such an event took place, I didn't attend it. 
Q.	Did you hear of any other event?  That's the crux of my question.  And I'll ask it as many times as it takes for you to answer the question.  
A.	I heard about the swearing in to office of the préfet on the 22nd of April in the commune office, but I cannot be too sure.  I also heard about that ceremony over radio, so I can't tell if others took place. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Kajelijeli.  But that was in Kigombe in Ruhengeri town.  I'm talking about Mukingo commune.  
A.	My answer was no. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you told us that Nzirorera didn't say anything at that event.  He made no speech.  Right? 
A.	I confirm what I said before.  He made no speech. 
Q.	Was there any discussion of the Tutsi by any other speaker that day? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The préfet made a long speech, since in any event he was the one who was chairing the meeting or the ceremony.  I also took the floor and I said that for peace to return we had to work together and that we didn't have to allow people to come and perturb the peace.  

With regard to the Tutsis, and as I stated yesterday, we said that before the war there was no problem with Tutsis you had -- there was no problem between Tutsis, you had marriages amongst them, and that no one would -- anyone who committed any violence against others would be prosecuted.  

At that time there had been a meeting in Tunisia between the government of Kambanda and the RPF, and they were negotiating.  And so we were all doing everything in our power so that subsequent to these negotiations peace would return and that everyone who had assaulted the Tutsis or against Hutus who had been killed for nothing, for no good reason, would be prosecuted so that when their accords were signed, between the government and the RPF, peace would return. 
Q.	Well, it's a relief to hear you say that, Mr. Kajelijeli.  But I must tell you that of all the people that have testified in this case about that event, you are the only one who seems to remember that you talked about returning to peace and criticised the violence.  You seem to have reviewed so much of the transcripts in this case, and related cases.  You told us about ANU and GBU, and a number of other witnesses.  What witness do you remember providing the information that you just gave?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, distinguished members of the Bench.  Please read the testimony of 
	Basile -- Préfet Basile's testimony in the Ndindilyimana case.  Please also read the testimony of the witness you just mentioned.  Also read very well the testimony of Mr. Simpakanye, also read attentively 
	Karorero's testimony, read that of Niyoyita.  

Most of those witnesses corroborate what I say, because -- to the effect that we were doing everything for people to live in peace, as we had seen the results of war.  People were living abroad up to the time when we fled into exile.  So among all those witnesses you mentioned, everyone talked about the return of peace.  

I'd like to remind you all that in my testimony I said how I helped the Tutsis, in spite of the 
Prosecution's attempt to tarnish my image.  Many witnesses have come here to testify.  And in my testimony I cannot say contrary to what happened.  Thank you. 
Q.	On that point, that last point, now that you raise it, tell us, how many Tutsi came to testify in your defence? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. President.  If my recollection serves me well, there were about -- there were five.  But we need to cross-check these witnesses, identify themselves as testified.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	Well, I'm not quite sure that there were five.  I recall one.  But we can look at the record again.  
	Your Witness JK312, right?  This is the witness that testified about coming to your house on the morning of the 7th of April.  Is that one of the Tutsi witnesses that you claim is defending you? 
A.	Yes, that witness is among those who came and defended me. 
Q.	And you recall in your judgement that Trial Chamber II did not believe anything he said, right?  Right?  
A.	That is not true, Mr. President.  I already indicated to the Chamber that I disagree with that judgement and I have said extensively it is not true. 
Q.	I'm not asking if you agree with the judgement or not.  I'm reminding you that the 
	Judges of Trial Chamber II would not rely on what Witness JK312 said.  They disbelieved him.  This is the witness who claims that you provided him with 100 gendarmes to protect him on the morning of the 7th of April.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I wonder if my witnesses said that or my lawyers did.  But you are never going to find in his testimony that he said that I gave him 100 gendarmes.  I had no role to play in that affair.  

But what I am saying, as I explained already, the Judges failed to consider his statement in their findings.  And that is why the Appeals Chamber is going to review that.  And if you read what I wrote properly, you'd realise that the Appeals Chamber has already reviewed the findings on 
JK312's testimony.  

So it was necessary that when I found evidence, significant evidence, compelling evidence, showing that witnesses had been trained to provide false evidence, especially considering the fact that from 1st January to 31 December 1994 I was not accused of any crime in Rwanda, you grounded yourself on those witnesses and witnesses who provided those false testimonies, and it is based on those false testimonies that the Chamber convicted me.  And I'm saying that we have new evidence and that judgement is going to be reviewed.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, your testimony before Trial Chamber II in April of 19 -- April 2003 returned to that very issue of the assistance that you gave to JK312 on the morning of the 7th of April.  

And at the conclusion of your evidence the issue was of such curiosity that the Judge herself asked you to explain that portion of your evidence.  

And here I refer to the transcripts of the 23rd of April 2003, page 64 in the English text, where 
Judge Ramaroson asks you to explain why, if you could provide 100 gendarmes to protect JK312, you weren't able to provide military assistance to investigate the killings that had taken place in 
April of 1994.

Do you recall that exchange with the Bench back on the 23rd of April 2003?  
A.	Mr. President, I have the impression that we'll just keep on tiring you, but please be patient with us.  What the Prosecutor just said is not correct.  And if need arises, we're going to look at all these testimonies and check if what he's reading is correct.  

I've always said that I had no authority to provide to anybody's disposal so many soldiers.  This was a story -- is a story that the Prosecutor just invented.  I never said this in my testimony.  And if need be, I'd like the Prosecutor to read the question and the answer.  

I reminded the Judges that they did not listen carefully to the testimony on that issue.  So I pray you, Your Honours, please do not accept that which the Prosecutor just read. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Kajelijeli, returning to the 26th of June 1994, your testimony was that Nzirorera was on the dais.  He was present for that event and said nothing to condemn the massive killings of Tutsi that had taken place in his home commune during the previous two months, right? 
A.	Please bear with me, Mr. President.  Your Honours, please bear me.  I sought your authority to take 
	off -- to redact the date of 29th April in the records.  

Nzirorera did not show up.  We should know that the Prosecutor is trying to put across this information and yet this information does not appear in my testimony.  Twice the Prosecutor has said the same thing, which means that he's not making a mistake.  So, Mr. President, please tell the reporters to redact that date.  

Mr. President, the Prosecutor should move on, because more than once I have answered that question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I notice the microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We have given you a great degree of indulgence.  There's only half an hour before 12:30 and you have to wrap it up by then. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Thank you.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, I am troubled about your relationship with Joseph Nzirorera, because you claim that you've only spoken to him three or four times over the course of the three or four years leading up to the 26th of June 1994.  Yet this is the person you end up living with in Benin for a full year before you were arrested.  You seem to suggest that you had a very formal relationship with Joseph Nzirorera.  

Doesn't it strike you as contradictory that when you were arrested in June of 1998, you're found right in the very home of Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Mr. President, I have a little problem -- very particularly, will you permit me to answer nature's call.  If you give me just two minutes, I'll be right back.  I just can't take it anymore. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Permission is granted. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think we can possibly use this time for a little bit of planning.  First of all, on Monday we're going to have the testimony of General Bizimungu, which has to take place out of order because his lawyer is arriving this weekend and cannot stay that long.  

So, first of all, I want to ask you -- to remind you that the issue of General Bizimungu's lawyer and his participation in these proceedings is something that we addressed earlier and you indicated you would get back to us on that.  And so we are coming close to the time that we have to decide that issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maybe I will be able to say something after the lunch break.  I think the matter has been addressed. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.

And the second point is we are not going to have sufficient time after the lunch break to complete the testimony of the next witness, Mr. Karera, before General Bizimungu would be starting his evidence on Monday morning.  

And I wonder whether or not it's better to just start Mr. Karera's testimony on Wednesday or Thursday.  Or, if you prefer to use that hour or so, we can begin his testimony.  But there's no -- he won't even complete his direct examination.  So I leave that up to you as to how you would like to proceed.  

I think we're also going to have to spend some time on Mr. Webster's exhibits once the 
redirect examination is completed.  

So I'm not exactly sure how far we'll get with Mr. Karera in any event.  But you might consider whether it's better to begin his testimony sometime next Wednesday or Thursday, rather than beginning it today.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  In relation to the issues that were raised, I don't think that it's necessary for us to go on the record about the arrangements that have been made with regard to counsel for Bizimungu except to give the assurance that administrative arrangements have been put in place.

With regard to the issue of the commencement of the testimony of the next witness, we agree that it might be more appropriate to allow the testimony to commence after Colonel Bizimungu's testimony has been completed.

And, Mr. Webster, it is unlikely that you will continue to persuade us that there will be such extensive indulgences in cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's understood, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, returning to your relationship with Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, you seem to suggest to this Chamber that you just happened upon him in Benin, that he was gracious enough to take you in.  That's not quite how things happened, was it? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor just said that Nzirorera is a kind person.  I want to confirm that for -- all along until I met him in Benin, he has been a kind person.  I'm not the only one who has benefitted from his kindness.  He has been of help to many people.  At the moment at which I'm talking to, I can confirm that the person for whom I came to testify is a nice, kind person. 
Q.	And you just happened upon him when you were in Benin, is that your testimony? 
A.	I did not go -- I did not just happen upon him.  I did not go to his house by chance.  I just understood that it was a place where a Rwandan could be welcomed without any problem.  There are some countries where, when a Rwandan was arrested, he was maltreated.  It was a problem.  Benin for us is a country which is democratic and which had love for human beings.  I went to Benin with the hope of finding peace there.  And, in fact, that was what happened, contrary to other countries which I had visited on my way.  Thank you.
(Pages 23 to 40 by Melissa Hook)



























1215H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes, but you coordinated that with Joseph Nzirorera before you went there; right? 
A.	No.  I did not contact Nzirorera to go over to Benin.  It simply happened that war broke out in Zaire, and in Congo-Brazzaville, everybody tried to find refuge somewhere.  While some went to Côte d'Ivoire, others stayed behind, and there were some who went to Gabon while I for one -- I decided to go to Benin given that for me it was a country, a peaceful country, that could welcome me.  

Unfortunately, I found Nzirorera there.  He is not the only one that I met there.  There were many other Rwandans there.  There were many other Burundians who had also found refuge there.  As a result, with that said, I do not want -- I cannot say that I met Nzirorera who advised me to meet him in Benin.  I just went to Benin because I thought I would be in safety there.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could assist by showing this to the Chamber and then placing it in front of the witness.  This is a document that is in the last tab of the bundle that I circulated.  It's the first document.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what you have in front of you is a document you've seen several times before.  It was even admitted in evidence in your own trial as a Prosecution exhibit, Prosecution Exhibit No. 31, admitted during your cross-examination.  So I'm really quite surprised at your last response because you've encountered the very same questions from another Prosecutor.

That's your photograph on that travel document, isn't it?  Do you have difficulty recognising yourself, Mr. Kajelijeli?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  This document does not change anything with regards to what I just stated.  Everybody has travelled here and there.  When you are preparing a trip, you also think about those who welcome you.  Before I knew that Nzirorera was in Benin, I asked him to welcome me when I got to Benin, and that does not change anything regarding my previous testimony.  I was going to Benin from Congo-Brazzaville as a refugee, and I knew very well that Nzirorera, alongside other persons, was already there.  And I was looking forward to him welcoming me.

I am not contradicting this document.  I recognise it.  I acknowledge it.  It's a useful document, and there's nothing wrong with it.  The Judges themselves can look at this document.  Thank you very much, everybody. 
Q.	You're not contradicting the document.  You're contradicting your testimony of just five minutes ago when you told this Chamber that you just happened to come across Joseph Nzirorera when you arrived in Benin.  But what this document demonstrates is that you were travelling under a false name and you were communicating with Mr. Nzirorera and coordinating and planning with him your arrival, as indicated in the writing at the bottom of the document, which is signed the 2nd of May 1992, in anticipation of your arrival in Benin the following week.  You're not Gaspard Mbanzabugabo, are you?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I have already expressed myself on this document during my trial.  I will not tire you out by allowing you to ask too many questions.  If someone wants to go to our country, well, in our country you could have many people with the name Gaspard Mbanzabugabo.  In Benin I was compelled to take up the name which you find here because when I was in Zaire, people were sought after on the basis of their identity.  So I tried to avoid that trap.  

And I already said this in my testimony, that when you go out to arrest people, you disguise your vehicle.  You change your matriculation number for your licence plate.  This document was done in 1998, and this has nothing to do with the mandate of this Tribunal.  The picture that you have there is my picture, and if you go to my region where I was born, I would tell you that my name is Mbanzabugabo Kajelijeli.  
Q.	Well, let's just read what it says at the bottom, and I'll read in French.  There's a fax number, and then there's a name of Joseph Nzirorera, and then you have his post office box number in Cotonou.  And it says, "In conformity with your fax dated 11th April 1997, I hereby forward to you the picture of my (inaudible) conduct in a bid to request you to undertake measures for obtention of visa on arrival at Cotonou airport.  As for departure, I probably will be arriving on the flight of Monday, 5th May 1997.  And I, therefore, plead with you to intervene on time to pick me up from the airport.  Thank you in advance, Mbanzabugabo, Gaspard, done on the 2nd of May 1997."  

So this was something that was planned, Mr. Kajelijeli.  It just didn't happen, like many other things that transpired -- 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  This document does not change anything on my previous testimony.  I just said that I cannot travel without informing people who were supposed to pick me up from the airport, particularly as I was supposed to pick up a visa on arrival.  I was leaving 
	Congo-Brazzaville, a country which was at war.  So please do not dwell overly lengthily on this document.  I recognise this document is from me.  I asked Nzirorera to do it for me.  He met me in Benin, and there was no manipulation or fabrication anywhere soever.

My father gave me the name Mbanzabugabo.  My mother called me Kajelijeli.  And if you want, I can explain the meaning of these names.  And as you know, some people bear names of their fathers or their grandfathers as is the practice in West Africa.  So please let us not go looking for crimes where they do not exist.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I recognise the document, and I asked -- it is true I asked Nzirorera to come and pick me up at the airport in Cotonou because that was the first time I was going to Benin.  This document can be accepted in evidence, but it's a document which was drafted in 1997 and which does not fall within the mandate of this Tribunal.  
Q.	Haven't you previously described Joseph Nzirorera as your benefactor?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I have answered that question by saying that this was a kind man and from the dates that I got to know him until the moment now that I'm talking to you testifying in his defence.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)... "Joseph Nzirorera in whose home I lived for lack of my own resources."

But in any case, you acknowledge in this filing a relationship with Joseph Nzirorera that you seemed to want to deny previously.  Isn't that so?   
A.	Mr. President, the Prosecutor is establishing his own thesis.  I never took the floor to say that Nzirorera was not good to me.  He helped many people.  He helped many Tutsis to whom he offered many positions within the administration, and I think that some were brought here to testify in his favour, and I also learnt that some have been here.  He helped Tutsis.  He appointed them to several important positions in his ministry.  I was not the only one to benefit from his kindness.  

Of course, I am among the persons who thank him for his kindness, but I have -- I have never been an accomplice with him in committing any crime.  We had a good relationship.  We were all civil servants, and that is not illegal.  That is not a crime in itself.  Nobody should claim that that becomes a crime which should be judged by this Tribunal.  Many witnesses who testified against us, if not all, stated that they lied.  The Prosecutor has not established anything that can be condemned in my relationship with him.  And all these witnesses contradicted themselves. 
Q.	Did his kindness and benefaction to you personally start in 1997 in Benin, or was it more longstanding?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I have said that I know Nzirorera for a long time, since my childhood; that I've said that we worked together.  We had a good relationship.  We built the country together.  I began working before him.  Later on he was appointed general manager at the time when I was interim bourgmestre in Mukingo in 1995/1996.  

We moved on together, as was the case during our youth.  This did not begin in 1997.  I knew him since my childhood.  And until date, Mr. President, Your Honours, you will agree that we never did anything criminal together.  We did not do anything that was liable to the prosecution.  Even the witnesses who were trained to come and testify against us here contradicted themselves and recanted.  And someone sent to me their statements where they were confessing that they had been misled by the authorities, including the actual minister of justice in Rwanda.  

So please, Mr. Prosecutor, stop stating that I joined Nzirorera in condemnable acts.  Together we served our country.  But, unfortunately, we were arrested unjustly.  Please consider our cases with much more clear-sightedness and eventually acquit us because the persons who have testified against us contradicted themselves.  So please repair the wrong done to us and recognise us as respectable citizens of this world. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, it is you that have tried to distance yourself from Joseph Nzirorera.  You've tried to convince this Court that you only had four or five encounters with him during the period 1990 to 1994 when clearly that's not the case.  Clearly he was supportive of you, assisting you, protecting you, financing you in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994.  

And what I'd suggest to you is that you're working together very closely now to corrupt witnesses, to lie about witnesses, to get them arrested in Gacaca, to get them to recant their evidence.  The collaboration that you shared in Benin was the same collaboration that you shared during the period 1990 to 1994 in Rwanda, and it's the same collaboration that you share right now as you prepare your common defence.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I realise that the Prosecutor has no more questions.  He's now engaging in speculation.  He's talking about my relationship with Nzirorera, a relationship I have described from our youth.  And he's even extrapolating and exaggerating talking about me being funded by Nzirorera.  The Prosecutor has never proven that fact.  He's exploiting statements made by witnesses, either 
	GAP or GAO, and which witnesses all lied.  And these facts are in the trial records of these witnesses and which were judged -- cases that were judged in 2002 and 2005.  These witnesses came out here and were coached by the Prosecutor and the Rwandan justice system to come and lie here.  

It is obvious that these witnesses finally recanted.  The Prosecutor communicated these statements to me, and please, the Prosecutor should not repeat the same things over and over because the witnesses who made these statements stated that these testimonies were baseless.

Mr. President, Your Honours, he's saying that money was paid to Gacaca courts for some people to be arrested and for others to be set free.  I have given the example of Prosecution Witness GAO.  This is a witness who was arrested thrice and released again.  He was arrested in 2005; he was arrested in 2006 and in 2008.  The Prosecutor and the Rwandan authorities released him so that he should go and testify against people.

Yesterday I told you that on page 10 and on page 16, on page 20, on page 26 and 28, 30 and 38 in the testimony of GAO of the 5th -- the witness did not give the month in 2005 -- no.  Rather, 2009.  The witness stated that nobody from my family paid him any monies.

Mr. Prosecutor, you asked him, "Why did you not mention Kajelijeli among the criminals?" 

And he said to you, "In fact, I did not mention Kajelijeli among the criminals," and that is underscored, and that witness said this to you, Mr. Prosecutor; that when he was drafting the documents in my defence, he had been arrested and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment by the Gacaca court of Muhoza, and when he realised that the Prosecutor had abandoned him, he decided to talk to the Gacaca court in Busogo and confess that he had lied before the ICTR when he was testifying against me.   

And to prove that to you, Mr. President, the witness kept a copy for the prosecutor, the state prosecutor, and for the appeals court in Ruhengeri, and that document was seen by the authorities of the Ruhengeri prison.  The Prosecutor wanted GAO to come back here to testify.  He was released, but that does not take anything away from the document which he had drafted before and which had been seen by the Rwandan authorities.  

The prosecutor promised the witnesses that the sentence of 30 years was going to be lifted, and in the statement of the witness in 2009, that witness confessed that he had drafted that document for the reasons which I already gave to you, and he even confirmed the fact that nobody in my family had given him any amount of money.

I, therefore, refer you to the transcripts of these court sessions to confirm that what I'm saying is correct and accurate, and you would find it in the property records of this Tribunal.  Mr. President, Honourable Judges, please bear with us.  Understand what we are saying.  Restore us to our family members and to our rights.  It is our right to live in a society that has been reconciled with itself in Rwanda.

And what I am saying here and what the Prosecutor is saying is being heard by everybody.  And this is likely to jeopardise members of my family.  My family members did not pay any money to whosoever and have spoken lengthily on this matter.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you very much, Your Honours.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I thank the Court for its indulgence.  I have no further questions.

And I assume that you, Mr. Kajelijeli, have thoroughly unburdened yourself and have fully communicated to the Court everything that is on your mind.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kajelijeli, that was not a question.  You don't have to respond.

Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I just want to indicate for the record that I made reference to a JK312 in one of my previous questions, and I'd indicate for the record that I'm referring to information that is known to us as Witness 20.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Robinson, any redirect?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  It's going to be very brief.  I don't know if you want to hear it now, but I can do it right now if you'd like.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long do you think?  Having agreed already to take the adjournment, would it be preferable to complete it now before lunch, or do you think it necessary to come back?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think we can complete it before lunch.  I have three questions, but I'm not sure how long the answers will be.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That could be a problem.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I just wanted to indicate to the Court that there is probably going to be some jousting on admitting exhibits.  I don't want to be foreclosed on applications of admitting exhibits by not making it clear which ones I want to admit now.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I don't think that that will be a problem.  We would expect that, in saving time in court, that you and Mr. Robinson could identify what's agreed so that we only need to consider matters of controversy if there are any.   

Miss Hounkpatin, we just want to clarify that it would not interfere with your client's regime if we allowed the completion of the testimony of this witness with a view to adjourning for the rest of the day, or it would benefit him to have his lunch now and come back afterwards?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, in the interest of the health of my client, I think we could continue provided my learned friend, Robinson, respects his word of putting just a few questions.  You must have noticed that Mathieu Ngirumpatse just left the Chamber.  He has gone to check his pulse because his 
	blood pressure has dropped.  He has gone to meet Dr. Epée for an appointment.  And so, in short, if this session goes on for 45 minutes, one hour, that will be fine.  But anything beyond that may be difficult.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Mr. Robinson, let's see if we can finish now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I'm just going to ask you a few questions, and I would appreciate it if you could just answer with a yes or no to my first question.

And that question is:  In your judgement, did the Trial Chamber find Witness GAP to be credible?  Yes or no?
A.	No. 
Q.	Did the Trial Chamber, in your judgement, find Witness GAO, who we know as Witness GBU, to be credible in your judgement?
A.	No. 
Q.	Were the testimonies of those two witnesses important to the finding of guilt that was made against you in your case? 
A.	Please can you take over your question.  I did not understand it. 
Q.	Were the testimony of the two prosecution witnesses, GAP and GAO, important elements in the Trial Chamber's finding that you were guilty? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, Your Honours.  The testimonies by these witnesses were relied upon by the Judges who sentenced me.  If these witnesses recanted, that would enable me to prepare the review of that judgement.  And the recanting of these witnesses is found in documents whose dates you have, and this is in conformity with the judgement by which they were judged in Rwanda.

All these trials -- all these cases which were judged in Rwanda are cases in which judgements show or reveal that they never talked about me in front of the Judges before whom they were appearing.  
Q.	And since the Trial Chamber relied upon these two witnesses in finding you guilty, has information come out concerning the credibility of these two individuals since your judgement?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  After being sentenced on the basis of the Prosecution witnesses that counsel just mentioned, we discovered tangible proof, evidence, because these witnesses drafted documents in which they were pleading for forgiveness.  And they exonerated us in those documents.  We have, therefore, found proof in their sentencings in Rwanda, rulings which were followed by many Rwandans.  And there were even some witnesses who came here and who testified before Gacaca courts.  And these witnesses came right here before the Judges of the ICTR to recant.

We, therefore, have come up with new evidence which shows that the witnesses whom you referred to came and testified against us because they had been promised certain rewards in exchange for their liberty or freedom.  They were also promised that their sentences were going to be reduced.  It was on this basis that some came here to testify against us.  Others had been coached to testify against us.

They had no intention of testifying against us, but the Rwandan justice system and the 
Prosecutor's office of the ICTR had misled -- had trained them and coached them to come and fabricate testimony.  And it was through their trials in Rwanda that the prosecutor gave information to us, and during this trial we found further proof, and I take advantage of this opportunity to thank the prosecutor for having forwarded to us the sentences of these witnesses.   
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, in paragraph 4.9 of your indictment, it was charged that from late 1990 through July 1994 that certain personalities, including yourself and Joseph Nzirorera, conspired among themselves and with others to work out a plan to exterminate the civilian population, the civilian Tutsi population.  And then in paragraph 794 of your judgement, the Trial Chamber found that there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, as charged in paragraph 4.9 of the indictment, the Accused conspired with others to destroy the civilian Tutsi population.

So is it true, Mr. Kajelijeli, that as misled as your Trial Chamber was by the evidence, they still found you not guilty of conspiring with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Thank you very much.  That's correct.  I did not conspire with Nzirorera, and I proved this during my trial using documents.  I gave proof that I helped Tutsis during difficult moments, and I settled them in the ISAE institute.  And when they could not move, I helped them.  You got all this information, Mr. President.  And so I could not have connived with Nzirorera to kill Tutsis and still help them.  Some of these Tutsis came out here and testified.

All that the Prosecutor did was tarnish my reputation by using political authorities.  But the witnesses based themselves on lies.  There was no plot between Nzirorera and myself.  I informed you -- and I'm referring to Nzirorera.  I told you what we did to help Tutsis in our region.  Some had been appointed captains; some were working in his ministry.  There is proof to all of that.

And so I would like to tell you that my godfather was Tutsi.  When I left office, he went and -- when he left, he went and settled in Gisenyi, and he was attacked.  We have brothers who have good relationships with Tutsis, people who were living in harmony with Tutsis without any suspicions, without any mistrust.  And to prove that, Tutsis came out here to testify in my favour.  Consequently, there was neither any conspiracy or plot between Nzirorera and I to harm or destroy or kill any Tutsis.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Kajelijeli.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  I would make the request that Mr. Kajelijeli be allowed to greet Mr. Nzirorera.  With that, I have nothing further.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.

Mr. Kajelijeli, this winds up your testimony.  The Chamber thanks you, as it does all witnesses, for assisting us with our work.  You raised an issue on your first day in the witness box about the health of a fellow prisoner.  I commissioned an enquiry into it, and a document will be filed under confidential cover to the parties addressing the concern that was raised.  I think a copy will be sent to you.

We think that the -- sorry.  I was just confirming that we think that the statement you made which concerns the health of someone should not be in the public domain.  And so we are going to put that statement under seal as well as the report that we will be filing will be filed under confidential cover, but the matter has been investigated, and there is a response to it.  With regard to your request, the request stated by Counsel Robinson, the registrar will make arrangements for you to see Joseph Nzirorera.

Yes, Mr. Kajelijeli.
THE WITNESS:
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)

And when I was leaving Benin on the 28th of January, I came along with a suitcase, and on arrival here, my suitcase was damaged.  I reported it to the WVSS section, and yesterday this unit gave me a reply saying that I was supposed to contact the -- the flight that brought me here.  And members of the WVSS who carried out the negotiations -- I talked to them.  I have participated in reducing the expenses of this Tribunal which was supposed to use video conference.  Please.  I am trying to be of help.  I would like you to intervene so that another suitcase is given to me.  My suitcase was destroyed.  
I will not be meeting you again.  So please can you talk to WVSS so that this problem can be solved.  I am done, Mr. President.  Once again, I plead with you.  We are human beings.  Please, please take care of us.  Once again, I thank you for having welcomed me here very, very warmly.  And of course, as usual, please remember that we are normal human beings who are here before you, and I also 
pray -- plead with the Prosecutor to look into Article 68 to communicate (inaudible) evidence to me.  

And I want to thank the Judges.  I want to thank the Prosecutor.  I want to thank the counsel here and all those who have been listening to my testimony here.  I promise you I will remain a sincere and honest person.  Never, never will I join a small group of people who come and lie to this Tribunal because my aim is that there should be reconciliation in Rwanda so that everybody will be able to live in peace and in harmony.  On that note, I thank you once again.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you too, and this concludes our session for today.  We will resume on Monday morning.
