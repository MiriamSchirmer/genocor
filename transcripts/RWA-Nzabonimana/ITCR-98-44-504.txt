LÉONIDAS MUREMBYA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Have you decided on a language on which you wish to continue your examination?  Do you wish to speak English or French? 
A.	For the examination-in-chief, I prefer to speak French, and if the Court will accept it and if the Prosecution wants to cross-examine in English, that's fine by me.  But for now I've decided to continue in French. 
Q.	Very well.  We continue in French.  Yesterday afternoon we had hardly started our examination.  And let me briefly remind you of the rules.  Don't forget that both of us are speaking French.  And, therefore, you need to pause when you're giving your answer so as to avoid an overlap of our two voices.

Secondly, speak sufficiently slowly for the stenographers to be able to fully record your testimony.  And each time you mention a name or a word which is not French, which is not easy, you spell it.  If you don't do it, I'll remind you to do so.

Now, then yesterday I asked you for your academic background.  And if my memory serves me right, you did say that you did your primary school on the hill on which you were born and that you spent -- after primary school, you spent five years in Saint-André secondary school.
A.	Six years. 
Q.	I would like us to start from the end of that six-year period.  What certificate did you obtain, and what were the studies that you did subsequently?
A.	After my study of the humanities in Saint Andrews college, I opted for a certificate in general humanities in Latin and sciences option.  Then I got a scholarship to go to the Université Nationale du Rwanda, the National University of Rwanda, to do a bachelor's degree in economics.

I finished that at the end of five years, and that was towards the end of 1987.  Early '88 I met Mr. Mbaguta, Jean-Marie, Vianney, M-B-A-G-U-T-A.  He was the director of the economics section in the ministry of finance.  And we met when I was meeting my uncle, Jean-Marie Rugainynge, R-U-G-A-I-N-Y-N-G-E, who was sick at the hospital.  Mbaguta, as many people know him, was a well-known Tutsi, but was also a friend of my uncle, Jean.

I spoke to Mbaguta, and I told him that I had completed my studies at the university.  So he offered me a job as an assistant to Professor Don Mead, whom I mentioned yesterday, and his associate, Dr. Augustin Ngirabatware, N-G-I-R-A-B-A-T-W-A-R-E, who later on would become the 
minister of economic planning, and that was much later when I had left.

From 1988 towards the end of 1990, I worked with these two researchers as an assistant on research into the industrial secteur in Rwanda for the creation of jobs.  Professor Don Mead suggested that I continue further studies in economics and got me to register in the University of Michigan in the United States.  

He also assisted me in obtaining a scholarship in the USAID.  Towards the end of 1990, I recall that the RPF had started its hostilities and people of the Byumba préfecture who were close to my hail had already started moving towards the hinterland.  But it wasn't as bad as that yet.

So I left mid-December to the United States, and I started my studies in January 1991.  At the end of 1992, I had finished -- I had completed my master's studies, and I immediately went on for the doctorate.  And in 1993 I officially obtained my degree in master's and was immediately admitted to begin the doctorate programme. 
Q.	Can you slow down.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	So please proceed.
A.	Towards the end of 1993, I had completed the compulsory part of the doctorate degree, and I started my research for my thesis.  Professor Don Mead, who was also the director of my thesis, suggested that I came back to Rwanda to test some theories of the decision on small/medium-scale enterprises in relation to individuals.  That was the topic for my thesis.  And Don Mead and myself expected that at the end I would come back to Rwanda to continue with that research in a more professional manner.

I came back to Rwanda around February 1994, and I started my investigations which took me all over the country, virtually the entire country, to speak to small-scale enterprises.  Towards the middle of March, I started completing my investigations, and I started gathering the data in my computer with the assistance of some work colleagues in the agricultural unit of the ministry of agriculture. 
Q.	That's okay.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	So you have just told us about your studies at the universities.  And if I understood you correctly, this programme was done with some experience on the field.  Does that reflect correctly what you have just explained? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct. 
Q.	You left Rwanda in December 1990; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You were then present as of the 1st October 1990 in Rwanda.  Where were you, and what did you feel following the RPF attack of 1st October 1990? 
A.	At that time I had worked with the two researchers that I had mentioned previously, and I had an apartment in Nyamirambo, N-Y-A-M-I-R-A-M-B-O.  I lived in Nyamirambo, and I was working on a project which was managed by the ministry of finance and economic planning.

I think that several Rwandans, including myself, did not clearly understand the RPF objective when we were attacked in October.  And the general feeling was one of concern.  But at that time we considered the RPF invasion as an invasion from Uganda against the country, and I do not think that there was any feeling of hostilities against the Tutsis.

I myself had some Tutsi friends, and we discussed this.  And we did not understand the objective of the RPF.  My room-mate or my apartment-mate was a Tutsi.  He's currently in Kigali, and we are still in contact.  And at that time -- at that time he did not understand what was happening.  So it was something quite extraordinary for the ordinary Rwandan. 
Q.	Thank you.  You left in 1990.  So did you continue being interested in political development in Rwanda?  And if that is the case, tell us the information that got to you in Michigan where you were.
A.	I was not interested in political life as such.  My focus was to complete my studies.  I did not pay much attention to the political life.  But I was interested in the humanitarian impact or the humanitarian consequences of the advance of the RPF -- the advance of the RPF troops into Rwanda because that had a direct impact on me, my immediate family.

I wanted to know what was happening because my immediate family lived close to Byumba, and each time that the RPF troops advanced, the population would move towards the hinterland.  And each time they moved, I got messages to send money home to sustain the people.

So I needed to know at least what was happening to my family.  But I was not particularly interested in politics in general. 
Q.	Very well.  I understand.  But did you hear -- let me put the question this way:  You left Rwanda -- when you left Rwanda, what was the prevailing political setup or regime?
A.	At that time we were still -- we still had the one-party system, which was the MRND.  But there were discussions already about a multiparty system in a general manner.  When I left, the MRND was the only political party.  And that is my recollection. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you then told that between 1991 and 1992 there was a political change even though your interest focused on the humanitarian situation in relation to your immediate family?  One way or the other, did you get to know about this development?  And in what manner? 
A.	Usually, this was through newspapers that sometimes came from Rwanda, from friends who sent them to me, because this was a novelty.  And not everybody knew what it was.  And particularly, it was the newspapers who criticised that because until then there were no political criticisms.  So it was something new.

And my friends would send me newspapers in Kinyarwanda to show me what was happening in Rwanda.  It was basically that way, in that manner, that I was receiving the political news of the country as well as other news.

Sometimes I would call friends or relatives to update myself about situations in the country and then, if we had time and money, because it was very expensive to call from the United States to Africa.  So that's mainly how I obtained news. 
Q.	And did you get to know what the new political party -- what were the new political parties that emerged on the political scene in Rwanda?  If you do know, then fine.  If you don't, it's okay.  
A.	We all knew the MRND, the MDR movement.  I also heard about PSD.  Those were the three main movements that I recall.  I know there were several others, but those are the three that I remember. 
Q.	While you were conducting your research and while you were working with Professor Mead and Dr. Ngirabatware's team in 1988/1990, did you have the opportunity to move around the country?  And are you able to say if there was any political distinction -- if there was any ethnic differentiation in the country? 
A.	Prior to October 1990, there was nothing of the sort.  I could go everywhere in the country.  There was no hatred.  There were no signs of war.  Everything began with the October attack.  And at that time I was getting ready to go for my studies.  I had already completed a research, and I was taking a course in English to go and start my studies.  So in summary, in 1988/1989, I have no recollection of the -- of any ethnic problem that could exist.

But just this minor story:  When we were at the university, there were some rumours that there were people who were working for Uganda, but these were rumours that were not confirmed.  Apart from that, I have no recollection of any situation where there were any distinctions between the ethnic groups. 
Q.	In your research activities, you had access to Hutu, Tutsis, and Twa families that were in the country.
A.	I was not really interested in knowing who was who.  My focus was research into the industrial sector and on small-scale enterprises.  There were enterprises that were known to belong to Twa, pottery.  And I was very interested in that because that was one of the small industries that could be assisted -- to adopt good economic policies to assist that kind of group.

There were other economic activities which were not peculiar to one ethnic group or the other.  So what I was interested in was to know the economic factors of activity -- economic activities of people and not their ethnicity. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You explained that at one point in time you came back to Rwanda.  Can you explain when it was that you came back to gather data.
A.	When I came back, it was February 1994, and I remained there until mid-April 1994. 
Q.	Your return in February 1994, was that part of your efforts -- or was that part of your doctorate programme? 
A.	Yes.  It was to enable me to write my doctorate thesis. 
Q.	And this travel was done together with your thesis director?  Or you came alone? 
A.	I was housed in the agricultural unit which was also -- agricultural protect which was also financed by the USAID.  And the understanding was that this project was going to facilitate my movement on the field.  So when I was going outside Kigali, I used vehicles belonging to that project.

And subsequently, I heard that the director belonged to another political party.  I can't remember the name of that political party, but I remember a story because the Accused, my uncle, Mathieu, had lent me one of his vehicles to move around in town.  

One of the Americans who worked there came to give me a friendly advice that "Why are you taking an MRND vehicle to the opposing party?" which I found interesting because people there had no problems because I was in my vehicles   and the Rwandans who were there saw that vehicle as just any vehicle.  My vehicle was not vandalised.  So it was rather interesting for an American to come and give me that advice. 
Q.	Very well.  So now I want to know if you were alone from February 1994 to April 1994.  So I want to know whether you were alone or whether you were accompanied by the director of -- your director of thesis.
A.	My director of thesis, Professor Don Mead, came with me.  And during that period he went back to the United States a week before me.  Otherwise, he was with me.  But I conducted investigations outside Kigali with workers of the project.  I mean, Don Mead was not with me whenever I travelled outside Kigali.  But we were together to discuss the academic aspect of the research. 
Q.	Can you explain to the Chamber what the security situation was during the two months that you spent travelling across the country.
A.	Outside Kigali there was no problem.  I had no problem travelling outside Kigali.  I used to move around with the driver everywhere.  I went to Kibayi, Cyangugu, southwest, east.  The only place I did not go to was the Byumba side which was occupied by the RPF.  That was the only region that I did not go to.

In Kigali itself the security situation was flexible.  In the morning during the day, everything was fine.  People were in the streets.  But at night we started hearing gunshots.  We heard news of politicians who were killed.

So it was a bit difficult to move around at night.  But during the day, it was fine.  I was a long-distance runner.  So I used to run every day during the day. 
Q.	During this work session, where did you live? 
A.	When I got to Kigali, my aunt, my uncle Mathieu's wife, came for me at the airport.  And she told me that she had a room for me in their house.  So for me it was normal to go and live where I'm welcome as a member of the family.  So I lived with Mathieu's family all that time. 
Q.	So from February 1994, are you able to recall the exact date of your arrival in Kigali?  Was it beginning, middle, or towards the end of February? 
A.	I have no recollection of that.  I'm sorry. 
Q.	That's okay.  So you lived in Mr. Ngirumpatse's house during that period from the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What did you observe during that period when you were present?  Did you notice that any political meetings were held and that political figures came to visit at that residence? 
A.	Let me start by saying, first of all, that Mathieu's residence was a family home.  And so members of the extended family were always there.  I do recall that my aunt, who was diabetic, spent more than 
	two weeks at that residence.  She is a lady who came from a hill to spend some time at that residence.  

And I think that people do not gather at such a venue for political meetings, especially when people from all educational backgrounds and social strata gather.  So it would have been chaos for any political meeting to hold at such a venue.  I never saw any political meetings at that day at that residence, and the only day in which I saw any political figure was when I invited Augustin Ngirabatware to visit us for dinner.  He was a friend.  

We had become friends when we were working together, and I took it upon myself to invite him to Mathieu's house, to our home.  And that was the only political figure I saw during that time.  And even then we had to be careful because members of the extended family were around serving dinner.  So I don't think I saw anything of that nature there. 
Q.	The thrust of my question is to find out from you whether there were only family activities going on at Ngirumpatse's residence.  Or was there room in that residence for political activities to take place?  That is what I want you to tell the Court, whether that is how things unfolded.  Yes or no? 
A.	My relationship with Mathieu has always been based on our family ties for all practical purposes.  I grew up on the hill.  Mathieu was outside of the country serving as an ambassador in several countries.  So I did not see him when I graduated from my humanities.  

But he came home on holidays once or twice per year.  And on those occasions he would come to the hill.  And most of the time as children at one, two, we were not even at home.  And it was only when we returned later on that we were told that "Mathieu was here, but you did not see him.  However, he left a gift for you."  And that is how we knew Mathieu at that time.

It is only after graduating from my humanities studies that I really got to know Mathieu.  When he returned home, we became friends.  He was like another father to me.  He knew things that my own father did not know, and he could teach me a number of things.  And that is the type of family relationship that developed between us.

Now, to answer your question directly, it is this same family atmosphere that obtained at Ngirumpatse's -- at Mathieu's residence.  His home was open to the extended family, and it was practically impossible for any political meetings to hold at his home.

And as I stated earlier, the atmosphere was one that could be described as family chaos in which people discuss family matters and what have you.  But I do remember, regarding Mathieu, that at the time he was a very busy man with his political activities and I was very busy with my own research.   

I do know that in the evenings he would come back home in his vehicle and I would come back home in my vehicle too.  And I do remember very well that Mathieu on such occasions would play the piano.  He would sing.  And that would be very soothing.  This is the image and memory that I have of him.  Frankly speaking, I never saw any political meeting take place at home. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you ever have an opportunity to have a discussion with Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the political problems at that time? 
A.	At that time, namely, in 1994, it was impossible not to discuss politics because it was a difficult period.  We would see over television reports about meetings that had been scheduled but the chair would be absent; the prime minister would be absent; the representative of the MRND or any other party would be absent.  

And unless one were absolutely crazy, it was impossible not to talk about politics.  It was normal for people to talk about politics because that was the normal lifestyle of Rwandans at that time.  Politics was very topical.  Politics was in the air, and everybody talked about politics.  So we talked about it.

And there's a story that comes to mind.  Maybe you would come to it later. 
Q.	Well, yes, Witness.  I will put the questions to you in due time.  But I would like to know whether in your conversations with your uncle you learned or he told you -- he may have told you that the problems being faced were of an ethnic nature.  And did he appear to you to be someone who would pit one part of the population against the other?  
A.	First of all, the problem we were facing at the time was a problem between Rwandans and the RPF which at that time were considered to be part of Uganda or part of the refugees from the royal party who wanted to return to capture power.

For the ordinary Rwandan, that was the issue, namely, that the king was returning to take power and restore the situation to that which obtained before 1960.  Now, to be more specific in answering your question and contrary to what you have said, if one were to ask any of our family members what the assessment was, you would find out that he was being blamed for being too close to Tutsis.  He had many Tutsi friends.

I do remember some people from Gakarama I think, G-A-K-A-R-A-M-A -- rather, Gakarama and his brother were Tutsi, and they were Mathieu's best friends.  Their housemate was also Tutsi.  And in 1994 more than half of these who worked at Eden Garden, a restaurant belonging to 
Mathieu's wife -- more than half of the staff were Tutsi.

So I do not see how someone can hate Tutsis and still accommodate them in their home and even allow them to prepare food for yourself, your family, and your extended family and your children and even give them employment.  That would be a contradiction, wouldn't it be?  
Q.	Very well.  Would you say that your uncle is a man of dialogue, or do you think that he is one who took advantage of differences or disputes? 
A.	Well, as I told you already, I did not only know my uncle when I was already grown up.  I do recall that I used to hear stories about him having saved many Tutsis during the '59 revolution.

One of the stories was about somebody whose name I no longer remember, somebody who worked at the university bookshop in Rwanda.  I went to sign out some books from there, and he looked at me and said, "You look like Mathieu.  You resemble Mathieu."  And apparently, I resemble Mathieu.

So yes.  I told him, "Yes.  That is correct.  He is my uncle."  And so he told me a story about Mathieu -- or he told me his story, namely, that he was going to be imprisoned in the '60s.  

And at that time Mathieu was the prosecutor and decided to state that that person was not guilty and, therefore, saved him from imprisonment.  Those are the types of stories I heard while I was growing up.  And I formed an opinion of my uncle, Mathieu, to be someone -- well, I don't know how to put it -- someone, for example, who would remember my name.  

He would remember the names of all the family members.  He would remember which schools we attended.  And even for me, today I am not able to remember the names of my nephews.

You see -- and I was really surprised that Mathieu was able to do so much for the country and yet at the same time be able to attend to his family issues.  You see, as the most educated and de facto -- the richest member of the family, all family problems members were brought to him.  We raised our problems, our family problems, with him.  We asked for money from him.  And that was Mathieu.  That's how things were.  So to my mind -- well, I don't know what else to say. 
Q.	So you can tell me that he was a man of dialogue and a man who listened to people.  Is that it? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  That is correct. 
Q.	Where were you on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	On the 6th of April 1994, I was at Mathieu's residence.  I had spent the day at work concluding my data collection work on the computer with the assistance of some of my colleagues.  So I had spent the whole day entering and collecting that data into the computer relating to my research.

I left the computer in the office, and I went to the Sabena office because I had planned to travel towards the United States on Friday by Sabena Airlines.

So I had to take my passport and my air ticket to the Sabena Airlines office where I dropped off the ticket and the passport.  Then I returned to Mathieu's home, and it is during that evening that the president's plane was brought down. 
Q.	When you returned to Mathieu Ngirumpatse's home on the 6th of April, what time was it? 
A.	Once again, I don't have a clear recollection of the time.  But usually, I tried to be home by 7 p.m. or even before 7 p.m.  So I believe that I went to Eden Garden after being at the Sabena office, and then I went home.  So that was my habit, namely, to do everything to be home before nightfall because of the security problems. 
Q.	So would you say that you were back home between 6 and 7 p.m.?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When you got to the residence, was Mathieu Ngirumpatse home on that 6th of April? 
A.	Yes.  He was there.  Rose, Delphine, Frank -- I think Rose joined us later because she was at 
	Eden Garden.  The whole family was there that evening of the 6th of April.   
Q.	You have mentioned Eden Garden on several occasions.  Can you tell the Court what Eden Garden is.
A.	Eden Garden was a restaurant that Madam Ngirumpatse owned.  From time to time we had lunch and supper at Eden Garden.  It was a restaurant located at the city centre.  It was a high-standing restaurant which targeted expatriate customers.  So it was possible to have some foreign dishes and Rwandan dishes as well at that restaurant. 
Q.	During the two-month period you spent in Kigali, did you often go to that restaurant and did you notice anything about the staff working there and the customers who came to that restaurant?  And if yes, would you describe that restaurant as a meeting spot for extremists? 
A.	Well, it was a restaurant, an open restaurant.  Customers came at all times.  Young men and young women from Kigali came to Eden Garden to socialise, to drink some tea and enjoy a meal.  I do not see how extremists can mingle with the youth of Kigali in such a manner.

So what I saw at Eden Garden is what I have just described to you.  While I was there, I went to Eden Garden on a daily basis.  And as I have already said, this was the place where we regularly went either for breakfast, lunch, or supper.

But you may also want to know that sometimes in Africa it is difficult to distinguish family from business.  So we went there to eat, and I saw mainly young people socialising at that restaurant. 
Q.	Did you see any persons belonging to the Interahamwe za MRND at Eden Garden? 
A.	Well, you got me on that one.  You see, to this date, I am not able to distinguish which youth belonged to which party.  It was said that each movement had its own youth wing, and I never knew what these wings were.  And I never understood what it was all about.  You see, Eden Garden, as I have said, was a business undertaking.  And nobody was there to intimidate any customers.  We wanted to have customers in order to make money.  But all I can say is that I never saw that type of activity at that business venue. 
Q.	Were there any political meetings at Eden Garden to the best of your knowledge?
A.	Not as far as I know, no.  I do not know because while I was there, nothing of that sort happened.  The basement of the building had a disco, and people would go dancing down there.  The first floor -- or should I say the ground floor -- was the restaurant, and people would come in to eat and have some tea.

So I do not see at what location any meeting would have held at that restaurant except maybe there was another part of the restaurant unknown to me. 
Q.	Let us return to the 6th of April.  And according to your testimony, you were at the residence between 
	6 and 7 p.m. and family members began to come back home gradually.

Now, at what time did you find out or were you informed that the presidential plane had been brought down?
A.	I do not remember the exact time, you see.  But we were outside and saw a huge fireball, and we were wondering what it was all was about.  Mathieu took the phone and called to find out what was happening.  Mathieu called.

And again, that fireball was rather large.  And you know, the country was in a semi state of war.  And we did not know whether that was another attack that had been launched and whether those were new shellings that had started.  So Mathieu picked up the phone, called around, and was asking people what had happened.

So one or two hours after, he came back to tell us that it would appear that the president's plane had been brought down.  I do remember the expression on his face.  You see, the president was his friend.  And I really do not want to remember the expression that he had on his face.  He was very deeply saddened.

So all of this meant that matters had been become extremely complicated.  We couldn't step out.  We had to remain in our homes to switch off the lights.  So we said we would go to bed and wait to see what happens next. 
Q.	So the in course of that evening, you noticed how saddened Mathieu was, and you all remained in the house.  Now, what happened the next day? 
A.	The next day, the first thing was to try to gather information about what had happened or about what was happening.  So I think Mathieu continued to call people to find out what was happening.  And as the head of the family, he told us not to step out, asked us to remain within the residence, until we were fully aware of what had happened.

But it was towards evening, I believe, that people began to come to Mathieu's house to seek exile at his home.  And also it is at that time that we began to receive news from outside about the shellings and about what was happening outside.

People had come to the residence and were telling us what they had seen happening on the streets, how they had been frightened, and why they had decided to come to Mathieu's residence. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, let us know proceed more chronologically about this day.  You have already moved to the evening of the 7th of April.  But let me ask you, to the best of your recollection, whether Mathieu left his residence at any point in time on the 7th of April.
A.	Are you referring to the 7th of April?  
Q.	Yes.  The 7th of April in the morning or at any other time as far as you can recall.
A.	Well, I do not recall the specific date, but I know -- I do remember -- that at some point I saw Mathieu put on his suit and -- because he had taken me into the residence, I had become the eldest member of the family so to speak.  So he turned to me and told me that he had been called up to attend an 
	urgent meeting which had been convened to seek to set up an interim government.  

The country had no president.  And according to the constitution, the requirement was for a body to be set up to govern the country.  So I do remember that gendarmes came to collect him and to take him out of the residence towards the end of the day.  But I am not too certain about the exact date on which this happened. 
Q.	Very well.  On the 7th in the morning at Mathieu's residence, do you have any recollection of the persons who were present at that residence on the 7th in the morning? 
A.	I believe that some family members on the 7th -- I think it was only us.  I do not remember at what time people began to come to the house.  But I think it must have been around midday or in the afternoon of the 7th.  If you are talking about the morning, I think it was just us, just us. 
Q.	When you say "us", are you referring to the family unit, the restricted family unit, including yourself as a nephew?  Or who else was in the house?  Who are you referring to as "we" or "just us"?  Were there any soldiers?  Any guards?  Who else was at home? 
A.	Myself, Delphine, Mathieu's granddaughter, Rose, Frank, and Nancy -- I think that was the name -- a family friend from Ghana.  And Delphine's dog as well.  I think that's all.  That's all I remember. 
Q.	Was Mathieu's home guarded?  Were there any soldiers? 
A.	Well, I myself -- I blamed Mathieu on this particular point.  When I got home, there was news about all types of politicians who were being murdered more or less on a daily basis.

So I asked him what was his problem.  He travelled around town driving himself in town freely.  He even gave me a lift to town once without a guard, without an escort, nothing, absolutely nothing, at his residence.

So that was something that I had pointed out to him.  But the reassuring factor was that the gendarmerie camp was some 50 to 100 metres away from the house.  Well, I told him that it was not safe to be under those circumstances.  He travelled a lot, and he did not even have a bulletproof vest or jacket that he would have needed.  I even asked people from the United States to try to see if they could offer him one.

And he was living in an unguarded house on the road going to the Bugesera, a very public place, to my mind.  And that was my opinion at that time. 
Q.	Very well.  So it is your testimony that, to the best of your recollection, in the afternoon -- that in the afternoon people began to arrive at Mathieu's residence.  Now, can you describe to the Court who those people were.  And if you have any names, please mention them. 
A.	I do not remember which family came first, but it was probably Shingiro's family, S-H-I-N-G-I-R-O, Shingiro.  That was probably the first family to come.  Shingiro himself, his wife, his daughter, and his son.  I might be mistaken, but that might have been the first family to come, to show up.

Their children were Delphine's friends.  And when they came, it was as if they were actually going to their own home.  So we asked them what was happening, and they were the first people to tell us about what was happening outside; that the security problems had become unbearable.  So they were the first family to show up.

And then Wycliff -- and I no longer remember his family name -- Wycliff came with his wife.  And I think he is Tutsi.  And what is funny in Rwanda is that you do not necessarily know people's ethnicity, but I think he must have been Tutsi.  And I know that he was a friend to one of my friends who is still in Rwanda today.
So we socialised at my friend's place.  We were not friends in any particular manner, but we socialised.  Then there was Ephrem who came.  He was a trader.  He was a trader in the city.  He hailed from Nyanza which is in the south of the country.  Nyanza is N-Y-A-N-Z-A.  He also came with his wife and his son and one or two daughters.  I am no longer certain as to the number of children.

Then Karemera's family also arrived.  Karemera, Frodouald arrived with his wife and I believe his mother.  There was an elderly woman in Frodouald's company. 
Q.	Witness, you are referring to Karemera? 
A.	Yes, Karemera. 
Q.	His first name -- is it not Frodouald?
A.	No.  It's Karemera.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I think you should add the right first names with the family names.
THE WITNESS:
It's Karemera.  I cannot recall his first name.  I'm sorry about that.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	But you are saying Karemera. 
A.	Yes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
THE WITNESS:
So people came in a day or two in a house we were not ready for several people, people that were -- so many people.  And there was no food.  And as I was the eldest son, so to speak, of the family -- Mathieu was busy trying to understand what was happening outside -- it fell to me to organise and share the little that we had.

So I started organising the sleeping arrangements.  There were elderly persons, young persons, all sorts of people.  So I had to organise the house and also manage the little that we had -- share the food, who should eat what.

That is what happened during those two or three days there.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	At one point in time did Rose's sister not come to seek refuge in the house? 
A.	Rose's sister, yes.  I had completely forgotten about her presence.  Rose's sister came in the afternoon of the 6th April to Monique.  And there was a family dispute with the husband.  She was considered as Mathieu's daughter.  That's how she was looked at.  Each time there was a family dispute, she came because she considered Mathieu as the father.

Yes.  I recall.  Monique was there since the afternoon of the 6th of April. 
Q.	Was she alone? 
A.	I believe she came with a young boy, but I have no recollection of that little boy.  He was small, a very small little boy. 
Q.	Very well.  Are you able to tell us a little more about Ephrem.  Who was Ephrem? 
A.	Ephrem I believe, because that is how -- that is what we were told.  He was a Tutsi, had a beer distribution business in Kigali.  He was a rich person, and I recall he came with a vehicle, a car, a car that was very modern, very new, red in colour.  I cannot recall the make.  And I used to see his son drive the car. 
Q.	All these persons who came to Mathieu's, what reason did they give for coming to Mathieu's? 
A.	Well, first of all, because they felt safer in Mathieu's house because the gendarmerie was close to the house.  And since Mathieu was a politician, they thought he would be able to protect them.  So it was for protection.  And I also think that they were confident that Mathieu was going to protect them. 
Q.	People came to take refuge in Mathieu's house 8th, 9th, 11th?  Were people still coming?  And at what time did things change?
A.	I think at a point in time there was a young person who came to the house.  I was very busy organising -- making the household arrangements.  I did not -- I was not able to see the young person until the evening when I was asking people to go and sleep because I had to make sure that the young boys do not sleep in the same place as the young girls.  That was my duty.

I saw this young boy who was sitting there a bit disturbed, and I asked him who he was because I hadn't seen him earlier.  And he told me he was the son of a trader or an industrialist called 
Wust (phonetic).  Wust  is Wycliff's brother.  But I said I did not see any interaction between Wycliff and that boy.  So I did not know they had any family links.

But I was told that he was his nephew.  Well, I did not know him.  He was much younger in relation to me.  So I said, "Well, everybody will eat and then go to bed."

Well, obviously, later on, when I was talking to Shingiro's children with whom I had started having some kind of conversation -- but I did not know this particular boy because I did not live in the upper-class neighbourhood of Kigali.  So I did not know Shingiro's children until they came to Mathieu's house on that day, and that is when we started getting to know each other.
So they are the ones who told me about this boy.  And I went to speak to Wycliff on what he thought, and that is when Wycliff asked me if I can accompany him to his brother's house to see what was happening because his brother was living at about a hundred metres from Mathieu's house.

1015H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, if I understood you well, you are saying that you saw a child looking sad among the children who had come to the house.  And from the information you gathered, he was Wycliff's nephew, is that the case? 
A.	Yes, that is the case. 
Q.	So you did not know when that child got to the house? 
A.	No.  I can assert that, as I said earlier, I was busy organising family matters, because from a family of four, five people, you now have 20, 25 persons.  And as you know, in Rwanda, and in Africa in general, you normally don't have food stock to cater for such situations.  So someone had to be in charge of managing that.  And I recall that at a point in time and that is what -- that is where Ephrem and his 
	son -- that is where Ephrem and his son became helpful.  We used their vehicle.  Two days later, when things became more difficult, we had to go to town and get some more food because we could not support all those persons. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When was it then that Wycliff asked you to accompany him to his brother's house and for what reason?  
A.	I think it was a day after I noticed this boy whom I was told is his nephew.  So I spoke to him.  The following day, around 10 a.m., he told me if he could go and find out what was happening in the brother's house.  So I asked Mathieu if we could have some gendarmes to accompany us.  So we had two gendarmes to escort us to his brother's house. 
Q.	What did you do observe when you got there?  How did things happen at his brother's house?  Can you identify that place?  
A.	Give me -- please give me a moment because these are memories that I have tried to forget, because 
	I recall Wycliff's face when he saw the father and the mother, the bodies of his father and mother, and he started crying and trembling.  
Q.	Take your time.  I know it's not easy.  I know these are very painful memories.  
A.	At that time -- luckily, I have a personality that enables me to bear such situations.  I asked Wycliff to help me to take -- to take a carpet which was on the sitting room.  We cannot bury them -- we could not bury them because we did not have the implement to do so.  But, at least, we could give them some respect.  We could cover them with -- with a carpet.  I remember we put them side by side and I think Wycliff took -- I can't find a French word -- it was something that contained the identity card and all documents of his brother.  So we covered them with a carpet and the gendarmes were very worried.  They were telling us that -- what time we have to go; you see people are being killed; we have to leave.  And given that pressure, we put the carpet and left. 
Q.	Approximately, how long did it take, one hour; two hours; 10 minutes? 
A.	I'm sorry.  I started speaking before you finish with your question -- between 20 and 30 minutes, because, as I was saying, the house was within 200 metres. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry to make this request at this time.  Can we take the break at this point in time to enable the witness to recover.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, the Court is worried about losing some time.  The witness can be excused, and we can address some matters that I have written to the Chamber about yesterday.  There is an application that I would like to make.  So we can do that for the next five minutes, if time is of concern.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, in response to the request from Counsel Hounkpatin, we excuse you now and you can return at 10:45 when your testimony will continue. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Webster, we received the note that you submitted indicating what you wish to address, and 
I presumed Ms. Hounkpatin has received it as well. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe so.  We sent it to everyone, and I did discuss it with Ms. Hounkpatin yesterday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it controversial?   
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, it is.  I believe that the Ngirumpatse Defence team still wishes to hear from this witness orally, but 
I leave it to them to explain their position.  Perhaps it changed overnight.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't think there is much I have to add, Your Honour.  The thing is clear.  So I won't take any more time, and I will let Ngirumpatse's Defence respond to my concerns. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, please.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  The first comment I would like to make in response to my 
colleague's request is that it is a surprising request, because possibly this is due to the different legal cultures that we come from.  

Mr. Webster's view of the manner in which I wish to call my witness -- I am aware that, Mr. President, you accepted for the defence of Joseph Nzirorera, that the transcripts of his witness be admitted under 
Rule 92 bis, and it is for good reason that I want to hear this witness viva voce.  And when the Prosecutor says that he is coming to say exactly the same thing, I'm sorry to say that is not the case.  He is not coming to say the same things.  If it were the same things that he was coming to address --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, I am surprised that you described this as an issue of judicial systems.  The law provides that a witness's testimony can be admitted in writing in lieu of hearing him come to testify orally, subject to certain conditions.  

You made an application for this witness's testimony to be admitted in writing, and we granted the application.  And so the witness's testimony in writing is already a part of the record of this trial.  So he cannot come back to testify orally again.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry to disagree with you, and Mr. Webster explained this in his request.  The 
92 bis request was submitted by the team of Nzirorera.  I don't know if this was 92 bis.  It was not even 99(C) (sic).  These were transcripts that were admitted.  

So, Mr. President, what I am saying is that I need to have you hear this witness viva voce.  The Prosecutor is against -- this is not the condition that you are explaining.  It's not the situation that -- the explanation you are giving is not the same as my situation. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Perhaps I can offer a clarification, Your Honour, if Ms. Hounkpatin does not object.  This particular witness was listed by the Nzirorera team, and it was the Nzirorera team that submitted 
92 bis application, which was granted by this Chamber's decision of the 15th of July 2009.  And as a result of that, the entirety of this witness's testimony in another trial, the Zigiranyirazo's trial was admitted.  And I reviewed those transcripts in relation to the will-say statement that was submitted by the Ngirumpatse team, and I find that the content is essentially the same.  

So perhaps a decision was made by the Ngirumpatse team after 92 bis application.  I'm not sure when they decided to add him -- add this witness to their list.  I do note, however, that this was a new witness that was added towards the end of their series of Rule 73 ter submissions.  So we have him as a new witness.  I think he was added after the 92 bis application from the Nzirorera team was granted.  But he will come to say exactly the same thing, judging by the will-say statement that was submitted on the 24th of May 2010.  

I do note that the will-say itself is dated 1st of October 2008, even though I think we received it on 2010.  But there is no difference between the content of the will-say and the content of this 
witness's testimony in the Zigiranyirazo trial.  

So, essentially, it is an issue of judicial resources.  I think that would be wasting resources to have the witness come back and say exactly the same things that are already a part of our record. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I just want to clarify for my colleague on the other side that that witness has been on our list right from the beginning.  He was not added, as he is saying, at the time that we disclosed the will-say.  The will-say was disclosed much earlier.  It was disclosed again in April or May 2010.  

But from the outset, even before Nzirorera's request, this witness was on the list of our witnesses and it was never a joint defence.  Joint defence would not be enough.  This witness, right from the outset, had been on our list so that he can come and testify orally.  

So let me add that it was from the 7th of April 2008 that he was listed and the marking was 7031.  And I do not agree with my colleague when he says that he is coming to say exactly the same thing.  Why is it that at the time all witnesses of the Prosecutor who came to testify on the same issue come in the first place?  Why?  Why would this witness come in relation to charges brought against Ngirumpatse, testify on issues against Ngirumpatse.  If we have to rely on the transcripts of other trials to say that the witness has already testified and that is valid for all.  That would not be fair.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I just want to give my view on this issue by indicating to the Chamber -- Mr. President, Your Honours, you will recall that, on the 26th August 2010, the Appeals Chamber dismissed an application made by Joseph Nzirorera, on the grounds that there was no reason for that following his death and also the fact that the other teams were not part of Joseph Nzirorera's application.  I think that's an interesting situation. 

And on the same day, your Chamber rendered a decision which considered groundless an application by Nzirorera.  I think it is important to take into account the fact that Ngirumpatse's team has this freedom to deploy its own defence, and that he had found it necessary to call a witness, particularly since that witness, as they said, was already listed among their witnesses since 2008.  

Therefore, Mr. President, Your Honours, I believe on account of that there is no reason why they should not be able to call that witness, even if the Chamber is of the view -- or, at least, until the 
Appeals Chamber makes a ruling on the applications that -- the appeals that have been made, the evidence of Joseph Nzirorera remains on the records for now.  I think the Chamber is entitled to 
grant -- or to allow Ngirumpatse's team to call this witness to enable him make their case.  And that will be fair.  

Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could offer one last comment.  Your Honours, this is essentially an issue of judicial resources and economy and time management.  If this witness was coming to testify about the MRND party or the Interahamwe, and the Ngirumpatse's team wanted to go beyond the testimony that's already on the record, that would be one thing.  But when we look at the will-say statement for this witness, this is -- it should indicate clearly that this witness is a former member of the RPF and his testimony seems to concern exclusively the shooting down of the plane on the evening of the 6th of April and the 
RPF military campaign, which this Chamber has already held as marginal in its importance and significance for the factual issues that this Chamber will decide in relation to the indictment that we are proceeding on.  

So, although the witness's information may be interesting, we've explored quite extensively already through other Defence witnesses that it's a marginal issue.  When this witness testified in the Zigiranyirazo trial for the same reason, it was considered so marginal that there wasn't even cross-examination by the Prosecution on the issue.  The Chamber in Zigiranyirazo, judging by the record, was clearly impatient with the witness's testimony, because it was so marginal to the issues that were being adjudicated, and those are the same issues that we would be confronting in this trial, which are equally marginal.  

So it's for those reasons that I make the submission, but clearly, it is up to the Chamber to decide if it's worth time and expenses of bringing this witness to come and say the same things that he has already said in this trial by virtue of the Rule 92 bis application that was granted.
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I just want to recall the statement that you made following the comment made by my colleague on the other side on the need to save time and expenses.  You said that, 23rd January 2010, we are in a criminal trial here, and the fact of gaining time is not a criterion that govern a trial of this nature.   I would like you to keep in mind the statement which is fair in such a criminal trial, faced with the position of my colleague on the other side, which would prevent the Defence from presenting its case the way it had organised it.  In that case, it would mean that the Prosecutor is dictating the condition and the witnesses that he wants to hear.  

And, secondly, if you will not accept my -- Mr. President, I just want to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we've already understood the arguments.  What we'll do -- we'll just take time to consider the decision and we'll - we rise now and give our decision in about 20 minutes.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am on my feet, not to revisit this issue, but to respectfully remind the Chamber that we are waiting for the -- another decision -- another ruling on certification for appeal following your -- we are waiting for a decision on certification for -- certification -- application for certification, and we are waiting for your written decision on that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our mid-morning recess now.
