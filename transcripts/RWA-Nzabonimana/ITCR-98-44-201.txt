     (Witness enters courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 16th of November 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony -- 
THE WITNESS:
Present, Your Honour.  Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began your testimony yesterday.  

Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, we were in closed session yesterday, and I had not finished.  With your consent, we could return to closed session for a few moments so that I can finish the questions in that regard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.  We move into closed session for a short time.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 13] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MS. FALL:
Thank you.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, now I shall put questions to you about Gacaca courts and, so that we may go as quickly as possible, I shall ask you, Witness, to give precise answers to the questions I shall put to you.  That, I think, will greatly reduce your -- the time taken for your cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Unless there is an urgent need for it, we think that we will not have another break until midday, unless there is a need to have a short break.  So we will proceed.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you told us that you sat in Gacaca sessions; is that correct?
A.	No.  I told you that -- I referred to another court.  Gacaca is responsible for genocide.  As to the court where I sit, it is something different.  If you wish to refer to it in terms of a district, it has -- it works in a district, and it has nothing to do with the genocide. 
Q.	But you do take part in Gacaca sessions in your cellule, don't you?
A.	Yes, I do, like any other citizen would. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether all the people in your cellule take part in these Gacaca sessions?
A.	Even if some people are absent, the quorum is 100 people.  When the quorum is reached, then the Gacaca sessions can begin. 
Q.	I am going to focus, in referring to the Gacaca sessions, firstly on the killings that occurred in the Kayanga health centre.  I may return to this later.  Do you know anyone who talked about these killings?
A.	Yes.  During Gacaca sessions everybody tells the truth.  We say everything we know.  People exchange all kinds of information; we hide nothing.  This means that everyone is privy to all the information that is divulged during these Gacaca sessions. 
Q.	Witness, would you please answer my question, which is that people give testimony regarding the killings in the Kayanga health centre?
A.	Even if I do not take part in the Gacaca sessions of Kayanga secteur, I know that people give testimony about the massacres that occurred at the dispensary.  I know that people are still giving testimony about this matter. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whether the people who give this information said that they were eyewitnesses to the massacres?
A.	I told you that even if I do not take part in the Gacaca sessions organised in this area, I meet people from this area and, when I do meet these people, they tell me that witnesses talked about these massacres and gave exact information on the circumstances under which these massacres occurred and their perpetrators.  They will say, "Such-and-such a person took part in the Kayanga massacres."  They don't hide anything from us. 
Q.	Based on answers you've just given, witness, was it during your participation in Gacaca sessions that you heard about these crimes, or is it because people told you that they heard testimony about that?
A.	Actually, we receive most of our information during Gacaca sessions.  Before, people tended to keep the information they had to themselves, but in Gacaca sessions it is realised that people are more forthcoming and give more of the information that they have. 
Q.	Witness, I am going to show you a name that is indicated on a piece of paper, and would you please tell me if you know this person.
A.	In reference to the family name, if I remember correctly -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has referred to the name that has been indicated on the piece of paper, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Interpreter.  That name is redacted 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name is redacted.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He also referred to the position occupied by this person.  He thinks that that person to whom he referred has a certain position, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he can repeat that.

You can repeat the position.  Well, I don't know what it is. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter added that the witness said he was a conseiller in the secteur.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you tell us what this person's position is?
A.	Actually, they're called coordinators now -- district coordinators -- correction, coordinators of secteurs.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what role this person plays in Gacaca sessions?
A.	Coordinators have nothing to do with Gacaca.  They take part in it in terms of maintaining public order.  He is an administrative authority.  This is not an authority that would come to Gacaca sessions to fulfill any legal role.  This is someone who will come like any ordinary citizen, unless he chooses to interfere with the actions of Gacaca judges.
Q.	Do you agree with me that this person does actually participate in Gacaca sessions?
A.	Coordinators must participate in Gacaca sessions anyway.  They come there to maintain public order, but they have no role to play in terms of sitting in Gacaca sessions.
Q.	So since they participate in Gacaca sessions, is it possible then that these people would be privy to information that emanates from Gacaca sessions?
A.	Are you referring to the coordinators?  I didn't quite understand your question.
Q.	Yes, you told us that that person is a coordinator, that they participate in the Gacaca sessions, so is it possible that they are privy to the information that emerges from the Gacaca hearings?
A.	Yes, of course.  As anybody who attends the Gacaca sessions, they have ears to hear.
Q.	Witness, is it possible that a person who has been imprisoned and released might return to prison as a result of information given in a Gacaca hearing?
A.	I know nothing of that.  I am not aware of any such case in our area.  We were told that such cases might arise when the Gacaca hearings proper begin.  At home, the Gacaca courts have not yet reached that stage.  Perhaps in other areas they have and that is possible, but back at home we have not yet reached that stage.
Q.	Witness, are you aware of all the information -- do you have cognisance of all the information given in all Gacaca sessions throughout the commune?
A.	No, that is not possible.  In that case, what would be my role?  I have no role.  You only take cognisance of the information given out in the Gacaca sessions you attend, or when you meet neighbours who attend Gacaca sessions in other places and when you meet at the market you might talk of it from time to time.
Q.	Witness, you told us in your testimony that all the information emerging from Gacaca sessions in your commune was shared by everyone.
A.	No, I think you did not understand me correctly.  I spoke of neighbouring secteurs to ours -- perhaps one or two neighbouring secteurs, or two or three secteurs.  We meet at church, we meet at the market -- the same church, the same market.  If there is a place we have in common where we might meet, we might exchange such information.
Q.	Witness, have you cognisance of any information given in Gikomero secteur in Gacaca sessions concerning your incitement to commit genocide and your participation in killings in the course of the genocide?
A.	You're speaking of me, Madam Prosecutor, myself?  You're speaking of me, myself, that I played a role in the killing?  I did not understand your question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have a basis for that -- putting that matter to the witness?
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, this is information that we obtained in the course of our investigations, and the witness can answer whether he has cognisance of that or not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, I think the Prosecutor has an ethical responsibility in this matter.  Do you have a basis for putting that matter to the witness?
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're going to rise for a minute now.  We're going to take a short break.
MR. HOOPER:
Just before we do, can I ask that the question and the answer put to the witness just now, with probably little or no foundation, be put in closed session, and removed from the transcript?  It seems a gross unfairness to the witness to have that kind of allegation made on the kind of basis that one sniffs here, smells here, and not -- and have it made public.  It shouldn't be done.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we agree.  This last question and answer, which has already been dealt with in closed session, so we know what's the provenance of it, we order that it be placed under seal.
(Court recessed from 1125H to 1145H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, before proceeding, I think I should say that we think that counsel have a responsibility to have an appropriate foundation before putting accusatory matters of that nature to a witness.  You have given a declaration as to the basis upon which this line of cross-examination is based, and we do not think that, on the basis of information you've disclosed, that accusing this witness of genocide was proper.

You may proceed.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that before the break I had put a question to the witness flowing from information yielded from investigations undertaken by the OTP.  

The Trial Chamber decided -- was -- I don't think I had an opportunity to respond because of the break, but when the question was put, it was in a much more general context than the acts he was accused of in the document I used in closed session, which has been redacted, so I won't come back to that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you saying the document you used in closed session accused this witness of any acts?  Is that what you're saying now?
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that the questions I put to the witness concerning this document were clear.  I questioned him on the basis of a document we possess, and in which accusations are made against this witness.  He reacted by telling us that it was not himself in question.  
He mentioned Kabere cellule, and I will have the opportunity to come back to that, Mr. President, to see, indeed, whether Kabere cellule exists or not and whether it's not Kabarera in relation to the information we obtained.  I do not wish to revisit those matters.

I should like, with your permission, Mr. President, to continue my cross-examination and to the topic of the Gacaca sessions in a more general context in respect of the information we obtained regarding this witness in the course of our investigations.
MR. HOOPER:
I again interrupt, because what my friend is doing, and I base this on what has been demonstrated so far in respect to documents that were adduced today and also in respect of a document that was adduced, as we know, in respect of a previous witness, and on the basis of that, the whole tenor and basis of what is being put seems wholly inappropriate.  

Before the adjournment I understood my friend to say, in respect of Claude Karamu who's the name on the document and for whom I see no purpose in redaction whatsoever -- in respect of that person, as I understand it, there was oral information given regarding, as I understand it, this witness.  I find that incredible.  

Are we to believe that there is no document, no note, no statement?  Is it possible that Claude Karamu would have been asked just about one witness, or about several?  And I think, before we go any further, in my submission, we should be entitled to hear what it is the Prosecution have, and what's the basis for making the extraordinary allegation which this Court has found, with respect quite correctly, an improper suggestion.  What is the basis for it?

And we are digging there again; we've gone back to it, and we're still in open session.  All that's been said effectively since we came back has been said in open session.  The Prosecutor must surely appreciate she has a responsibility to this witness.  I suspect that has not occurred to the Prosecutor; she has a responsibility to this witness.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I should like to remove any misunderstanding that seems to exist on the Defence side.  We're not speaking of the same events.

When we spoke of this document, we did say -- and which is completely different from what Counsel Hooper is saying now -- that that document we obtained it from the Prosecutor's office.  It was an official in the Prosecutor's office who had supplied that document, provided it to us, and it is true that we also asked for information on other people, but we have not received it yet.

Now, as regards the information we obtained from the councillor, this is information of a different nature that he provided us, and it's on that information I wish to question the witness, because it is not at all the same as the topic discussed in closed session, but more general information on the participation of this witness in certain acts committed in April 1994.  And I think we are perfectly entitled to put to the witness questions on information that we have obtained, and the witness is free to answer "Yes" or "No".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it your position that you have no Rule 66 obligations with regard to that information?
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think we have questioned people who gave us some information.  We are putting the question to the witness, and these are not documents on which we are grounding our question, basing our questions; it is merely information provided to us in respect of which we wish to question the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are saying you are accusing this witness of genocide on the basis of information which is not contained in any statements?
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that unless the methods used in cross-examination at the time of the Prosecution case and cross-examination methods today in the presentation of the Defence case are completely different, and if the President tells me that there is a special procedure applied for the Prosecution, I can say that information was provided regarding the witness.  Without having been given the legal grounds on which those accusations were based, we are not making -- passing judgment on the truth of the allegations that I'm going to refer to in my questioning of the witness, but it is merely information that was provided which the witness can -- once again, I repeat, either be accepted or denied by the witness, or be denied as being untrue by the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would like you to know that we think that under Rule 66 the Prosecutor has an obligation -- has obligations which the Defence does not have.  And one of the obligations the Prosecutor has is to provide the accused person with information which may impact on the preparation of their defence.  

So if you have information which affects the credibility of defence witnesses, it is your obligation to disclose it.  That's what I'm referring to.

Now, you're saying that you have information but you don't have it in a form which can be disclosed, because it's not contained in a statement.  That's the question I was asking you.  It is a very serious accusation you're putting to the witness, but you're saying you don't have it in a form which can be disclosed.
Now, if that's the position, which you've stated in open court, we will allow you to proceed.
MS. FALL:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I'm drawing your attention to our perception of what your obligations are.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think we are conscious of the obligations of the Prosecution and we intend to comply with them.  We repeat that it is not -- that they are not proven accusations we're putting to the witness, but information we -- provided to us alleging his participation in certain acts.  I think this is a question that we can legitimately put to the witness and which he can either accept or refute, and I don't think the Prosecution will be going further than that.
MR. HOOPER:
And it's a grave shame that they don't feel restrained in any way not to even go that far.  If my friend is saying:  'We went and spoke to a man with a dog somewhere, who said this or that, and this is basically the basis upon which I'm putting these most grave allegations in open session to this witness,' then that is, in my submission, both an improper basis and an abuse of the position of Prosecutor.  And it shows a complete lack of awareness of her duties as counsel.

I invite her to reflect carefully on this position.  It's not a question here of keeping truth out; it's a question of producing matters in an appropriate manner.  She has no statement, she tells us.  So how was this information imparted to the prosecution -- over a cup of tea in Kigali?  Who provided it?  Was it Claude Karamu?  Why has he not made a statement?  How, if he's not made a statement, do the Prosecution propose to progress this matter?  Are they doing it on a wait-and-see basis?  We're seven years into the prosecution of this case.

If further allegations are going to be made based on, as I understand it, what Claude Karamu may have said, then of course that's already been put to the witness, and my learned friend can bear in mind that after the adjournment, Mr. President, in expressing the concern of the Court to her, said that the Prosecutor has obviously a responsibility, and accusing this witness of genocide on that basis was not proper.

But it's exactly the same basis, having heard those words, that the Prosecutor is now returning to -- nothing different; it's the same allegation.

Well, we spent a long time this morning on this matter, all of which could have been, and should have been, avoided with proper notice and a proper regard to obligations.  We've lost two and a half hours, and we lost time the other day, an hour and a quarter, for exactly the same reason.
I don't stand in the way now of further questions being put.  If they are to be put, I actually invite my friend to put them with the utmost specificity.  I know she was reluctant even to put the statement of the witness in this witness's hands, but having got it, he seems to have seen her off pretty good.  

Now, let's have the same extent of specificity in these oral over-the-cup-of-tea comments that she's picked up somewhere some time recently, put them as fully as possible to this witness so that he does not have to be recalled in the future to deal with it.  And please do it, because I do not trust the Prosecutor in this respect, in closed session.

And may I ask that all allegations so far made against this witness, to the effect that he participated in genocide that we've heard also be redacted, in the sense that they again have the protection of closed session testimony so that he does not have to walk away from here bearing what at present are improper allegations, with a lack of specificity.  

If in due course the Prosecution are in a position to put these things fair and square, I'll do my best to ensure he's recalled.  But, in the meantime, can you give him the opportunity to react fully and properly to these allegations -- allegations which, I must say, you should not be making in the first place, or the Prosecution shouldn't be making in the first place, but if we're going to have a mess, let's do it as best as we can.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I should like to retain my cool out of respect for the Trial Chamber, but I should also invite Mr. Hooper not to also go over the top, and the lack of confidence he demonstrates towards the Prosecution I should say is much greater on the Prosecution side concerning him -- in respect of him.

Once more, Mr. President, we must be quite clear: we have not here accused the witness of genocide.  We asked him, and I so consider that it is a right the Prosecutor has to ask him, whether he knows that in the course of Gacaca sessions he had been accused; if he knew that people had mentioned his name in the course of Gacaca proceedings.

I think the question is perfectly clear, and the witness can answer it.  And I did say that that information came from the conseiller, the councillor.  I'm not, of course, going to tell the Defence counsel how we obtained this information.  I'm not as he did -- under what circumstances it took place.  

We have this information.  We have put it to the witness, and we should like the witness to answer the simple matter whether he knew or not that people, in the course of Gacaca proceedings, had accused him of participation in the genocide.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, what you're saying is this, right: if you had that information, it was your duty to disclose it, and the Court has the power to order this an improper question and to tell you that you can't ask the question for violation of your Rule 66 obligation.  

Now, we have decided not to do that; we're going to let you ask the question.  But I want to make it clear that we are interested in ensuring that the fairness of this trial is maintained, and we expect counsel to observe their obligations.  We are concerned -- we have expressed our concern already in moderate terms, but we are seriously concerned about the propriety of this line of cross-examination, because we feel that accusations of this nature should not be put to witnesses unless there is a proper foundation for doing so.  And we expect to be informed of the foundation in advance as well as notice be given to the Defence about it.  

So under normal circumstances, we take a dim view of this way of proceeding, because we think it compromises the fairness of the proceedings.  However, we will allow you to put the question on this occasion, and we'll proceed from here.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I raise objection to the form of the question.  It has a touch of the:  "Have you stopped beating your wife?" about it.  The question that the Prosecutor wants to put is: did you know you've been accused in Gacaca of genocide?

Well, it presumes that he has been.  Now, so far, in respect to the statement there is a very strong indication, certainly from the witness's replies, that the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) there is not he.  We have no basis --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the Prosecutor said that the question is not based on the statement.
MR. HOOPER:
No, I appreciate that.  The question is now based on something even more void and less apparent, and certainly nothing that we or you have seen.  And if a question is going to be asked, the question should not be: do you know you've been accused in Gacaca?  It assumes that he has been.  The question should surely be: have you ever been accused in Gacaca?  

And the Prosecutor, given the position of what they have available to them at the present, and the lack of provenance in respect of it, should be bound by that question.  It will be for them in due course to rebut it.  
I've invited the Prosecutor to put matters specifically to him.  But to frame a question in that way: do you know you've been accused in Gacaca, she doesn't know if he has been -- none of us do.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, there are two small matters.  One, I have to redact the name of the witness, which I think --
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- I think you mentioned.  The record is quite clear.  And why we are concerned and the reason why we allowed the question, the record is quite clear that the Prosecutor does not have that information.  She's made it clear she does not have sufficient information, but yet she insists on putting the question.  

So we allow the question, and then we'll all be bound by the witness's answer.  We've invited the Prosecutor to consider her position, and she stated the position, that she doesn't actually know what the position is; that a certain person has given informal information, which has not been reduced to the level of a statement.
MR. HOOPER:
But who did this person give this to? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will just allow the question and the witness -- the normal rule in this matter is that we are bound by the answer of the witness.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we allow the question, and the witness will answer.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Right.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, did you know that in the Gacaca process you were cited as being one of the instigators, inciters to commit genocide, and having participated in acts of genocide?
A.	I know nothing of that.  Normally, when someone is cited in the Gacaca proceedings, you are called if it is another cellule from yours, or if it's in your own cellule you are called on the spot.  I know nothing of that.

MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, can the Prosecution indicate which Gacaca court that relates to, please?
THE WITNESS:
The Gacaca proceedings in front of the Gacaca -- Gikomero secteur; the Gacaca court which sits in front of Gikomero secteur, while I think it must be in reference to that other person I mentioned to you, I told you that he lives in that secteur.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is mentioning the person's name, says the Kinyarwanda booth.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know why you insist on thinking it's the same person as me, whereas it's not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I redact the name.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's name was not mentioned either in French or in English; it was only mentioned by the witness in Kinyarwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, interpreters.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you said that --
MS. FALL:
May I continue? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you said that the collection of information in the Gacaca proceedings had been finished.  
A.	Yes, that is true and, moreover, the phase of confirmation of the information provided is also concluded.  Inasmuch as the genocide crime has no statute of limitations, even if new information is provided after the confirmation of information collection phase is concluded, it can still be provided. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, because you have anticipated my next question.  Perhaps you could -- I could invite you to answer my questions very precisely.  So the phase of collection of information is concluded?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Is it concluded throughout the commune?
A.	Throughout Rwanda -- not only in our commune, throughout the Gacaca courts; they follow the same program nationally. 
Q.	We shall come back to that, Witness.  Witness, now I'm going to put questions to you in respect of your statements.  Witness, can you tell us how many times you met the Defence counsel and made statements to them?
A.	I think I met them three times, and I'm including the time when they came to see me where I am residing here in Arusha.  Otherwise, in Rwanda, I met them twice. 
Q.	Can you tell us on which dates, if possible, you met them in Rwanda?
A.	I cannot remember the dates, but I think the first time was in 2003, even if I can't remember the exact dates. 
Q.	On what date did you meet them the second time?
A.	The second time was in 2005, some time between February and June.  I did not keep track; I didn't know I was coming to testify to that time. 
Q.	Witness, when you met Defence counsel on those two occasions that you have just stated for us, did you or not make a statement -- provide them with a statement -- make a statement?
A.	I did not make a written statement.  They merely put questions to me that I answered and perhaps they took notes, but I did not provide any written document.  I have drafted no document. 
Q.	The document that they established on the basis of the questions and your answers, was it read back to you?
A.	They read those documents back to me.  I remember the first time questions were put as to what happened to me and my family during the war, and I answered those questions.  And then I remember that afterwards they read back to me what I had said. 
Q.	Did you sign that statement?
A.	No, they read from their computer so that I couldn't sign, but I remember that they read back to me what had happened to me and my family. 
Q.	Was that your first statement, Witness, and I can give you the exact date -- the 21st of June 2003; is that indeed your first statement?
A.	I don't remember the exact date, but I think you're probably right.  I remember the year. 
Q.	Witness, you told us you made a second statement in June 2005.
A.	When they came to see me, they read back to me my first statement, but I didn't sign it the second time, either, and I made no other statement on the second occasion. 
Q.	So, to be quite clear, your second meeting was for a second re-reading of your statement of 21st June 2003?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Apart from that statement, Witness, have you made any other statement to the Defence counsel?
A.	Yes, I did make another statement when I arrived here.  I made a statement very recently.  They asked me if I had any details to add to what I had said, and I remembered that the first statement only concerned what had happened to me and my family, and so I spoke to them of all that I saw during the genocide while I was fleeing.  And he asked me why I didn't speak of it to him before, and I said that the first time I was really answering the questions they put to me. 
Q.	So that second statement was made here in Arusha, and I can tell you that it is dated the 4th of November 2005.
A.	Yes, that's probably it.  That's the statement I'm referring to.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think perhaps we could break now and continue tomorrow with cross-examination of this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.

Mr. Witness, we only have access to the courtroom in the morning session, so we take our adjournment for the day now, and we resume tomorrow morning.  

I should remind you that while you are giving evidence and during this or any other adjournment, you are not to talk to anyone about the case or your evidence in the case.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  We'll take an adjournment until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1225H)
