MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. MJUI:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 19th of February 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:  
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, your testimony will continue after the break.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began.  

Mr. Nimy will continue his examination.  
MR. NIMY: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  
          FRANÇOIS KARERA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Karera. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	After a little break, we're glad to meet you again and we're going to carry on.  
	
	Mr. Karera, you would recall that during our last session we were about within the framework of all those meetings that were indicated to the Kigali préfecture known as PVK.  We were talking about a meeting which allegedly held on the 16th of April 1994.  
Now, Mr. Karera, on the 16th of April 1994, where were you? 
A.	On April 16th 1994, I was found in Ruhengeri at the Nyakinama University.  
Q.	Since when had you been in Nyakinama? 
A.	I arrived in Nyakinama on 7th April 1994 from the city of Kigali which I had fled. 
Q.	Didn't you move about in Kigali on the 7th of April?
A.	No, I wasn't able to do so. 
Q.	Did you ever hear about a security meeting which allegedly held at the Kigali city préfecture on that day of 7th April 1994? 
A.	If my recollection serves me right, I never heard about any security meeting whatsoever which allegedly held in Kigali on that date.  When such meetings were to be convened, the préfet would announce it on the radio.  In any event, I heard nothing over the radio with respect to the meeting you are talking about. 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. Issa. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Didn't you hear that Préfet Renzaho had said that the military authorities had decided to set up the civilian defence?  Did you hear about that? 
A.	Regarding the term "civilian defence", yes, I heard about it.  But I can't tell if it was Renzaho who announced it.  Rather, it was the prime minister who announced it.  He said it was necessary to set up civilian defence.  It wasn't Renzaho who talked about it. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you learn that Préfet Renzaho had said that he had met the MRND leader and that arrangements had been made so that after the meeting of the 16th of April the participants would go and collect weapons at the minister of defence?  Did you hear about that? 
A.	No.  I didn't hear that.  According to what I know about Préfet Renzaho, he was a soldier.  And the reason for which he was appointed as préfet for the city of Kigali was that he was impartial.  He was neutral.  And you had people from various political parties with him, and you had four political parties participating in the government.  So he couldn't have called on the members of the MRND alone.  In what framework would he have invited them, if at national level he was not in power to do so?  I did not hear anything about that. 
Q.	Very well.  Did you hear that after that meeting of 16th April 1994 of the security council, the participants at the meeting agreed -- afterwards went to the ministry of defence, or whether the conseiller had received five weapons each, including yourself, Mr. Karera, they claim.  Did you hear about that? 
A.	No, I never heard about that.  Someone came and testified before the Trial Chamber claiming that I had received five guns, and he was questioned as to who I was to have received those weapons.  Had I been a conseiller?  They asked him questions, and he was incapable of answering them. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, did you know Mr. Maniragaba -- spelling M-A-N-I-R-A-G-A-B-A, Maniragaba.  Did you know Mr. Benoît Maniragaba?  
A.	I don't know that person well, but apparently, that name is familiar.  There is one Maniragaba, who I believe lived either in the Gitega or Biryoga secteurs, but I don't know anything further.  I have no further detail. 
Q.	So wasn't he with you on 16th April 1994? 
A.	We never met.  We never sat down together in a meeting.  I knew many people, many residents in the Kigali city.  And that's how I came to know him.  I spent a lot of time in that city, so I know many people there.  
Q.	Very well.  Suedi Ndayitabi -- S-U-D-I (sic) N-D-A-Y-I-T-A-B-I -- do you know Suedi Ndayitabi? 
A.	I do not know Suedi Ndayitabi.  I do not know him at all.  I know an old man known as Ndayitabi, and he was the manager in many ministries.  As to Suedi Ndayitabi, I don't know that person. 
Q.	And that old man Ndayitabi, was he with you on April 16, 1994? 
A.	He was retired and he no longer worked.  I knew him but we never met.  
Q.	Mr. Karera, during your trial, were you charged with having received weapons after the meeting of April 16th in the Kigali city préfecture? 
A.	No.  No one ever accused me with respect to weapons received at PVK.  But I was accused of having distributed weapons in Nyamirambo, and the witness who came to testify to that effect stated that he was my domestic servant, and they told him that his name did not exist.  We checked his identification, and after identification we realised that he was a soldier who had been detained in Kigali.  When we discovered that that person was a soldier, the Prosecutor decided to drop the charge with respect to alleged weapons distribution by myself. 
Q.	And those weapons you allegedly distributed to Nyamirambo, were these part of the stock of weapons received at the préfecture of the Kigali city on 16th April 1994? 
A.	I never distributed weapons.  I was not in Nyamirambo.  I had left Kigali on April 7th, and I did not return to Kigali city.  

Counsel, those are all lies, and the Prosecutor, indeed, knows those are lies. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  Before moving on to the other meetings, the ones held before the 
	6th of April 1994 -- but before we get there, Mr. Karera, let me backtrack to a meeting we did not mention, the meeting of 9 April 1994, which still held at the préfecture of Kigali city.  It was a security meeting.  Do you follow? 
A.	I understood your question perfectly, Counsel.  I would like us to talk about this -- members of the security council of PVK, the Kigali city préfecture.  I told you the difference between the PVK and the Kigali préfecture.  And there's a law with regard to the running of the affairs of these préfectures, and so I'm one of the people who drafted that law.  The security council of the Kigali city préfecture is comprised of the préfet of the city, the bourgmestre, you also have the prosecutor and present -- at the time the person who was still prosecutor works in this Tribunal; the gendarmerie also works in that council, as well as the military barracks commander; the president of the court of first instance is a member and also the director of the prison.  The other people who I talked about couldn't have attended that meeting, and the meetings were held in closed session.  

So if such a meeting held that you have members who are not stipulated by the law, then it cannot be considered as a security meeting.  You have to refer to the law governing the city of Kigali that was promulgated in June 1990 and also refer to the chapter on the security chapter.  You'll find all that information therein. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  I understand your explanations on what is stipulated by the law.  But you see, Mr. Karera, with respect to criminal matters, it is, indeed, when offences have been committed that you know that the law was not respected at some point.  That is why I am asking you this series of questions.  Do you follow? 
A.	I do, Counsel.  We're talking about the meetings that held before April 6th? 
Q.	Mr. Karera, I'm not there yet.  We are on April 9.  I just wanted to refresh your memory.  Now I'm going to put the question to you:  Where were you on April 9, 1994? 
A.	I was still in Nyakinama in the Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	Didn't you go to Kigali on that day? 
A.	No, I had fled Kigali, and I couldn't have returned there. 
Q.	Did you learn that in that meeting of 9 April 1994 Préfet Renzaho asked that roadblocks should be systematically erected to check identification papers?  Did you hear about that? 
A.	I no longer recall.  In any event, I never heard that over the radio. 
Q.	Did you hear that during that same meeting of 9 April 1994 Préfet Renzaho had said that a decision to erect roadblocks to check identification papers had been taken in agreement with Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Nzirorera?  Did you hear about that? 
A.	No, I didn't hear anything about that. 
Q.	Did you hear that Renzaho, still him, had said that weapons had to be distributed to the people who were found at the roadblocks to block the way to the Inkotanyi who were entering the city?  Did you hear about that? 
A.	No, I never heard that on the radio.  I listened to the radio, and I did not hear about that. 
Q.	But, Mr. Karera, did you learn that weapons had, indeed, been distributed to the people? 
A.	Regarding weapons which were distributed to reservists who were able to use them, yes, I heard about that, but that was not announced over the radio.  Good citizens who were disciplined had been told they could receive weapons to ensure security.  
Q.	Very well, Mr. Karera.  And now I come to the various meetings that were held prior to April 6th, 1994.  In 1992, Mr. Karera, could you remind the Chamber what your duties were? 
A.	In 1992 I was sous-préfet of the Kigali-rural sous-préfecture. 
Q.	And what was your relationship with the national MRND, as well as its leaders? 
A.	I would have to split 1992 into two parts.  Before 16th April 1992, I was the chairman of the MRND in the Nyarugenge commune, and it is in that office that I was able to meet the party leaders, but who had not yet been elected at that level.  So you had three leaders, and they were elected in 1993.  I need to remind the Chamber about that.  

	But after 16th April 1992, after the agreement for the setting up of the multiparty government, the authorities were requested to be neutral, be it at communal or préfectoral level, including gendarmes, and the military had to be neutral.  Because of that I decided to stop leading a party, and I was replaced by my vice-chairman.  

	That is why I broke up 1992 into two.  Before I could have met one of the leaders, but after that we no longer had any relations with regard to political party or, in any case, within the framework of 
	political party.  
Q.	Very well.  Did you know -- Mr. Karera, did you know a certain building known as Rubangura, called Rubangura building?  And I am translating it literally.  
A.	I know two people called Rubangura.  These are traders and they are Tutsis.  There is 
	Védaste Rubangura and Uzel (phonetic) Rubangura.  These are Tutsi traders who are from -- who are natives of the Gitarama préfecture and who conducted their activities in the city of Kigali.  So who of them are you talking about, Uzel or Védaste Rubangura?  
Q.	Mr. Karera, I am talking about Védaste Rubangura.  
A.	Yes, I know Védaste Rubangura.  He owned two buildings, one, which was a building for traders next to the motor park in Kigali, and another building, which was found not far away from the minister of the plan on the avenue of the -- of justice -- Justice Avenue, was also a building that was used for trade. 
Q.	Did you ever attend the meeting in that building in February 1992?  
A.	In February 1992, at the time when Ngirumpatse, Mathieu was the president of the MRND party in the Kigali city, yes, I was the MRND president in Nyarugenge, and along with Ngirumpatse we met during a meeting in that building.  Yes, I went into that building. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, was it on that occasion that there were over 45 people who had been convened to that meeting that you met Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I no longer remember the exact number of people who had been invited, but Ngirumpatse was the chairman of the MRND.  But maybe if you remind about what was discussed during that meeting, it could jog my memory, but I no longer remember the number of people in attendance at that meeting. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Karera.  I will do that.  Was -- I mean, did Ngirumpatse present the members of the national committee of the Interahamwe during that meeting? 
A.	No.  I know some of the members of the national committee.  However, those members were not there during that meeting.  On that day he told us what we had to do to present the MRND well, and he explained to us what were the characteristics of an MRND party member.  In order to be chosen, you firstly had to be chosen by the commune committee.  He said that people should not insist too much on the number of members but mostly on the quality of the member and that it was better to have a little number of members who were of high moral quality, rather than having many members who were 
	ill-behaved. 
Q.	Didn't Ngirumpatse say that Tutsis were members of the Inkotanyi and hence had to be killed? 
A.	You must be joking.  It would appear you really don't know who Mathieu Ngirumpatse is.  You don't know what his relationships were and where he lived.  

Let me tell you about the Rubangura building.  That building was rented by Technoserve, which was an American company.  Some people who were working there were Tutsis, and I know them.  You had Kayitare from Nyamirambo.  You had Assiel Kabera.  At some point in time, he was the préfet of the Inkotanyi.  That NGO was in charge of studying development issues in Rwanda, and they would even work at night.  

So how could Mathieu have said that Tutsis had to be killed, whereas in the committee a secretary, for example, was a Tutsi.  You had Tutsis within the MRND.  In that building you had Tutsis.  That building belonged to Rubangura, who was a Tutsi.  So how could he have said that Tutsis should be killed in talking to Tutsis?  I mean, people can tell lies, but in that particular instance I think this is a gross exaggeration.  
Q.	Very well.  There was a second meeting the following week after the first meeting.  Did you attend it? 
A.	Counsel, would you be so kind as to remind me of the date?   
Q.	Still in February 1992.  
A.	I believe the meetings which were held before April when the MRND leaders were convened at commune level, I attended all those meetings.  
Q.	Very well.  Now, during that second meeting I am referring to, did Simon Bikindi and Sukari attend? 
A.	I know those two.  I know the singer Simon Bikindi.  He was a worker in the ministry of youth.  I know Sukari as well.  When the MRND was the single party, he was a singer in that party.  I can't forget them.  And I can tell you that those two people were not in attendance at that meeting.  I can assert this.  
Q.	I am talking to you about these people, Mr. Karera, because the witness who mentioned these events stated that Simon Bikindi and Sukari had sung a song on the extermination of the Tutsi during that meeting.  Did you hear about that? 
A.	This is the first time that I hear about that, yet I know those two people.  Those songs were never sung within an MRND framework.  
Q.	Very well.  Still, during that meeting, membership cards -- I mean, were membership cards distributed? 
A.	No, that is impossible.  MRND party membership cards were distributed by the party committees at commune level.  So these party cards could not have been distributed in public.  I was in attendance at that meeting, and Mathieu -- Mathieu never distributed those cards.  

	Allow me to remind you that those cards had to be signed by the person who was issuing them, and Mathieu was at a préfectoral level.  But, Counsel, is there anyone who showed you those cards?  Did you check the signature of the issuing authority of the cards?  Alternatively, would you be so kind as to identify that authority to me?  No, there never was a distribution of a membership card during that meeting. 
Q.	Very well.  The requirement to be issued an MRND card, what was the requirement, Mr. Karera? 
A.	To be issued an MRND membership card, one had to be an adult, 18-year-old adult.  And the member had to apply in writing or verbally, and the communal committee with ten members had to meet to examine the file of each applicant.  

	And that was done because the MRND party could not let bandits, undisciplined members, and other immoral persons or persons who had defected from other parties in its ranks, and especially where such persons were established or were known not to tow the MRND line, and that would bar them from membership.  And following the communal committee meeting, the members who had been vetted in -- the applicants, rather, were identified, and their names were placed on the roll of members of the party.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  But was there -- is there a prerequisite which you might have left out in your account? 
A.	Counsel, you see, a lot of time has gone by, and perhaps I do not recall all the requirements, but discipline was the core requirement, and the other requirements were ancillary requirements.  And I believe I have mentioned the core requirements to be met by an applicant for MRND membership. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, as a prerequisite to be issued an MRND membership card, did the applicant have to have undergone military training? 
A.	That makes me laugh.  That is impossible.  Among MRND members you had elderly men and women from all ethnic groups.  And with specific regard to Kigali town and Kigali-rural préfecture, MRND had a large membership, and even if soldiers had to join, that was impossible because that requirement was not relevant.  I have acknowledged before this Tribunal that I was a member of the MRND, yet I never underwent any military training. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Karera.  Thank you.  So after that second meeting, allegedly one week later there was a third meeting.  Mr. Karera, did you attend that meeting? 
A.	I have already explained that all the meetings that took place before the 16th of April and that were chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, I had notice for those meetings and I attended.  However, I challenge the fact that there were weekly meetings, because we were all busy.  And Mathieu himself was busy as well, and perhaps subsequently I can dwell on his job.  So it was impossible for us to meet every week.  However, regarding meetings that he convened and which I had knowledge -- I acknowledge, rather, that I attended those meetings. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, do you know Désiré Murenzi -- spelled M-U-R-A-N-Z-I (sic), Murenzi? 
A.	Yes, I know Désiré Murenzi. 
Q.	Who was Désiré Murenzi in the MRND? 
A.	Désiré Murenzi was a member of the MRND party in Kigali-rural préfecture because he was a native of Gikomero commune, and to my memory he did not hold any specific duties in the party. 
Q.	But regarding his activity in the party, was he replaced by Mr. Augustin Ngirabatware during that meeting, which I would call the third meeting in February 1992?  Does that ring a bell? 
A.	Did you say Augustin Ngirabatware of the préfecture of Kigali-ville?  I do not know anybody by that name in the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  The only person who bears that name and whom I know hails from Gisenyi préfecture. 
Q.	And during that third meeting, did it so happen that Désiré Murenzi was replaced by Ngirabatware as honorary leader of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Did you say honorary president?  I have told you already that I do not know anyone by the name Augustin Ngirabatware from the Kigali town préfecture.  And regarding Murenzi, who would have appointed him to the position of honorary president of the Interahamwe?  If such an appointment had been made, he ought to have been elected by the national committee, or alternatively by the president, that is, the national chairman of the MRND, yet that is not the case.  So I take it that he never held that position.  
Q.	Very well.  But, Mr. Karera, you would understand that the questions I am putting to you are curled from allegations made by Prosecution witnesses before this Court in their testimony, and that is why I have to check the veracity and the probative value of those testimonies.  Do you understand? 
A.	I understand you fully, Counsel, and that is why I, as a person who attended those meetings and who knew many citizens or dwellers of Kigali, acknowledge that I, indeed, know Désiré Murenzi, and I have further stated that I know the MRND leaders who stand accused in this trial.  But if you are referring to other persons who allegedly attended that meeting and who are to my knowledge, I would tell you.  But regarding Augustin Ngirabatware, I know no one by that name in Kigali town préfecture, but perhaps, if you gave me further information by, for instance, indicating his occupation, I might be in a position to -- or it might refresh my memory, and I think I know the national dignitaries as well as those who held duty positions in (inaudible). 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Karera.  Let me put it to you that Mr. Ngirabatware, Augustin was the minister of planning in the government of Rwanda.  He is the one I am referring to.  
A.	If that is the person you are talking about, I know him very well.  I know him in a dual capacity.  

	Firstly, he had been professor at the university, and he was a famous national professor.  And I know he hailed from Gisenyi and that he served as minister of planning in the national government.  And I would like to confirm before this Chamber that that person was not at that meeting.  
Q.	Very well.  At that meeting, did Mr. Ngirumpatse say that the time had come for the MRND to embark on its plan against Inyenzi? 
A.	I have told you that you are giving me the impression that I do not know Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I believe the people who make such allegations do not know him as well.  His wisdom would not have warranted him to make such statements.  Yet, it is thanks to him that we were able to get many Tutsi members into the MRND in Kigali town.  He couldn't have made such utterances unless he was guided by the objective to destroy his own party, the MRND.  No, he never ever made such utterances.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  Mr. Karera, tell me, do you know Mr. Ahmed Napoleon Mbonyonkiza? 
A.	No, I do not believe I know that person.  The name does not ring any bell.  And what did he do for a living?  
Q.	All right.  I'll tell you.  Mr. Karera, that gentleman in question was the leader of the MRND youth from December 1991.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Youth leader of the MRND in what commune?  In what préfecture?  
Q.	Kigali.  
A.	Let me start off by Kigali town.  On the 16th of December 1991, the national Interahamwe committee was not yet established because I think that it was in the course of December that the entity was set up in 1991.  We did not even consider the establishment of youth organs at communal level, and be it at the commune or préfecture level, there was no youth organ.  And for quite a while there were only national committees, and on the date you mentioned, that is, 16th of December 1991, that body did not exist.  And that person, therefore, could not have led in solo the MRND youth.  There was definitely a committee, and if such -- if somebody -- that person were to allege that they were a leader, then they ought to give you the name of the other members of the committee which he chaired.

0945H
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Very well.  Thank you.  So, Mr. Karera, now let's address the meeting which purportedly took place at the end of April 1992 at Védaste Rubangura's.  Did you attend meetings that took place at the end of 
	April 1992 at Rubangura's?  
A.	At that time there was -- the political parties had signed a memorandum of understanding, and at the level of the préfecture office the draft of that MOU was already available, and we were cognizant of the content.  And if you are talking about April, at the end of that month, 1992, I believe it was sometime around the 25th of April and beyond, I couldn't have attended such a meeting where I spoke, for that matter.  But if it were a meeting which I attended, I might be able to discuss the matters that were addressed.  

And I say this, subject to the fact that the person who placed that meeting at the end of April would be mistaken, because that meeting should have preceded the signing of the MOU, that is, memorandum of understanding, between the political parties.  
Q.	Thank you.  I confirm that it is, indeed, the end of April 1992.  And that meeting is said to have seen the attendance of about 50 people.  Ngirumpatse, Karemera, Nzirorera were those who chaired the meeting.  Did you hear about that, Mr. Karera? 
A.	Let me start by discussing the year 1992.  To discuss the three persons you have just mentioned:  In 1992 Ngirumpatse was the leader of the MRND party at Kigali town, while Nzirorera was the -- a member of MRND at the Ruhengeri préfecture, not in Kigali town, while Karemera was in Kibuye.  

And at the time, these three persons had not been elected to national positions.  And with regard to that alleged meeting, if I attended that meeting, I did not see the above-named persons.  

The person who mentioned the presence of those three persons at that meeting should say in what capacity those three persons attended that meeting of the MRND political party at the préfecture level of Kigali.  

And there is no link between those three persons and the MRND party at the Kigali préfecture.  You would understand that the person who made the ambigation -- allegation, rather, was simply saying pure lies. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Karera, according to that same Prosecution witness, there was a -- a second meeting during which commune, secteur and cellule elections took place, or were held; is it your recollection? 
A.	This is the first time I'm hearing such an allegation.  

There were three communes in the Kigali town préfecture.  And you have also mentioned elections at secteur level.  Since I headed the préfecture of Kigali town, I would say it had about 19 secteurs.  And there were more than 300 cellules in the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  

And how, therefore, could such administrative bodies meet in a building to hold elections?  Elections could not have been held at those three levels concurrently in one and the same meeting.  You would fathom yourself the challenge it would bear for the organisers of such an election.
Q.	Mr. Karera, the witness alleges that Ngirumpatse chaired that meeting.  Karera -- or Karemera, I am sorry, and Nzirorera were in attendance, even though the witness says Nzirorera did not hold a position in the party, but that he attended in his capacity as a friend of the party.  

And, Mr. Karera, it seems that it was during that meeting that you were elected chairman of the MRND at the commune level; what do you say to that?
A.	Let me start by the last point you have raised.  I was not elected to the office of chairman of the party at the communal level in 1992.  I was, rather, elected around August 1991.  And the elections took place in the office of Kigali-ville préfecture.  But in 1992 I ceased to perform those duties.  Perhaps that is what that witness was trying to say. 

Regarding the second point, the persons who were vested with the powers to elect the chairmen 
of the party at the communal level were established in the legal instrument.  And you have mentioned members of the cellule committees who are not provided for in the law of the party -- or by-laws of 
the party.  So you would understand Ngirumpatse, being in the MRND in that capacity, defied the law.  And it also means that Karemera flighted -- flouted, rather, the law that was in place at the time.  And that is not possible.  

I have just mentioned the date of my appointment as chairman of the party at the communal level and the date on which I quit that position.  And, therefore, you would understand that with the clarification I have made, the testimony borne by that witness cannot be reliable.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  But, Mr. Karera, do you know Michel Haragirimana -- Haragirimana?
A.	Haragirimana?
Q.	Haragirimana.  I'll get there. H-A-R-A-G-I-R-I-M-A-N-A.  Haragirimana.  Do you know that person? 
A.	I believe I know that person, unless there are several persons who go by the same name.  But if you were to give me further information, perhaps by way of his occupation, I think I would be in a position to respond with certainty. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, I'll do so immediately.  Haragirimana, Michel, was that person appointed deputy secretary -- or elected, rather, deputy secretary of one of the communes of Kigali.  That is the person I'm referring to. 
A.	I believe you are referring to Nyarugenge commune.  Since the law did not make such provision, no deputy secretary was elected in that commune.  According to the law, there was a chairman, a vice-chairman, a treasurer and only a secretary.  There was no position of deputy or 
	assistant secretary.  

And let me say that the person I know could not have held the position of secretary.  And nobody would have gone as far as seeking him to hold that position because the MRND party was trying to get intelligentsia to hold that position so as to able -- to be able, rather, to stand their ground vis-à-vis the other parties in the country. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, this Mr. Michel Haragirimana was present at your election, was he? 
A.	When I was elected in 1991 he was not among the people who had to elect.  He was not there.  
Q.	Why, Mr. Karera, are you so sure about it?  Could you tell the Chamber why.  
A.	I say so because the people who had to elect were the members of the communal congress.  And the members of that communal congress are people who are stipulated by law.  We had no president at that time.  

In any event, he was not among the members of the commune committee, and he was not an 
elected member of the secteur committee either.  Hence, he could not take part in the elections.  He could attend as an observer but he could not achieve -- he did not have the right to vote. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Karera.  Let us go to the third meeting in that series, the third, as the Prosecution witness said.  I am basing myself on the fact that you attended all these meetings, as you stated before the Trial Chamber.  During that meeting did you hear that Nzirorera was present? 
A.	I just told the Trial Chamber about elections that were held.  But they were held at the PVK bureau and not in the Rubangura office.  You need to make a distinction between those two events.  You don't have to confuse them.  I was elected at the office of the Kigali préfecture -- city préfecture, and 
	Mr. Nzirorera was not present.  

As to the meeting that held place at Rubangura in which people claim there were more than 
150 people, what I have to say is in Rubangura's building there was no room which could contain 
150 people.  So that meeting never took place.  Since that meeting did not take place, I therefore did not attend. 
Q.	But did you, perchance, learn that Nzirorera allegedly said during that meeting that the training of 
	the Interahamwe was done with and that the Interahamwe had received firearms and grenades, which they would use in the event where the MRND was attacked or in the event where the city was attacked by the Inkotanyi?  Did you get wind of that?  
A.	No, I never heard about that.  But let me explain.  I believe that the witnesses who come and testify before the Trial Chamber do not know those Accused.  Nzirorera is a very orderly person.  He, who was in Ruhengeri, could not have meddled with the affairs of the Kigali préfecture.  
And I would like to insist to the Trial Chamber that even before the advent of multiparty politics, at a time when many people had to be convened in a meeting, you had to apply for an authorisation.  

And as I told you, I was a bourgmestre in the city of Kigali, and I was also a préfet and sous-préfet.  And you always have to apply for authorisation from the préfet.  And there are specific times that are meant for these type of meetings to be held.  And when the préfet does not have enough placement, then 
he -- he can ask for gendarmes.  Maybe the préfet of PVK had many policemen, police officers, and could use them to ensure security during that sort of meeting.  But for such a large number of people to meet, the préfet needs to have given his authorisation.  

That type of meeting could not have held.  And, if such had been the case, the gendarmerie -- the gendarmerie would not have allowed it.  Remember that we were at war.  During such times people cannot meet for many hours -- hours, without authorisation from the intelligence services.  That is out of the question. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  Tell me, Mr. Karera, do you know Mr. Setiba, S-E-T-I-B-A, Joseph Setiba, to be more precise? 
A.	I do, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, who was he? 
A.	Well, I knew Setiba in 1991 because he ran into problems with his neighbours.  He seized their fields and stopped Kabageni Venantie from passing and blocked the way.  She was a Tutsi, and he did not want Kabageni to go through that area.  

She came and complained at the préfecture office.  Préfet Bagambiki, who is standing trial before this Tribunal, asked me to go and check what was happening.  So, I was in charge of the 
economic services, which had land in that area.  We went there and noticed that he had placed bones, which we took out.  These are the conditions under which I met him.  We gave him a warning and told him that he was not to start again.  

Before we left he told me that "You, Karera, I knew you.  When I was in primary school, you were school inspector."  I asked him where he had come from and he said he had come from -- he was a native of Rushashi.  I asked him what he had come to do there.  He told me, "I had come to try out my hand at things as a traditional healer."  

I went and investigated his origins, and I was told that he was from Minazi secteur in the 
Rushashi commune.  

I was also told that at the time when he left his commune he was considered to be a witch, a sorcerer, and had been chased away by members of the population and that he had come to seek refuge in Butamwa, where he bought land.  

I know him as a sorcerer, as a liar and as a trickster.  And that is how I know Setiba, Joseph. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Karera.  Did the sorcerer/liar -- Mr. Setiba we are talking about -- was he 
	the president of Interahamwe in the préfecture of Kig -- Kigali-rural between June and 
	September 1993?
A.	Did you talk about Kigali-rural, Counsel?  Yes, indeed.  Between June and September 1993 
	Kigali-rural préfecture never had an Interahamwe committee.  That committee existed in the city, but no meeting was ever held to elect him.  And if such a meeting were to be held, then the authorisation of the préfet had to be sought.  And I believe that had such a meeting been held, I would have been told about it.  

Setiba was never president of the Interahamwe in the Kigali-rural préfecture, considering the fact that there was no Interahamwe committee in Kigali-rural préfecture.  Otherwise, I would have known about it.  

And I would like to insist on the fact that there are people who come and tell lies before this Trial Chamber.  If he had been elected as president, he must have had a vice-president, a secretary and a treasurer. 

Considering the fact that he was -- that he had barely gone through primary education, and taking into account his doubtful character, he couldn't have been elected.  But during the war I heard that he was Interahamwe, but in the city of Kigali, during the war.  
Q.	Lastly, still with respect to Setiba, did you ever hear that, in the event where one would think about someone for the Kigali préfet -- Kigali-rural préfecture --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda request counsel to kindly repeat his question.
MR. NIMY:
	I am sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would you mind repeating the question, please. 
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.  That was what I was about to do.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Did you ever hear that people believed -- or that people thought at some point in time that -- about Mr. Setiba as being the person who would be the president of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural? 
A.	I heard about that here.  I know the members of the MRND committee at national level, and those are the people who could have elected -- had him elected at that level.  

The first president of Kigali -- Kigali-rural was Desiré.  The second one -- the first one was 
Nyandiywi, Desiré.  The second one was Semanza.  And I know them very well.

1015H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Very well, Mr. Karera.  Still with regard to these meetings, let me ask you the following:  Did you know the Kabuga building? 
A.	I did.  I do. 
Q.	What is it? 
A.	The Kubuga building is a storage building, built along the Nyambugogo road, not far from the Muhima market.  And it is close to the Muhima secteur office where the canton tribunal was set up.  You always had many people there.  You also had the office of the state prosecution office.  It was a big building and had an agency, a branch of the Banque Populaire.  And when that building was built, I was found -- I was in the city of Kigali.  
Q.	Did you hear that a meeting held there between May and August 1993?
A.	What meeting are you talking about?  The MRND had offices there and held meetings therein, but I can't tell what meeting you are talking about.  But I'm certain that meetings were held in that building.  But what meeting are you referring to, Counsel? 
Q.	Mr. Karera, I'm talking about a meeting, an MRND meeting, indeed, which held in the 
	Kabuga building between May and August 1993.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May and August 1993.  Counsel had previously said 1983, then corrected himself to 1993. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't remember that meeting.  I can't deny the fact that meetings were held.  The MRND had offices in that building and they certainly held meetings in that building which I no longer recall the meeting you are talking about. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you.  But let me enlighten you and this may jog your memory.  A meeting that was chaired by Ngirumpatse and during which Nzirorera allegedly announced that the Interahamwe had returned from their training in Gabiro, and he asked -- allegedly he asked that the houses in which Tutsis lived had -- should be -- 
MR. N'DOW:
I think it is obvious that Mr. Nimy has not been asking the right questions to the witness.  You know, just giving him the impression that there was a meeting at the building and not being specific about the time.  I don't think that's the right way to ask the question to a witness.  He should at least ask him to approximate the meeting, when it was and who were those in attendance, before he starts in with this witness. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, the Prosecution witness who led us to conduct this examination-in-chief, to cross-check events with the witness, is not stating anything more than what I'm asking the witness; namely, a meeting held between May and August 1993 at the Kabuga building.  And he provides details during that meeting, which was chaired by Ngirumpatse. 

Nzirorera announced that the Interahamwe had returned from their training in Gabiro.  These are claims from the Prosecution witness, who further states that during that meeting which -- the date of and period of which he locates between May and August 1993 without further detail.  Nzirorera allegedly asked that Tutsi houses should be put under supervision and that -- and to report to him or to Karemera or, alternatively, submit the report to the building to an employee who was meant to collect them.  Those are testimonies for the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mister -- Mr. Nimy, we allow you to put the question. 
MR. NIMY:
Thank you.  Much obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Karera, did you hear about what I said with regards to the claims of the 
	Prosecution witness? 
A.	No, I did not hear that. 
Q.	Very well.  And more specifically, Mr. Karera, during the meeting of August and, let me be specific, with regard to the period August of 1993, according to Prosecution witness, Nzirorera allegedly said that a list of Inkotanyi accomplices had to be drawn.  Did you hear about that, Mr. Karera? 
A.	No.  I did not hear that and I did not take part in those meetings. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  Mr. Karera, we have completed the series of questions, but allow me to put one last question to you regarding the Arusha agreements.  

As a cadre of the party, a backbencher in Rwandan politics, did you ever hear about those agreements, Mr. Karera? 
A.	Yes.  As a préfet, I received that document.  The sous-préfet had to read it and understand it because these were the authorities who had to implement it.  I know those agreements, but I can't tell you I know all the fine details offhand, but I think I know it. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  I don't think we're going to look at the summary of the 
	Arusha agreements.  That is not what we are looking for.  But what was the ultimate goal for the Arusha agreements, when we know that since October 1990 Rwanda was at war; the ceasefire had been decreed and flouted; and that ultimately an agreement was reached, which was known in August of 1993 as Arusha agreements -- April 1993 as Arusha agreements.  So, Mr. Karera, what was the goal sought by those agreements? 
A.	Did you talk about the ultimate goal, where it had to lead?  The agreements had to lead to elections to move out of the transitional government.  That was the ultimate goal.  But so far as we were concerned, there were two aspects.  Firstly, the war had to stop for people to see -- to stop dying.  And the second aspect were elections so that institutions which ought -- which would have been selected by the members of the population to be set up. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, in the process of this agreement did you ever hear about the GTB -- sorry, the broad-based transitional government? 
A.	Yes, I heard about the BBTG.  I am aware of it and I know what it meant. 
Q.	In sum, what was it?  What does it mean?  Very summarily.  
A.	We had to set up an interim government because the government that was running affairs comprised four parties.  It had to be broadened to include the RPF, meaning that RPF members had to participate in that government.  That is why it was called broad-based.  So it was called broad-based transitional government, broad based to include the RPF. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, did the BBTG -- was the BBTG meant to be the final stages of Rwanda? 
A.	It was a government which was limited in time, according to those agreements.  The ultimate 
	goal -- the main goal was to lead us to elections, and that broad-based transitional government had to organise elections, set up institutions, new institutions, which were acceptable to the people.  That is why it was described as transitional. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, you are a politician.  Let us talk about real politics.  In terms of importance, what was more important for you as a political player, a transitional government, be it broad-based or not, or elections? 
A.	The most important were the elections.  When you are playing politics, after your elections by the people you need a lot of time to work for the electorate.  That is what is important.  A 
	transitional government may be acceptable because it is short-lived.  But the most important thing for me was elections, which is where we ultimately had to arrive at. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, did the MRND -- was the MRND afraid of the Arusha agreements with respect to the elections which were the ultimate goal sought by the agreements? 
A.	You said MRND?  The MRND was set -- very sure of winning the elections.  That is why they wanted those elections so badly.  Why were they sure?  Because MRND had its leaders and members who were loyal.  You had communes that were managed by Inkotanyi, such as Byumba and Ruhengeri.  They said, "Since the Inkotanyi are here, let us organise elections."  

When the elections were organised, it was the MRND members who were elected in areas under RPF control.  And even today, even if the chance was given to the MRND party to run for elections in Rwanda, everyone is going to elect MRND members. 
Q.	Now -- thank you, Witness.  I'm sorry.  It's very difficult for me to see the clock from this angle.  I believe it is 10:30, but I am at the end.  I still have one question.  I would leave this to the discretion of the Bench whether I should put it now or after the break.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
If you have one question only, you should put it now. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Karera, did you learn that elections were organised in 1993 in the demilitarised zone? 
A.	Yes.  I just alluded to the said elections.  Of course, I heard about this and I followed them rather closely.  Some of the state officials who organised those elections had come all the way from Kigali.  I knew a number of them.  They came and told us those who were elected.  It was publicised over the radio and even carried in the private press.  And it was the MRND party that carried the day following those elections. 
Q.	And who was it that lost those elections? 
A.	Oh, it was the RPF.  That's always controlled by the RPF.  And the RPF was sure -- confident that it was going to win the elections.  But none of the RPF members were elected. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I am done with my examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Nimy.

Do any other Defence teams have questions of this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have a few questions to put to Mr. Karera.  And I wish to avail myself of the 
10:30 break to maybe delete those questions which, either directly or indirectly, may be redundant following the questions put forward by the team led by -- for the Defence team of Nzirorera. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I do not have any questions, Mr. President, for this witness.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

We take our mid-morning recess now.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, you may continue.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, thank you.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Karera.  With your permission, I will introduce myself.  My name is Frédéric Weyl.  I'm a lawyer with the bar in Paris.  I am co-counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I will ask you a few questions, in fact, questions for purposes of clarification, given that essentially you have been very, very clear in the answers furnished to my learned friend Patrick Nimy but I think that it would be wise if I ask for some further clarifications.

To begin with, you told us -- you stated that you knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Can you specify exactly what type of relationship you have with him and the circumstances under which you got to meet him.
A.	I know Mathieu Ngirumpatse very well, and he also knows me.  We've know each other from our boyhood days, and we've remained in a good relationship until this day.  Now, concerning the circumstances under which I got to know him or what I know about him, I would say that there are many things I know about him, and it would be difficult for me to be exhaustive.  But by way of answer, I will give you a few details on that score.   
Q.	Did you know him in a private context? 
A.	Yes.  I know him privately as well.  Because as I just told you, we've known each other from our youth.  I also know him from the various offices that he held and through which I had the opportunity of meeting him.  I already mentioned that I was a teacher and I had him as one of my students.  Even if he himself may not remember, but at one time he was a student of mine. 
Q.	You also got to know him within the framework of political activities I believe.
A.	Yes.  I know him well.  I have known him in the various offices that he held, but that does not necessarily mean that we held the same offices, even if I was informed about the offices which he held. 
Q.	And can you in a few words state the dominant traits of character of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, I mean his strengths and weaknesses.
A.	I will, first of all, ask him to bear with me because I will not be able to enumerate all his strong points or strengths, but he's a very compassionate person.  And I will talk maybe of five traits in delineating his character.  I will begin from his youth, character traits which he displayed very early in life and which he kept on displaying later in his adulthood.  I will then talk about members of his family and what he inherited from his family.  Thirdly, I will talk about offices which he held and which made him known nationwide and even beyond the country.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, maybe so as not to put me in difficulty with regards to the commitment I took towards this Trial Chamber, can you kindly limit yourself to essential character traits concerning his character.  And please do not add too much flesh to my question.  I have no doubts that you certainly have many things to say, but please can you focus on the essential issues. 
A.	Now, concerning essential issues, I told you that I got to know him very early when we were studying together in 1952 and 1953 before we went to secondary school.  We were of the same age, and we were both brilliant persons.  So Mathieu is a brilliant guy, and we respected each other.  We appreciated each other.  And both of us played football, and he continued with his love for sports until the time when he participated in creating the Kiyovu football team.  So I can say he is a very intelligent man.

I also know him, secondly, because I know him -- I know him within his family.  I know members of his family.  He comes from a strongly Catholic family, members of which attended faithfully Mass services and would sing.  And he inherited from his family this quality of a singer and a practicing Christian.  He's a known singer, and he's one of the founders of the Kigali choir which brought together both Tutsis and Hutus, men and women.  

And his songs continue to be sung today.  And even when he found himself in prison with us, he took time to teach us how to sing.  And he even called me up openly sometimes to lead the choir.  And so he's a reputed artist.  And his compositions, his songs, are very, very interesting.  He's a poet.  

And concerning the third point, I know him through the offices which he held, and I will begin with his career in the judiciary.  I taught him civic education.  I also got to know him because he was at the court.  And at the time we were just three of us teaching.  There was him, there was Gatwa, and a 
third person.  And we were particularly interested in Mathieu.

And what we liked in him was that he carried out detailed investigations to make sure that anyone who had been arrested was arrested legally.  And whenever he found that the file did not have enough evidence, he would release the arrested person.  We really appreciated that and appreciated him because in his inquisitions he did not demand -- did not impose very, very heavy sentences.  Because for him, prison was a place which people should go to convert -- to reconvert themselves, to be able to fit themselves back anew in society.  

This is what characterised him, and maybe I should limit myself to that concerning his career in the judiciary.  But maybe I should add that he continued loving the judiciary because even after he was an adult, he went to Strasbourg where he obtained a doctorate in law.

And so, in fact, today he's a doctor in law.  And I think that you certainly understand better than I do what a title -- what that title means because you are a lawyer yourself.  And he also held office as minister of justice within the Nsanzimana government between 1991 and 1992.  And after these offices, he also served as lawyer.  You can guess that he was a prosecutor, and he also served as a lawyer.  I can also talk about his -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, please let me come back to my wish, my wish that you be more focused in your responses.  I am sorry I have to interrupt you, but tell me -- if I told you that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is secretarian as a person, authoritative as a person, would that correspond to his character?
A.	If that is what you are talking about, I will maybe give you the main traits of his character.  We are talking about a humble man.  We are talking about a simple, down-to-earth person.  We are talking about a discreet individual.  And fourthly, this is a man of integrity.  The fifth point, this is a man who loves justice and truth.  And from what I know about him, he's patient.  He's simple.  And these are the main character traits which I can cite concerning his character even if I know much more about him. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, I thank you very, very much.  Let me ask you some clarifications on some points which were addressed by my learned colleague Nimy.  And maybe I should ask for a particular clarification.

Counsel Nimy asked you a few minutes ago whether you participated in meetings in February 1992, that is, meetings of the MRND which meetings were also attended by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  For my part I wish to ask to erase any ambiguity whether you have any recollection about having attended any meetings during that period, meetings held by individuals in the MRND buildings, meetings that set out to organise a youth wing of the MRND.

Did you attend any meetings with that objective?  
A.	No.  I did not attend any meeting with the aim of creating a youth wing of the MRND. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, thank you for that clarification.  And this will help me and avoid asking many other 
	follow-up questions.

Now, to the best of your knowledge, when the youth wing of the MRND was created, can you tell us whether Mathieu Ngirumpatse in any way or other gave instructions or orders to the young -- to the MRND youth wing.
A.	Personally, I do not know anything about that.  But when you talk about the youth wing, there are some organisations which abusively referred to as the MRND youths, and yet that is not the case.  
Q.	But to your knowledge, Mathieu Ngirumpatse never -- well, let me specify that.  I repeat.  From your recollection, from what you know, Mathieu Ngirumpatse never got around to giving orders or instructions to the youths of the MRND or to the Interahamwe of the MRND.  
A.	Oh, did you say Interahamwe of MRND?  Well, personally, I would not qualify -- I would not describe the Interahamwe as a youth wing or as youths because when someone is married, when someone is a grandfather, he is no more a youth.  He is no more part of the youths.  And if I consider those who were part of the national committee of the MRND, all those who were part of that committee were adults.  
And I was not informed about Mathieu Ngirumpatse having given any orders or instructions to the Interahamwe.  And I also know that Mathieu Ngirumpatse loved writing, and he was educated in writing.  And if, perchance, he gave my instructions to the Interahamwe, there should be a document in which these orders are confined.  And so personally, I do not know of any such. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, thank you very much.  That having been said, I wish to move on to your administrative duties.  As part of your administrative duties as sous-préfet before the 6th of April 1994, can you tell us whether, in one way or the other, you received instructions from the MRND officials or leaders.
A.	When I was sous-préfet, I never received instructions from MRND leaders.  At the préfectoral -- at the préfecture, even if MRND leaders gave instructions, they would have given these instructions to the préfet.  And personally, I never received any instructions from the leading organs of the MRND as part of my work there as sous-préfet. 
Q.	Well, you have been even more precise than myself because you used the word "organs".  And so I suppose that by so saying you are equally saying that you did not receive any instruction from any of the three defendants present in this Trial Chamber.
A.	That's correct.  I never received any instructions from any of the defendants in this Trial Chamber. 
Q.	Did your bosses or your subordinates ever receive any instructions, any orders, any directives from the organs of the MRND or from any of the three defendants in this Trial Chamber? 
A.	I will begin by my bosses, and I would say there was government made up of ministers from different political parties led by a prime minister from the MRND political party.  No instructions could have been given at the préfecture office or at the sous-préfecture office for such instructions would not have been implemented without having prior approval by the hierarchy, and the organs of the MRND would not logically have given any orders or instructions to a government that was led by a prime minister from the MDR.

And concerning the three defendants here, I was in the Kigali-rural préfecture, and none of the 
three defendants, even after their election, was part of the MRND organs at that préfecture.  You, therefore, understand that none of these three accused persons could have given any instructions to the administration at the Kigali-rural office, préfecture office.

Now, concerning my subordinates, I would say that none of the three defendants could have been able to speak to any of my subordinates.  And if perchance any of these three defendants had the thought of organising any meeting within the area of my jurisdiction, they would have had to ask prior authorisation from the minister who would have informed the préfet who in turn would have asked the gendarmerie to ensure security for that event.  And none of these three defendants ever did any such thing because none of them had jurisdiction or the competence to do so.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Karera.  When you run into any difficulties in carrying out your work or generally speaking at your office, did you have to report to the MRND organs or to Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Well, Mathieu Ngirumpatse would not have been of any help to me within the framework of my work at the préfecture office.  But even if I had any difficulties, I would have informed the préfet, and I would not have thought about submitting any such report to Mathieu Ngirumpatse because Ngirumpatse could not come all the way to solve those problems in the territory that was under my authority without going through the préfet.  

And even after he was elected to the office of MRND president nationwide, he was always obliged to go through the préfet if he thought about coming to organise any meeting in the Kigali-rural territory.

And if at all he had attempted organising any such meeting without prior authorisation, I myself would have been accused or condemned because I would have flouted the law on the administration of my préfecture and regarding the organisation of political meetings.  And, therefore, you understand that that would have been an administrative blunder, talking to someone, to anybody, who would not have been able to give me any assistance.

1200H
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  I still have some very short questions to ask you to provide specific detail.  My learned colleague, Patrick Nimy, asked you if you knew Joseph Setiba, and you were very lengthy and quite eloquent.  He also asked you if you were aware that Joseph Setiba had been the president of the Interahamwe in the Kigali-rural préfecture, and you answered him clearly.  

I want to know if, as one witness claims, you attended a meeting in the -- Rushashi, R-U-S-H-A-S-H-I, between June and September 1993, during which Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Mr. Semanza were allegedly present and during which Joseph Setiba allegedly was presented to members of the MRND as the president of the Interahamwe.  Do you recall any such meeting?  
A.	Such an event never took play -- I -- place.  I recall all the meetings I attended.  Remember that I was a sous-préfet and -- the Kigali sous-préfecture.  Rushashi is found within the sous-préfecture.  And the sous-prefect -- the sous-préfet of that sous-préfecture's name was Juvénal Sezikeye, S-E-Z-I-K-E-Y-E.  Sezikeye.  Therefore, as a sous-préfet, I couldn't have gone to another sous-préfecture to hold a meeting there.  The person who talked about Rushashi did not tell the truth. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, for further detail, as far as you are aware, one Turatsinze was, at any point in time, president of the Interahamwe in the Kigali-rural préfecture?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Turatsinze, number 40 on the spelling list.
THE WITNESS:
Would you kindly tell me his first name.  Who's -- Turatsinze, his first name?  Do you know his first name?
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Before I give you a first name, I would like you to tell me if you are aware of the existence of one Turatsinze who allegedly was an Interahamwe president in Kigali-rural préfecture.
A.	Then, subsequently, I will tell you no.  There was no Interahamwe committee in Kigali-rural préfecture. 
Q.	That fully answers my question except maybe to ask you if you know about one Jean-Pierre Turatsinze? 
A.	Yes, I know one Jean-Pierre Turatsinze.  He lived in the city of Kigali and was a native of Nyamirambo.  I know him.  We were not close, but I knew him. 
Q.	And could you tell the Chamber what you knew about him.
A.	I knew Jean-Pierre Turatsinze when he came to the Nyarugenge urban council, and he had come in search of identity documents because he wanted to present it to be employed as a driver.  We checked the registers.  And when we found his identity, we issued him the document he was looking for.  I believe that was that occasion he told me that he was going to be a driver at the presidency.  

The second time, I saw him driving one Donat who worked at the presidency.  Who was -- he was working at the intelligence service at the presidency.  We were conducting an investigation in Nyakabanda, and I saw him.  He was a driver.  

On another occasion I saw him, he was working at the MRND, and he was driving a vehicle.  Subsequently, I would see that he had been dismissed.  That is all I know about Jean-Pierre Turatsinze. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  Now, let me come to my last question -- let me say, my possible last line of questioning.  This all depends on your answer though.  As sous-préfet of Kigali, you were, I presume, confronted with the issue of internally displaced persons.  
A.	Yes, there was an issue.  I had a problem with internally displaced persons, especially those who were coming from the Byumba préfecture and who had sought refuge at the Rutongo commune -- R-U-T-O-N-G-O, Rutongo -- which is found in the Kigali-rural préfecture.  Although they were in the Murambi sous-préfecture, the préfet went there precisely because of forestry problems.  I told them that they had -- I -- I went there to tell them how they had to behave.  These IDPs were in a place known as Nyacyonga.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Spelling, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A.  Nyacyonga.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Karera, in your opinion, did this order resulting from the influx of IDPs around Kigali -- I mean, did this facilitate the entry of RPF infiltrators into the Kigali secteur and its surroundings?  
A.	You are talking about infiltrators.  It is very likely that the influx of refugees facilitated the attack.  But I need to tell you that the IDPs had entered Kigali long before, and I have had a chance to say this before.  The infiltrators were in Kigali.  They had come claiming that they were students and, as I said before -- but when the refugees or the IDPs entered, the infiltrators came along with them.  

As I already indicated to the Chamber, I was a sous-prefer -- sous-préfet in Byumba.  And among those IDPs you had Tutsis.  There was one, for example, who owned a pharmacy.  And when he arrived, he entered the city of Kigali.  I went and saw him, and I greeted him.  That is why I'm saying that when the IDPs arrived the infiltrators also took advantage to enter the city of Kigali and its surroundings. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have completed my examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  I think we will just take a five-minute break and then -- before the Prosecutor cross-examines.
	(Court recessed from 1210H to 1214H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. N'dow, do you have any idea of how long you might be?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I hope to finish -- significantly less than the time that the Defence used.  I -- I understand that they used about three hours.  So I do not intend to spend more than two hours with the witness, Your Honours.  My plans really, and my objective, was to finish the cross-examination of Mr. Karera today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. N'DOW:
So I will really just have maybe -- it -- it depends on how long the Court will take to finish this session today. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  I think we will stick to the original plan and adjourn at 12:30. 
MR. N'DOW: 
All right, Your Honours.  I have only 15 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Today.  Yeah.
MR. N'DOW: 
Yeah.  Thank you.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Karera, good afternoon.  My name is Mr. Saidou N'dow.  I am prosecuting counsel.  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And I will be cross-examining you.  And I will be asking you questions.  And I would advise you to be as concise as possible in your answers.  And also when I ask you questions, it's not meant to provoke you.  It's simply to assist the gentlemen in front of you in their functions.  Do we understand each other? 
A.	I am in agreement with you. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, on the 7th December 2007, Trial Chamber I convicted you of three counts of genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity, and murder as a crime against humanity, and they imposed a single sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of your life; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  But I disagree. 
Q.	Okay, Witness.  You were charged with ordering, authorising, participating in the crimes committed against Tutsi civilians in Kigali-ville préfecture and Kigali-rural, where you served as sous-préfet and préfet; is that correct, Witness? 
A.	Those were the charges against me, but I do not accept them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And the Judges in that trial, after hearing the totality of the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the evidence you presented in your defence, concluded in a resounding judgement that you did indeed order, encourage, participate, and failed to prevent the crimes committed; is that correct? 
A.	I have to say there's evidence which was not examined by the Chamber.  I also have to say that some evidence was not presented during the trial. 
Q.	Yeah.  But what, Witness, we have to agree on is that this is what happened.  The Judges found you to have ordered, encouraged, participated, and failed to prevent the crimes; is that correct, Witness? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, can you support the Judges who do not seem to want to see the truth?  And the Prosecutor indeed was of the opinion that the Judges dissimulé some documents which could have contributed in -- as exculpatory evidence.  Yes, I agree this is the findings of the Judges, but I disagree because I don't believe that they did their job properly. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And, Witness, you would agree with me that the Trial Chamber found that in April 1994 three policemen -- Kalimba, Habimana, Kabarate -- who were stationed at your house in Nyamirambo committed crimes, together with the Interahamwe.  Can we agree on that?  That's what the Trial Chamber found.  
A.	You asked me to answer by yes or no.  But that is a very difficult thing for me to do.  There's always need to provide -- to expantiate (sic).  

Now, did those police officers -- they didn't state under what authority they were acting?  These were the police from the préfecture of the city of Kigali; whereas, I was working in the préfecture of Kigali-rural. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, these people, they are stationed at your house, and you know that they committed crimes.  In fact, you ordered them to commit the crimes.  Is that the case? 
A.	Those police officers were not at my home.  As a matter of fact, they couldn't even come to my home. 
Q.	But the trial -- 
A.	You see, the préfet, Renzaho, who asked me to come to my home -- who asked them to come to my home -- that is why I say justice was not rendered in my case. 
Q.	And the Trial Chamber did not believe you when you said that they were not stationed in your house; is that correct? 
A.	But what do you want me to do when Judges become liars?  I'm sorry for having used -- I apologise for using that term.  The Prosecutor has -- did not demonstrate the link there was between me and those police officers, even at administrative level, at the level of the territory I was in charge of.  Show me that link, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	And you said, "What do I do?"  And what you did, Mr. Witness, was to appeal.  Didn't you appeal? 
A.	I did appeal. 
Q.	And the Appeals Chamber upheld the findings of the Trial Chamber; is that correct? 
A.	Did you read what the Appeal Chamber wrote with respect to Nyamirambo?  I have not read the decision of the Appeal Chamber in French, but I believe that they dropped the claim with respect to Nyamirambo. 
Q.	They dropped some of the claims.  And we'll get to that, Witness.  Witness, in your alibi -- you rely on an alibi, and the alibi was that at the time of the crimes you remained constantly and exclusively at the Nyakinama University campus at the relevant period, that is, from the 7th of April through the 17th of April; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.  Yes.  I was in Nyakinama in the Ruhengeri préfecture.  
Q.	And you presented evidence.  You called about eight witnesses, including yourself; is that correct?  
A.	You talked about an alibi.  But the Prosecutor first went and saw those witnesses and accepted here 
	his -- their testimony, but the -- the Bench did not believe them.  Yet the Prosecutor had indeed accepted that during that time I was in Nyakinama, but the Bench did not believe that. 
Q.	The Prosecutor, Mr. Witness, did not believe that.  And so was the Bench -- in fact, Witness, I will come to what they did in their findings.  

And I will read that for you.  In paragraph 510, Witness, the Trial Chamber said, "After viewing the evidence of the alibi in its totality, it is understandable that" you "stayed in Nyakinama in Ruhengeri préfecture between 7th and 19th April 1994" but not exclusively and not constantly.  I will read on, "The Chamber considers, however, that the credibility issues raised in connection with your Defence evidence...as well as the reliable and credible evidence placing" you "in Nyamirambo, Ntarama, and Rushashi during this period eliminate the reasonable possibility that" you "remained consistently and exclusively in Ruhengeri préfecture."  

They did not believe you when you said you were indoors at the Nyakinama campus and never ventured outside.  They did not believe that.  What do you say to that, Witness?  
A.	Let me explain that to you.  The distances are very great.  That is why the Defence prayed the Chamber to go there and see the distances.  The Prosecutor was in agreement, and the Chamber went there alongside the registrar.  We had asked them to state the premises and the distances in kilometres, to state where the roadblocks erected by the Inkotanyi were found, and to examine all the sites.  They spent three days there.  And the President, the presiding Judge, the President of the Tribunal, who was the presiding Judge, had accepted that the Judges should -- should go there.  That was done.  

When they noticed that we were right, they did not submit a report.  We asked for a report of their 
field trip to be drafted.  That report does not exist.  

Tell me if the distance between Nyamirambo and Ruhengeri was indicated to you.  Did they tell you the distance between Nyamirambo and Nyamata?  We showed all those distances on a map.  And we showed the positions of the RPF, places where people could not go through to go to another area.  Do you have that report?  The Judges worked for three days but did not write a report.  

Now, do you believe that we are going to agree with their decision, their findings?  The findings of the Judges are false.  
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	What is the state of the road?  What is the time required to cover the distances between the various areas?  How long does it take?  Did they say -- tell you those?  
Q.	Mr. Witness, your concerns were actually considered by the Appeal Chamber, weren't they? 
A.	But the Appeals Chamber did not go to the field, and that is an error that that Chamber committed.  

Now, if something is -- happened in Nairobi and you not go there to check the facts, how can you draw conclusions?  

We showed them maps.  Maybe they made reports which they did not publish.

1230H
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned in your testimony on Thursday last week that you had lodged an appeal, and after you lodged the appeal the Trial Chamber in their judgement -- the Appeals Chamber in their judgement mentioned that the Trial Chamber must file a report on its visit.  That's what you said.  

Was that not what you said in your testimony on Thursday?  
A.	I said so.  But the Trial Chamber did not write a report.  The Chamber made a field trip, but even if it filed a report, that report is hidden somewhere.  That is what I said.  And I insist on saying that the Chamber went to the field but that it hid some documents.
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I can see that the time is 12:30, but if I could just finish with this line of questions and then we can adjourn for today.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you also went on to say that you have requested for a copy of the judgement in French, but you still have not received it, and that you would make an application for a review as soon as you have received the judgement.  That was your evidence, wasn't it, Witness?  
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...what the Appeal Chamber said in the judgement, weren't you, when you said that they required the Trial Chamber to file a report on its visit, so -- which meant, Witness, that you must have read the Appeal Chamber judgement; am I right?  
A.	No.  What you are saying is not correct.  When the Appeals Chamber comes here, what it does is give a summary of its decision.  All I have is a summary of the decision of the Appeals Chamber.  And it didn't even take 30 minutes to read the résumé of that decision.  I have that résumé.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it fair to say that you did not make a review application because there's nothing to be reviewed?  Everything was considered in your appeal.  What do you say to that?  
A.	But, Counsel, do you want me to write an application for review when I don't even have all the facts?  What you are claiming is that I am not credible in my testimony.  I am testifying before this Chamber that you should use Rule 91.  If you think I am telling a lie, then let this Chamber apply Rule 91 and accuse me of plagiary.  And I will request this Chamber to constitute an amicus curiae to check whether what I'm saying is wrong.  If you do not accept this proposal, then accept what I'm saying and consider that what I am saying is the truth.  I think the ball is in the court of the Judges, and we await their finding.  And if you do not draft another indictment against me, then consider that my testimony is true. 
Q.	Witness, would you agree with me that your team, your Defence team, was bilingual, that they could speak both English and French?  Would you agree with me on that?  
A.	I know that my Defence team are French speaking.  You know, there were Canadians, and Canada is a large country.  I have been to Canada.  You have Quebec and others.  So it is likely that my counsels speak English.  But if you tell me "good morning" and I answer, it doesn't mean that I speak 
good English.
MR. N'DOW:
I think we can take the adjournment for now.  It's 12:35.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the adjournment now.
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We adjourn until Monday morning.  

Mr. Witness, I still remind you, as I am sure you know, that during an adjournment while you are on the witness stand you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  
(Court adjourned at 1235H)
