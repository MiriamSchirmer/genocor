MR. PRESIDENT:

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue.  Ms. Hounkpatin will continue her cross-examination.
WITNESS UB,
                CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Witness UB.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	So we are going to continue this morning, and the first question I'd like to put to you is about what you said at the end of yesterday.  You told us that there were young people of JDR, young people of Abakombozi who were also killing people.  Can you give us the préfectures where these young people acted?  And of course if you refer to these young people of JDR, it is because they were not Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	Now, regarding this question, I said that there were other youth organisations of other parties that took part in the massacres.  I said this because my duties included finding out what was going on in my secteur.  That is why I said that in some préfectures, there were not many Interahamwe, but, however, there were massacres that were perpetrated.  So I gave this information because I was talking about the MRND party and particularly the Interahamwe that were part of that party.  

Now you are asking me to talk about the youth wings of other political parties of the MDR and the PSD.  I do not wish to say that the youth wings of these parties killed people in my secteur.  It does not, however, mean that these parties did not have youth wings.  It is the MRND party that has had the highest number of members in Kigali-ville préfecture, but there was also the youth wing of the MDR, which is JDR Inkuba.  There was also the youth wing of the PSD party, which was generally referred to as Abakombozi.  

So if I said that in some places these youth wings perpetrated massacres, it is because when the Power wing -- or wings were created, these Power wings allied themselves to the MRND.  This means that the youth wing of the MDR, the PSD, and the PL worked with the Interahamwe.  But I would like to add that if the Interahamwe had not taken the initiative, working together with the soldiers, then we would not have experienced the kind of massacres that we saw. 

You are asking me whether the MDR killed people in my secteur.  My secteur was mostly composed of youth wings -- the Interahamwe youth wing, but it also included members of the JDR.  It is the Interahamwe youth wing that took the initiative most of the time because they were the strongest.  That is my answer to your question. 

I cannot make any comment about other préfectures.  It is up to the ministry of the interior and the president of the republic to say something about that.  However, I do know that there were préfectures in which there were not many Interahamwe but which experienced massacres.  However, if the question were put to me about, for example, whether the MDR leader for my secteur played a role in the killings, then I will be able to tell you.  I think you have understood what I have said in response.  If not, you may seek clarifications from me.  
Q.	Thank you for your answer, but to return to what you said yesterday, you said that there were préfectures that did not have Interahamwe but where massacres took place.  I would like you to name some of these préfectures.  
A.	If I said that there were préfectures where there were no Interahamwe but which experienced massacres, it was because I wanted to speak out against the authorities of the country.  I wanted to demonstrate the role of the army and political parties and the neglect of which the government was guilty during these massacres.  That is why I said there were préfectures in which there were not many Interahamwe but which experienced massacres.  

Political parties formed a coalition and they had one objective.  And I might say, for example, that in Gitarama the MR -- the Interahamwe were not a majority.  I would not be mistaken in saying that.  

I would say the same for Butare, because when President Sindikubwabo went to Butare he made a speech there, and I am sure you're aware of that.  The préfet of Butare at the time was not a member of the MRND.  This means that it was not the MRND which was in the majority.  The préfet of Gitarama was not an MRND militant also, which means that the MRND was not in the majority.  But in Kigali, it was the MRND that had the upper hand because the communes and préfectures had leaders that came from the MRND.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I shall now take a quick look at a few things because -- I shall not dwell on them because Mr. Robinson examined them in detail, but I just want to look at a few important points with you.  

First, the massacres in Bugesera of the 5th of March 1992.  You said during the examination-in-chief and the cross-examination, and you even said yesterday, that after the incidents that occurred in Bugesera, no arrests were made.  Can you tell me who was the minister of justice in March 1992?  
A.	You're referring to the 1992-1993 period.  I do not remember exactly the year, but I think when multipartyism was introduced, the minister of the interior was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  This was the time when the PDC and the MRND were in government.  Afterwards, you had the MRND, the MDR, and the PSD forming the government.  And at that time the minister of justice was Mbonampeka.  

This came with the advent of multipartyism, and I think at that time the government was made up of four or five parties:  the MDR, MRND, PDC, PL.  And so the minister of the interior was chosen from those parties.  I do not remember exactly who followed whom in that position, and I do not know when the changes were made, but I think that in March and April the person who followed Mathieu Ngirumpatse was Mbonampeka.
Q.	Throughout your answer you have used the expression "ministry of interior," but I asked you about the minister of justice.  In March 1992, what ministry was Mathieu Ngirumpatse heading?  
A.	In March 1992, I no longer remember whether Mathieu Ngirumpatse was minister of justice, but I have given you information that you can analyse.  I said that when the PDC and the MRND were in government, it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was minister of justice.  When the government was formed of five parties, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not a minister; however, I do not remember the exact date.  Perhaps you might guide me.  Perhaps you might tell me at such-and-such a date it was Mathieu and at such-and-such a date it was someone else.  I do not really remember.  Try to guide me and so I will understand.  

This was not my duty.  It was not my duty to determine how or find out how the government was formed.  I do not think I mentioned the minister of the interior.  If I mentioned the minister of the interior, it was because this was my supervisory ministry.  I know that I had to go through the minister of -- ministry of the interior in order to be able to work with the ministry of justice.  
Q.	So I shall give -- I'll give you indications.  At the time -- or the date I have given you -- at the date I have given you, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was minister of justice.  And I put it to you that as minister of justice, in respect of the events of Mugesera (sic), he arrested more than 400 people because of those events.  What do you think of what I have just told you? 
A.	You say that Mathieu ordered that more than 400 people be arrested.  Perhaps, but there is a difference between arresting and punishing.  I do not want to go on to the slippery slope of justice.  If 400 people were arrested, then they should have been taken to court.  I do not know whether this actually happened.  I was not a judge.  But I do not think that the applicable law was implemented as it should have been.  How many people were convicted of these acts?  I just refer to this incident in Bugesera as an example.  Why were the Tutsis of Bugesera killed?  It was because an order was given to that effect.  So I just said that the Tutsis were always the victims of massacres, and the state had done nothing.  

Try and imagine how -- why if you were to kill someone and you were imprisoned for four months only.  You kill someone and you are in prison for two or three years.  The thing is unimaginable.  People who were guilty of such crimes should -- were to go to prison for several years.  

So Mathieu Ngirumpatse may have arrested people, but the killings continued up till 1994.  That is what I have to say about the incidents of Bugesera.  
Q.	In any case, you do agree with me, don't you, that arrests were ordered after these events? 
A.	Yes, an order was given to arrest the people who had committed these massacres, but I think that the person who gave such an order should have ensured that it was complied with.  They just arrested people, and after a few days, they were released.  It was just to prove to the international community that something was being done to stop the massacres.  I do not think, however, that such an order should have been given only four or five days after the massacres started.  So there was negligence and people were killed, and it was only afterwards that an order was given to arrest these people, and just to prove to the international community that something was being done.  You say they were punished.  I say that they were never punished.  The proof is that the killings never stopped.  

I do not wish to risk giving other examples because it would be giving you too much detail, but I might give examples, if you wish, as long as I do not agree with you when you say that Mathieu gave the order that people should be arrested.  I am asking you, too, to tell me what was done to punish these people, at least 30 or 40 people.  Tell me how they were punished.  If 400 people were arrested, then there were guilty people and innocent people, because it cannot have been all 400 of these people who were punished. 
It was, therefore, just to give the impression to the international community that something was being done.  If a person commits a crime, he must be convicted of it.  So what they did was just to try and fool people.  People were not punished in accordance with the law.  If you say that they were punished, well, prove to me that afterwards people were killed -- were not killed afterwards.  Then I shall agree with you.  If you ask me, once again, to talk about this incident which I mentioned only as an example, then I will tell you that Tutsis were killed.  The Bigogwe were killed, and there were people who were killed in Shyorongi, and some of them decided to come seek refuge in the city of Kigali. 
Q.	Witness UB, I put it to you that Mr. Ngirumpatse, when he lost his position as minister of justice in April 1992, was implementing the procedures that he had initiated, and if there were subsequent decisions such as those you referred to, it does not in any way mean that it was he that stopped the procedures that he began.  
A.	I understand you clearly for the time being.  So we agree.  So he started the procedure, and those who followed him in that position did not continue to carry out his orders.  We are in complete agreement in that, that is, that these people were not punished.  But there were always authorities.  The president of the republic was there.  He was the head of state.  

So Mathieu had caused these people to be arrested, and after that, he left the position of minister of justice.  We are not going to hold it against him, but he knew perfectly well that these people were not -- had not been punished.  And the minister of justice at the time did not try to punish them.  Perhaps there was some other intervention, that is the president of the republic, who may have asked that these people would not be punished.  

I think the Tutsi were killed because nobody served as their advocate.  So Mathieu left the position of minister of justice, and he must not be blamed, because he was not a judge.  But it was all the authorities, the body of leaders that were at fault.  They were convinced that Tutsis could be killed just any how and with complete impunity. 

I do not know what you are referring to.  I was not concerned with this procedure.  I was not a figure of authority.  I did not come to accuse Mathieu or blame Mathieu for the incidents that occurred in Bugesera.  But the role that he played in the massacres was that he was a senior figure of authority and killings were perpetrated, and he did not seek to intervene.  He was a leader of the MRND.  He was in charge of its youth wing, and he did not try to stop them from committing these atrocities. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I told you this morning that -- I told you that this morning we would be re-examining some matters for which I required particular clarification. 

Now we shall come to the rally at Murambi.  During your cross-examination, you said that this rally in Murambi of Byumba préfecture took place at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994.  You said that the bourgmestre of Murambi, Mr. Gatete -- you said that this rally took place in the presence of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Do you confirm that?  
A.	I do not wish to change anything in the answer that I gave you.  When your colleague questioned me, he said, "The Defence finds that you are not telling the truth."  So if he said "the Defence," it is because he was speaking on behalf of the entire Defence team.  I do not know whether I am going to repeat the answers that I gave.  If I had known that your colleague Robinson would put questions to me that you yourself would be putting to me, I should not have answered them.  I only know that he put questions to me, I answered the questions, and I know that he consulted with you.  So if you say that the answer that I gave to the question put -- the answer to the question put to me by your colleague was -- did not please you, well, I shall answer your own questions. 

He said "the Defence."  So if I have to answer such questions, you are going to put -- try to trap me.  I know that you are taking notes.  I didn't take notes.  So I cannot repeat or give the exact same answer as the one I gave to Robinson.  So if you remember the answer that you -- I gave when Robinson put the question to me, then it will be the same.  So I would like to know the answer to the question -- the answer I gave to Robinson when he puts that question to me.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have spoken at length to confirm that the answer to the question of my colleague was yes, and we would have saved two minutes with that if you had given me that answer. 

But we shall move on.  I put it to you, and I repeat, the suggestion that was put to you at the time that Mr. Ngirumpatse never took part at that rally and Mr. Gatete was himself not present at the rally.  
A.	Thank you very much for your guidance.  Thank you also for asking me to give you brief answers.  There were many rallies organised by the MRND.  We are not going to dwell on this particular rally at Murambi.  Robinson put the question to me.  I gave him an answer.  He made a suggestion to me, and we went on.  So we shouldn't dwell on that. 
Q.	So we shall just clarify matters.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I would like the registry to take out Exhibit 1 -- or the first document in my disclosure, which is the report on the commission of enquiry on Bourgmestre Gatete which is dated 23 June 2 -- 1993.  I would like this document to be shown to the witness, please.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Do you have the document now, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	All right.  Would you please go to page 5 of that report.  So this is a report dated 23rd -- 24th of June 1993.  This report comes from the prime minister's office, the intelligence services, and the report was prepared following a commission enquiry that was set up to report on the situation in Murambi commune.  
Before this commission of enquiry, on the 12th of March 1993, the bourgmestre was suspended and the suspension decision was contained in a telegram which is included in the documents I have provided to the Court.  

So you will be given a second document which is document number 10 in my bundle.  It is a telegram announcing the suspension of Mr. Gatete from his duties as the bourgmestre.  It is important for you to have both documents at the same time.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Registry, would you be so kind as to provide document number 10 to the witness?  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, do you have a second document? 
A.	Yes, I have the second document.  
Q.	I would like you to read it, please.  It is a French document -- a document in French.  I am asking the interpreters now for help.  I would like them to read this document to you in Kinyarwanda while I am reading in French. 

So, this is a telegram from the ministry of the interior and communal development.  I shall read the text, and the text begins with:  "Regret to inform you following the report of the national commission for the evaluation of government employees, the cabinet meeting on 16th February 1993 has instructed me to suspend, by order, Mr. Jean-Baptiste Gatete, bourgmestre of Murambi commune, pending an administrative enquiry.  Kindly implement this message immediately." 

I'll stop there because that is -- what was important was the immediate effectiveness of the order of the suspension. 

Now, you have a date of -- on the telegram.  It is indicated as the 12th of March 1993, and the document is signed the ministry -- minister of the interior and communal development, and it is 
Faustin Munyaseza. 

Now, we are going to move on to the document that was given to you first; that is labelled 1.  This is the report of the 24th of June 1993.  We shall be looking at page 5 of that document.  This page contains the conclusions of the commission of enquiry, which took advice from the people who were involved in the matter and which then produced recommendations.  There are two points in the conclusions.  The recommendation is equally brief.  This procedure is somewhat time consuming, but it is necessary.  I shall read the conclusions in French so that with the -- the interpreters can interpret this passage for me.  Thank you. 

We shall now go to part 6, "Conclusions".  Part -- point 1: "In view of the observations made above, it is proven that 15 people got to Byumba alive and that, therefore, the accusations leveled against Gatete about their disappearance are unfounded." 

I shall now go to the second point of the conclusions, and it says:  "The political situation in Murambi commune is characterised by manifest intolerance amongst political parties and an atmosphere of insecurity among the inhabitants." 

Part 7, "Recommendations":  "Considering the sociopolitical climate that reigns in Murambi commune, the commission recommends that Jean-Baptiste Gatete should be given another position of responsibility by the government."  

This document is signed -- or initialed by eight people, and it was done in Kigali on the 23rd of June 1993. 

Witness, following all that we have just seen, having read these documents, I put it to you that Gatete could not have made a speech at the rally as bourgmestre because from the 12th of March 1993 he was not a bourgmestre, on the one hand.  On the other hand, the tense political atmosphere of Murambi in Byumba precluded the holding of any MRND political rallies at that time.  What do you say to that?  
A.	I think for you to understand me, I must recall that Bourgmestre Gatete took the floor at this rally -- or he addressed the rally.  Previously you said that you did not agree that such a rally did take place at all.  You say that such a rally could not have taken place.  Well, I'll tell you that Murambi commune was not prey to widespread insecurity as a result of the war that was being fought in Byumba.  

Apart from the MRND, the MDR also held a rally in that area.  It must be clearly understood that a rally took place in Murambi in Byumba préfecture but precisely in Murambi.  I shall not dwell on that.  

Perhaps in law you do not think this to have been feasible.  It was not the practice, however, in our country.  The situation was not as you think it was.  The enquiry was made, and its -- the conclusions were reported to the prime minister which -- which led to the dismissal or suspension of 
Bourgmestre Gatete.  

You say that he was suspended from his duties and that he was replaced by an alternate conseiller, but this -- none of this could have prevented Gatete from addressing the rally.  When they say that the bourgmestre was suspended pending the result of a commission of enquiry, it does not mean that the bourgmestre has no power in the commune.  We always considered that he was still bourgmestre because it was a temporary decision.  It was a suspension.  He could address the rally as a member of the MRND.  But everywhere he went we called him "Bourgmestre Gatete". 

I'd like to make this clear.  I do not want to rely on the provisions of any law or regulation.  If I had been préfet, I would have told you about it.  But I remind you that I was a conseiller, and I am telling you what I know based on what I observed.  

In June 1993, a letter was written.  If you have a letter that confirms that Gatete was to leave his position once and for all, then please produce it.  If you get a letter -- if you have a letter from the minister of the interior to the same effect, then show it to me.  Because you know we have a lot of evidence about that.  Several people were asked to leave their positions but did not actually do so.  So I'm going to tell you something, and you may investigate it and be convinced thereafter of it.  Several measures were actually taken but were not translated into action.  A minister could take a decision, and he would be overridden by the prime minister.  That could happen.  I'll give you a concrete example of that. 

The préfet of Kigali préfecture was dismissed by ministerial order, and he was supposed to be transferred to the ministry of defence.  Well, even if such a decision were actually taken, the ministry -- minister of the interior ordered him to continue to perform his duties as préfet, whereas the communal assemblies had met to take a decision to that effect.  

Perhaps we will have the opportunity to discuss this further, but I am telling you that measures were taken but they were not implemented.  Such a telegram may well have been sent, but it might not have been implemented.  I don't know whether you are aware of this.  The Interahamwe went to Murambi, and the Interahamwe went there to reinstate him in his position.  I know that many things were decided, but they were not implemented. 

The bourgmestre of Murambi was appointed, but he was never able to perform his duties in an independent manner.  The situation was the same in Butamwa and in Bicumbi.  Bourgmestres were always suspended or dismissed, but this was not implemented.  There are many examples.  

Well, Counsel, you may produce or provide these documents to the Trial Chamber, but the measures were not implemented as was -- might have been expected.  That is what I want to say about the report and the statements that were made. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I'd like to tender these two documents into evidence.  The first document, which is the telegram and is number 10 on my -- in my bundle, will be number 10.  The second will be D. NG11. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG10 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. NG11 admitted) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that Mr. Gatete, following this suspension, never returned to Murambi as bourgmestre.  He was appointed as director in the ministry -- ministry of family affairs and the promotion of women from August 1993.  And from July 1992 -- I beg your pardon, 1993, there were no further rallies in Murambi.  Perhaps I'm getting a little confused with the dates.  I shall repeat.  

From the 12th of July 1992, the last rally in Murambi was on that date, that is, the 12th of July 1992.  And the rally to which you refer and which you insist took place did not -- did not take place.  And that is my opinion.  
A.	You're entitled to say things like that, Counsel.  You want to give me to understand that no rally was held in Murambi because this is information that you are receiving.  You cannot say that rallies were not regularly held.  I give -- I have given an example of rallies held in Murambi, and I mentioned the speech that was made by Gatete.  I confirmed that.  That rally did take place.  You want me to say that the last rally took place on a certain date.  Well, this rally did take place but did not prevent Mathieu to return there to hold another rally, because if we went to Murambi, it was a national meeting -- it was for a national rally, I beg your pardon.  It was not limited to Murambi.  It was a national rally.  

You have just informed me that Gatete become -- became director in the ministry of family affairs.  I do not know whether you are informing me of that to deny that this rally did take place.  I do not know.  Perhaps we might return to that.  Perhaps we might return to this matter of Mr. Gatete's speech.  To be brief, I confirm that this rally was held in Murambi towards the end of 1993.  Well, you say that the rally in question was held in 1992.  I can say nothing further.  You're entitled to present matters like that.  I confirm that a rally was organised at the end of 1993.  I was present.  What you are saying is just repeating what your client has told you.  I think the Trial Chamber will decide -- will determine the rest of the matter.  I said that rallies were held regularly, and these rallies never condemned the killings.  

If subsequently it is found that no rally ever took place, well, good for you.  I took part in several rallies.  I only gave an example in mentioning the rally at Murambi.  And there is a document you have produced or tendered to show that Mr. Gatete had no power, but I am telling you that he never allowed his replacement to work independently.  He was always active in the commune in spite of the installation of another bourgmestre in this position.  Well, you can tender exhibits, but the Court will determine this afterwards. 
Q.	There's a fourth point I'd like to deal with with you:  The sale of arms allegedly by Mr. Turatsinze.  You said on the 2nd of March 2006 that Jean Habyarimana spoke to you of that sale by Turatsinze and the profit from the sale was shared by Turatsinze and Ngirumpatse.  Have you ever heard that allegation repeated by anyone else? 
A.	Jean Habyarimana was president of Kigali MRND.  He and I worked together, and you're asking me if I've heard someone else repeat the allegation.  Well, I can tell you that we -- when we were talking together we didn't need to find someone else to witness our conversation.  I told you what 
	Jean Habyarimana told me, and he can tell you that a conflict arose between Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse after the sale by Turatsinze because the suspicion was that they had shared the proceeds from the sale with Ngirumpatse, with Mathieu.  In fact, they wanted me to -- they wanted to give me to understand that the person we were supporting was not above reproach, that there were things that could be reproached for, and apparently they shared the profits from the sale of the arms with Turatsinze.  And I think that it is subsequent to that conflict that Turatsinze decided to flee.  Now, perhaps he also committed other mistakes, but that was the information given to me by Jean Habyarimana.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth says that they are very sorry, Mr. President.  They're not sure that they completely grasped everything the witness said.  It was a bit complicated.  If you want to ask him to repeat.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it would be very helpful for the record if you could repeat your last answer, as the translators had difficulty in translating -- translating it.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The question was put to me as follows:  They asked for clarifications as to the sale of arms by Turatsinze.  And Mathieu allegedly shared in the proceeds of the sale with Turatsinze.  And this is the answer I gave:  That information as to the sale of weapons by Turatsinze was given to me by Jean Habyarimana, who was Kigali chairman of MRND -- or chairman of the Kigali section of MRND.  And he told me that the conflict which arose between Nzirorera and Mathieu was due to the sale of arms by Turatsinze, and the suspicion was that Ngirumpatse and he shared the proceeds -- that Mathieu shared the proceeds of the sale with Turatsinze.  But he never said that it was something proven.  He wanted to give me to understand that Nzirorera had decided to sack Turatsinze from his post but that Mathieu -- Mathieu did not agree with that sacking or with that decision.  That is what I said, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	So, you only heard that -- that allegation from one person, and you confirm that there is no reason to believe that it was true.  
A.	Well, when you say I heard it from the -- only one person, let us be clear that I was in an office with that person, and he had no reason to conceal anything regarding the state of the party from me.  That is one.  

Second point, you're asking me if there was proof that that allegation was true.  Well, there were certain facts you could note that there were arms in circulation.  That means that arms had been issued, distributed.  It was someone from my own party who gave me the information.  We do not have -- I don't have similar access to information, and I think he was telling me the truth.  And as to the authenticity of the allegation, well, he had no reason to lie to me on that subject. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But it is, nonetheless, only one person and you who possess that information? 
A.	Yes, me and the president of the Kigali section of the MRND party. 
Q.	I come to the fifth point I wanted to discuss with you this morning.  Throughout your testimony, you've told us that you travelled around Rwanda, at any case, in April, May, June and July.  Could you please specify the dates on which you travelled and where you went?  
A.	Every time I travelled I didn't note the dates.  I didn't need mission papers, and I didn't keep a diary in which I'd note the dates of my travels.  You say I travelled throughout the country.  Well, you can question me as to the places I went, and I will tell you why I went there and give you other details that might assist you, but I did not make a note of the date every time I travelled. 
Q.	You stated under examination-in-chief that you wished to accompany your family to Nyanza.  When was that? 
A.	I don't remember the date, but I can tell you that it was in April when I took members of my family to Nyanza from Kigali because I thought it was safer, that there was more security in Nyanza. 
Q.	Well, let me put it to you that between the 6th and the 30th of April, would it be nearer to the 6th or nearer to the 30th that you tried to make that trip? 
A.	Well, I would say it was in mid-April, neither near the 6th, nor near the 30th.  I'd say it was somewhere between the 12th and the 17th, or thereabouts, that period of time.  I cannot give you an exact date, but it was mid-April, if my memory serves me right, that I went to Nyanza. 
Q.	Nyanza is in which préfecture? 
A.	It is in Butare préfecture. 
Q.	Which mode of transport did you use? 
A.	I had my vehicle and I used it for that trip to that place.  
Q.	How long did it take? 
A.	I am not able to tell you how long it all took.  I think it's somewhere between an hour and a half, two hours, because it -- between Kigali and Nyanza there were other families one might visit.  So it all depends on how you do the trip. 
Q.	Did you do the trip in one go?  You didn't have any difficulties on the way? 
A.	On the way from Kigali to Nyanza there were roadblocks, and at the roadblocks one should give the identities of the family.  You couldn't just drive through.  There were roadblocks here and there throughout the country. 
Q.	And in spite of those obstacles, you did get through? 
A.	Yes, I -- in my capacity as conseiller and MRND member, I could get through.  I revealed my identity and I passed the various roadblocks. 
Q.	And once you got there, you returned? 
A.	Yes, I returned to Kigali. 
Q.	On the same day?  
A.	Yes, absolutely.  I arrived in Nyanza, I deposited -- I left my family, and I returned to town. 
Q.	In May also you have stated that you went to Bugarama -- Bugarama.  Do you confirm that, or would it be on another date you might wish to confirm that? 
A.	I went to Bugarama in May and -- in May and not in April.  
Q.	The same questions.  Now we're in May.  Is it the beginning of May?  Maybe you recollect the exact date of that trip.  
A.	I did not make a note of the date.  If you want me to give you an approximate period of time, I could say that it wasn't in the beginning of May.  I think it was, rather, towards the end of May.  I don't remember the exact date.  Maybe second -- second week, third week, fourth week, sort of thing.  I went to Bugarama.  I'd sent part of my family, and I wanted to make sure that they had gotten there without any difficulties or without too many difficulties. 
Q.	You said that you had sent the family and you wanted to ensure that they had arrived safely; therefore, I deduce that you made two trips to Bugarama.  
A.	No.  First, there was the phase of sending the family.  I did not go with them.  Now, as regards Bugarama, my -- the members of my family went first and then I went to check that they had arrived without any difficulty, which is different from the -- my family's trip to Nyanza, in which case I accompanied them. 
Q.	Who were the members of your family that you sent to Bugarama? 
A.	I had a large family.  Are you asking for their names?  I took a few children, my wife, and they went with someone else who I was helping and was going to Bugarama.  The person I was helping came from Bugarama.  
Q.	And what means of transport did you use? 
A.	I had more than one vehicle.  I could send my vehicle with my driver who could take them to their destination. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, it is 10:30.  Inasmuch as the questioning will be continuing, I suggest perhaps we can take a break now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take our midmorning recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1030H) 
(Pages 1 to 13 by Sherri Knox)

(Court resumed at 1108H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin, you may continue.  You may proceed. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness UB, we are going to continue with the line of questioning that I began before we went on break.  We indicated to you that you said that the Bugarama trip was in two phases.  You sent your family first, and then you yourself traveled there to find out if they had arrived safely; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Can you tell me on what date your family went to Bugarama? 
A.	My family went in April; it was towards the end of April.  Please understand clearly these are not the people I sent to Nyanza; this was another group of people.  I went to Bugarama in May to find out how they were doing and whether they had arrived safely. 
Q.	From what town or city did this second group of your family leave for Bugarama? 
A.	They left from Kigali. 
Q.	Can you tell us how long these trips lasted?  We shall refer to the trip that your family made from Kigali to Bugarama first? 
A.	The Kigali, Bugarama is as follows:  Bugarama is on the border with Congo.  But the trip from Kigali to Bugarama is between 290 and 300 kilometres.  At the time one had to leave from Kigali to Kamembe and then continue the trip the next day.  But one could also leave Kigali and get to Bugarama on the very same day.  But it was easy to leave Kigali on one day and return to Kigali on the next day.  It took an entire day, but generally it was possible to leave Kigali and get to Bugarama within six hours. 
Q.	To summarise then, the trip accompanying your family -- to accompany your family to Bugarama lasted two days; is that correct? 
A.	I did not accompany them, I'm -- in order to determine that it took two days.  All I know is that the vehicle returned to Kigali the following day.  It may well have spent the night the Bugarama, but possibly also in Kamembe.  What I would like to clarify for your benefit is this, the vehicle returned to Kigali the next day at about 8 p.m. 
Q.	And at what time the previous day had the vehicle left Kigali? 
A.	The vehicle left Kigali in the morning. 
Q.	Let us try to be more precise; it will be helpful.  At what time in the morning? 
A.	I cannot give you the exact time because I did not check my watch before I sent them off.  I think it was at about 9 o'clock in the morning.  I do not know whether it was 8 or 9 o'clock, but it was between 8 and 9 o'clock. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, regarding your own trip to Bugarama, from which city did you leave when you traveled to Bugarama? 
A.	I left from Kigali. 
Q.	How long did your journey last? 
A.	I spent the night in Gikongoro.  I got there in the evening.  And I continued my trip to Bugarama the next day. 
Q.	Did you travel without breaks?  There were no breaks in your journey when you were going and when you are returning? 
A.	There were roadblocks.  When one got to the roadblock one had to show one's identity card and then one would be able to cross the roadblock and go on. 
Q.	How many roadblocks did you go pass on your journey to Bugarama? 
A.	I did not try to count them; there were many roadblocks everywhere in the country.  It was not my obligation to count roadblocks.  There were so many of them.  I cannot -- I did not count them, so I cannot tell you how many there were. 
Q.	But you went through all of them? 
A.	Yes, during this trip I went passed roadblocks.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I would like to apologise to the interpreters.  I think I covered the tail end of a translation, I am told? 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, so that we have got through the month of May, the end of May.  You cannot tell us whether it was the second -- your second trip to Bugarama was in the second or the fourth week.  You returned to Kigali, you say.  When was that?  Was it still at the end of May or at the beginning of June? 
A.	It was towards the end of May when I returned to Kigali. 
Q.	We shall move on to another trip.  During your examination-in-chief and cross-examination you said that you went to Gisenyi.  Can you tell me on what date you went to Gisenyi? 
A.	I think I went to Gisenyi towards the end of June. 
Q.	Don't you have a date, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th? 
A.	I do not remember the exact date, so I cannot give it to you. 
Q.	When you were going to Gisenyi, where did you leave from? 
A.	I left from Kigali as usual.  So I left Kigali and I went towards Gisenyi. 
Q.	How long did the trip last? 
A.	I think I got to Gisenyi -- well, I left Kigali in the morning, but since we had to take a round about road and make detours, I got to Gisenyi at about 2 p.m. 
Q.	What vehicle did you use to travel to Gisenyi? 
A.	I had a Suzuki vehicle. 
Q.	How long did the trip to Gisenyi last?  Did you go to Gisenyi and return on the same day, or did you stay there? 
A.	I spent the night in Gisenyi.  I did not return to Kigali on the same day. 
Q.	Perhaps you might remember the date on which you returned to Kigali? 
A.	No, I cannot tell you the date on which I returned to Kigali, but it was towards the end of June when I went to Kigali -- to Gisenyi, I beg your pardon.  I spent the night there and I returned to Kigali. 
Q.	You made another trip leaving Kigali because this was during the last days, the RPF having overrun the city of Kigali.  So on what date did you leave Kigali? 
A.	We evacuated Kigali on the night of the 3rd.  It was the 3rd of July.  We left and went towards Gisenyi. 
Q.	You used the plural.  Who was with you? 
A.	On the 3rd, the city of Kigali was evacuated.  Everybody was leaving.  It was at night, and it was the general falling back.  Everybody went towards Gisenyi. 
Q.	Did you have a vehicle? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	On what date did you arrive in Gisenyi? 
A.	I arrived on the 4th at about 5 p.m. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Now, I would like Mr. Issa to pass around the administrative map of Rwanda, which I handed to him during the break; one copy to the witness.  I think there is also a copy available for the Judges and the parties.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Perhaps the interpreters can also be given copies. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I should like to ask the witness to indicate with a marker the various towns to which he went.  And for this purpose I would like to use the projector for that purpose so that we can all see his marks or his indications in real time.  I would be grateful if the registry would assist me with this. 
THE WITNESS:
There are some names that I am unable to read because the font is too small.  So, it is not easy for me to recognise these locations.  However, I do see where Kigali is indicated.  So I can read that; but I am unable to read the rest. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Perhaps with the projector we will be able to enlarge the map somewhat.  If the curtains are drawn, is it all right for the witness to move so that he can indicate on the projector?  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, I am putting the question to you:  You do, at least, know the direction in which I found the towns that you went to, don't you? 
A.	You say -- you are asking me whether I know the direction, at least, of the towns to which I went.  I am not an expert topographer.  I know that I went to Gisenyi.  Now, if you are going to ask me to look at a map and indicate locations on it, then I will tell you that I am not a specialist.  But if I do see the place which is indicated as Bugarama, I shall show it to you.  But, please, do not ask me to tell you -- give you directions about east and west.  I can show you Kigali.  I can show you Gisenyi and Nyanza.  And if I am able to, I will read.  I don't know what I am going to do because you are putting questions to me as if I were a specialist in law, in astronomy or in geography.  I think you are setting a trap for me when you put questions of that sort to me. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am not setting any traps for you.  You know that when you came to -- come to give testimony, questions will be put to you; that is what I am doing.  I am going to make it easier for you.  Since I am able to read the towns, I am going to read them out to you and you are going to point to the place that I indicate to you on the projector.  So you have found Kigali.  Kigali is practically in the middle of the map; is it not? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I think the registry should assist you to move.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Interpreters cannot hear the witness.  He is not speaking into his microphone. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Issa, could you give the witness his headphone so he can speak through the --  
THE WITNESS:
I can see Kigali-ville. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	So, if you go down, first we are going to go trace the route to Nyanza.  You go down to a town called Nyabisindu.  You go to the left of the screen; it is just above the boundary line of Butare préfecture.  That's right.  There we are.  So, could you draw a line linking Kigali to this point?  
A.	I see Nyabisindu.  This is -- this is the chief town of that area; Nyanza, you leave Kigali, you go throught Gitarama.  So, you go -- you go to Tambwe commune to Ruhango.  You cross Kigoma commune, and Kigoma shares a boundary with Nyabisindu.  Nyanza is in Nyabisindu commune; the town in question in this particular matter.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But for more clarity, I will ask the registry to give you the highlighter so that you can show us the spot --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is calling Mr. Issa to give him a highlighter. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Could you please -- now please make a mark to show the place you have been talking about? 
A.	Here we are, Nyabisindu.  
Q.	So I see that you crossed Gitarama préfecture.  You came into Butare préfecture, and then on the next trip you went to Bugarama, which is practically at the bottom of the map, bottom left-hand side, after the black area which must indicate a park.  And then before you get to Bugarama you go through Busozo.  And there is get Gisuma just above that.  
So please take your highlighter, go down to the bottom there, and you will see Bugarama.  Please make a mark to show Bugarama.  

Now Gisenyi, it is still on the left of the map, which is the west.  And then we have another forested area.  And Gisenyi is up there, it is written in larger letters.  So please make a mark there? 
A.	Here is Gisenyi, I have got it; Buhavu and then Gisenyi. 
Q.	You may now go back to the box after having made the marks on the map; and everyone has followed with you your trip.

After this little  journey we have done together on the map, we can see from what you have said that you were --  had an extraordinary ease in traveling, at least, in that part of Rwanda, at that time, from April to July.
A.	Yes, quite, I had no problems as regard the trips that I made in those parts -- that part of the country. 
Q.	I put it to you, Witness, that if you, if it was so easy for you to go from one place to another in préfectures which you yourself have described as being difficult and where there were roadblocks to cross, you must have another card apart from the MRND card.  And I think you had an Interahamwe card.  
A.	I should like you to distinguish between two things:  Interahamwe was a youth movement affiliated with the MRND.  I have never denied the existence of the Interahamwe.  If one of the Interahamwe's task was to support other members of the Interahamwe, and so as far as I am concerned everybody knew that I was a member of the MRND; moveover, I was a conseiller, but belonging to the MRND party, which made it, for me, possible to travel throughout these areas because most of the roadblocks were manned by Interahamwe.

Now, from there to suggest, to saying that I was a member of the Interahamwe; well, I don't think there is any reason to conclude that I was a member of the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe had their own particular distinctive insignia.  I was a member of the MRND.  I could show them my MRND card and introduce myself, identify myself as being a member of the MRND and then they let me pass; because I told them who I was, a member of the MRND, and a conseiller,  and I was free to move.  
Q.	Witness, throughout your examination-in-chief and cross-examination, you have told us that you were conseiller in a very limited secteur of Kigali, and I am surprised that you were known at all of the roadblocks where you passed without any difficulty for someone so small? 
A.	I have explained that Rwanda is a small country, to the extent that people knew each other.  And, moreover, I had my MRND party card.  And every party member had a party card to which you can add the ID card, which identified anyone who had one.  So I don't know what you want to say when you say that I was known.  In any case, I can't answer for the whole country, but what I can say is that my secteur was a secteur in Kigali city and many people came there.  And it was -- the secteur was inhabited by people who came from all areas.  So, when I introduced myself and I say that I'm a conseiller of my secteur, well I was known.  And I have an MRND card, and I am a conseiller, well, that was an advantage.  It made it possible for me to introduce myself and continue my trip. 
Q.	I am sorry to confirm to you that eminent MRND members could not pass roadblocks as easily as you did? 
A.	What eminent people are you referring to?  Who were they, Counsel?  
Q.	I don't want to name people.  
A.	You are saying that influential MRND members could not pass roadblocks?  Well, I will tell you something; if one was a member of the MRND and a Tutsi, you couldn't pass a roadblock.  We had ID cards where the ethnic group was clearly indicated.  And as Tutsis were targeted, whether they were MDR or MRND, if their ID cards said "Tutsi", they could not pass.  But if you were Hutu, or if it said Hutu on your ID card they would let you pass even if they had some doubts.  

And I can confirm to you that if someone had an MRND card, but his ID card said "Tutsi," he couldn't pass, he couldn't go to Ruhengeri or to Gisenyi.  So give me an example of a Hutu who was an influential member of the MRND and who tried to take a trip, and was arrested at one point or another and I will try to understand.  But I tell you that my ID card made it possible for me to travel.  And my MRND party card was another triumph card that made it possible for me to travel. 
Q.	Well, what about Georges Rutaganda?  He had a problem at a roadblock.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Unfortunately, the interpreter missed the name of the place.  I don't know if it is important. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kinombe (phonetic) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, could you repeat the question?  I think the interpreters missed the name that you mentioned?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, sir.  I shall repeat. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness UB, you wanted an example.  I will give you only one so as not to draw out the debate.  What about Georges Rutaganda who had serious difficulties to pass Gitikinyoni roadblock.  That is what I said.  
A.	I do not accept that.  If I told you -- if I told you that Georges Rutaganda was national vice president, a member of the national MRND committee, who is well known.  He was a big businessman in Kigali.  I know him well.  He knows me well.  I know his house at Cyahafi.  His house at Cyahafi was considered to be an Interahamwe headquarters.  And I tell you that I know what I am talking about.  

So, if he arrived at Gitikinyoni, which was manned by Setiba, one Setiba, and he was prevented from passing, I tell you that is a pure lie.  Kajuga, Robert who was thought to be a Tutsi, when he said something it was final.  He went anywhere he wanted.  There is absolutely no truth in what you have said about Georges Rutaganda.  I met him on several occasions, it is impossible. 
Q.	Well, I am not going to spend the forenoon giving you examples.  That is your testimony.  The           Trial Chamber will assess.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I should like, Mr. President, to tender the map as marked by the witness.  It is D. NG12, I think. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG12 admitted) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, my last line of questioning that I should like to cover with you this morning.  We have seen, over the past few days that you were the subject of a judgement on the 7th of July 1997; that after you had appealed, a decision was handed down on the 11th of June 1998.  You have told us repeatedly that it is not a final decision.  I should like you to tell us when you appealed against the Appeals Court decision? 
A.	First of all, the appeals chamber decision was brought to my attention on a different date than the date that the decision -- as soon as I was informed of that decision, I appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court.  I think I was informed of the decision in November 1998.  Well, even if I can't remember the exact date of my appeal against the decision, I know that as soon as I was informed of the decision, I quickly appealed against it. 
Q.	So, for about the last six years, you have been awaiting a final decision? 
A.	That is correct.  That is what I am waiting for. 
Q.	And in the meantime while awaiting that decision, is the agreement that you come to the international tribunal to support testimony; then you have told us in the course of your examination-in-chief and cross-examination that certain assertions were knowingly false.  Is it true to guarantee, with the passage of time and what you are doing, a decision that you hope will be favourable? 
A.	That's not correct.  Are you saying that I agreed on something with someone?  I don't know what you are referring to.  I don't understand very well.  Are you referring to the Rwandan government or to the ICTR?  I don't understand very well.  Perhaps if you could clarify, I could answer you. 
Q.	Witness, I merely wanted to put it to you, to suggest to you that your testimony before this                Trial Chamber as well as before other trial chambers is for the purpose of obtaining what would be a decision that would be clemency? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  Any decision is taken in accordance with the law.  It cannot be done arbitrarily.  You are trying to get me to understand that I am testifying in various trials, it is for the Rwanda government to do something in exchange.  Well, I am not doing anything like that.  I don't expect anything from the Rwandan government.  The ICTR asked me to testify, and I agreed to testify.  It has nothing -- my testimony has nothing to do with my trial.  

I have never tried to conceal my identity or anything, as far as I am concerned, from the people who work for this tribunal.  Since I have been in touch with the ICTR, I have explained everything as to my judicial experiences back home.  I was tried and adjudged, and I don't expect clemency from anyone as a result of my testimony.  I should be judged.  The decision will be taken in compliance with the law.  And if peradventure the decision was not favourable, I will bear the consequences.  

I am testifying as to the events, quite independently from my trial or anything connected with it.  I am not testifying because I expect something in return.  And if anything I were to be given in exchange, I think, I should -- one would more logically turn to ICTR to expect something in return.  And I certainly don't expect anything in return.  So that is incorrect as far as the purpose of my testimony goes.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I have finished.  And I thank the witness for having answered my questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Hounkpatin.  

Mr. Witness, having been examined by three lawyers already, you are still not finished.  You now have to respond to questions put to you on behalf of Mr. Karemera.  And I think you will be questioned by  Mr. Sow, who will take over your examination.

Mr. Sow, are you ready to commence?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, you may proceed.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, my first line of questioning bears on the witness's individual situation.  I should like to go into closed session to ensure that the witness is protected. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how long do you think this part of your examination will take?  
MR. SOW: 
I think perhaps the remainder of the -- the remaining 30 minutes before the usual lunchtime break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
For the benefit of the public, we have made protective orders for the security of the witnesses.  And this really relates in particular to protecting their identity from being made public.  We are going to have to go into closed session as part of that exercise.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 23 to 30] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

	1430H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are back in open session now, and your cross-examination will continue.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  I will proceed with cross-examination, and I will ask for your assistance with regard to the answers you will give me in an endeavour to avoid making comments so that we can gain time, given that you have been here for several days already.  

Mr. Witness, you stated that you were a conseiller de secteur, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Is it also true that you were a conseiller from*****? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Were you made aware of the law on communal organisation which gave a list of prerogatives of conseiller de secteur? 
A.	Yes, I know the functions of conseiller de secteur. 
Q.	Do you draw that knowledge from your reading of the law, or did you -- did you just come by that information -- through information you were given? 
A.	Most of this information was provided to me by other persons.  I cannot say that I read the content of the law.  I was aware that a law existed, governing the operations of the commune, but I did not personally read it.  
Q.	In relation to your préfecture, which had a special status, did you also take note of the law that governed your particular préfecture? 
A.	We were not given the documents, but we knew -- we were aware that the Kigali-ville préfecture had a special way of operating, was governed by special laws.  We were aware of this. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that, in order to know these laws and obligations, you should at least read the laws that govern you? 
A.	Yes.  In order to do that, one should be able to read the document in question so as to effectively take note of one's duties and obligations.  
Q.	Since you did not read the text, how can you be certain of your rights and obligations? 
A.	I did not read the document because those who were supposed to provide the documents to us were keeping them in their drawers, and yet there were rules that governed the operations of the secteur.  And we were aware of them.  Perhaps this was done on purpose, the failure to give us the documents so that we could be aware of them. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know that a rule exists to the effect that no one should be unaware of the laws and that you, as a citizen, and in addition a conseiller de secteur, were under obligation to be aware of the laws in force?  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  The rule exists, indeed.  One cannot use ignorance as a defence.  I am aware that one can be sanctioned for this.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told this Court that very often you drew up reports.  Apart from the reports you drew up, can you tell me what your work consisted of? 
A.	I said that the conseiller knew what his duties were.  He knew well what he had to do, and he had to report about this to his direct superiors.  And I think that one of his responsibilities was the drafting of the texts in question.  And I don't think that ever changed. 
Q.	Speaking of direct superiors, who do you mean by that? 
A.	It means that I had to draw up reports and report to the bourgmestre.  Secondly, I had to brief the préfet. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, looking at the rule on communal administration, your direct superior is the bourgmestre.  You answer to him, so why were you also required to report to the préfet? 
A.	That instruction was handed down by the préfet, that we should inform him of the reports we were writing.  That was perhaps a part of the practice at the time.  When one held an office, he could put out instructions, and it was our duty to execute them. 
Q.	Witness, the instruction you referred to, was it a written instruction by the préfet? 
A.	That depended on the circumstances.  The bourgmestre or préfet can issue written or unwritten instructions.  The city committee, the urban council, decided that the reports should be forwarded to the préfet.  The communal committee could also take such decisions, and each of us was bound to respect decisions taken at those two levels.  
Q.	Witness, I'd like to understand.  Earlier on you said the préfet issued an instruction, and in your answer you now add the urban committee.  I'd like to be enlightened.  I'd like to know, if it was the préfet that gave the  instruction, was such an instruction written or oral? 
A.	Once the urban council took a decision in the course of a meeting, perhaps at the suggestion of the préfet, well, once that decision is taken, it comes into force as a law, added to the law on organisation of the préfecture or commune in question.  
Q.	Am I, therefore, to understand that the decision that was taken -- you say it was the urban council that took the decision -- that that decision was minuted in the record and disclosed to the communal council? 
A.	He said that when the urban council took the decision, our decisions -- those decisions are enforced by the préfet.  In that sense, we say the préfet requested that such a decision be respected.  

You have asked me to be brief in my answers, and I think I have explained it clearly.  For instance, the préfet could dismiss a conseiller, and yet this was not provided for by the law, and yet his order was obeyed.  
Q.	Well, I'm not going to insist because it appears you do not want to answer these questions.  

Tell me, Mr. Conseiller, before whom were you sworn in? 
A.	I took the oath before the bourgmestre.  He was replaced -- actually -- or, rather, represented on that occasion.  He was representing the conseiller communal. 
Q.	If you took an oath before the bourgmestre, then why did you not submit your resignation letter to the bourgmestre? 
A.	That was not the legal provision.  I took my oath before the bourgmestre because he represented the authorities in general.  But he did receive a copy of the resignation letter, just like the préfet.  
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, when we look at the law on communal administration, there is absolutely no provision for a conseiller to resign before a minister or to send a letter of resignation to a minister.  The -- the bourgmestre would have been enough because that is the person you took your oath with.  
A.	That is your opinion, Counsel.  That was not the practice at the time.  The bourgmestre was allowed to take my oath, but he was not allowed to dismiss or authorise dismissal of a conseiller.  I can give you another example.  The bourgmestre may authorise an official marriage, but he cannot proceed with divorce proceedings, so that the administration of communes and préfectures, in those circumstances, it was viable.  

At the time if I had committed an offence, the préfet or bourgmestre could have spoken to me about it.  And I addressed my letter of resignation to the minister, who asked me to continue in my functions.  However, if you think I did not proceed correctly, we just have to agree to disagree. 
Q.	Can you tell me what structure was responsible for administrating the préfecture, in your préfecture? 
A.	At commune level there was the person we referred to as assistant bourgmestre, who was responsible for administration of the secteur.  At préfecture level there was a sous-préfet responsible for administrative and legal affairs.  He was in charge of administration of the secteur.  
Q.	Witness UB, I believe you have not understood the question.  I asked you the following question:  What structure was responsible for administrating the préfecture of your city? 
A.	It is the minister of home affairs that carried that responsibility. 
Q.	Witness UB, I see that you do not know the law administrating the secteur -- or, préfecture where you lived.  I'd like to tell you it was the urban committee that was in charge of administration of the préfecture.  Can you tell me whether -- which structure was responsible for security at the level of the préfecture? 
A.	I do not quite understand your questions.  You are asking me which structure was responsible for administration of the préfecture.  I was thinking of a structure that was above the préfecture.  Now, coming to the question you have asked, there was an urban committee and another body that was responsible for security.  This was the préfectoral security committee.  
Q.	Just to assist you, Mr. Witness, there were three structures at préfecture level.  There is what we call the urban council, which is responsible for administration; the préfet; and the security -- the urban security committee.  Do you know who were the members of this urban security committee? 
A.	Its members were provided for by a law, the relevant law. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell me -- in relation to the composition of the urban security committee, can you tell me or confirm whether conseiller de secteur would attend its meetings? 
A.	According to the relevant law, the conseiller or a party representative could not attend the committee's meetings, according to the law governing the functioning of the committee. 
Q.	So you are definitely confirming that political parties and conseiller could not attend meetings of the committee? 
A.	No.  The law does not have such a provision.  According to the law, no one else can attend committee meetings, given that there is no such provision in the law. 
Q.	So tell me why you maintained that security meetings of the préfecture had political parties attending their meetings.  
A.	If one considers the functioning of the security committees, well, these were organised by the préfet the way he wanted them.  He organised the committees and added political party representatives, as well as the conseiller, to the membership.  So what I have always said, that is, that the laws existed and that they were interpreted according to our understanding.  

He convened meetings that were expanded, to which he invited political party representatives.  Moreover, he added that at their level the conseiller were to hold meetings that were to be attended by political party representatives.  It's not my job to say why this was happening.  I just know.  
Q.	Witness, do you have any document to bear out your assertions, that is, that there was a request or instruction for political party representatives and conseiller to attend those meetings? 
A.	I do not need any document to maintain this.  I was present.  The meeting was convened at préfectoral level because communal meetings had stopped.  And people were invited.  All I can say is that the préfet summoned us to a meeting, and we answered his call.  I said that communal meetings were no longer being held, and since I was present at the meetings, I do not need a document to maintain this position.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I was asking you if you had a document, because the law contradicts your assertions.  
A.	If the laws had been respected, no one would have been killed.  You see, Tutsis were killed, whereas there were regulations, rules, in force that were not complied with.  So, in short, I have no document indicating that a leader felt it was right to do what he did when he convened the meeting in the way you described.  
Q.	Thank you.  

Now, I will ask you a question about the weapon you had.  From 1992, April -- in April, the préfet wrote -- Préfet Renzaho wrote to the minister of national defence to request that you be provided with a weapon.  Can you confirm this? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Was this weapon supposed to be used for your protection? 
A.	Yes.  This weapon was meant to protect me, and other colleagues received weapons for the same purpose. 
Q.	And who were you supposed to be protecting yourself from? 
A.	Bandits.  You could be attacked by bandits, and, consequently, one needed an -- weapon to protect oneself as an authority, just as other citizens could make a request to protect themselves. 
Q.	Only against bandits, or could other people be of threat to your safety? 
A.	Against anyone who might come, whether you'd call them a bandit or other types of criminal, any wrongdoer who might be -- come and try to threaten your security.  One had to protect oneself.  One had to be in a position to protect oneself, when one could, against any wrongdoer who would threaten my safety.  That was the purpose for which the weapon was issued to me. 
Q.	Was that weapon not given to you following upon the RPF's invasion of Rwanda and, thereby, destabilising Rwandan security? 
A.	It wasn't the first time that one authorised people to carry weapons.  Even before then citizens could lodge a request with the ministry of defence to have the permission to bear an arm.  In the case concerning us, it was only three or four councillors -- conseiller among the 19 in all in the city who made the request.  
Q.	Am I to deduce from what you've said that the RPF attack did not cause insecurity in Rwanda? 
A.	The attack did cause insecurity in Rwanda, but you can't say that the weapons were issued to us because of that.  It's true that there was a state of belligerence between the RPF and the Rwandan government, but that is not why we asked the préfet to facilitate our obtaining a weapon.  
Q.	Did you have the opportunity to use that weapon? 
A.	No, I had it with me at home.  
Q.	And what became of that weapon? 
A.	When I went into exile, I returned the weapon to the authority who had issued it to me.  
Q.	And who was the authority to whom you returned the arm? 
A.	I returned it to the ministry of defence before we crossed the river to go into the Congo.  There was a soldier on duty on behalf of the ministry of defence, and showed us where we had to put our weapons before crossing the river into Congo. 
Q.	And when you handed in your weapon, were you -- and when you handed in your weapon, were you provided with a document certifying that you'd returned it, or did you merely hand it in? 
A.	When I was issued the weapon, I was issued a document that went with the weapon, and when I handed it back, I was given another document, certifying that I'd handed the weapon back. 
Q.	Do you have that document available? 
A.	No, I do not have it on me.  I lost it.  I lost quite a few documents, and then quite a few documents were confiscated from us in Congo.  But as regards the weapon, I gave it to the appropriate and competent persons.  
Q.	Witness U -- Witness UB, did you hand over any people to Renzaho, who subsequently released them?  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I do confirm that.  And when I see him next time, I will remind him of that fact.  I handed some people over to him, whom he released. 
Q.	How many people did you arrest, or detain? 
A.	At the outset, there were two people that I handed over.  But I am worried you -- perhaps you are going to rely on this information.  I know that in the beginning there were two people; the second time, three people.  But then I saw it did not concern him.  Other conseiller handed over quite a few other people.  But there is proof as to what we were doing at that time, and especially the case of the people who were arrested and handed over to the préfet. 
Q.	Do you remember the names of the people that you yourself are -- arrested, the first two people?  Can you give us their names? 
A.	For the time being, I don't remember their names.  I can't give you the two names.  But the most important person we arrested was a certain*************.  We arrested him, and when we got to the préfectoral offices, he was -- the préfet released him.  He was someone very important.  

The other one who came from my secteur was one *******(sic), and I handed him over to the préfet.  And the other one's name was*******.  I handed them over to the préfet, explaining that they were attacking the population, and then subsequently we noted that those people were not detained at the préfectoral offices.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you help with the spelling of *************************(sic), please? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, might he not spell all the names?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be helpful, even -- even more helpful.  
THE WITNESS:
****************************************************************************************************.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  ***********************************************. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, have you finished? 
A.	I think I also mentioned*********************************************************************.  

I'm sorry.  I don't remember the other names of these individuals, these people.  Very often these people would have nicknames they'd use here and there, but I don't know those other names. 
Q.	Witness, do you remember the dates or date, date or dates, on which you arrested those people? 
A.	I do not remember the dates, but I can tell you it was in mid-April 1994. 
Q.	As far as ***********-- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel said Kidengi (sic), but I think he means***********.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Do you remember the date on which you arrested him? 
A.	No, I do not -- no, I do not remember the date, but it was in April.  It was then that I informed the préfet that that person had killed many people in*******************************, and he asked us to take him to the préfectoral authorities. 
Q.	Now, Witness UB, tell me, when you arrested him, you arrested those other people, were you alone or were you in the company of others? 
A.	You're asking me if I was alone when we arrested those people?  Well, we used various methods to take them before the préfet.  I couldn't handcuff **********to take him to the préfectoral office.  I merely told him that the préfet wanted to see him, and then I went to the préfectoral office to tell the préfet that the chap named **********was there.  We used various methods so as to protect our security. 
Q.	Witness, I wish to understand better.  Because when you say that a person is arrested, he is under constraint; he won't be complying with a summons from his own volition.  So tell us exactly how you arrested them.  Were you alone?  Were you with other people? 
A.	Well, that's what you say, Counsel.  I used my own means to take them before the préfet.  I didn't handcuff them to take them to the préfet.  I told them the préfet wanted to see them, so I used my own means to take him before the préfet, to tell him that he was killing members of the population.  I didn't handcuff him, if that's what you are expecting.  I wasn't in charge of doing that.  I used my own methods.  I managed to get him to appear before the préfet, whom I've informed that he was slaughtering people by the droves. 
Q.	To be clearer, Witness, can you describe the methods you used? 
A.	I have told you, I told him that I had a message from the préfet and the préfet wanted to meet him, wanted to see him.  That is how I got him to go to the préfecture. 
Q.	So if I understand, you didn't arrest him, you invited him, or you used subterfuge or trickery to get him to go and see the préfet; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, there you have it.  That is the procedure I used.  I wasn't authorised to arrest anyone.  I'm trying to show you that I informed the préfet that these people -- this man was killing people, and he did not arrest him.  He had a jail.  He could have locked those people up. 
Q.	Is -- did you follow the same procedure with the other people you arrested? 
A.	Yes, the same procedure to arrest the others.  That is the procedure I used, and finally they did get to the préfecture. 
Q.	At the time you were informing the préfet that those people were killing others, did you have the proof necessary for the préfet to arrest him, or was he to proceed on the mere basis of your statement? 
A.	I have told you that we sent reports as to who was dying in the various cellule and who were the perpetrators of those massacres. 
Q.	Well, I can -- I -- I understand that.  I can conceive of that, Witness, but did you provide the préfet with any proof as to the crimes committed by those people you wanted to have arrested? 
A.	No, it wasn't enough that I want him to arrest them, it was his responsibility to arrest those people who were killing other people.  The essential point is that I pointed those out and said to him, "These are so-and-so, and they have been killing people."  It was enough that I should tell him that so-and-so was killing people.  I was reporting on the security situation in my secteur, as well as who were the troublemakers. 
Q.	Well, I can see that your word was taken for scripture.  Very well.  I understand.  Let us continue.  I should like to put some questions to you regarding the Interahamwe.  

Witness UB, can you tell us how the MRND youth wing was created? 
A.	I think I have already answered that question.  The MRND youth wing was established following a decision of the national committee.  That is where the decision was taken, and the Interahamwe were created from the national level right down to the grassroots level. 
Q.	And what was the youth wing called at that time? 
A.	The MRND youth wing, from its inception, bore the name Interahamwe. 
Q.	Wasn't it called Interahamwes MRND, or just Interahamwe? 
A.	They were called Interahamwes MRND, and it was the youth of the MRND.  So it was the youth of the MRND. 
Q.	Now, how were the Interahamwes MRND recruited, Witness? 
A.	I think the top authorities of the MRND could answer that question.  They knew what criterion they applied in selecting the Interahamwe.  We, for our part, knew that the youth wing was born, and as days passed, the number of Interahamwe increased.  So they know what criterion they applied in recruiting Interahamwe.  
Q.	You have just stated that Interahamwe were established throughout Rwanda at all levels.  Do you maintain that assertion? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.  You could find Interahamwe everywhere throughout the national territory.  You'd see them at secteural level and in certain areas.  You'd see them in Kigali, but everywhere throughout the national territory. 
Q.	How are you so well informed as to the creation and establishment of the Interahamwe throughout Rwanda? 
A.	The Interahamwe were born in Kigali préfecture.  In fact, the Interahamwe wing was born in Kigali urban préfecture, but there were branches everywhere throughout the nation.  Those who started up the Interahamwe in Kigali went back to their home préfectures to establish other branches in other préfectures because those who began the Interahamwe in Kigali town were not necessarily from Kigali.  They had, of necessity, to go back to their home préfectures to start up the same Interahamwe wing in their respective préfectures. 
Q.	Well, what I've heard in the translation is they "must have."  Is that a supposition on your part, or do you have any concrete information to support what you have just asserted? 
A.	Yes, that is what happened.  When the Interahamwe were created in Kigali, the people who created the Interahamwe in Kigali then could return to their home préfectures to establish the Interahamwe in their respective préfectures. 
Q.	You have stated that the purpose of the Interahamwes MRND was to undertake party propaganda and protect its members.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, that is what was said to the militants, that the wing was to protect MRND members and undertake party propaganda.  But in the course of time, the -- that wing received other orders that it followed.  But in the beginning, that is what they told us. 
Q.	And why -- and why did the MRND have to seek to ensure membership should be protected by the youth wing? 
A.	The question should not be put to me.  The people who created the Interahamwe can tell you why it was necessary to defend the party members.  Those who created the youth wing can answer your question.  They can tell you whether MRND members did not have the required level of security. 
Q.	Well, until proof of the contrary, you are an MRND member, so you are -- you should know what's going on in the party.  
A.	I am not the MRND party spokesman.  I was a mere party member.  I cannot answer all the questions you can put to the MRND.  Since the MRND leaders are here, why don't you ask them?  I can't answer in depth.  I can't tell you why, in -- in depth, the reasons why the party leaders created the Interahamwe.  And as to the rest of it, those who created the Interahamwe, the party president, they're the ones who should answer your question.  There was a president.  He had his bureau.  They have their secrets.  We ordinary party members could not know all the party secrets.  
Q.	Witness UB, can you tell us how the other parties went about protecting their members? 
A.	Well, I -- I will answer you as an MRND party member.  I don't know how the other parties worked.  Since you say that I was the party leader at secteural level, I could perhaps tell you what I saw on the road, what was happening with the PL, PSD, and other parties.  
Q.	Well, that's what I'm asking you, Witness UB.  In respect of your responsibilities as a conseiller, how did the other parties proceed? 
A.	I don't know how the other parties proceeded in recruiting youth, but the fact is that they also had youth affiliated to the respective parties.  As I was not a member of those parties, I cannot tell you what they did.  But as a conseiller, I saw that each party had its youth wing, the PL, the PSD, et cetera, and the MDR also.  But I don't know how they functioned in detail.  
Q.	Can you tell us whether the MRND was the last party to create a youth wing? 
A.	No, the MRND was not the last.  If I said the MRND was the last, it might mean the 17th because there was 16 political parties.  I cannot, therefore -- I'm not in a position to tell you whether it was the MDR which was the first, and then the PL.  I am not in a position to tell you, but I know that the youth wing of the MRND and the MDR were the first to be established.  The PSD, for example, had a youth wing, Abakombozi, but I can't tell you when the MRND established its youth wing.  But I -- I can tell you the MDR was the first to establish a youth wing. 
Q.	And when the MDR youth wing was established, how did they act towards the MRND? 
A.	The MDR did not act towards the MRND, as such.  The Inkuba -- the MDR had a youth wing called Inkuba.  When they had meetings, they went from village to village, and they wanted to force the conseiller de secteur and other people to join their party, what they called Kubohoza.  So I don't know anything about the internal organisation of the MDR party.  But what we can see was the MDR wanted to use force.  They were always in confrontation with the MRND members. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you tell us if you assisted in the recruitment of Interahamwes MRND? 
A.	No, that was not part of my duties.  I was not in charge of recruiting Interahamwe.  After the establishment of the steering committee, it was the -- that committee that was in charge of recruiting the Interahamwe round -- right down to cellule level.  It had nothing to do with the duties of a secteural conseiller. 
Q.	But tell me, Witness, as an MRND militant, what prevented you from encouraging the recruitment of Interahamwe?  But as you are fond of saying, as a simple MRND member, what prevented you from encouraging the recruitment of Interahamwes MRND? 
A.	In view of a conseiller de secteur's duties, I could not show all the people in my secteur that they should necessarily follow me in my party.  I like the Interahamwe, but they were sufficient unto themselves.  They had their own means from the national level down to grassroots level.  I didn't need to encourage young people to join the Interahamwe.  

It's true that I was an MRND party member, and I merely wanted that the MRND be the majority party in my secteur.  Because if ever I were to stand it as a candidate, MRND candidate, I'd have plenty of people to vote for me. 

The Interahamwe had enough means to do their own recruitment because they didn't take just anybody into the youth wing. 
Q.	Did you obtain arms for the Interahamwe of your secteur? 
A.	No, I never provided weapons to the Interahamwe in my secteur.  They had their own means of distribution of weapons to their members. 
Q.	Those weapons you obtained from the ministry of defence, to whom did you give them? 
A.	Yes, I was given weapons in accordance with the number of cellule in my secteur, and I gave them to the responsable de cellule. 
Q.	Can you give -- can you give us the names of the responsables de secteur (sic) to whom you issued those weapons? 
A.	There were *****cellule in my secteur, and I think I've already named them in the course of the questioning by one of your colleagues.  Without going into the names, I told you there were *****cellule, and I issued those weapons to the five responsable -- respective responsable.  I think the lawyer that preceded -- counsel that preceded you has already asked me that question, and I already provided the answer. 
Q.	Agreed.  Were the responsable de cellule members of the Interahamwes MRND? 
A.	No, no, that is not correct.  The way in which you put that question is not correct.  At the time of multiparty politics, they did not represent the MRND at cellule level.  MRND had its own structure, from cellule level up to national level. 

So there were the government officials, civil servants on the one hand, and there was the party structure on the other.  The party had its representatives at cellule level, secteural level, communal level, préfectoral level, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. 
Q.	Witness UB, would you agree with me that at a given time the concept of -- or, the name "Interahamwe" was applied to all those who opposed the RPF?  Is that not correct? 
A.	I don't understand your question.  Can you repeat that question, please?  
Q.	Well, let me put it differently.  As you know, with the war in Rwanda, the RPF were called the Inkotanyi and, in parallel, the RPF considered that all those who were not its allies, were not for it, were considered Interahamwe.  Do you share that?  Do you agree with that?  Do you agree with that?  
A.	No, I don't believe that.  When the RPF attacked, the Interahamwe did not yet exist.  The RPF attacked for the first time in 1990, and the Interahamwe wing was not yet established. 
Q.	Witness UB, I'm talking of the time after the Interahamwe were established and, in particular, after April 1994.  
A.	If I have understood, everybody was considered Interahamwe?  I can tell you, even today, people are considered Interahamwe, whereas they're nothing of the sort.  The fact is that in 1994 Interahamwe were the majority.  They were the most visible here and there.  So it wasn't easy to distinguish who was a real Interahamwe or not.  

I don't know if you mean to say that a political party said that or if the RPF said that, but in 1994 it was said that the Interahamwe were distinguished by the fact they committed most of the criminal acts perpetrated at the time. 
Q.	On the 28th of November 1997, you said that they were mixed groups, and this morning you also confirmed that by "Interahamwe," there were MRND people, CDR people, and MDR power, Karamira people.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that.  I know that in my testimony I stated -- I did state something along those lines.  In fact, I did not distinguish between the MRND or the CDR or MDR power, and Karemera (sic).  They all were within the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe led all those people from various groups in perpetrating criminal acts, is why all the evildoers were referred to as Interahamwe.  So I said the Interahamwe were joined by CDR people and other people from other parties. 
Q.	You have just said that you do not distinguish between MRND and CDR.  Am I to deduce therefrom that there is no difference, that it was the MRND that decided everything as to whether to accept the CDR or the MDR? 
A.	The MRND was quite powerful.  It -- most decisions taken by the MRND were followed by those who worked with the MRND.  And if the MRND did not decide something, it was then not implemented. 
Q.	Do you mean -- what do you mean by that, that the MDR, CDR had no autonomy, had no -- no -- could not act on their own account? 
A.	Since the CDR was not in government, could that party have any influence?  If the MDR only had three positions, whereas the MRND had more than five posts, do you mean that the MRND was not powerful?  It is true that the MDR and the CDR were autonomous, but that autonomy lay in their unity. 
Q.	Witness UB, given the events of April 1994, which you will agree with me that this was a time of war, and you yourself admitted that the Interahamwe was a heterotic group, what would you say was the reason for this support, who lent this support for all Interahamwes? 
A.	The word "Interahamwe" is to say that anyone who was Interahamwe, who called himself an Interahamwe, was understood to be someone from the MRND because the MRND could not organise or control the Interahamwe.  People called themselves Interahamwe, joined the Interahamwe, and perpetrated the same acts.  I cannot say that the JDR joined the Interahamwe and make the distinction between them.  All these groups joined together with the Interahamwe in the forefront, and wherever the Interahamwe operated, they were directing these groups.  No such group manned a roadblock on its own.  

I am saying that the parties had formed a coalition.  Perhaps it was an MRND strategy, but I think that when there is a coalition with other parties, including the CDR, that that was the objective.  So I take it that you consider that there was a coalition between the parties. 
Q.	I'm going to question you on the rallies of the 23rd of October.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I see that it is time for the break.  And before I get on with this line of questioning, I would suggest that we take the break at this stage, that is, if it is convenient for you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is convenient.  I think it's a good time to take the break now.  

Are you on track to finish this afternoon?  

MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I am on the third page of a six-page document, meaning that one and a half hours will not be enough for me.  I will most likely have to conclude tomorrow morning, unless -- considering that everything depends on the answers I obtain.  Sometimes there are questions where I do not need any comments, and I would ask that the witness answer quickly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  We take the recess now.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, you may continue. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, we will continue.  Let me ask you a question about the rally of the 23rd of October 1993, the one in Nyamirambo.  I would like you to explain to me who held -- rather, who organised the rally and to what end. 
A.	The rally was organised by the parties who met in that place.  So party leaders got together and decided to hold the rally.  I cannot tell you who planned it.  Normally, when one plans to hold a rally, one first has to ask for permission from the préfet.  I am not able to tell you the name of the person.  I know that political party leaders agreed to hold the meeting in that place.  So those people must know the -- of the meeting, especially with regard to its planning. 
Q.	Can you give me the names of the parties in question? 
A.	There were several political parties holding the rally.  There were -- there was the MRND, which was the majority party, but there were also the PDC and the PSD and others; a dozen or so political parties had consulted to hold that rally.  I am not able to tell you the exact -- the names of the parties, but I know that there were a few.  
Q.	Can you tell me how long the meeting lasted? 
A.	The meeting took place in the morning.  You want me to tell you the number of hours the meeting lasted -- the rally lasted.  I cannot say, I did not check what time the meeting -- the rally began, and whether it ended at 2 p.m.  Basically, it took place; that is all that matters. 
Q.	At the start of the rally, were you not present? 
A.	At the start of the rally, first of all, there was sensitisation and even if I had been there or the fact that I was there did not -- does not mean that I took note of the time the rally began.  It took place in a place that was close to where I was.  I was therefore able to attend together with other members of my party. 
Q.	Is it not true to say that the meeting took place on the 23rd of October 1993, one afternoon -- in the afternoon? 
A.	Rallies held at the regional stadium -- there were so many of them.  In the course of a week or a fortnight, there were lots of rallies.  I was present at a rally.  Before noon, another rally was held at about 3:00 or 4 p.m. when people were coming back from their offices.  There was a march first.  I don't know if that was included in the rally.  So the population organised a march in the three communes of the city of Kigali and participants reached the regional stadium.  I am not able to say or give the timings of the various rallies held. 
Q.	What would you say if I were to suggest that, first, this was a protest march against the assassination of President Ndadaye of Burundi and that the march had been organised by the MRND, with the participation of other parties, including the MRND? 
A.	I was not one of the organisers of the rally, and, therefore, I cannot tell you whether the rally had been organised by the MDR or the MRND.  You tell me the MDR organised the rally and that it invited the MRND.  I have no problem with that.  All I know is that the rally took place.  I have no comment, and since you tell me, you must have been told by people who knew a lot more about it.  So if the MDR organised a rally and invited the MRND or any other party, that was within their rights.  It is quite possible but, I, in fact, observed the rally took place and decisions were taken.  That's it.  
Q.	Witness UB, you have asserted that Mr. Edouard Karemera arrived at the stadium just as the rally ended.  Do you confirm that you saw him arrive at the stadium? 
A.	Yes, I do.  I can confirm that Karemera arrived at the stadium just as the rally was ending.  Many participants had already taken the floor and for the MRND, so Habyarimana had already made his speech so that by the time Karemera arrived these people had already addressed the rally and it was ending. 
Q.	What time do you think he arrived? 
A.	I do not remember.  I do not remember the time.  I do know that he arrived at the venue as the rally ended. 
Q.	Could you at least give me a range?  Could it have been around 4:00 or 6:00 since the meeting took place in the afternoon, even though you did not look at your watch? 
A.	We cannot make an estimate here.  You are asking me to give an estimate as to the time.  I was not wearing a wristwatch.  It is as if you are asking me to tell the time now and yet I am not wearing a watch.  So, I cannot make an estimate and firmly advance an estimate. 
Q.	Was this the first time you were meeting Mr. Edouard Karemera? 
A.	It was not the first time I saw Mr. Karemera, but I told you that I had never had a chance to address him even though I would see him.  I already knew him, but I never said that we had any relationship. 
Q.	Witness UB, can you tell us the names of other persons who might confirm that Mr. Edouard Karemera, indeed, came to that event? 
A.	I can give the name of Jean Habyarimana, MRND party president for Kigali. 
Q.	Do you have any other names? 
A.	I cannot give you Karamira's name because he is no longer alive.  I am telling you that 
	Jean Habyarimana was present at the time.  I did not try to note down everybody, but I said that Habyarimana who was president of the party can attest to this rather than give you another name that I am not so certain of. 
Q.	You are in the habit of saying that Mr. Karemera was a dignitary in the party.  When he arrived, was he introduced to the crowd? 
A.	What do you mean?  He could not have been introduced when he arrived at the close of the meeting, people were dispersing, leaving.  He was not a person who was unknown nor was he a very important person that was coming from very far.  I could not hold the crowd any longer as they were scattering. 
Q.	Witness, does this mean that Mr. Edouard Karemera did not address the rally? 
A.	I did say that he did not address the rally on that occasion. 
Q.	During the rally the Interahamwe of the MRND, were they present?
A.	When it was announced that MRND militants were to attend the rally, the Interahamwe would be in the forefront, which means that when MRND militants or cadres held a meeting Interahamwes, especially those who were from that secteur, had to be present.  So the MRND and other youth groups, other party youth groups were present.  The Interahamwe were the strongest, the most numerous, and had to be present at the march to give it some impact. 
Q.	How were you able to identify them as MRND Interahamwe? 
A.	You will even ask me how I can identify MRND Interahamwe.  Well, in Kigali they were known; every secteur had an Interahamwe leader.  In the Nyakabanda, Biryogo, Gitega, Nyamirambo, all these secteurs, Interahamwe leaders were present at the rallies.  And with this -- these leaders were the members of the various youth wings.  That does not mean I know them by name.  If there was an MRND leader, one of his fellow members would be present; the same was true of Interahamwes present at the rallies. 
Q.	Am I to understand then that just from seeing them, you would be able to tell that these were Interahamwe MRNDs -- rather, MRND Interahamwes? 
A.	I told you that Interahamwe leaders were known at secteur level.  The Interahamwe were not hiding.  We would see them whenever they attended any event.  The same was true of militants of other parties.  They would make themselves known to other members of their parties. 
Q.	Witness UB, I do agree with you that you might know some leaders, but perhaps all leaders of the Interahamwe leadership, that would be to say that you have exceptional powers of recollection or photographic memory? 
A.	I believe you are putting questions to me, and I am giving you answers from my mind.  I did not take notes.  I am not relying on any document.  Let me tell you something.  It was not one of my duties to know the names of Interahamwes attending the rally, but when the Interahamwe danced in the company of their leaders, it was obvious that the Interahamwes were present.  I cannot -- and besides, it is not even my duty to know all Interahamwe in Nyakabanda, I could not even do that for my own secteur, but when I saw their leaders and if I knew them -- I knew some of them -- some of these leaders.  And since Interahamwe leaders were there and Interahamwes were dancing, there is no further proof needed to say that Interahamwes were present.  The same was true for MRND members.  We had a leader and the party members would follow that leader. 
Q.	Can you tell me the name of any Interahamwe leader who was present at the rally? 
A.	In Nyakabanda secteur there was Jean Bereki Sukari (phonetic).  His name appears on the list that I drew up.  In Biryogo secteur there was Kitonsa and Ndayitabi, Suedi, and his name also appears on the list I drew up.  In Gitega there was Bernard and one Pekos.  I am referring to Nyamirambo area.  But in Remera, I do not know the names.  I am talking about the area I know best. 
Q.	So you do agree with me that your knowledge is much more limited to the secteur in which you operated? 
A.	Yes.  I have not talked of any other secteur.  I have only given evidence on the secteur that bordered my own.  I knew the responsable by face and by name. 
Q.	After the rally, you stated that violence was orchestrated by Interahamwe and that 
	Mr. Edouard Karemera, who was present, did nothing to stop the violence.  Do you maintain this? 
A.	I can confirm this.  I made a report and I mentioned violence perpetrated by the Interahamwe at the end of the rally, along the road from Nyamirambo to town.  People were beaten and houses were destroyed. 
Q.	Witness UB, you have stated that Mr. Karemera arrived at the end when the people were dispersing.  I don't know whether you know what the verb means, "dispersing", when people were going off, each in his own direction.  Can you tell me exactly what he did?  Did he come back and take his car and go off again, or did he also walk away? 
A.	Karemera did not take part in the march, so he left just as he had come in his vehicle.  Karemera went off as he had come, and I don't know where he was going.  I did not know his destination but those who would come to take part in the rally started attacking the public, especially those who they thought were Tutsi.  And I made a report regarding my secteur and others made reports on*********************** *************************************. 
Q.	Can you tell us how long it took when Karemera arrived at the end of the morning and when he left forthwith?  How long was it between the time he arrived and the time he immediately left again? 
A.	When we saw him the population -- the people were leaving, were dispersing, and they took a road and they could see what the people were up to.  He came back by the same road.  And when you asked how much time passed between the time he arrived and the time he returned, went off again, the activities, the violence of the Interahamwe continued for at least an hour.  What I can say is, on their way home the Interahamwe, while they were on their way home and committing those acts of violence, the others looked on without intervening.  

After the rally, we didn't stay very long on the spot and he also left again by the same -- on the same road he had come by.  What I am saying is, he was a witness to the acts of violence being committed along the road. 
Q.	Witness UB, try and listen to the question and try and answer.  I am asking you, between the time you saw Karemera come and when he got into his car, how many minutes or how many days, if you prefer -- could you tell us? 
A.	I think you are asking me how many minutes, days or hours passed.  The rally was finished.  I didn't look at my watch to see how long he spent there.  After the rally we went home.  For the people to disperse, it takes maybe 20, 30 minutes.  I didn't check to see how long he spent at that place.  The fact is he came for the close of the meeting.   We had begun to disperse.  Let us say that it took about 30 minutes in order to get to their homes, maybe one hour's walk. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness UB. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, for the record, I would like to have the 3rd of March 2006 draft corrected, where for "Karamira", "Karemera" was written, whereby it was stated that Karemera took the floor to speak on behalf of Hutu-Power.  I think it is now -- it's clear that it was Mr. Karamira who took the floor at that rally. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The application would be submitted to the authorities who will address that. 

Mr. Registrar, is that a sufficient notice?
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Mr.  President, it is.  We would expect him to provide us with copies of the transcripts in question and we will submit them to the appropriate quarters for rectification.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. MORLEY: 
And I think I can assist.  I do recall that certainly, when we are all speaking English, we noticed that there was some confusion over the expression Karemera versus Karamira, and it may just be that in the French translation the spelling remains wrong. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Sow, do you understand what is required?  We don't make the order from the bench for correction.  There is a process for dealing with mistakes of this nature.  And if you submitted draft -- the particular transcript with your suggested correction, it would then be forwarded to the proper authority.

1645H 
MR. SOW:
I understand, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness UB, I'm going to put a series of questions to you in respect of the events of April 1994.  Can you tell me who started the killing after the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	After the 6th of April, that means the 7th of April, and as I have already stated, I'm referring especially to the area for which I was answerable, there was a cellule in my area, and when I got there, I found the soldiers had started killing people, whereas in another cellule, the CDR militants in the company of Interahamwe and some CDR people had begun killing people.  So I'm saying it's especially the military who started the killing in the secteur where I was on the 7th of April, because they wanted to set an example for the others to be able to follow their example.  
Q.	Witness UB, at the time of the events of 1994, you have stated that within three days, 5,000 Tutsi were killed, and you have also stated that the Interahamwe could kill a thousand people in 20 minutes.  Do you stick to that estimate? 
A.	In three days, in the area where I lived and the neighbouring area, I do assert that that number of people was killed.  You could see the lorries, trucks, taking the corpses away to common public graves.  I maintain -- I assert that within three days more than 5,000 -- more than 5,000 people were killed in Kigali. 
Q.	Witness, to make such an estimate, did you, yourself undertake the autopsy of those people, or were you at least carefully listing the people killed to come to this estimate, or is it merely because you saw trucks passing to say that it was the Tutsi who were killed? 
A.	Yes, it was the Tutsi who were being killed in those days.  And, secondly, you're asking me if I undertook an autopsy.  That's another question.  I don't know how to answer that question.  It's your opinion.  You seem to be saying that corpses were being taken away to perform autopsies.  The fact is that conseillers were submitting reports to the bourgmestres and reporting on the people being killed.  I never said that 5,000 people were killed in my secteur.  

I am telling you that, where I was staying, where most of the Tutsi were staying, the figure could well reach that number.  Various reports showed that in Nyarugenge secteur -- in Nyarugenge, people were being killed all over the place.  And at the hospital, CHK, where the bodies were piled up, you could see that many people had been killed.  And I've just told you that in various secteurs the councillors prepared reports on the situation. 
Q.	Witness UB, would you be surprised to hear, on the basis of your estimates, that a thousand people killed in 20 minutes, after one hour and 40 minutes, that's 5,000 people killed, instead of three days?  What do you say to that?  
A.	You're telling me that in 40 minutes, 5,000 people would be killed.  Listen, I tell you that one person can kill a thousand people in one hour.
Q.	Witness, that people were killed is possible, but I would like to remind you, it was you who said that in 20 minutes you could kill 5,000.  You said -- not 5,000, you said 1,000.  Now, is it reasonable, if we take that estimate of 20 minutes for a thousand people -- and you haven't even mentioned what sort of weapon they used.  Maybe it would be a machine gun, because if it's only machetes or pangas or coupe-coupe, it would take a great deal longer.  

So when you're speaking of crimes that are so serious, it is important you should not exaggerate, which might even be verged on the ridiculous.  You said a thousand people in 20 minutes, so I calculated that in an hour and 40 minutes, you could kill 5,000 people in one hour and 40 minutes.  

A.	Well, personally, I'm satisfied that you, at least, acknowledge that people were killed.  But I would remind you that the killers were trained to kill.  You are asking me what sort of weapons they used.  How do you know that they didn't have machine guns?  Well, it was the Interahamwe or the soldiers; everybody was killing.  They had all sorts of weapons.  They had grenades.  They could throw grenades on a group of people, a crowd.  They had all sorts of weaponry, as I have said -- in view of the fact they were trained.  And the way I saw the people being killed, machetes were not the only weapon they used.  They had a lot of weapons.  That's why I said 5,000 people.  In your opinion, you think it wasn't possible?  

Apparently, even today here, you don't understand how someone can kill his father, can kill another human being because of his racial group, ethnic group.  If someone is capable of killing someone else, well, it's also possible to throw a grenade into a crowd of people.  According to what was stated by a person trained to kill, I say it is possible.  And in 20 minutes, a thousand people can be killed.  And that is why I answered thus to the question put to me.  Otherwise, they had many different ways of killing people.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, were reports prepared after the killing, can you tell me?  And the procedure that you explained, were those reports submitted to the préfet, who certainly prepares a report for the minister of internal affairs?  Is that the procedure? 
A.	Yes.  The procedure was that you would report to your hierarchical superior.  If I reported to the bourgmestre and the préfet, the préfet also had his superior in the person of the minister of internal affairs, who knew what was occurring.  That was the procedure, and as I understand it, the minister of internal affairs also had a superior to whom he had to report.  And that is why I say the report was given to the préfet and to the bourgmestre, who, in turn, reported to his hierarchical superior, who was the minister of internal affairs. 
Q.	Witness UB, did you have access to the préfet's report numbering the number of people killed? 
A.	No, it was not part of my duties to check the préfet's report or ask him for a copy of it.  The main -- the essential thing was that I keep him abreast of events, to keep him informed.  If he did not inform his superior, that's his problem.  I did not ask him if he gave his report to the minister of internal affairs.  He is the only one who knows what he did with the various reports and what figure he put in his report.  But in view of the hierarchical structure, his immediate superior was the minister of internal affairs. 
Q.	Am I to conclude, Witness, that as regard the estimates, we consider that they're your own estimates and not based on the préfet's report?  
A.	I was not present when the préfet handed in his report.  What I am sure of is the report I made to him.  And I know that my colleagues also sent him reports.  As to his report to his hierarchical superior, you can ask him to explain.  What you're speaking of -- you're speaking of those reports from the secteurs to the commune and from the commune to the préfet.  The préfet also reported to the minister of internal affairs, who also had a hierarchical superior to whom he should report.  You can come to any conclusion you want. 
Q.	Witness UB, you have claimed that it was a matter of killing all the Tutsi, including the children, so as to avoid the mistakes of 1959; is that correct? 
A.	I did not say that the Tutsi, including the children, should be killed.  I said they were killed.  I didn't say that they had to be killed; I said they were killed so as not to repeat the same mistake as in 1959, because they said they should not commit the same error as in 1959.  So I said the children, the old people, the women, the men, were all killed.  And I put that in my reports to my superiors. 
Q.	Witness UB, the killing took place at the time when the war broke out between the RPF and Rwanda, is that not correct?  
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, I did not understand your question.  
Q.	I said the slaughter took place, the killing took place at the time when war broke out between Rwanda and the RPF.  Is that not true?  Is that not correct?  
A.	I don't see your question.  The killing -- the war was already underway when the killings occurred, at the outset.  It was the beginning of the war, or, rather, the return to the hostilities.  I don't -- what are you talking about?  I don't know if you mean that the war began in 1990 and continued till 1994 -- I don't understand.  I don't understand the question.  I can't answer it. 
Q.	Witness UB, in 1994, in April, after the 6th of April, did not the war resume?  
A.	After the 6th of April 1994, there was resumption of hostilities between the RPF and the Rwandan army, and the Rwandan government. 
Q.	So I wanted to ask you, Witness UB, what distinction do you draw between a situation of peace and a situation of war? 
A.	Well, that's not an easy problem to solve.  Is it some sort of test?  You are asking me of the difference between wartime and peace time?  Well, maybe you're speaking of the time before the 6th and you mean, after the 6th, war broke out.  Well, it's obvious that there must be a difference between the two periods of time.  The question is to know who started the war, who triggered the hostility. 
Q.	Well, of course, we'll come back to the matter of the presidential plane that was shot down.  But I merely want to ask you whether, in a time of war, authority could be exercised in a normal fashion.  
A.	You are asking me if authority or power could be exercised normally?  That was to protect the population.  I do not know if by that you mean that the population could not be sufficiently defended because this was wartime.  Those not taking part in the war were supposed to be protected, because those who were not taking part in the war, our duty was to protect them.  Are you saying the opposite?  
Q.	Mr. Witness, the reason I've asked you this question is that in the course of examination-in-chief and cross-examination, you have often maintained that nothing was done, and in spite of everything, you were shown messages of peace that were either communicated by the MRND or the government and yet you felt that nothing was done to stop the killings.  And this is why I asked you the following question: Do you feel that in time of war, authority can be exercised in a normal fashion?
A.	It is possible that it is the difference between time of peace and time of war, but there are people who take a direct part in the war.  We could, for instance, consider the fact that I was shown releases or communiqués, but those are just pieces of paper.  You can easily put out a communiqué without actually doing anything, and that is pointless.  There were places where various authorities were in place and no hostilities were taking place, and yet others where killing was taking place and yet no fighting was going on in those places.  

Maybe you are arguing that since all efforts were concentrated at the front line, the administrative authorities could not attend to their responsibilities.  Maybe that is your idea.  I cannot say.  But there were people who were fighting at the front who were engaged with their enemies.  But the bourgmestre and other authorities who were in place did nothing to protect the population.  And I do not have any confidence in the communiqués that were put out, because even those who drew up the communiqués did nothing to implement them.  

If you are arguing that these people were busy waging war against the RPF, that is for them to say.  I have no comment on that.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, try not to look into my mind.  What I think is of no importance here.  Try to answer the questions I am asking and be as concise as possible.  That will save us time.  I wanted to ask you, Witness UB, what was the attitude of the Interahamwe national committee towards the killings? 
A.	I was not a member of the national Interahamwe committee so as to know what the conduct of the various members was or their reaction to the killings.  
Q.	Am I therefore to understand that you were not informed of any initiatives by the national committee of the Interahamwe, with a view to halting the killings?  
A.	No, I'm not aware of that, was not informed, because I was not a member of those structures and would therefore not be in a position to say whether any measures were taken to restore security.  I know nothing about that.  
Q.	Witness, were you not aware of the communiqué of the 1st of February 1994 by the Interahamwe national committee?  
A.	The Interahamwes of the MRND, how could I have been informed?  I was not a member of that national committee.  I was not informed of this communiqué of the 1st of February 1994. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, that communiqué was broadcast in the media and was also circulated in -- among the parties, one of which -- the parties -- and you were a member of one of these parties, so how can you say you were not aware?  
A.	I did not read it.  I do not think you can hold it against me.  I was busy with other things.  So this communiqué may have been broadcast, may have been printed in the media, but I am mostly referring to the events of 1994.  But I did not closely monitor the activities of the Interahamwe in February, so that I am not aware of this communiqué because I was not made aware of it.  That is why I say this. 
Q.	Witness UB, can you tell me, what should you have done that you did not do to stop the slaughter, in particular, in your secteur? 
A.	I had no powers greater than those of the Interahamwe, who were the perpetrators of the massacres.  I did all that was in my power to stop the killings, but it was in vain because I was discouraged by the Interahamwes, who were stronger than me.  When I asked for help from the authorities, they did not intervene.  So I would be -- would have been mistaken if I had not appealed to the authorities, and yet I did that.  And I think, therefore, that I did my duty in that regard. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness UB.  I will move to another line of questioning.  These questions relate to the activities of the MRND party, of which you were a member.  

Witness UB, you stated that you were a signatory to the statutes of the mouvement républicain national pour le democratie et le developpement; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did you read the statutes before you signed them? 
A.	We received a reading of the statutes at the Amahoro stadium.  This was read to the whole population.  So we were therefore able to be advised as to the content of the MRND statutes at the advent of multiparty -- of the multiparty system. 
Q.	As a signatory, did you not seek to obtain a copy of the statutes in order to read them and better acquaint yourself with the party?  
A.	After that, I did not try to obtain a copy of the statutes.  I awaited distribution of the statutes by high authorities.  I supposed that the reading was sufficient.  I felt that the statutes of the MRND were acceptable, so I did not try to obtain a copy of the statutes thereafter.  
Q.	Bearing in mind the information you obtained, which information allowed you to conclude that the statutes were acceptable, can you tell me what is the motto of the mouvement républicain national pour la democratie et dévelopment?  
A.	You are telling me about the motto and you are talking about the mouvement révolutionnaire national pour le developpement et la democratie.  Essentially, the MRND was supposed to promote development of the whole population.  It was also a matter of maintaining and safeguarding the republican character.  Those were gains that were already attained.  There was no explanation in Kinyarwanda about what it was; that is to say, broadly speaking, that any citizen who wanted to become a member of the MRND could do so, guided by the belief that this party was defending democracy and development. 
Q.	Witness UB, I do not want to offend you, but I notice that you do not know your party's motto.  It had -- it did not need you to elaborate the way you have done.  Give me in a few words, what are the words that more or less sum up your party's motto?  
A.	Providing -- all I can do is provide the information I have.  So if you want me to tell you, even the movement's founder has not yet explained it.  But if you want me to say it, the party, that is, the movement, envisaged a regime whereby the people would have their say, and the concept of democracy meant that there was a need to install popular power.  You've asked me to elaborate, and that is what I can say in answer to your question. 
Q.	So, Witness UB, let me give you the party's motto, even though I am not a member of the MRND.  The party is "peace, unity and development", three words that did not require the elaboration you have gone into.  Can you tell me how recruitment was effected within the MRND -- into the ranks of the MRND, and the "R" stands for républicain, not "revolutionary".  
A.	Anybody who wanted to join the MRND would receive a membership card.  Party cadres in the cellule and secteur were the grassroots militants.  And anyone joining the party would receive a member's card for the party. 
Q.	Witness UB, should I therefore understand that recruitment was not done along ethnic lines? 
A.	At the time ethnicity was not an issue.  You were given a card if you agreed to join the MRND, and there was no mention of one's ethnicity on the party's membership card. 
Q.	Let me ask you a question on the situation.  In terms of ethnicity before the MRND was created, that is, I want to discuss the time when the MRND was a single party.  I'd like to ask you, were the ethnic groups living harmoniously when the MRND was the sole party?  
A.	At the time of the single party regime, everyone was a member of the same party, living in harmony.  Both Hutus and Tutsis were members of the MRND, as envisaged by the law in force. 
Q.	When did this harmony begin to crumble?  
A.	It started with the attack launched by the RPF. 
Q.	What attack do you mean?  
A.	I mean the attack launched in 1990. 
Q.	In October 1990, you mean?  
A.	Yes, it is October 1990. 
Q.	Witness UB, tell us why exactly did the RPF attack, disorganise the relations between the ethnic groups? 
A.	I cannot say why.  I do not know why the RPF attacked.  That is a question that the leadership of the country at the time could answer.  All I know is that when the RPF attacked, we began to note differences between the Hutus and Tutsis.  I cannot say anything about the attacks by the RPF.  I am an ordinary citizen and, therefore, cannot tell you why the Tutsis were persecuted following the RPF attack.  Even though I was a leader at the grassroots level, I am not able to tell you why the RPF launched the attack.  And then we noticed that Hutus and Tutsis were no longer living in harmony, but this was based on the assertion that it was the Tutsis attacking the country.  

When one said "RPF", one meant Inyenzi.  I'm able to tell you of the effect, but I cannot tell you about the sequence of all these events.  All I can tell you -- all I can do is report on my observations.  I apologise, Counsel, if my answers are not satisfactory. 
Q.	Witness, you are on the right track.  Please go on this way.  Can you tell me what is the RPF's social basis? 
A.	The RPF attacked from Rwanda.  I was not living in those areas.  I'm not able to tell you the social basis.  If I knew, I would explain it, but I am not really able to explain to the Court the sequence of all these events.  I'm not able to give an adequate answer to the Court.  
Q.	Witness UB, the term "Inyenzi", does it not point to the Tutsi ethnic group? 
A.	That is correct.  The word does point to the Tutsi as an ethnic group. 
Q.	There you have it.  That is the social basis, Witness.  
A.	I know that it was said the Inyenzi had attacked the country from a neighbouring country, but as for the reasons that led to the attack, I'm not in a position to explain.  You say Inyenzi points to the Tutsis.  Well, I think it is the Tutsis from the exterior, not the ones within the country who should account for this.  The ones within the country had nothing to do with it.  So if that is what you mean by the social basis, the people inside the country should not have been persecuted for it.  It is the Tutsis from outside the country who were answerable.  That is my opinion. 
Q.	Witness UB, I'm not asking you to give me the reasons for the RPF invasion.  We are discussing the social basis.  Can we agree that it is the Tutsis?  
A.	Counsel, you ought to remember that at the time of the attack, the RPF included Hutus and Tutsis.  So there were Hutus within their ranks, but it is the Tutsis that paid for it. 
Q.	Witness UB, are you saying that the RPF had as many Hutus as Tutsis?  
A.	I did not take account and therefore would not be able to say how many Hutus and Tutsis were in their ranks.  All I know is that at the time of the attack, the RPF leadership included Hutus, and we saw them.  We were told about this by the programmes -- or through the programmes and releases that were broadcast.  So that is what makes me say that when the RPF attacked, there were Hutus and Tutsis alike in its ranks, but I'm not able to tell you what was the percentage of Hutus and Tutsis at the time of the RPF's attack. 
Q.	Witness UB, the term "Inyenzi", do you know what it means?  
A.	I have heard the word and heard of it.  It is a small insect, cockroach, which in Kinyarwanda is inyenzi.  Otherwise, I do not know what other meanings it could carry.  I know that there is an insect that is known as inyenzi, and that was a name ascribed to the attackers, as the Inyenzi attacked. 
Q.	Witness UB, I'm going to put another definition of inyenzi to you.  Inyenzi is a coded name for the RPF which means, in Kinyarwanda, Ingangurarugo, written I-N-G-A-N-G-U-R-A-R-U-G-O, yiyemege, Y-I-Y-E-M-E-G-E, kuba, K-U-B-A, ingenzi, I-N-G-E-N-Z-I, which could be translated as, "Combatants in Ingangurarugo militia, which militia, in the history of Rwanda had as its motto that they were the best and one of the most feared militias of the King Rwabugiri.  That is the definition I am putting to you.  Now, what do you say to that?  
A.	Well, thank you for that explanation which I didn't know of.  I did not have the opportunity of studying history.  I cannot confirm that.  It is quite the first time I've heard that explanation.  If perhaps I had been taught history, I'd know that because I wasn't yet born under King Rwabugire  But if that's what you've been taught and you are passing on the information, I don't know, so I can't really comment on something I don't know.  You know that; I didn't.  And you can't ask me to take it at face value.  You just informed me, and if someone else whom I might consider to be independent explained the thing to me, I'd understand.  But I do understand that it's your explanation and I must say I didn't know of the explanation you have just given us as to the meaning of the term "Inyenzi".  
Q.	Thank you, Witness UB.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I should like to suggest to you that we can adjourn the proceedings for now and continue tomorrow morning, and I think that with what I have left before me, we'd finish within an hour tomorrow morning.  In other words, it's a way of telling Mr. Morley to make his arrangements so as not to be surprised. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Witness, we take the adjournment now.  We resume tomorrow morning at the usual times.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you in turn, sir.  
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
