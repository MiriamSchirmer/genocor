MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  Could the registry introduce the matter coming before this Trial Chamber this morning?
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday the 2nd of April 2003, in order to consider two motions and thereafter to continue with the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  

The two motions are as follows:  
	1.  Motion for extension of time within which to file Prosecutor's Notice to challenge the proposed expert report by a Defence witness, Professor François X. Bangamwabo, Pursuant to Rules 54 and 94bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, motion dated 26th of March 2003 and filed on the 27th of March 2003.  

2. Requête en extrême urgence: Opposition de la Defense de M. Juvénal Kajelijeli â la Requête du Procureur "Motion for Extension of Time within which to file Prosecutor's Notice to challenge the proposed expert report by Professor François Xavier Bangamwabo, pursuant to Rule 54 and 94bis (I) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence", motion dated 30th of March 2003 and filed on 31st March 2003.

I am most obliged, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
May we have the appearance of the parties, starting with the Prosecution if we may?  
MS. OJEMENI:
With due respect, Your Honour, Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial attorney; Dorothée Marotine, case manager; Dennis Mabura, case manager, and Hayat Mohamed, legal officer for the Office of the Prosecutor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, learned counsel.

Next.  Can we also have the appearance for the Defence please, for the record?
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Lennox Hinds representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor Bompaka, Ms. Juliette Chinaud, research assistant and Emilien Dusabe, who is the translator interpreter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  

Yes.  Let's be clear as to how we proceed.  There are a number of motions.  There is one by the Prosecution for a  request for an extension of time, and there is another motion for challenging, as it were, the --
MS. OJEMENI:
As to that report, Your Honour, and calling the witness as an expert. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- yes, as an expert.  And then we have responses from the Defence.  I think they address the same two issues.  Is that correct, MR. HINDS, learned counsel for the Defence?
MR. HINDS:
Yes.  I think that is true, Your Honour, and we were speaking to the registry about this yesterday, because I think that the Court has correctly characterised what we are doing this morning.  One deals with the Prosecutor's application for filing a challenge on the merits of the expert, because they are out of time with respect to 14 days, and then the Court will deal with that and then we will move to the merits of the arguments.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We were proposing we deal with these things in this way.  Without prejudice, we will deal with the application of the Prosecution, hear the response by the Defence on the Prosecution's application for extension of time, but at the time, because of the time constraints, we will deal with the second motion as well, and hear both parties on that, and then the Trial Chamber will deliberate on all those motions and decide.  Do we understand one another?
MR. HINDS:
That is all right with the Defence, Your Honour.  We have no quarrel with this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So Counsel, you can introduce your first motion, we get the response and the submission of the Defence in response, and then your concluding remarks and then we move on to the next motion.  

We wish to point out that we have seen the pleadings.  So you may need to address issues that you want to specifically ventilate before the Trial Chamber.  Maybe for the Defence, when responding, we would appreciate if some of the elements that have been stipulated in the responses are touched on by sort of -- closely because to some of us, they are in French.  But if it can be done briefly, it would help us to speed up matters.  

Yes, learned counsel for the Prosecution, Ms. Ojemeni.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Our motion for extension of time is brought under Order  -- I mean Rule 54 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and is dated 26th March 2000 (sic).  

Your Honour, we have set out four paragraphs and we submitted our reasons for the late filing.  The issue here is that of timeliness of the motion, and the substance of this motion is as it were, whatever consequences that the Defence might suffer the Prosecutor submits that this motion is not prejudicial to the Defence.  It is not prejudicial to the Defence because the consequences that the Defence will suffer if this motion is admitted, is just the deprivation of the  free right to put in the view of an ordinary person who is not an expert in the field that he professes to specialise in.  

The reason for this motion is simply that the reorganisation in the Office of the Prosecutor which has temporarily -- which created a temporary lack of resources in the team to attend to this matter while I was on mission, and the motion is in the interests of justice.  It is in the interests of justice because, what is justice?  Justice is the truth.  The truth of this motion is that Professor François Bangamwabo states that he is an expert, whilst he is not an expert.  

From the findings of the Prosecutor, we have been able to establish that he is not an expert.  All the Defence needs to do in this matter is to show that the Defence witness, Professor Bangamwabo, is an expert.  The reason that the Defence has stated for refusing our motion or opposing our motion is that we did not file the motion in time -- on time rather, which is a technical issue.  And if the motion is not admitted, justice will not be served.  The issue of an expert -- the notion of an expert suggests somebody who is specialised in the area that he is talking or discussing on.  

The Prosecutor submits that from her finding, which is outlined in the motion attached to this motion for extension of time, which will also be elaborated in our oral argument in support of this motion to challenge the proposed report, and the calling of François Bangamwabo as an expert, show that he is not an expert as he has indicated to the Court in his report.  We therefore respectfully submit that our motion be admitted as it will serve the interests of justice.  

Secondly, as we have already demonstrated, the Defence will not be prejudiced if this motion is admitted, because justice is truth, and the truth of this matter is that the Defence is seeking to tender a report that contains the views of an ordinary person and not that of an expert.  The issues contained in the report are issues that are usually under the domain of a historian or a political analyst and not that of a linguist. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you come down to issues of the motion.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.  Your Honour, I am only using this part, I am not going into the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But come down to the issue of the expert
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am trying to illustrate the truth that we are seeking to bring to the attention of the Court.  For the reasons that I have stated, the Prosecutor submits that her motion be admitted.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.  Thank you, learned counsel.  

Yes, learned counsel for the Defence.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The issue that we are dealing with here is a simple one.  We are not getting to the merits.  The issue is whether or not the Prosecutor in filing their request for an extension of time, whether the Prosecutor has set out sufficient reasons within the jurisprudence of this Tribunal, or with any jurisprudence that establishes just cause.  I mean, that is really what the issue is.  

The Prosecutor admits that they have filed their opposition to the notice of the Defence to produce an expert witness or the expert report, late.  There is no question about that.  The Rules under 94bis establish very clearly that the obligation of the Defence as to within 21 days prior to the date that the expert is scheduled to testify, that a full report be submitted.  

We complied, within certainly more than 21 days.  We submitted the report on the 10th, and that is uncontroverted.  The Rules under 94bis subsection B, set forth that within 14 days of the filing of the statement of the expert, the opposing party shall file a notice to the Trial Chamber indicating:  
	(1) whether they accept or (2) whether they wish to cross-examine the expert.  If they accept the expert, the Chamber may just simply admit the report without even calling the expert.  In this case, the opposing party, the Prosecutor's Office filed an opposition.  Their problem is, they filed it late.  

We contend that this late filing, especially at this stage of the proceedings, prejudices the Defendant because the Prosecutor, in filing the late notice, has not given the Defence a sufficient amount of time.  What we have is that they filed both the application for extension of time at the same time that they have filed the substantive motion challenging the same.  

We pointed out to the Court that this was done at a time when counsel for the Defence was travelling.  The Defendant was not served.  We are unable to do the necessary collaboration and get these inputs.  And the reason why the Rules were established setting forth the requirement, which was within 14 days the Prosecutor has to respond, so that everyone would have a sufficient amount of time in the interest of justice to deal with this matter.  The Prosecutor talks about interests of justice, but we have to look at whose interest is at play.  It is not just simply a question of everybody is on an equal plane here, because the stakes are different for Mr. Kajelijeli than with the Prosecutor.  It is like, if you see  a deer and lion running across the plain, running across the field, you can see two animals running, but the stakes are different.  

From the standpoint of the lion, he or she may be running for what?  For a meal.  If the deer gets away, what are the consequences?  The lion may be starving, but the lion has another chance to hunt for a meal.  The stake with respect to -- may I complete?  The stake with respect to the deer, is the loss of his life.  So when we talk of the interests of justice, we have to look at the individual stakes, prejudice.  

Why did the Prosecutor talk about prejudice?  The Prosecutor suggests that prejudice to the Defendant is that he would not be able to introduce evidence of an ordinary witness.  But that goes to their characterisation of this witness.  It is not for them to determine whether this person is an ordinary witness or not, or whether this witness, pursuant to the ruling in Prosecutor v. Akayesu has any special expertise that an ordinary person will not have or that would enable this Trial Chamber to analyse and determine issues in this case.  So it is not for them to determine this would be an ordinary witness; that is conclusionary.  

And so the issue at this point in terms of the interests of justice, we say, is that the late filing prejudices Mr. Kajelijeli.  The remedies, when we look at what the impact would be, is for the Trial Chamber to deny the motion and to simply because of the equities at play, allow Professor Bangamwabo to testify.  Now, is there any prejudice to the Prosecutor?  And when you look at all of the jurisprudence, everybody knows what expert testimony is all about.  Expert testimony even within Akayesu, is not sacrosanct.  An expert brings a special expertise with respect to subject matter.  

Under the Rules 94bis, if the Court rejects the extension of time, we deal with it as 94bis(b)(1), which means that factual statement is accepted when the expert testifies.  It does not mean that the Court accepts everything the expert says.  An expert does not walk around with a halo on his head.  The Court can in fact accept part, accept all, accept none.  The expert testimony is simply that testimony that is presented.  There is nothing halo about it.  He is a witness who brings like any other witness a particular point of view.  He is not a fact witness and so therefore, he brings in a speciality within a subject area, but the Court does not require --  

So what I am saying in terms of  balancing the equities, if the Court grants our opposition, the Prosecutor nor the opposing party is going to be prejudiced in terms of their case, because ultimately, the remedy is that the expert testifies, a report is admitted and the Court makes a determination with respect to it and other evidence that is adduced at the trial, and weighs it as it weighs other evidence.  

So at this particular point we are dealing with prejudice to Mr. Kajelijeli or prejudice to the government.  Mr. Kajelijeli, I gave you the example of the lion and the deer.  With Mr. Kajelijeli, it means that his evidence, whatever it is worth, it is not  -- it may not be admitted and on the contrary, if for example, we have the expert to testify, then the Court is to weigh that evidence with all others.  And  so, for those reasons, we believe that the equities outweigh -- the equities with respect to prejudice to Mr. Kajelijeli outweigh the Prosecutor's argument with respect to filing this late motion, and they have not given just cause. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Maqutu has a question to put to Defence counsel. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
MR. HINDS, I have looked at (C) of 94, which requires the Court to exercise some discretion.  If the Prosecution is the lion and Mr. Kajelijeli is the hare, what is this Chamber?
MR. HINDS:
Well, this Chamber makes the determination as to whether or not in terms of ultimate determination of the facts, that is, whether or not the hare is eaten or escapes and the lion has another opportunity for a meal.  The example that I gave relates to the decision that this Chamber makes in terms of the equities, what ultimately would happen.  If the Chamber come down on one side, we have one determination.  If the Chamber comes on the other side, we have another determination.  The Chamber ultimately makes the determination in terms of the equities of balancing the questions of prejudice and making a decision in the interests of justice.  And so, what I am talking about in terms of the equities, and in the interests of justice is determined upon in which side you are on.  So the Chamber makes the ultimate decision in this matter. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
I think you missed my point.  You see, whenever you come to this question of interests of justice, the Court has to have benefit of argument.  Now, if the Court, just unilaterally without the benefit of argument, reaches a decision, would you in your view feel the interests of justice have been served as they should? 
MR. HINDS:
I would hope.  I would hope.  We are just dealing now with the seminal motion dealing with extension of time.  The argument I am making at this stage is that, if there is a decision on one side, it has a certain impact.   The Prosecutor suggests and that was the only argument that I was making.  

The Prosecutor said in the interest of justice, the only prejudice that Mr. Kajelijeli would suffer is that not being able to introduce evidence of an ordinary witness. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Now you are dealing with these merits.
MR. HINDS:
No, I am not in the merits yet.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
I just want you to deal with the principle, the interests of justice that occur or a decision of a chamber that is delivered without the benefit of contrary argument.  That is my issue.
MR. HINDS:
Well, it is clear that where you have an arbitrary -- what you are suggesting perhaps is an arbitrary kind of decision.  A decision where you have no arguments, et cetera that are offered or in the case where an argument is offered, it is just simply summarily rejected.  We are not talking about the interests of justice, here we are talking about miscarriage of justice.  There is a difference. If we have a situation where a chamber just ipso facto without any benefit of any argument makes a decision based upon whatever factors are, we have a miscarriage of justice.  On the other hand, where you have a Chamber deliberating, weighing and balancing et cetera, et cetera.  I am pointing out or I am suggesting that that be taken into in consideration of all these factors is the balancing of the interests of the parties at stake as to whether or not that is, in fact, they are the same.    That the Chamber has to take that into consideration.  The Chamber must take into consideration, when we talk about arguments, what are the arguments and other parties in terms of the stakes involved; are the interests the same?  And that is the point that I am making with respect to the Chamber.  The Chamber is involved in making that decision, taking into consideration and balancing all of the interests at play.  Did I confuse or elaborate?  I am trying to make this point. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Well, you see, the way I see it, you are asking the Chamber to shoot itself in the foot by not getting the benefit of contrary argument deciding solely on yours, and that makes me uneasy because here we are saying the Chamber has to exercise a judgment, and it is a principle of justice that before you exercise a judgment, you should as much  as possible have heard the other side.  That is the point I really have been making.
MR. HINDS:
I agree with you totally on that, absolutely on that question.  But I didn't even think that that was an issue, and if it is in fact what I conveyed, that is not true.  I thought that we heard the Prosecutor, the Chamber heard her and heard her arguments.  I then am responding to her arguments and elaborating on the question of the balancing between the parties, and whether they stand on equal plane et cetera, for the Chamber ultimately to make the determination only on one issue now, as to (A) whether just cause was given and what is the remedy.  That is for the Chamber to decide.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Judge Maqutu.  

Are you through?  Thank you, learned counsel.  Any response?  Very briefly please, so that we can move on to the next motion.  We must come back to Witness FMB. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, we are addressing an expert, and an expert does not masquerade in a pseudonym.  I don't know if you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  I am talking about FMB is the witness who is on the stand, we want to come back to him.  Yes.  Any response?  
MS. OJEMENI:
None, Your Honour.  I am moving on to the next motion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Learned counsel for the Prosecutor, I just want to know.  You said your motion is based on Rule what?
MS. OJEMENI:
Fifty-four.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I suppose Rule 94bis as well. 
MS. OJEMENI:
And 94bis, Your Honour.  We are requesting --
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you look at Rule 94bis(B), there are a number of scenarios.  If it accept the expert witness statement or to -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
Cross-examine -- we would rather cross-examine, Your Honour, that is more or less what we are saying; we will cross-examine him.  If his report is admitted, we will cross-examine him on that.  Otherwise, what in essence our motion, the second motion is saying that he is not qualified in any way to be called an expert, and we stated our reasons for that and that the report itself should be rejected because it doesn't -- it is a report on expert opinion.  It doesn't represent an opinion of an expert in the light of decided cases and even the meaning of the word, an expert. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And if he were to testify, because we are dealing with two issues here, what happens?
MS. OJEMENI:
Testify as a factual witness. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no. We are not addressing -- I am still addressing Rule 94bis.
MS. OJEMENI:
If he testifies, we will cross-examine him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that your prayer?
MS. OJEMENI:
It is not our prayer anyway.  It is not our prayer, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it what you are asking the Chamber to consider?  
MS. OJEMENI:
It is not what we are asking the Chamber to consider, because he is not even an expert.  Yes.  That is our prayer.  Your Honour, I am sorry.  That is our prayer.  We are rejecting the report as an expert report, and we will cross-examine him on that, if admitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can we move to the next motion.  We have seen the Prosecution's argument, all of us, of course, except for Judge Ramaroson, they are in English, but you can ventilate the issues briefly.  And for the Defence, the submissions are in French and if you can also ventilate, we would like to know salient aspect of these arguments.  But please try to be as brief as possible so that you can come to the testimony of this witness who is on the stand.
MS. OJEMENI:
Very well, Your Honour.  Our motion is brought under Rule 54, 94, Rule 89(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  In addition, orally, Rule 89(C) on relevance.  In support of our motion, we set out 11 paragraphs and I would attempt to address the Court briefly on each one of the paragraphs, and the motion is dated 26th day of March 2000 (sic). 

Your Honour, our first point is that Professor François Bangamwabo is not an expert, does not qualify as an expert.  What is an expert?  The Black Law Dictionary defines expert as one who by reason of education or specialised experience, possesses superior knowledge with respect to a subject about which person having no particular training  are incapable of forming an accurate opinion, or deducing correct conclusions, or one possessing with reference to a particular subject knowledge not acquired by  ordinary person.  How does one determine that an expert -- that a person is an expert?  The notion expert is limiting in scope.  An expert specialises in an area.  The mere fact that one has knowledge of a subject that he is discussing does not qualify him to be an expert.  

We have looked at the CV of Professor Bangamwabo and there is no where in his CV that he would be able to determine that he is specialised in the area that is he is talking about or discussing in his report.  The report itself is 58 pages.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it 58? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, it is 58 pages. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mine has -- the draft in English, I don't have the --
MS. OJEMENI:
That is the French.  I am referring to the French.  I don't speak French, but this time I will attempt to do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The English text draft is 58, I don't know.
MS. OJEMENI:
It is 58 pages, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In French?
MS. OJEMENI:
In French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
I crave you indulgence, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Take your time. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am sorry.  97 per cent of this report deals on historical context and politics in Rwanda.  The Defence witness Professor Bangamwabo is a linguist by profession.  And looking at his CV, a closer look at the CV shows that there is nowhere, no place where he has indicated his speciality in historical matters or politics.  In his response he last stated, and I draw your attention to the relevant paragraph.  Your Honour, I will move on.  If I find it, I will refer you to it.  It is stated that he is a linguist -- a social linguist and he is versed in political matters.  

Your Honours, please may I crave your indulgence for two minutes.  May I?  In response to the Defence motion --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document are you referring to?  

MS. OJEMENI:
The Defence response to the Prosecutor's notice to challenge the proposed expert report and is dated 1st April 2000.  I am reading paragraph 7(A) which I translated is in French, but I translated.  It reads -- it says that FAB which is François Bangamwabo is a specialist in linguist, which is a vast domain.  He can talk about terms like -- terms used by the Prosecutor, (B) the understanding of these terms requires a historical and political approach in a country like Rwanda where several ethnic groups lived.  Each group has its own understanding of the term used.  One cannot talk about linguistics without looking at the political and historical aspect, and that that is the issue I am addressing now.

In paragraph 6 of our motion, we state that the professor is relying on a book that he wrote, he 
co-authored, and one could see that from the title of his report.  His report is titled "Inter-Ethnic Relations in Rwanda, The Armed Conflict of October 1990", the multiparty system and implications on events of which the content is dominated -- oh, sorry.  The content of the report is dominated by historical and political matters in Rwanda up to 1991, which was the year the book was written.  From the report -- from this book, from the introductory part of the book, it is stated that it is a collective work of writers and that each writer wrote his own article in a chapter or two independently.  Professor Bangamwabo wrote, participated in the writing of one chapter, and this chapter he wrote in collaboration with another person, and that chapter falls squarely on his profession as a linguist, and the chapter in that book is about five per cent of  the book.  The book is about 352 pages, and his own page is about five per cent of the 352 pages of the book.  

The introductory part more or less defined or described each contribution of the author in that book, and the book itself is a book that contains -- the majority of the book is his own -- is on history and politics in Rwanda.  And the historical part and the politics were written by people who are historians.  Professor Bangamwabo does not possess the requisite expertise in writing on issues of historical and political matters.  I concede to the fact that he is a linguist, and as a linguist he is versed in that area.  A linguist, of course, is knowledgeable in any -- he could be knowledgeable on any matter that touches on language.  Language itself is contextual in its nature, and it relates to society, community; it is a language spoken by a community, people, but then, that does not mean that as a linguist he is also a historian.  It is like a general doctor who knows virtually everything about parts of a body like the teeth, for instance.  But when it comes to the actual case of dentistry or that is of dental nature, he refers the patient to a dentist because it is not his field.  

I am lawyer, I am knowledgeable in medicine, I treat myself at times, but that doesn't make me a doctor.  A doctor has his own field.  I as a lawyer, I have my own field.  He is a linguist, and as a linguist, he has claimed that he is a social linguist, I don't know what that means, it might be another area in linguistics.  He cannot also claim that there could be another area in linguistics that he can't claim to be a specialist.  The term expert has also been defined in the jurisprudence of this Tribunal.  And I refer Your Honours to the case of Akayesu, which my learned friend mentioned in his submission in respect of the first motion.  

In Akayesu, the Tribunal held that an expert witness is intended to enlighten the Judges on specific issues of a technical nature requiring special knowledge in a specific field.  

We submit, Your Honour, that Professor Bangamwabo is a linguist and not a historian or political analyst that he has purported to be in his report.    

Your Honour, moving quickly to the next issue -- an expert is not partial.  An expert comes to the Court as a witness for both the Court and the parties.  I refer once more to the case that I have just brought to the attention of the Court, which is a case on a decision of a Defence motion for the appearance of an accused as an expert witness.  The case is The Prosecutor v. Akayesu,
ICTR-96-4-T, 1998.  The conditions for the requisite conditions for admitting are articulated in this case.  And a recognised expert in his field is not partial, it is one of the conditions  that he is not partial.

Your Honour, we demonstrate to you that Professor Bangamwabo is partial in his report, and to buttress this fact, Your Honour, I draw your attention to page 52.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In French or in which language?  
MS. OJEMENI:
In French, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have an idea what would be the corresponding page in English?  If you do, you can indicate.  If not, don't worry.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I got the English translation just last night.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  All right, we will find it.
MR. HINDS:
If she just gives us the subject area, so we will be able to find it in English.
MS. OJEMENI:
On page 2, he talks about political context. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page?
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 2. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought we heard you say page 52.
MS. OJEMENI:
Sorry, page 52, Your Honours.  It talks about the political context within -- I am talking about Interahamwe, the description of Interahamwe, Your Honour.  He is a bit restrictive in the meaning of someone, which as a linguist and an expert coming to discuss the issue or to testify before this Tribunal; he is not supposed to do.  He limited the discussion of Interahamwe, Inyenzi, to the deep history of the word, the meaning, dictionary meaning of the word, and does not interpret the words the way the words were being used in 1993/1994 and upward.  Words in themselves are not  static.  Words change over time, and it is common knowledge that certain words when referred to an individual or referred in the context, once again, the meaning of the words are inferred in the context that they are used.  And if a child in Rwanda now hears the word Inyenzi, or Inkotanyi, for instance, the child knows the meaning.  This dictionary meaning that the Professor used in the report for these words are basically -- is based on dictionary meaning of -- the dictionary printed in 1986, the Kinyarwanda-French dictionary printed in 1986.  Does that mean that the word Inyenzi as described in that dictionary 1986 is the same as today?  No.  

Your Honour, the professor -- to demonstrate also that the professor was partial in his report, I refer   Your Honours to the page where he mentioned -- when he was making reference to statistical data.  He is a bit economic with the truth.  On page 10 of the French, he referred to areas where Tutsis were more favoured by the Belgians, and he is trying to show that Hutus were deprived of education in 1966.  He is using data for 1966, which is outside the temporal jurisdiction of this Court.  And even if he is using this data, he should able to contrast it with the situation in 1993 and 1994, for instance.  He merely shows here that Hutus -- mentioned the population, mentioned the ratio of the students in primary school and secondary school, to show that Hutus were deprived of education in 1966, but it does not show what the situation was in 1994.  We find testimonies in this Court in respect of that.  

We move on to where he also used a statistical data to show that Hutus were killed by Tutsis.  On page 20 of the same French document, he mentioned -- he referred to February 1993 when Hutus that died, the victims were up to 40,000.  He does not mention the number of Tutsis killed in 1994, which is relevant to this Court.  And in any event, the number of Hutus he mentioned that were killed on the 23rd of February 1993, he does not put his source.  

In this report he also made reference to areas that are not relevant to the case, to Kajelijeli' case.  The indictment is very clear on what case the Prosecutor has presented to the Court.  And in his report, one would expect that at least he would address the issues that are in the indictment.  For instance, he talked about historical origin of Rwanda, and the historical matters covered virtually all the topics referred to in his report.  And he dwelt on the parties, issues like the historical background, the impact of the arms conflict, multiparty politics which are not dwelt on in the indictment.  The indictment itself touched on the party, multiparty system just to explain how that developed, and it was just one paragraph and no reference to the origin of the myth of Gahinga, this has no reference to this case, which is on page 1.  

He went on to discuss -- and even on this particular issue, one would expect that at least he would mention the reference  -- evidence at least to elaborate on the myth.  This is not an evidence before this Tribunal.  The case of Kajelijeli is very clear.  The issues for the charges are very clear.  The charges have no bearing with the myth of Ganga (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is that?  Gahinga. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Gahinga, excuse my pronunciation, Your Honours.  He also touched on the issue of the plane crash in his report. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.
MS. OJEMENI:
The plane crash of President Habyarimana.  There is established evidence in this Court that is not in this Tribunal, that such matters are not relevant to the issues before the Tribunal.  

Finally, Your Honour --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where is the plane crash discussed?  You are using a French text.

Go on. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Finally, Your Honour, the Prosecutor submits (1) that the report -- most of the portions of the report is not relevant and the evidence is not admissible.  

Professor Bangamwabo has distorted the facts that he represented in his report.  As I have just demonstrated, his report is more or less -- in his report he chooses areas that favours his case or advances the Defence case, rather than educating the Court on issues that are beyond the knowledge of the Chamber or the parties.  He is more or less trying to favour the Defence case, not being partial, which is expected or a requirement of an expert.  
Secondly, Professor Bangamwabo cannot in any way be qualified as an expert on the issues that he spoke about in his report.  His report -- the area that falls under his speciality are just three per cent, are within three per cent of the report.  And as I have demonstrated, he is not even giving a fair definition of these words.  For instance, the Inyenzi, the Interahamwe, the Inkotanyi.  He merely gives the historical context of the words, and then went on to define the words defined in the 1986 dictionary without actually bringing out the meaning or presenting the meaning of these words as were used in the period within the temporal jurisdiction of this Court.  Words in themselves evolve over time, and words are not static.  One should expect a linguist to educate the Court on how these words got to the meaning that they were ascribed to in 1994.  

It is common knowledge that as a linguist, he is versed in his area.  He cannot allocate himself the qualities that he does not possess.  He is not a historian, he is not qualified to speak on the issues that he has raised in his report.  He is only a political analyst.  And for these reasons, we urge
Your Honours to disqualify Professor Bangamwabo as an expert to speak on the issues that he does not possess the qualification -- the necessary qualifications.  He is not an expert.  His report is full of partiality, there is irrelevant matters that are not within -- that are not related in this case before Your Honours.  

For these reasons we urge you to disqualify him and deny him his report. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have the citation of the two decisions in Akayesu?
MS. OJEMENI:
The citation of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The two decisions you have referred to  Akayesu.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, I gave you that.  It is ICTR-96-4-T.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Date?
MS. OJEMENI:
 1998. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In 1998.  Thank you, learned counsel.  

Any response from the Defence, please?
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  We have in response submitted a certification supported by an affidavit by Professor Bangamwabo.  I don't know if the Court has received that, the affidavit is English.  And so I don't -- I suppose for the benefit of Judge Ramaroson, I am going to give the sum and substance of that without -- the sum and substance of that without just going into too much detail, but since the Court has the affidavit of the professor --  

We do not take issue with the Prosecutor's citing of jurisprudence of this Tribunal concerning this scope and definition of an expert witness.  As set out in Prosecutor v. Akayesu, Case No.  ICTR-96-14-T, March 1998, and as reflected in the decision of the Ferdinand Nahimana, Jean-Basco Barayagwiza and Hassan Ngeze in Case No. ICTR-99-52-T, which was a decision that was handed on January 24th of this year.  So, there is no dispute that, according to those cases, the testimony intended -- the testimony of an expert is intended to enlighten the judges on specific issues of a technical nature requiring special knowledge in a specific field.  

We contend and we think that the submission that we have submitted attests to Professor Bangamwabo's expertise in this area.  The Prosecutor in their moving papers essentially argued that our expert did not, in the report, did not in fact demonstrate his expertise in that he commented on subjects that were of a historical nature and political nature, and that he was a social linguist, and therefore, the commentary that he had in the report was outside the scope of his expertise.  

We take the position that the Prosecutor's assessment of his expertise is misinformed concerning what is social linguist.  And Professor Bangamwabo indicated that -- Bangamwabo has indicated in his affidavit the scope of his expertise.  

He furthermore points out that in order to deal with terms that this Tribunal has heard over and over again, even most recently, from the witness yesterday MLNA, the terms of Interahamwe, Inkotanyi, Inyenzi, Inkotanyi-Inyenzi.  Those are terms that had been given a particular interpretation by the Prosecution.  They are terms that cannot be discussed except within and their meanings except within the context.  And what is the context?  The context is a conjunction of where or intersection between the political events that inform those terms being used.  And the historical context in which this is done.  The social linguist does not proceed with blinders on.  He is given analysis and part of the commentary is based upon the historical events.  The trial that we are engaged in has a political context.  The question of Interahamwe as it relates to multiparties, you cannot in fact, separate that.  Who are the Interahamwe?  The Prosecution takes the position that the Interahamwe were a militant or a youth wing who were like a militia of the MRND, and they actually were like a killing machine involved in the massacre.  That is their theory, and they have, through their witnesses, asked for definitions of Interahamwe.  Professor Bangamwabo certainly can provide a different perspective -- a broader perspective, a perspective that would be helpful to this Tribunal because it is a perspective that is informed by the years of research that he has done, and informed by his specialisation with respect to the use of language and the derivative terms are flowing from them and meanings.  

Inkotanyi, its history, where that originated, what does it mean?  Again it has to be dealt with within the political and historical context.  It flows from not only history in the abstract, but as it relates to the particular events in Rwanda.  The Prosecutor cites the fact that there were statistical data relating to 1956, concerning disparities.  

Well, Professor Bangamwabo -- yes, talks about that, but the Prosecutor simply did not read further in the report nor make what is the obvious connection.  56, conditions of 56 relates to conditions of 59.  What is 59?  He talks about 59 of a situation where there was a change that occurred as a result of those particular situations. 
	(Pages 1 to 17 by Sithembiso Moyo)
























	1030H 
	So therefore, that has to be discussed.  The Prosecutor went further and said that Professor Bangamwabo only used a publication of 1990 as the basis for his authority.  That is -- that is partly true, but the Prosecutor went further and said that his contribution was limited and she cited, for example, what she said was page -- at page 9 of that publication, the publication dealt with inter-ethnic relationships in Rwanda and the attacks or aggression of 1990, implications thereof.  In the general introduction, she suggests that the authors -- said that each author worked independently.  There's nothing like that, that was said in the introduction at page 9.  What was said is that the study had been prepared by a multidisciplinary team of experienced professors/teachers.  Each professor has been the principal, not exclusive, principal editor of one or two chapters.  Nevertheless, the general introduction, the conclusions and recommendations were undertaken collectively. 

In the preceding chapter, preceding paragraph, it is said:  "This is the fruit of research and reflection of a team that have the pleasure to present this particular work."  It's a team effort, collaboration.  And Professor Bangamwabo pointed out in his affidavit, the collaborative efforts between him and his colleagues in preparing this work, that he, in fact, brought the perspective of a social linguist to many of the issues that were being discussed.  And he specifically pointed out with respect to some of the historical perspective; he laid out how he collaborated and where he was able to derive his conclusions as reflected in the report. 

Now, the Prosecutor cited, in particular, certain portions of the report in which she said that a -- the question of relevance.  She wondered what was the relevance of certain portions of the report, and in others she cited with respect to what she characterised as a bias. 

We are dealing with events that took place, certainly in 1994, that we contend has a historical root.  The Prosecution contends that these events were planned, there was a conspiracy within the meaning of -- genocide to destroy in whole or in part, a particular group.  That is what they contend.  We challenge that position.  Throughout our Defence we have laid out, through the mouths of our witnesses, that massacres occurred.  There is no question about that.  Whether or not they were part of planning, whether they were carried out by a group called Interahamwe, whether it was as a result of the death of the president as perceived through the eyes of those people who heard the news and reacted, whether it was a reaction to that, is something for this Trial Chamber to determine ultimately.  But certainly, we have a different view of the events that took place. 

Professor Bangamwabo is not a fact witness.  He is not talking about any facts that took place, or any events, that took place, in Ruhengeri or Mukingo or any of that, but he talks about the attitude, the values that people had at that time.  I, reading his report, I had no idea of what Gihanga meant.  What is Gihanga?  But in terms of the Rwandan context, he brings an analysis that we think is unique.  He brings it, not from the standpoint of a historian, but he brings it from the standpoint of a socio linguist, and which the Court may find useful with respect to looking at events and attitudes of witnesses who have come forward and testified as they did, the attitudes that reflect the social norms and mores of the society in 1994 and prior to that.  The three sons of Gihanga as he talks about.  These sons are Gatwa, Gahutu and Gatutsi.  In other contexts, we hear of the sons of Ham.  These are concepts that have a social historical context that may be illuminating in terms of the attitudes and values that, in fact, have been accepted within the norms and mores of the society.  And so the relevance of this reflects the inter-ethnic relationships and attitudes that we see have unfolded for us in events of 1994.

The Prosecutor, in her oral submissions, says that Professor Bangamwabo failed to -- or gave a biased view of Interahamwe.  She cites by that his definition, and she said that he did not interpret words as they had evolved over a period of time and he simply gave the dictionary definition.  That certainly is maybe her opinion.  Certainly, the witness may be cross-examined on this issue.  He maybe cross-examined on whether or not they were definitions he omitted or interpretations, etc, but that does not go to the issue of bias. 

She suggests that he used statistical data where Tutsis were favoured by the Belgians in 1956.  But as I said before, that data that he gave then, if she had read further, dealt with what were the events laid on, but he had given other data to explain disparate treatment with respect to one group at the hands of another.  She suggested that the statistical data showing deaths of Hutus killed in February of 1993 may not have been accurate or that he didn't cite sources for those.  But those are issues that don't go to his competence to give information.  It goes to the issue of whether or not there were authoritative sources, any sources, what is the basis of his arriving at this information, etc, which doesn't go to the competence issue. 

She talks about issues not relevant to the indictment.  All of the issues here are relevant to the indictment.  She talks about the death of the president.  We are not introducing evidence with respect to, as was attempted in other cases, to show who killed the president, etc.  Trial Chambers in other cases which were faced with that decision have in fact ruled who killed the president etc, ultimately, is not a question that they determine for the Tribunal.  We haven't raised that issue.  But out of the mouths of witnesses that -- called by the Prosecutor, called by the Defence, witnesses have testified that they heard of the death of the president at a certain time and they talked about the attitude of the population relating to that event.  We, the Defence and the Prosecution, have completely different approaches to what ensued.  They say it was part of after overall plan and conspiracy; we say that what occurred was spontaneous.  That is the difference. So he talks about the death of the president in a context of events that occurred.  That does not go to his competence.

And so, Your Honour, I am not going to go over all of what has been in the affidavit.  He has laid out the courses that he has, in fact, not only taught, but courses he has taken.  He has laid out his particular collaboration with his colleagues with respect to the publication.  He has laid out the intersections between the publication and his report.  And so, I am just at this point submitting, based upon the papers that are presented, in addition to my oral presentation, without taking the time to go through all of those  --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- or taking the time to go through excerpts of his report, which is in English now, and I had to struggle through it because it was in French, but we now have the official copy in English.  Just dealing with the pages, the report is 82 pages of which five contain references, etc.  So therefore, we are talking about 77 pages and with respect to those 77 pages, the section dealing with the use of terms and words etc are eight pages -- right.  I don't know what the Prosecutor's arithmetic is, but certainly out of 70, eight is not 3 per cent, but that is of no major consequence in any event.  The point is that in terms of socio linguistics there is one section dealing with that.  He deals with other areas within the report which are all relevant in this case, and he should be heard because he has a particular expertise within the meaning of Nahimana and Akeyesu, which this Court should benefit from. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned Counsel.  And the response. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Briefly, Your Honour.  My learned friend  in his submission posed the question, what is Gahinga.  Your Honour that is the issue.  Reading the report, one cannot really grasp the purpose or the objective of that report.  The expert, the Professor Bangamwabo, claims to be an expert, and as an expert he must be perceived by others according to his -- the objective of his report or his -- as an expert.  There is no purpose -- you cannot deduce the purpose of that report in -- while reading it. 

Professor Bangamwabo is not competent to testify as an expert before this International Tribunal.  He has not testified -- there is no previous record of his testimony as an expert before any national court or any international court.  If he has -- if he has done so before, he should have exhibited it in his affidavit, which he has not.  To the best of the Prosecutor's knowledge he has only testified in this Tribunal as a Defence witness in the media case, and his report contains his view that he expressed in that Court, which is favourable to the Defence. 

My learned friend also touched on the issue of Interahamwe.  Interahamwe should be viewed or analysed by an expert in the historical or political sense.  Words -- meanings of words at times ascribed to them in the newspapers or from their description in newspapers or media, for instance, there are abundant evidence to show how these words  Interahamwe, Inyenzi, Inkotanyi were used in 1994.  We cannot accept Defence view on that, neither will the Court accept Defence view on that.  We have to -- they have to present their case.  The Court will come to that determination later.  But if we have an expert who is supposed to be a witness for both the Court and the parties, he cannot be seen to be putting across the view of the Defence.  The view of the Defence can be correct; there's no doubt about that, but he has to present it as an expert. 

For instance, the issue of the plane -- Your Honour, that you asked me, the plane crash.  I refer Your Honours to page 44 of the French version and page 61 of the English version. 

Your Honours, the witness is not competent.  In conclusion, the witness is not competent to be an expert in this case.  He has partial -- an expert does not need to be partial.  The report contains irrelevancies to this -- on matters that are not relevant to this case.  And we submit, Your Honours, that the expert report should be denied. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned Counsel.  Yes.  We will deliberate on these two motions and we will continue with the testimony of witness FMB, who is on the stand, and we will see how we proceed from there.  We have just received the English version of the report and we will try as much as possible to deal with this issue in the most expeditious manner.  But we will continue with this witness up to the end and then see how far from there we will be able to move, but we will try as much as possible to deal with these motions because it has a bearing on the course of our work, and see to it that they are resolved as soon as possible. 

In order not to -- we will take a break now, so that when the, when we come to continue with the witness, we will continue, go on with his testimony without interruption. 

Registry, can you tell the witness protection that we intend, when we come back, to continue with the witness up to lunch time. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
We shall do so, My Lord. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will adjourn these proceedings to 10 -- 10 past 11, 10 past 11, about 20 minutes.

Could you please advise the witness accordingly, as well.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1050 to 1117H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed, and we get back to Witness FMB.

Witness FMB, the Trial Chamber reminds you of the solemn declaration you made yesterday, and you continue with your testimony today on that same solemn declaration.  All right. 

Yes, Professor Hinds. 
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  May we proceed?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We were dealing with the map when we adjourned.
WITNESS FMB
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness FMB, I want to remind you that we are now in open session, and I would like you to be very careful with respect to anything that you may say.  If you think any answer that you would give may reveal your identity, then you would ask the Trial Chamber for some instructions on how to proceed, and the President of the Tribunal will advise you accordingly.  Do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I understand.
MR. HINDS:
Registry, could you help us by putting the chart up on the overhead projector, please?  The map, really.  Could we have -- that does not -- could we have the original rather than the copies?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now Witness, while we have been focusing on Kinigi, can you tell the Tribunal whether there were other communes in Ruhengeri that were part of the demilitarised zone?
A.	Yes, I can show that on the map.
Q.	Yes, the registry will guide you on how to proceed from there?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ready, registry?  Yes.  You can move witness.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, using the map, and you can unfold it as you wish, to display what other areas you want to display.  Can you tell the Tribunal what other communes in Ruhengeri were part of the demilitarised zone after February of 1993?
A.	After February 1993 Kinigi, Nkumba, Kidaho communes -- let me start all over again, Kinigi, commune, Nkumba -- and I will come back to Nkumba in a moment -- and Kidaho.
Q.	Is Kidaho on the map?  Just show us each of the communities that you are mentioning; just show it to us because we'd like to see the relationship between the communes, where the demilitarised zone was established.
A.	Yes, let me start all over again.  There is the Kinigi commune, there is Nkumba, and I did say that I was going to come back to Nkumba, then there is Kidaho.  There is a small portion of Ruhondo commune, a portion of Cyeru commune.  There is a small -- a portion of Cyeru commune and a section of Nyamugali commune.  So if I should go over,  there is a portion of Nyamugali commune, a portion of Cyeru commune, a portion of Ruhondo commune, that is  Ruhondo, then Nkumba commune, which I will come back. Then the entire Kidaho commune and the entire Kinigi commune.
Q.	Now, you said you will come back to Nkumba, what do you want to tell us about Nkumba?
A.	The additional information I want to give on Nkumba is that when the decision was taken to create a buffer zone, the Nkumba commune -- the Rwandan troops came to the Nkumba commune office, and when it was said that the soldiers should stop where they had gotten, they stopped at Nkumba communal office, but the bulk of that officer (sic) would go into the buffer zone.
Q.	And is it fair to say that all of the communities that you have described concerning the movements of civilians and military within the -- what is now the demilitarised or buffer zone is the same as it was in Kinigi?
A.	I will say that it was a bit different; different in the sense that the communes that had no direct contact with the positions of the Rwandan armed forces as at then, movement was different, different from those that had boundaries of areas occupied by the Rwandan armed forces.  Let me explain further by saying that movement in the Kinigi commune; for example, Kinigi was closed to the zone of the Rwandan armed forces.  Then movement of the population was free, but movement of the people in vehicles was regulated, which is different from Kidaho commune, because the armed forces had no contact with the Kidaho commune, so the regulation of movement was completely outside their control.
Q.	I see.  All right.  Now, Witness, focusing now on  --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.
MR. HINDS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Could you please, Witness, could you repeat your answer that you have just given?
THE WITNESS:
I was saying that regarding movement of civilian population in the communes which were within the buffer zone, that communes that had borders with areas occupied by the Rwandan armed forces then, civilian movement was free, but movement aboard vehicles was regulated.  Whereas in those communes that had no direct borders with the operational zones of the soldiers, in those communes movement was not regulated like it is in the communes that I have just mentioned.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, what does that mean?  I am sorry.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, now, can you particularise this, in the case of Kinigi, for example? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  We have no problem with Kinigi.  He says movement was free for ordinary people and movment of vehicles was regulated. 
MR. HINDS:
That's right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are asking in connection with the movement where -- in the commune, which was not in contact with the Rwandan forces, where he says movement was not regulated.  What does that mean? Who was -- he used the word "free" with regard to Kinigi.  And when he says "not regulated", what does he mean?
MR. HINDS:
I thought he was distinguishing between Kinigi and other communities where there was generally free movement without regulation.  Kinigi, there was -- okay.

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, this is a very important area that you must explain clearly.  The Judges would like to know, specifically, with respect to the communities where there was  -- where there was not contact with the Rwandan armed forces.  First of all, what communities did that include, was that Kinigi or was it other communities, and be very specific about what communities that encompassed?  That is where --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not go back to Kinigi.  We understand Kinigi.  Movement in communes like Kinigi, for example, which were close to Rwandan forces, movement was free with regard to ordinary people.  And as far as vehicles were concerned, he has used two terms, restricted or regulated.  The only thing that we want to know is regard to movement in communes which were not in contact with the Rwandan armed forces.  He has used the words "not regulated", so what does he mean, if he expound on that?  We understand about Kinigi, and we followed his evidence from yesterday, actually.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, do you understand the question asked by the Judges?
A.	Yes, I do, and I am going to attempt to answer.  If I should start with the Kinigi commune -- this is not to overemphasise the point, it's just the explanation -- to ensure the explanation comes out clearly.  Regarding the Kinigi commune, the regulation was as follows:  Civilian vehicles going through the area occupied by the Rwandan armed forces had to stop at roadblocks, be checked, be searched, and this pursuant to the rules that established the demilitarised zone, and so as to avoid the movement of weapons into those areas.  And that is why vehicles going there require signed authorisation, signed by a commanding officer of that area, and that authorisation is to be shown at the roadblocks, and at the same time these vehicles were searched, before the vehicles are allowed through the roadblock, and even on their way back.

Now, regarding communes which had no direct boundaries or were not neighbouring to the secteurs controlled by the armed forces, I say that movement was not regulated by the Rwandan armed forces because those communes -- we were not aware of what was happening in there, we could not see.  And therefore, I cannot say that movement there was controlled or regulated by the Rwandan armed forces on that side, but in communes which had direct borders with the secteurs occupied by the armed forces, there is Nkumba, for example, and Cyeru, as far as the regulation involved regarding the -- as far as the regulating of vehicles were concerned, like Kinigi  --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness stops there and he is asking whether there is any other detail that you wish him to furnish. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  It's okay. 
BY MR. HINDS:
No other details, Witness FMB. 

What I'd like you now to focus on  --
MS. OJEMENI:
Before we move on, can we have the spellings of the communes that were mentioned?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Yes. 

Sorry, Witness FMB, you will have to spell out the names of these communes you did mention in your testimony for the people who want to take notes, but in particular, for the stenographers who compile the record for the proceedings.  Maybe in future, if you can -- it's a bit tedious, but I think it is necessary.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, as he is unfolding the map, the names are right there.  As he is pointing it out, we can write it down, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We have Nkumba there --
MR. KIYEYEU:
I am sorry, My Lord, just to simplify --
MS. OJEMENI:
The words are not visible, so it would be better to spell it out where he can.
MR. KIYEYEU:
I was simply saying that we tried to facilitate the process, we photocopied the map and we have already given it to the stenographer, so they can use the photograph, the maps that we have given. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that easier than spelling, for their work? 
MR. KIYEYEU:
We thought maybe that could simplify -- but the process is okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If they have to search, I think it might be easier for them if they don't have screens. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
It is true, My Lord. 
THE WITNESS:
So let me start.  I mentioned Kinigi.  Let me start with Kinigi, K-I-N-I-G-I.  I mentioned Nkumba, N-K-U-M-B-A, Nkumba.  I mentioned Kidaho, K-I-D-A-H-O, Kidaho.  I mentioned Ruhondo, R-U-H-O-N-D-O, Ruhondo.  I mentioned Cyeru, C-Y-E-R-U, Cyeru.  I also mentioned Nyamugali, N-Y-A-M-U-G-A-L-I, Nyamugali. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on, Counsel, please. 
MR. HINDS:
Thank you.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, I notice that you did not mention Butaro commune.  Was Butaro part of the demilitarised zone or not, and if not, why not?
A.	Butaro was part of the buffer zone and yes, I did not mention it because Butaro had already been taken over by the RPF before February 1993.  And that is why I did not mention it, because the other communes date from 8 February 1992.  At that time Butaro was under -- already under the control of the RPF.
Q.	Okay.  Witness, I would like you just to show the map, fold the map and display just the Kinigi area, so that you could take a seat and testify based upon what is on the screen.  If we need you to go back to the map, or if you need to go back to the map, you could so indicate, but rather than have you stand up there, I prefer for you to just sit.
A.	These are the boundaries of the Kinigi commune.  Here, you have the north, north-east through the chain of volcanoes, that is the Zairian side; then this is the north,  Uganda; south-east you have the Mukingo commune; to the south you have Kigombe commune and to the west you have Muhingo commune; and this is the boundary in red here.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  For the record, Your Honour, the witness was tracing the boundary reflecting the markings that he had made yesterday and the mountain range at the top of the map, which reflects the boundary between Zaire on one side and Uganda on the other side.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we did point it out yesterday, but if it was not done then, then let the record so reflect. 
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, you now should have the map displayed on your screen,but -- can you describe for the Tribunal, what was the situation within the demilitarised zone after it was established in February 1993 and up to the beginning of 1994, were there any violations of the Accord concerning movement of troops and so on in this zone which was now in Kinigi?
A.	May I request to give this answer in closed session, please?
Q.	Do you think that giving the answer, Witness, would tend to reveal your identity or  --
A.	Yes, I think so.
Q.	Okay.  Your Honour, we make an application to briefly go into closed session to see what  --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, any objection to that?
MS. OJEMENI:
No objection, Your Honour.  But we would like to have the question read back  when --
MR. PRESIDENT:
When we get there.  We'll see whether -- we'll know what the answer is when the witness has given his answer, because we cannot judge whether it is a risky position.

We will go into closed session to enable Counsel -- to enable the witness to answer the question that has been raised to him by Counsel which he thinks might reveal or may be connected to his identity.

	1150H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness FMB, we are back into open session, so be careful. 

Yes, Counsel. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, drawing your attention again on the map. 
MR. HINDS:
Could we focus on the map please?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, again, focusing on the map and in particular the barricades, can you tell the Tribunal, up until the -- what you describe, between the establishment of the buffer zone and the eve of increased hostility, as you say, in 1994, what -- how were you able to supply troops, how were the Rwandan armed forces able to supply troops who manned the blockade, for example, at between *Shinguru and Susa?  How was that accomplished if military -- if there were problems with military  -- vehicles travelling?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, this is a sensitive area and my learned friend should be very careful.  I object because the question, the present question is really leading.
MR. HINDS:
Well, let me rephrase the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you had better rephrase that question, even the previous one.  If you want the witness to react -- would like to get his answer --
MR. HINDS:
Sure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- without any suggestive elements, as it were, please rephrase.
MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, concerning the situation of your troops at the blockade between Susa and Shingiro, can you describe for the Tribunal what, if any, steps were taken to --
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour, the question is still leading.
MR. HINDS:
This clearly is not a leading question.  Counsel can just object, but this is not a leading question:  What, if any, steps from taken with respect to replenishment of the troops at those blockades.  Based upon the question, I don't think anyone here can determine what he will say.  I certainly don't know what he will say, and the test of a leading question is that the answer is obvious.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, this particular question and the other question that I objected to contain information.  My learned friend knows what he is doing.  It's, it's -- it's very obvious a leading -- I mean, that both of them are very obvious leading questions, very obvious.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, obviously you are asking a witness to describe what, if any, steps were taken and what were the circumstances.  I am not, by the question, suggesting the answer.  I have to put him some place.
(Pages 30 to 31 by Judith Baverstock)




























	1200H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, maybe you can break down your question and then address one aspect and then address whatever, what happened.
MR. HINDS:
All right.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, between the period of 1993 and the first of the year of 1994, could you describe the situation involving your troops or the government's troops who were manning the blockades?
MR. HINDS:
Is there any objection?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, could you answer the question, please, if you can?
A.	Between the period beginning February 1993 up to 6 April 1994 the organisation of the roadblocks was organised in the following manner.  During the day the roadblocks were removed, what I mean is the obstacles, the stones were manned by soldiers and when a civilian vehicle came to the roadblock they would check on the occupants regarding authorisation and a search of the passengers.  They would remove the stones and the vehicle would proceed.  This would be effected on the inward and outward journeys.  Have I answered your question?
Q.	Now, could you tell us whether, with respect to movement of troops, movement from the government side, dealing with civilian vehicles, was that movement ever interrupted?
A.	Do you mean movement right up to the roadblock or beyond the roadblock?
Q.	Right up to the roadblock and I'm now focusing your attention to the period right before April of 1994.  I will get into the activities after April 6, 1994, but up to that period.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think his answer is the 20th February to 6 April.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, but he was talking about civilians, what was done with respect to civilians, and that is beyond the roadblock, going beyond the roadblock.  I'm asking him now about coming up to the roadblock, what was the situation during that time period for government vehicles that were coming up to that?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, certainly I do recognise the fact that this witness was quite high in the military, but the fact remains that this witness is a factual witness.  He has not put himself -- placed himself physically at the locations that my learned friend has been examining him on.  He is supposed to -- as a factual witness, he is supposed to be giving evidence of what he witnessed, which he, so far, has not addressed the Court on.  

He's been talking about his boys, his people under his command.  I object because this is hearsay, irrespective of the fact he is a military man and quite high in the military, but he hasn't come before this Tribunal as an expert.  It's hearsay evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think this is a matter of cross-examination.  Things will be ventilated if need be by the Trial Chamber, if need be.  He's a factual witness and he's a witness that questions could be raised for cross-examination for the Trial Chamber's appreciation.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, did you understand the question that is now pending that I asked you concerning movement of vehicles, government vehicles up to the blockade and the time period up to April of 1994?  What was the situation, if any?
A.	Until immediately before the 6th of April 1994 government vehicles, if I were to refer to military vehicles, regarding supplies and foodstuffs, they were on movement to the roadblocks in order to facilitate supplies at the roadblocks or around the roadblocks where the soldiers would come and collect their rations after having eaten and they would return the material and the vehicle would return.  So the posting at roadblocks was authorised and effected.
Q.	Was that movement -- did that situation change, if any, after April 6 and, if so, can you describe?
A.	Yes, there were changes from the night of the 6th of April, and after the announcement of the death of the president we alerted the units at the front.  What does that mean, maximum alert?  This means that the soldiers at the front needed to return to their foxholes and those who were at the roadblocks became an obstacle.  In military terms an obstacle means it is an object which is militarily guarded, it is held under fire.  It is strengthened for it to become impassable; in other words, the stones which had been there earlier were increased in number and there was also an increase or extension of the depth, and I think this is the important issue.  No longer were we using the term roadblock; we were using the term obstacle with orders for prohibition to cross the obstacle or traverse the obstacle in question.  Subsequently, regarding movements of vehicles, be they supply vehicles or patrol vehicles, they were no longer allowed to get near or approach the obstacle.
Q.	And concerning that situation starting on April 6th, the prohibition of the vehicles even approaching the blockade, was that prohibition applied not only to civilian vehicles but to military vehicles?  Is that your testimony? 
A.	Yes, that is indeed what I'm saying; in other words, the obstacle, which had previously been a roadblock, became an obstacle, be it for civilian or military vehicles.  There was no longer any distinction made.
Q.	And why was this decision taken with respect to even military vehicles?
A.	That decision was applied even to military vehicles, first of all, because of matters pertaining to security and also to avoid, firstly, dealing with military vehicles, that loaded vehicles stopping at the obstacle would become targets that is number one. 

Number two, vehicles which were parked at a position would become a target which would help any observer to note that position; therefore, in prohibiting vehicles from approaching the roadblocks, this was a matter of security for the vehicles themselves, their loads, and also it involved security with regard to not revealing the positions occupied by the soldiers at the front.  As for civilian vehicles, this is the second part of your question, there was no distinction made in that regard because when orders were given in order to change what had been roadblocks into obstacles -- and this applied to all vehicles -- this was in order to avoid any possible conflict which may arise and affect the soldiers at the post.  So there was no distinction regarding the approach or the crossing of the obstacle.
Q.	Now, Witness, how did you determine what was taking place at the various blockades on a -- how did you determine what was taking place at the various blockades at specific times?
A.	How did one get to know what was happening at the roadblocks at various times?  May I request to answer in closed session, please?
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution counsel, any objection?  We'll go in closed session to hear the witness.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript (pages 35 to 41) was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)













BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, we'd like you to go to the map and can you tell the Tribunal, based upon your testimony, where did you determine, on the morning of April 7, there was particular gunfire coming from Kinigi and in what direction was that gunfire?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you can just tell us according to him, according to his information and his evidence, where that fire was coming from.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Okay, if you can do it, Witness, without going to the map and referring.  The map, now, is in front of you, so you don't have to get up.  So you can refer to the map without standing and refer to the areas where you learned that there was gunfire and the range and calibre, on the 7th.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He has told us, according to the evidence, using all that kind of analysis he gets, he's close to where the firing came from, so he can tell us the direction, he could perhaps talk about the direction according to his evidence and his analysis where this could have been coming from.
MR. HINDS:
Absolutely, that's what he's going to do using the map.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He should tell us exactly, first, before using the map, because what particular location?  I think it is only direction that he can talk about.
MR. HINDS:
Well, I don't know that, but I'll put the question to him in terms of location or direction.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Could you determine, Witness, the location, the area from which the fire was, in fact -- or the gun, the discharge of these weapons were coming from and areas of impact, both in terms of where it was coming from, the direction in which it was coming from and the impact, where there was impact, if any?
A.	Regarding the detonation of the shots, the gunshots, and when I refer to the map, looking at the western side of Kinigi, the observation reports told us that the occupation of positions, Nyabitsinde -- this map is not very clear, but I can still see Nyabitsinde, I see Bitsate there, the occupation of positions, that means the movement of troops, and Nyarugina.
Q.	Can you, Witness, spell these names for the assistance of the court reporters who do not have screens in front of them?
A.	I spell Nyabitsinde: N-Y-A-B-I-T-S-I-N-D-E, Nyabitsinde.  Bisate, B-I-S-T-E, B-I-S-A-T-E.  Nyarugina, N-Y-A-R-U-G-I-N-A.  These three places, the reports were saying that the troops, regarding the movement, the troop movement, and regarding weapons, you were asking about the impact point.  If you look at Tero on the map, Tero is T-E-R-O, and Shingiro, S-H-I-N-G-I-R-O.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Tell us in which commune, which one?
MR. HINDS:
That's right at the bottom on the border.
THE WITNESS:
Tero is on the border between Kinigi and Mukingo.
MR. HINDS:
It's right under Nyarugina, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
Now, the reports mention impacts of 60 millimetre mortar.  Regarding the individual weapons, the impact is not easy to determine because the bullets are small and when they wound people it is difficult to determine the impact.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The only thing is that witness is using troops movement, which troops?
MR. HINDS:
I'm going to ask him that now.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	With respect to troop movement, Witness, that you described at Nyabitsinde and Bisate and Nyarugina, that were previously spelt, could you -- were you able to determine what troop movements you were talking about, were they UNAMIR or were there some other --
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.  What troops?  The witness should know, why mention of the names of the troops?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anyway, the witness can answer that question.
THE WITNESS:
Do you want the identification and specification of the troops?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	We are not asking for the particular platoon numbers and battalion designations, we just want to know what troops -- the Chamber would like to know what troops you were talking about, what troops that were moving. 
A.	The troops involved were the RPF troops.
Q.	And did you -- this is the morning of the 7th, particularly in the vicinities that you have now described in Kinigi, did you learn in which direction those troops were moving?
A.	Yes, the direction, when you have the border between Kinigi and Mukingo, between this border you had the RPF forces on one side and on the opposite side you see the direction of the Rwandan Armed Forces, so the two -- the positions of the two parties were opposite each other.
Q.	And the question is, in which direction were the troops moving, the RPF troops that you have described; did you ascertain? 
A.	The RPF forces, the RPF troops at Nyabitsinde came from the volcanos, as well as Bisate, whereas those of Nyarugina were observed directly.  Yes, that's it.
Q.	Now, I'll draw your attention to the 8th, that is the 8th of April.  Was there any change in the situation that you've described to us from the 7th with respect to your testimony?
A.	Yes, in the course of the 8th of April there were changes regarding weapons used and troop numbers.  Regarding the weapons used, reports indicate that 81 millimetre mortars were used, as well as heavy machineguns.  Regarding the troop numbers around Nyabitsinde, the numbers that we observed on the 7th increased considerably.
Q.	Were there any changes with respect to locations with respect to any of the troops on the 8th?
A.	Yes, in the course of the 8th there were changes with regard to positions but, unfortunately, the map I have before me is not very clear; otherwise, at Kinigi itself there were reports of the presence of troops.
Q.	I'm directing your attention just to your testimony previously concerning the 7th.  Were there any changes with respect to the -- you have already told us that there were changes in numbers with respect to one area.  The question is whether or not there were any changes with respect to the two other areas that you had mentioned and whether or not there was any movement from that location of those troops, or were they stagnant?
A.	Yes, between the 7th and the 8th, well, on each day there were changes, be it changes in numbers, changes in positions occupied, or changes in terms of weapons used, things moved towards the use of weapons with a longer range and increase in numbers with regard to position, also, and on the 8th in Musanze, at Kanyamiheto -- let me spell Musanze, M-U-S-A-N-Z-E.  I mentioned another name, that is Kanyamiheto, K-A-N-Y-A-M-I-H-E-T-O, Kanyamiheto.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Well, it's 1 o'clock and I don't know how the Court wants me to proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, if it's convenient for you to stop at this stage and to be able to continue after the lunch break, we can stop right now.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we'll stop here and resume our work at 25 to three.  Witness FMB, be so advised.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court was adjourned from 1304H to 1440H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  Yes, learned counsel for the Defence, we are told you had a problem.
MR. HINDS:
The problem has been solved.  The problem that we had was Mr. Dusabe had a stomach problem, had to, over the lunch time, go to the break (sic), but the problem that this team has, which is unlike others, is it has nothing to do with the witness, it has to do with my client; in other words, he cannot communicate with me.  Even if he gives me a note I can't read it, so he has no way of me knowing what he is saying, because we don't speak the same language.  That is why Mr. Dusabe is critical.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we suggested because the witness was speaking in French and we could go on and if there was any problem that needed some communication between you and the client we could see how that could be done, but now that the problem has been solved so we can proceed.
MR. HINDS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We were in closed session, were we?
MR. KIYEYEU:
No, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We had just gone to open session.
MR. HINDS:
May I, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, before we went on the break, you were describing the situation as it was on the ground on the 8th of April 1994, and could the Registrar put back -- there was a map displayed -- and, Witness, you were describing troop movements within the Kinigi commune and also types of weapons and impact of those weapons, in terms of areas where they were impacting, at least up to the 8th.  Now, could you tell the Tribunal, with respect to information that you knew about on the 8th, what was the situation concerning movement of vehicles between Mukingo and in the Susa area?
A.	Let me start again.  You were asking me about the movement of vehicles between Mukingo and Susa.  The vehicles which were authorised to move about on the 8th on that trunk of road were only military vehicles and these vehicles were also supposed to drop off passengers before they reached the positions, which were those of Shingiro, and you will see another position on the road going to the west of Kimonyi.  There's a position to the right after Tero and, since it's a road for vehicles, vehicles which were transporting either soldiers or military material and equipment were supposed to drop off the passengers and the contents before they reached those positions.
Q.	Now, drawing your attention to the road going to Susa, why was there this requirement to deposit, even with military vehicles, for them to deposit their cargo prior to reaching the roadblock?
A.	That was necessary for security reasons, and a moment ago I mentioned that the roadblocks had disappeared, as it were, and had been replaced by what were known as obstacles held under fire and these obstacles were close to military positions.  These military positions were targets.  Once a vehicle stops at those positions it becomes immobile; that raises matters of security or insecurity, if you wish, the personnel on board the vehicle and the vehicle itself would stop at that position, would become, at one in the same time, a mark, in other words, easily observable, and, at the same time, a target which is easy to bring down.  So the fear came from the other side, because a moment ago I mentioned the impact of mortar shells of 60 millimetres on Tero and Shingiro, so that meant if the vehicles were to stop there they would immediately constitute targets.  That was why movement was prohibited up to that location.
Q.	Now, taking you, sir, to the next day of the 9th, that is the 9th of April 1994, can you share with Chambers whether or not there were any differences in the military situation in Kinigi and, in particular, in the area of, you say, Shingiro-Susa?
A.	From a military point of view, a difference one needs to distinguish, and this concerns the increase of numbers, you will realise that from the night of the 6th the situation developed or evolved both from the numbers standpoint as well as with regard to the occupation of positions and weapons used.  This means, therefore, that from the 9th one could see, at the various positions I've mentioned, an increase in numbers and the use of long range firearms, in other words, mortars using shells of between 80 and 120 millimetres.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	With respect to -- specifically with respect to the 9th, was there a -- could you tell the Chamber whether or not there were any increase in the calibre of long range weapons, and if so, what were the changes, if any?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that has been asked and answered from the -- you were talking about the 9th there was an increase in the numbers and use of long range of firearms 80 to 120 millimetres, unless you have some specific aspect you want to address the witness.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, with respect to the location of those, what you call long-range weapons or mortars, were you able to determine the location of those particular long-range weapons in connection with the specific deployment of troops that you have previously testified to?
A.	First, for the weapons I spoke of mortars using 80 millimetre shells located at Nyabitsinde, spelled 
N-Y-A-B-I-T-S-I-N-D-E, Nyabitsinde; at Kanyamiheto, which is spelled K-A-N-Y-A-M-I-H-E-T-O, at Kanyamiheto.  Have I answered your question?
Q.	Yes.  Now, Witness, with respect to those long-range weapons that were deployed on the 9th, were you able to determine where the impact of any projectiles landed in connection with the area that you already described, in terms of where the roadblocks or what were now obstacles occurred?
A.	Can you see the road from Mukingo towards Susa, the position of Shingiro, you see where that is, and to the right of Shingiro there is Tero, and a little further on you have the road from Rutagara, which goes through Kimonye, and there's another position on that road, and these positions suffered impacts of mortar shells of 80 millimetres -- I'm sorry, 81 millimetres.
Q.	Now, drawing your attention, sir, to the area that you talked about, in terms of Shingiro, when you say positions that were located in these areas suffered impact, what positions were you addressing in your response, specifically what positions?  Could you clarify that for us?
A.	Shingiro's position on the road from Mukingo towards Kinigi, before one crosses the Susa River.  You have Shingiro, and on the map it was formally labelled "barrier roadblock", a roadblock which subsequently became an obstacle held under fire, and there was a military position and the position suffered impact from 81 killometre mortar shells.
Q.	Now, can you tell the Trial Chamber how often that particular location was bombarded with mortar shells; that is on the 9th?
A.	The only position at Shingiro on the 9th, which was shelled by the 81 millimetre mortar shells, the reports provided us with three strikes, but I'm referring to the 81 millimetre mortar shells, I'm not referring to the 60 millimetre mortar shells that I spoke of earlier.
Q.	Can you tell us, with respect to the 60 millimetre mortar shells, what was the frequency of those, in terms of within the same area, impacting within the same area that you've just testified to?
A.	What type of weapon are you referring to, the one bearing the 60 or 81 millimetre shells?
Q.	You previously -- your previous testimony was that there were three strikes with respect to 
81 millimetre.  I'm now asking you how many strikes, if any, were there on that date, which is the 9th, with respect to 60 millimetre mortars?
A.	The 60 millimetre mortar shells, as for the number of strikes made by them I cannot tell you because the report, the report dealing with contact on those positions regarding the 60 millimetre mortar shells, said "sporadic", in other words, throughout the day, it was sporadic throughout the day.
(Pages 32 to 47 by R. Lear)





1500H
Q.	Witness, drawing your attention to the 10th of April, can you tell the Trial Chamber, if there were any changes with respect to the military situation that existed previously described starting with the 6th and up so far to the 9th, was there any change?  And if so, what were they?
A.	From the 10th of April, the major change that one can notice -- I said the situation evolved everyday regarding the numbers on the ground and as well as with the increase of long-range weapons.  The change that one needs to indicate is that from 10th, there was the indication of bombardments with 120 millimetre shells, and this was in the Kinigi area in a range of 8 to 10 kilometres, and this went right up to Nkumba commune.
Q.	Now, concerning drawing your attention to on the 10th, was there any change with respect to movement of civilian vehicles compared to your testimony about the conditions on the 9th, 8th or 7th? Was there any relaxation any -- had things gotten better?
A.	Regarding the movement of civilian vehicles I believe you are saying?
Q.	That's correct.
A.	I do not see any improvement, because the prohibition of the vehicle movement was not removed.  Therefore, there was no improvement in that regard, or under that category.
Q.	Did you receive any reports with respect to the movement of any or attempts of any civilian vehicle to pass along that road during the time period from the 6th to the 10th?
A.	During the days from 6th to 10th April 1994, I am still referring to the road from Mukingo to Kinigi, the various roads in that area; we didn't receive any requests.
Q.	If there were any movements or requests for movements, would you have been informed?
A.	The requests for movement were directed -- were submitted directly to the commander who was to issue the laissez passer, or the permits so I don't see how I would not have been informed of them, whereas I was amongst those who signed those documents.  So I would have been of necessity informed of the request because they had to go through the headquarters.
Q.	Now, sir, were you aware of - withdrawn.  Were you aware of the time -- withdrawn.  
Did there come a time, to the best of your knowledge, when the town of Ruhengeri was no longer under government control?  Now, the time period we are dealing is after if April 6th, 1994; did there came a time when Ruhengeri town -- was no longer under government control?
A.	From the 6th of April, yes, indeed, from the 15th of July 1994, the troops of the Rwandan Army left Ruhengeri town, but I am repeating that it was from the 14th of July 1994.
Q.	Now, sir, while you were stationed in Ruhengeri, did you know of a place called Apicur, A-P-I-C-U-R?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Spell it again, Counsel, A?
MR. HINDS:
A, as in Apple, P-I-C-U-R.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
	R.
MR. HINDS: 
	R, as in ready.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Okay.
THE WITNESS: 
	I personally didn't know any policeman bearing this name.  I wouldn't know such a person.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	No, it's not -- I am asking you if you knew of a place called Apicur, not the name of a person.  This maybe my accent.  It's a place, a school?
A.	Yes, at Ruhengeri, if I recall right, there was a school referred to as Apicur.
Q.	Now, was that school within - withdrawn.  Between April 6th and mid-July of 1994, do you know whether that school -- do you know whether that school was under government control?  Should I repeat the question because I know interrupted?  Let me repeat it so that we are, we are clear.  Witness, between April 6 and July of 1994, do you know whether Apicur was under government control?
A.	I must say that on the 6th of April, that was the time of the holidays in Rwanda, and since students had gone home for the holidays, the schools had not resumed around the 6th of April.  There was no teaching, therefore, I would say that that school between the 6th of April and in mid-July, I would say that that school had never been under the control of government in that period of time.
Q.	Was that school under the control of RPF during that period time, do you know?
A.	If it was really the Apicur which was in Ruhengeri town and between the period of 6th April to mid-July 1994, as you have said, I can affirm that if that school were in Ruhengeri, it would not have been under the control of the RPF because in Ruhengeri town, it was the FAR soldiers who were in place.
Q.	During that time period, do you know whether that --
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Just a minute.  So what is the answer of the witness?
MR. HINDS: 
The witness has said as to repeating, he can affirm during that time period --.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can he answer that?
MR. HINDS:
Oh, yeah.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, the Trial Chamber would like you to repeat your answer.
A.	I stated that if this Apicur school was indeed in Ruhengeri town in the period of time between the 
6th April and mid-July 1994, that school could not have been under the control of the RPF, because during that same period of time the FAR soldiers were still in Ruhengeri town where this school was supposed to have been.  So to summarise on that matter that school during that period of time was not under the control of the RPF.
Q.	Now, Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	If that was the school.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, do you know of any other Apicur, any institution, any facility with the name of Apicur?  
Do you know of any other Apicur that would be in this area other than the one that you have just identified?
A.	I do not see any other institution bearing the same name in the Ruhengeri area.
Q.	Now, Witness, with respect to that institution, between April 6th and July of 1994, do you know whether or not that institution was ever used as a hospital?
A.	During that period from, 6th April to mid-July, that school should not have been used as a hospital, because there was a hospital in Ruhengeri and the hospital was operational.
Q.	Witness, listen to my question carefully: The question is whether -- do you know whether that school was ever used as a hospital?
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour; asked and answered.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Was it a hospital?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that is the answer the witness gave.  The school should not have been used as a hospital because there was another hospital, something like that.
MR. HINDS:
I have now asked him whether or not he knew. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was your previous question, Counsel, whether he knew, and that is the answer the witness gave.
MR. HINDS:
Well, I am entitled --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can go ahead and ask him.
MS. OJEMENI:
The answer -- I know my learned friend, of course, might have an answer that he wants the witness to give him, but if the witness does not remember.  I still register that that was the question -- .

MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Well that answer can be -- the witness can answer that question, and the Trial Chamber has to take note of all the answers being given here.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, did you understand the question that I have put to you?
A.	You are asking me whether I knew whether that school had been used as a hospital.  I am saying I do not know whether that school was indeed used as a hospital, and I added, as I have just done, that the Ruhengeri hospital was still operational during that period of time.
MR. HINDS:
I think that may be my last question, but let me just check with my client.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, thank you, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
No further questions on direct, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, thank you, learned counsel.  

Cross-examination?          
WITNESS FMB
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, when exactly were you transferred to Ruhengeri, which year?
A.	I was assigned to Ruhengeri in 1992.
Q.	What was your rank then?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we are now in open session.  I hope the Prosecutor realises that.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	If you have questions that might have some -- have to do with this person, perhaps you can decide whichever way you want to proceed either, we start in open session or we could go in closed session to rise whichever questions you want to raise with the witness.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.   I think that might be the best, because I will be going in and out of the session.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Okay.  There is no objection, I suppose.  Yes.

MR. HINDS:
No, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we will go into closed session to enable Counsel to raise questions with the witness, even those which have a bearing on his identity.  Registry
