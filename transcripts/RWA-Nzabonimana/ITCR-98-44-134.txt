P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open you proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, Tuesday, 28th June 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of The Prosecutor v. Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44(C)-T. Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  The appearances are the same.  Thank you.  

Two small housekeeping matters.  Mr. Hooper, are you ready to complete the filing -- the submission of the three exhibits from yesterday afternoon?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, we are, with the exception, I'm afraid, of the confirmation statement which we believe we only received in hard copy and not in electronic format in this particular case, and we don't have that.  So I'm going to have to make a further request to the helpful Ms. Fall and Ms. Cummings-John, Mr. Niane, of course, in respect of that.  But the other statements we have, I last saw them in the hands of Mrs. Pouplard.  I don't know whether she's handed them to the -- no?  

I'm sorry, rather than take up time, can I defer that till later?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR.  HOOPER:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday afternoon, you also raised the question of -- of the closed session transcripts of a witness.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I had promised to make enquiries.  Now, I think that the position is governed by Rule 75(F) which imposes an obligation on the Prosecutor.  

MR. HOOPER: 
I have been assisted already this morning by receiving the closed-session testimony of ^GIN, but not of two witnesses who also gave evidence in respect of the matters that were discussed then.  And I've discussed that with Ms. Fall this morning, and I think we are trying -- attempting to get hold of them through those channels.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, yes, that's the appropriate channel because the (inaudible) suggests that the intervention of the Chamber is not required to achieve this, unless there is a problem.
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I just need to remind you to observe the protective measures.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Ms. Fall, the next witness, please.  
MS. FALL: 
Yes, Mr. President, we have Witness AVD, who is present and waiting to appear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Could you bring in the witness, please.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  I can hear you.  I'm listening.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The registrar will now give you the oath as a witness that requires you to tell the truth during these proceedings. 

Mr. Registrar. 
(Declaration made by Witness AVD in Kinyarwanda) 
MS. FALL: 
May it please the Court.



WITNESS AVD,

Could the registry please show the document first to the Bench and to the Defence.  
MR. HOOPER:  
May I just indicate that we have no sight of the witness at all.  
MS. FALL: 
I have the same problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it okay now?  Is it okay now?  
MR. HOOPER:

Ms. Fall.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, the information the document bears, is it clear to you or do you need the assistance of an interpreter?

MR. PRESIDENT:
You may.  
MS. FALL: 
Could an interpreter, please, come and help us.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, do you see your name on this document -- or can you confirm it's your name on this document?

MS. FALL:
Could I ask the registrar to assist in obtaining from the witness that he put the date and sign this document.  Today is the 28th of June 2005.  The date can be written in Kinyarwanda.  
THE WITNESS: 
I can write the date but I don't know what date it is today.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I did say it is the 28th of June 2005.  
MS. FALL:

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could the witness come closer to the microphone because the Kinyarwanda interpreters are having difficulty hearing him. 
BY MS. FALL:

A.	No. 
Q.	Have you had the opportunity to meet investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda?

A.	If it does not compromise my safety, I don't know, should I tell you that?  I mean, might it not compromise my safety. 
Q.	In which commune did you reside? 
A.	Gikomero. 
Q.	Could you be more specific -- more precise, without, however, revealing your identity?  When you say Gikomero commune, is there a place you could name without compromising your safety? 
A.	If I told you exactly where I lived, people may know -- might know who I am. 
Q.	Very well.  Witness, can you tell us what occurred in Rwanda on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I can tell you what I saw. 
Q.	And what did you see? 
A.

In the course of that week, ******************************** who were Tutsi were beaten, and subsequently they were taken to Kayanga hospital at the health centre. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry.  Could my friend just put the brakes on a little bit just so that I keep up with the written notes?  Thank you.  I got as far as, "they were searching the houses of Tutsis who they said were Inkotanyi."  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, please, proceed gradually by stages.  The Defence counsel cannot follow, so please go -- proceed by stages.  So, you said that after hearing about Habyarimana's -- President Habyarimana's accident, the Hutu began to search Tutsi houses; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Do you know why they were searching the Tutsi houses -- the houses of the Tutsi? 
A.	I, for my part, did not know why. 
Q.	And then what happened after they had searched the houses of the Tutsi?

A.	No, the store was destroyed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So we shall return to the vehicle.  You told us that the vehicle parked in front of Muhire's house, that there were many people around it, and that at one point you saw them getting out bags which were put in -- taken into Muhire's house; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us where the bags in question were?

Q.	At the time you saw him leave, were you still at the place that you have indicated to us? 
A.	Yes, I was still at the same place. 
Q.	Can you tell us in what direction André Rwamakuba went?

Q.	Mr. Witness, I shall return quickly to these bags.  When you saw the bags being unloaded, were you aware of what their contents were? 
A.	No, I wasn't. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether you did find out about the contents of these bags at one point or another? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber when you found out what the bags contained? 
A.	It was in the morning.  André Muhire was taking machetes out of his house and distributing them to the Hutus of Gasabo.  He was helped by Ndoli and Murangira. 
Q.	I think we should take it -- slow down a little for the Defence.  

So, you said that this happened in the morning.  What morning? 
A.	It was the morning of the third day.
Q.	The morning of the third day, in relation to what? 
A.	This was when the machetes were distributed. 
Q.	Can you tell us who distributed the machetes? 
A.	I can give you the person's name. 
Q.	Would you be so kind as to tell us who it was then? 
A.	It was on Wednesday afternoon.  Muhire distributed machetes, assisted by Ndoli and Murangira. 
Q.	Were Ndoli and Murangira the same people you said you saw in Muhire's house when 
	André Rwamakuba visited it? 
A.	Yes, they are the same people. 
Q.	Can you tell us to whom the machetes were distributed? 
A.	These machetes were distributed to the Interahamwe of Gasabo. 
Q.	Amongst these Interahamwe in Gasabo, were there any people that you were able to recognise? 
A.	There were many of these young people, and they all participated in the killings. 
Q.	Why do you say that they were Interahamwe then? 
A.	It is because they were killing people. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what happened after the machetes were distributed to these young Interahamwe? 
A.	When I observed that machetes were being distributed, I fled. 
Q.	Where did you go to? 
A.	I went to my home, and I told the people who were there that they had started killing.  We all fled to Kajevuba. 
Q.	When you were going to Kajevuba were you accompanied solely by your family members? 
A.	There were also other people with us. 
Q.	Can you tell us the ethnic origin of these people who were with you? 
A.	They were Tutsi. 
Q.	Were there only Tutsis? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, when you left, did you leave with your older brother? 
A.	We left the centre separately.  He went his way and I went my way, but we met at home. 
Q.	Witness, does this mean that when you went through all this, your brother also experienced the same things as you did? 
A.	It is possible that we did not experience the same events because people do not experience things that happen in the same manner. 
Q.	What I mean is, was your brother also present when all this was going on? 
A.	Yes, he was present. 
Q.	So, Witness, you were telling us that you went to Kajevuba.  When you went there, did you find other people? 
A.	Yes, there were other refugees. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the ethnic origin of the refugees you found there was? 
A.	They were Tutsis who came from Rubungo and Gishaka, as well as from Rutungo. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, how long you stayed in Kajevuba? 
A.	We spent two or three days in the surrounding hills and the Inkotanyi finally overran Gasabo.  That is why we went to Gasabo. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us when you left your place of refuge to go to Gasabo? 
A.	It was one evening. 
Q.	Can you indicate the period to us? 
A.	It was in April, but I no longer remember the date. 
Q.	Witness, did you go to Gasabo with your family members? 
A.	Yes, I did.  We were together, the family. 
Q.	Can you tell us when you returned to Ndatemwa centre? 
A.	I did not return to the centre. 
Q.	Where do you live now? 
A.	I live in **************. 
Q.	So, when did you return to Ndatemwa centre? 
A.	It was in 2001. 
Q.	Where were you then from 1994 to 2001? 
A.	I was a soldier. 
Q.	Can you tell us when you became a soldier? 
A.	It is from 1994 after I met with the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	I take it then from what you have said that when you went to Kajevuba and the Inkotanyi came there, you followed them? 
A.	Yes, I followed them. 
Q.	Witness, I shall just touch on a few facts.  You told us that after the distribution of weapons -- that weapons were distributed to young Interahamwe.  After this was done, what did the young Interahamwe do? 
A.	They began to kill and to destroy houses. 
Q.	Can you tell us to whom the houses belonged? 
A.	They destroyed houses belonging to the Tutsis, including mine. 
Q.	Were you present when they destroyed these houses? 
A.	No, I was not because I had fled. 
Q.	So how do you know that they had destroyed the houses of Tutsis? 
A.	When we left that place, they began to destroy houses and they were shouting all over the hills.

1000H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whether it is the machetes that were delivered by André Rwamakuba that were given to the young people? 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Could my learned friend not put words in the mouth of the witness to that extent? 
MS. FALL: 
I shall rephrase.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you did tell us that you saw bags being unloaded from a vehicle parked in front of Muhire's house, this vehicle had been brought by Mr. André Rwamakuba; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	You also said that afterwards you did not know the contents of this bags -- these bags, but it is during the distribution of machetes that you realised that the bags had contained machetes? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You told us that this distribution took place one morning and that it is Muhire who distributed these machetes to the young Interahamwes? 
A.	That is correct. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel began her question before the channel was through.  Would counsel be so kind as to repeat the question for the interpreter? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter would like to point out that the last but one question of Counsel was not heard because she was using the English channel and the interpreter could not hear. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear what the interpreter said, Ms. Fall?  
MS. FALL:
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that the interpreter missed your last but one question.  Are you in a position to recall it?  
MS. FALL: 
Could my memory be refreshed by the interpreters to the last but one question?  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm afraid I can't do that, Counsel. 
MS. FALL: 
I said at that point, I did not have any further questions for the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Mr. Witness, your examination will be continued now, but on this occasion you will be asked questions by the attorney of the Accused person, and you will have to answer his questions.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Hooper. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness AVD. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I'm going to start by -- now you can't read at all, is that right? 
A.	Could you repeat your question please, Counsel. 
Q.	You can't read at all?
A.	No, I cannot read. 
Q.	How many years of primany school did you do? 
A.	Four years of primany school. 
Q.	If I gave you a list with names clearly printed on it, would you be able to read those names to yourself? 
A.	I would not be able to do so. 
Q.	Then I think we better go into closed session and I will put the names to you and you can tell me whether you know the people whose names I put to you? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think we have to go into closed session at this stage.  

Mr. Hooper, do you have an idea of how long you are likely to be?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, there may be some other questions I can ask.  It may take us up to the mid-morning adjournment, half past 10:00, but maybe a little shorter than that.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, for the benefit of the public in the waiting gallery I think that we can say that the open session will resume after the mid-morning break, at about 10:45.  We will go into closed session now.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 16 to 24] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 13 to 15 by Donna M. Lewis)
































MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Witness, I draw to your attention that we are now in open session, so you have to be careful about giving information which may reveal your identity because we are now in open session.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
I understood you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you have been telling us that you followed the RPF army, joining it in April and, indeed, ************************************************.  You told us that you had, in fact, been shot, as I understand it, *********.  And I was suggesting to you, for you to agree or disagree, that the fact that it would appear that you have had battle or fighting experience as a soldier.  Do you have a difficulty with that?  
A.	I have told you to tell me clearly what fighting you are referring to and you didn't give me an answer, Counsel.  
Q.	Let me ask you this:  Have you been involved in any fighting as a soldier?  
A.	I have answered the question.  
Q.	And the answer to that was yes; is that right?  
A.	Do you think that I got shot by a bullet when I was not fighting, Counsel?  
Q.	I am not going to go into this any further, but can I just ask you this:  Were your duties ******************* a secret?  
A.	No, they weren't.  
Q.	And did you have any particular skill in the army?  Were you trained to fulfill any particular function?  
A.	I think you yourself, from the matter that is at issue here and you are talking about military matters, I didn't come here for a military trial.  I think that you are departing from the point that is at issue here today.  
Q.	Let's go back again to 1994, and you have a shop which you run with someone and you indicated ******************************* where that shop was; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Just so that we are clear, are you saying that the shop actually stood where ******************, as close to the road as you indicated?  
A.	It was below the road.  
Q.	So how far in metres would it be from the road the front of your shop?  
A.	It was ************** from the road.  
Q.	And I take it it wasn't a well built or permanent structure; would I be right?  
A.	It had plastered walls and it had a foundation, so it was a fairly solid house, I would say.  
Q.	But there is not a single trace of it that survives today, is that the position?  
A.	The house was demolished but the foundation is still there under the debris. 
Q.	Was this shop rented by your brother from somebody?  
A.	It belonged to us.  
Q.	Today, do you have any cattle?  Do you own any cattle today?  
A.	No, I do not.
Q.	Does your brother?  
A.	My brother has a cow. 
Q.	Just one, isn't it?  
A.	A cow and its calf. 
Q.	And back in 1994, did you own any cattle or did your brother own any cattle, and if you did, how many?  
A.	We had cattle, yes.  
Q.	And how many did you have?  How many did you own?  
A.	We had many cows.  
Q.	But that's right that you have provided information.  You told us about Gacaca proceedings, about events in your area, that is correct, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, it is.  
Q.	And when Gacaca takes place, it would be a very open and public thing, wouldn't it?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And you would be expected to stand up and implicate those who were guilty of terrible events in your area and you would do that in public, won't you?  
A.	That is correct.  We provided information that was taken down. 
Q.	And the time will come when you will have to stand up and speak about those events and the people who committed those crimes and you will do so in public, in front of your neighbours; is that correct, isn't it?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And that will occur fairly shortly, wouldn't it, possibly this year, wouldn't it?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	So why are you so concerned about security when in a month or two you will be saying presumably all this in front of whole world?  What is the problem?  
A.	Here we are abroad, we are not in Rwanda.  Even the plane can be shot down, or getting down from the car, I can be shot. 
Q.	Now, you said you have provided information in respect of several people in respect of Gacaca proceedings, and I think I heard you say that included André Rwamakuba and someone whose name I didn't get, but I will come back to that.  Is that right, that you have given information about Gacaca, mentioning André Rwamakuba; is that correct?  
A.	That is quite correct.  
Q.	And when did you provide that information or statement?  When was that?
A.	Every ********* we provide information.  Everyone provides information he possesses.
Q.	And is that done in public?  
A.	Yes, it is in public.  
Q.	So it seems from what you say Gacaca is actually under way in your area at the moment; is that right?  
A.	Yes, proceedings have begun; we are at the information collecting stage.  
Q.	And how many people attend these ********** meetings?  
A.	All the local inhabitants.  
Q.	And where do you meet?  
A.	We gather in meetings. 
Q.	Where?  
A.	If I name the place, I don't know whether you will know it.  
Q.	Please name the place and the interpreter can spell it for us, if it would help.  
A.	I have the impression that we are no longer in closed session; I cannot give you the name of that place for reasons of safety.  
Q.	What's the problem of you attending public meetings in your own neighbourhood?  What is the problem telling this careful and discrete place, this Chamber, the name of the place?
A.	I think I have given you the reasons that prevent me giving the name of that place.  I told you that the airplane that would take me home can be shot down, or the vehicle attacked, and I risk losing my life because of my lack of caution.  
Q.	I suggest that is a gross exaggeration of your position.  Will you name the place where public Gacaca hearings take place?  
A.	The Gacaca proceedings take place at the cellule centre.  
Q.	Can we just make sure that is an accurate translation?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Within the cell. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	We know there is a commune.  We know there are secteurs and we know that within the secteurs there is a cellule.  Which cellule are you talking about?  Is it the cellule where you live?  If your answer to that is yes, don't mention the name of the cellule.  We've got it written down and we can look at that.  Is it the cellule where you live?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	These meetings, do they take place in an open air or in a particular building or both? 
A.	The Gacaca meetings are held under the open sky.  
Q.	And does everybody in your cellule attend, if they are able to?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And about how many attend on an average ***********?  
A.	Many people.  
Q.	Would that be a hundred, more than a hundred or less than hundred?  
A.	I said that everyone who resides in the cellule participates in the Gacaca proceedings, so there are many people.  
Q.	And so it is compulsory, is it, to participate?  
A.	Well, listen, the Gacaca courts have begun and the people must participate in the work of those courts.  
Q.	And is there someone who is in charge, who keeps a record of what is said at these meetings?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And what is the name of that official or person?  
A.	We call that person the secretary of the Gacaca jurisdictions -- Gacaca courts. 
Q.	And what is the person's name, that is all I want?
A.	I told you that I cannot give you that person's name.  
Q.	But it is not a secret, is it?  
A.	It is a secret because if I give you his name then they all know that it is me that named him.  
Q.	Have you signed any statements for Gacaca proceedings?  
A.	One doesn't sign statements before the Gacaca courts; one merely provides information one possess, and I told you that we are still at the information gathering or information collecting stage.  
Q.	I thank you.  Can you confirm that after President Habyarimana's plane was shot down that in the days that followed people were ordered to stay at home, to remain indoors and not to wonder about?  Can you confirm that was the case?  
A.	Yes, that was the case.  They wanted the Tutsis to stay at home so they could be more easily killed.  
Q.	I didn't ask you for the reason or the reason you would like to give us, I am just asking you that, in fact, that was the government's order, as you understood it to be.  
A.	That was ordered so that the Tutsis would not leave their houses because Hutu were allowed to move about.  It was merely in order to retain -- keep the Tutsis in their houses so that they would be killed without difficulty. 
Q.	And did you keep a Tutsi in your house?  
A.	Yes, I stayed at my place of work.  
Q.	Are we to understand that the shop you referred to was where you and the person you worked with lived?  
A.	Yes, we spent the night in that shop.  
Q.	Did you share the room there together or did you have separate rooms there?  
A.	Each one had his own room.  
Q.	Were, in fact, shops or marketplaces -- after the president was killed, were they ordered to be closed?  
A.	No, such an order was not issued.  The shops were open.  
Q.	And were you trading normally?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, in the days leading up to the day that you left, but not including the day that you left at the moment, but the days before you left, after the president's plane was shot down, did you hear any shooting at all in your area?  
A.	No, I did not hear any firing or shooting. 
Q.	Did you hear any shooting or firing at all prior to the day that you left?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Didn't you hear the heavy guns firing from Kigali?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you hear firing coming from the communes around you, that is, the communes of Rutare, R-U-T-A-R-E, Mugambazi, M-U-G-A-M-B-A-Z-I or Rutongo, R-U-T-O-N-G-O?  Did you hear shooting coming from those directions to your east, north and west?  
A.	No, but from what time are you referring to, Counsel?  At what -- to which time are you referring to, Counsel? 
Q.	Well, I will put the question again.  From the time the president's plane was shot down to the day before you left your area.  
A.	No, I did not hear of such things.  
Q.	And I do not seem to be facetious here, but did you have at that time any trouble with hearing?  
A.	I cannot speak of something I did not hear.  
Q.	Would there be any reason you can think of why you didn't hear something that others say they did?  
A.	You must ask people that said they heard something.  I did not hear anything. 
Q.	And you are sure that you left where you lived the day that you told us you did and not on an earlier occasion?  
A.	But, Counsel, I told you the day I left that place.  
Q.	You see if there was heavy gunfire, one reason you might not have heard it is that you weren't there to hear it.  Do you understand?  
A.	I did not hear the gunfire you referred to, but you, where were you to hear the firing?  Were you the person shooting?  
Q.	And as an ex-soldier, you are very well placed to help us to the kinds of guns that were firing, if you had heard any, but you told us that you didn't hear any guns firing.

Let me just ask you this.  Did you hear any guns firing the day you left?  
A.	I told you, no.  
Q.	Just so we are absolutely clear, by guns I don't just mean heavy guns and mortars, but also rifles, machine guns, did you hear anything by the time you left?  
A.	I have told you that I did not hear the various things you are referring to and I don't know why you are dwelling on it. 
Q.	Now, you spoke of two persons, *************************************************************************************************.  What can you tell us about those people?  
A.	Those people were beaten and subsequently they died.  
Q.	Were you in any way related to them?  If you were, just say yes or no, don't give the relationship, just say yes or no.  
A.	I know that they were Tutsis, otherwise there was no family connection between those people and me.  
Q.	And how do you know they were attacked and assaulted, as you say?  
A.	They were beaten at the trading centre where I was.  
Q.	Are you saying that's something you saw?  
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness thereof.  
Q.	Do you recall what time of day that was?  
A.	I do not remember the time.  
Q.	Was it in the morning or lunch time or the evening or at night?  
A.	It wasn't at night, but I don't remember the time.  
Q.	These were the first Tutsis to be attacked and beaten at the centre at this time; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And it must have been something that, particularly as you saw it as an eyewitness, both shocked and frightened you?  
A.	But, Counsel, it could frighten -- it could frighten you, too.  
Q.	But you can't even remember what time of day it was?  
A.	You will understand this was 11 years ago, I can't remember the day and dates.  One can't retain all these things in one's memory after so long a time.  
Q.	Now I understand that it is a long time ago, but when was it in relation to the car coming?  
A.	Those people were beaten before the arrival of the car.  
Q.	Because in your evidence you said that you left on the third day, and I want you to explain to the Chamber what you mean by "You left on the third day"?  
A.	That is when the massacres began.  
Q.	You see, this thing, the third day, do you mean by that that there was a sequence, a series of events?  Something happened on day one, the next day, day two, something else happened and the third day you left, and if that's the case, can you tell the Chamber what that sequence of events is that you referred to?  
A.	It was the third day that the material was distributed and the massacres began.  
Q.	And you told us that the third day was the day that the attackers -- that the distribution took place.  Was that the third day thereof?  What happened the day before, the second day?  
A.	That day was a Wednesday, I think you are mixing up the Wednesday and the third day.  I told you that it was on a Wednesday that the material was distributed and the massacres began.  
Q.	But we know that Wednesday was the 13th of April, you might not know the date, but that is the obvious date on the calendar, if Wednesday was, then it's the 13th that the distribution takes place and you leave.  So what happened on the day before the 12th, the Tuesday?  
A.	That is when André Rwamakuba arrived.  
Q.	I will come back to that.  That is Tuesday the 12th of April in the afternoon you have told us.  So what happened the day before that, the first of the three days, what happened?  
A.	I told you that after the airplane was shot down, they began by searching the Tutsis and then the people I mentioned were beaten and then the vehicle arrived, and the massacres followed.  
Q.	Are you saying that the two people you witnessed being beaten were beaten the day before the vehicle arrived, is that your evidence?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And so when you say the morning of the third day, this was when the machetes were distributed, we can see now your sequence.  First of all, the two people were beaten on one day and the next day you say Rwamakuba arrived, it was in the afternoon, and leaves machetes.  And the day after that, the morning of the third day, this was when the machetes were distributed, so that's what you are saying, isn't it?  That is your evidence.  
A.	That is not what I said.  I told you that the machetes were distributed on Wednesday morning and the massacres began.  I don't know what you are saying.  I don't know where you got it from.  
Q.	One last go, all right.  But I don't think I am misinterpreting in any way what you say, sir, just listen carefully.  The first day the two people, *********************** are beaten up.  The next day, André Rwamakuba arrives, and the day after that, the weapons are distributed and the attack begins.  Is that right or is that wrong?  
A.	I have described the various stages to you, but you are giving days, but I don't know on what basis you are doing that.  I told you that firstly, that Tutsis were searched; secondly, **************************** were beaten up.  After that Rwamakuba came and after that, machetes were distributed and killings began on that day.  I don't think you understood me correctly. 
Q.	No, I think I understood you very well.  And I am asking you, you understand this about the meaning of your evidence this morning when you said "The morning of the third day," this was when the machetes were distributed, and I understand what you are saying.  But let me ask you this, and I am going to read part of your statement to you that you made just a couple of years ago.  

You talk of the car arriving -- I hope you are listening to me.  You talk, first of all, of the car arriving, André Rwamakuba arriving.  The next part of your statement you say on the next day in the morning there was a distribution of machetes.  I understand that entirely.  And on the same day after receiving machetes, there was an attack on the Tutsis and you fled, so all that is what you have told us.  And then you say this:  "On that day, two persons, ********************* were attacked by the people with machetes and they got seriously injured.  They were taken to Kayanga hospital where they died.  Later I fled to the hills.  I know you don't have the statement in front of you and I appreciate that you would have difficulty reading it.  But I will say it again, the clear reference in your statement to the day when André Rwamakuba arrives, the next day in the morning machetes are distributed, and on that day, **************************** are attacked.  So why do you have a different sequence there, if you actually witnessed, if you were there to witness what happened?  Why have you got it different in your statement?  
A.	You are telling me I said things I did not say.  You said, for example, that the vehicle came and then Rwamakuba came afterwards.  Do you think the vehicle didn't have a driver?  
Q.	No, that is my fault because I -- I am not going to read the whole statement out to you.  You said here -- 
A.	So, Counsel, you have not told the truth in all that you have said.  
Q.	Well, we have the advantage, sir, of having your statement, all of us here have your statement and you are at a disadvantage because you don't have the statement.  So, I am not misleading anybody, because everybody can see what I am reading, do you understand, so you can, I hope, be confident that the Judges know what you said in your statement, and they won't allow me to misrepresent what you said in your statement, do you understand?  And I am giving you an opportunity to explain something that is strange in your statement?  Do you understand?  
A.	I understand you, Counsel.  Would you be so kind as to read that statement?  
Q.	No, I am not going to read it all, but if the Prosecutor wants to read it all to you later, she can do that.  
MS. FALL:
I will do it, Counsel, I will.  Don't worry.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What you say here, I will repeat it briefly, is that Rwamakuba arrives in a car.  The next day there is a distribution of machetes and the Tutsis are attacked.  And you say this, listen carefully, "On the same day" -- strike that.  "On that day, two persons, ******************************* were attacked by the people with machetes and they got seriously injured on that day."  Do you understand that there isn't a link between the machetes and the attack on that day?  So in your statement, sir, it reads that ***************** were attacked after the machetes were distributed, but that is not your evidence now, is it?  
A.	I am going to answer you.  I am not making a statement.  I was not taking down notes.  I told you that I asked that some things mentioned in my statement should be corrected.  I do not know whether this was done.  So I gave an oral statement and people who were taking notes -- so I said when the vehicle came, ********************* had been beaten up before.  The person who took down the notes thought it happened later, but that is not what I said.  
Q.	All right.  So you accept that your statement says something different to your evidence, you accept that, do you?  
A.	Except for the point where I asked them to make a correction, they didn't take down what I said.  I talked about the events before the arrival of the vehicle, but they took it down as having happened afterwards.  So the person who took down my statement took the events down as having occurred afterwards. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  So you are saying it was a simple mistake and these things can happen.  When did you realise first that there had been that mistake?  
A.	It is when the statement was read out to me and I asked that corrections be made, and I think I said this at the beginning of my testimony today.  I told you that I asked that corrections be made.  For example, the fact that ***************************** were beaten up before the vehicle arrived, they did not correct the error.  They situated the events after the arrival of the vehicle, whereas, I had said in my oral statement that this happened before.  
Q.	Thank you for your very clear answer, but you appreciated it at the time that you specifically asked for a correction, but that that was not done.  

Now, tell me this, just a few months ago on the 16th of March, the investigator, an interpreter and a trial attorney came to see you, and I have a copy of a report and I am going to read you items 13(a) headed "Positive report of the reconfirming," which is, that you agree with the evidence in your statement.  "The witness has confirmed all matters mentioned in his statement as being true and correct.  And that is signed by the investigator and by the interpreter with one exception, except page K050508847, which is the particular reference to the second page of your statement.  Line one and then it reads:  "One occasion forcibly slaughtered," that is in relation to cattle, is it not?  I regret to say particularly concerned about.  So, first of all, do you agree that you had such a meeting and that your statement was gone through very carefully?  Do you agree with that, that is in March of this year?  
A.	No written statement was reread to me. 
Q.	But you don't read yourself, but you have made a positive confirmation of your statement and you have made a positive correction of a detail of the statement.  So it looks, does it not -- 
A.	I told you that I do not remember the date on which these meetings took place, but I told you that when they came to see me, I asked that corrections be made to the statement and I have told you what they needed to correct, and, apart from that, I didn't meet with them again. 
Q.	I am not going to dwell on this to take more time up.  We can see what happened.  But let ask you this:  Since that time, have you had any meeting with anyone from the Prosecution about your evidence, since you have been here in Arusha, for example, have you had a meeting, quite normally if you have, but can you confirm that you have had such a meeting?  
A.	No, I did not meet them. 
Q.	So at no time while you have been here has there been any discussion between you and the Prosecution?  
A.	I don't know them and I haven't met them.  
Q.	Well, I have to accept your answer.  So you were there up to the 13th, the Wednesday, you don't hear any shooting, you see *************************** assaulted on one day you tell us, something you saw you can't tell us when in the day?  Were you really there?  
A.	I was there, I was in my home.  
Q.	It is not a question of you coming along to support your brother's evidence, is that what it is about?  
A.	I am talking about things I experienced.  I don't know anything about my brother; I do not even know whether he has come to give testimony here.
Q.	All right.  Let's come to the day that you see Rwamakuba which we now know from your evidence is the afternoon of Tuesday, the 12th of April, on your evidence.  And can you help us as to the time that car arrived?  
A.	I told you that it was in the afternoon, but I do not remember the exact time.  
Q.	In your statement you say it was around 1600 hours; would that be about right?  
A.	What you say is not true.  I said, instead, that he left at around that time, but I did not say that he arrived at that time.  
Q.	Well, it reads it was afternoon around 1600 the vehicle came from Rutunga side, but now you say it came at what time, if at all?  
A.	I said it was in the afternoon.
Q.	And what were you doing at your shop on the 12th, the afternoon of the 12th of April?  
A.	We were going about our normal business, the sort of thing that happens in a shop. 
Q.	So you were just trading in a normal way and that is the reason why you were there.  Were there a lot of refugees coming past your shop over the previous days and this day? 
A.	I did not see refugees.  Perhaps you have information that I myself do not have.  However, I did not see any refugees.  
Q.	Are you sure you were there? 
A.	Yes, I was there.  
Q.	And, sir, it is a normal day's business -- did you have many customers on that day?  
A.	Counsel, we didn't have many customers during the war.  They were average, I would say.  
Q.	Again a vehicle arrives.  How many other vehicles did you see that day?  
A.	No other vehicle went past there apart from the one that I have talked about.  
Q.	And who did you see in the vehicle?  
A.	I saw André Rwamakuba.  
Q.	Well, you didn't know who the person was when you saw the vehicle.  You saw someone in the car, is that the position, someone driving the car?  What was the position?  
A.	I did not know him, but they said that the vehicle belonged to André Rwamakuba.  
Q.	How many people were in the car?  
A.	I did not get a chance to see because a crowd surrounded the vehicle and I was not able to look closely enough to determine how many people were on board the vehicle.  
Q.	Well, was there just one person in the vehicle or more than one that you saw?  
A.	It was not just one person. 
Q.	How many people did you see?  
A.	I have told you that I didn't pay attention, but there were other people in the vehicle and the large crowd surrounded vehicle, but I could not see them clearly, so I could not determine how many they were.  
Q.	Why were you interested in this vehicle?  
A.	I was not alone in being interested in the vehicle.  There were other people who were also interested in the vehicle and we wanted to know what had been taken out of the vehicle.  
Q.	When the vehicle arrived, why were you interested in the vehicle and not interested in what other people may have thought, what were you interested in?  
A.	I couldn't go to approach the vehicle because if I had done so I would have been killed.  
Q.	Why do you say that?  You just see a vehicle arrive -- 
A.	I said that if I had approached the vehicle, I would have been killed.  They did not want me to know what had been taken out of the vehicle because I might reveal the information and people might flee.
Q.	Let's just take it in stages.  All that happens is that this vehicle arrived in your centre, for all you know it could have contained two nuns and a priest.  Why are you saying what you are saying?  
A.	But we were not in church.  We were not in church.  The priest was not about to see mass -- Rwamakuba was not a priest. 
Q.	And you don't know who's come in a vehicle, but you tell us, as I understand it, that you are anxious about the vehicle so much so you don't go anywhere near it.  So what did you notice with such keen interest that you had other people who were in the vehicle?  How many were there, men or women, can you help us?  
A.	I did not see any women on board the vehicle, but I cannot tell you how many people were on board.  These people who came out of the car, they went into a house, but I did not see them, so I couldn't tell how many they were.  
Q.	So you didn't see people in the car, is that what you are saying?  
A.	I did not see how many people were on board the vehicle, but there were people in the vehicle. 
Q.	Did you see the people get out of the vehicle?  
A.	They parked the vehicle in front of the house.  They came out of it, they went into the house.  Then they came out of house afterwards and got into the vehicle and they drove off.  They drove in the opposite direction to the one that -- from which they had come. 
Q.	You have taken me to the next point.  You see, you had two opportunities in your evidence to see who was in the vehicle.  You can't tell us how many they were, you can't describe any of them; is that right? 
A.	I told you that there were people on board of the vehicle, but I didn't tell you how many they were. 
Q.	And, finally, in terms of this morning, I just ask you this:  You told us today in your evidence that it was a white car, but you never ever mentioned that to anyone till today, did you?  
A.	I think I have already said that this vehicle was white.  I don't know where you get that one from.  
Q.	Well, I am looking at your statement.  I am looking at any correction you have made and there is no indication you added anything to your evidence, or is it the case that this detail that it was white has come to you 11 years afterwards from your brother perhaps, recently?  Would that be right?  
A.	I told you that no one told me what happened.  I was an eyewitness myself.  You are talking about events that you did not witness.  I am talking about things that I saw for myself.  
Q.	I see the time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take the lunch adjournment now. 

Mr. Witness, we are going to take an adjournment for lunch.  During the break as a witness under oath, you are not to discuss the case with anybody; do you understand it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, we will return at around 2 o'clock.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I beg your pardon.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, too. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will resume at 2 o'clock. 
(Court recessed at 1233H) 
(Pages 25 to 36 by Sithembiso Moyo)
















(Court resumed at 1407H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  We can resume again. 

Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  You are going to resume your evidence on the same oath -- you're going to resume your evidence on the same oath that you took this morning to tell the truth.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper, there were just some technical issues that we were looking at. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	When we broke for lunch, we were just discussing your introduction today of a further detail of the car -- that it was white and I suggested to you that today was the very first time that you have ever mentioned to anyone a detail about the car like that.  Is that, in fact, the position?  Are you saying that on a previous occasion you had described the car as being a white car? 
A.	I had previously described the vehicle as being white.  If it wasn't written down in my statement, that is not my mistake. 
Q.	Would you agree it's strange that a particular specific detail like that, if mentioned by you, should be omitted by those who are gathering evidence?
A.	Well, that question should not be put to me. 
Q.	Or, is the fact this -- that it was only today that you mentioned to anyone that the car was white? 
A.	I said so previously. 
Q.	Have you ever discussed with your brother about the coming of the white car that brought the machetes? 
A.	I have already answered that question and I've told you that I hadn't had any such discussion with him. 
	I believe I already provided an answer to that question. 
Q.	Indeed, you did.  And, just before lunch, you told us that you hadn't even discussed it with him on the day you say it happened.  Is that correct? 
A.	Please, do not say what I haven't spoken.  I didn't discuss this issue with my brother. 
Q.	Well, let me put the question.  Did you discuss it on the 12th of April when you saw the car? 
A.	My answer is that I did not discuss it with him.  I believe I have already provided explanations.  Why are you moving backwards instead of going ahead to put other questions to me? 
Q.	So when the car came on the 12th of April, that afternoon, who were you with? 
A.	There were several people in the area where I was -- where I was. 
Q.	There may have been people all over the place in the Ndatemwa trade centre, but who were you with?  Will you provide their names to us, please, if you can? 
A.	Well, this happened 11 years ago.  That is a long time ago; I cannot remember the names of those who were with me. 
Q.	Can't you remember any of them? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Well, who, that afternoon, told you it was Rwamakuba? 
A.	People were saying, "That person over there whom you see is Rwamakuba." 
Q.	Well, I've asked you who you were with.  You can't remember; it's so long ago.  Can you remember who told you it was Rwamakuba? 
A.	Many people were saying it at the same time, people who knew him. 
Q.	So there's a whole load of people sort of around you, or near you going, "That's Rwamakuba, that's Rwamakuba, that's Rwamakuba, that's Rwama- --."  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	Yes, that is what I heard. 
Q.	But you don't remember who any of those people were? 
A.	There were many people and I do not remember their names. 
Q.	Now, when this car arrived, how many people were around the car?  You said that there was a number of people gathered around the car, how many people is that? 
A.	There were many, many people.  Some were young, some were old and I don't have an idea of the number of people. 
Q.	Was it as many people as there are in front of you in this courtroom? 
A.	Many more than those who are seated here in this courtroom. 
Q.	But you didn't see any refugees? 
A.	I have already said no, and I have provided an explanation.  I don't know why you are asking that question again. 
Q.	What was your explanation for there being no refugees?  I didn't hear it.  
A.	In my answer, I told you that I did not see any refugees. You are insisting on that issue.  Maybe you saw them.  I, for one, I didn't see any refugees. 
Q.	You say in your statement, "That was the first time I saw André Rwamakuba."  Did you see him? 
A.	I did not see him because he was behind Muhire's house and that is what I have told you. 
Q.	Well, he was in front of Muhire's house, you told us.  What do you mean he was behind Muhire's house? 
A.	No, what I said is that when he arrived, he parked the car in front of the veranda, then he went into Muhire's house with Muhire, Ndoli and Murangira.  So I don't know how it is that you come to the conclusion that I said that he was in Muhire's veranda.  I think I have already provided explanations. 
Q.	I -- I didn't mention veranda.  Let -- let me just get the position.  You see and name two people that are with André Rwamakuba going into Muhire's house. You see André Rwamakuba, yes or no? 
A.	Counsel, I didn't say two persons.  I said that people came out of the vehicle and went into the house and that, in the meantime, there were others surrounding the vehicle.  Subsequently, those who had gone into the house came out, went into the vehicle and left.  That has been my testimony. 
Q.	Well, just -- just one last time.  Did your eyes see André Rwamakuba?  Yes or no? 
A.	I told you that I did not see him.  I saw his car parked in front of Muhire's house.  He went into Muhire's house, came out, entered the vehicle and left to the place from which he had come or towards the direction from which he had come. 
Q.	Did your eyes see him get out and get in the car? 
A.	I have told you that there were several people.  The vehicle had come to a stop in front of the veranda. He went into the house and when he came out of the house, he went into the vehicle and left.  That is what I have already told you. 
Q.	But one thing is clear, and that is, you can't begin to describe the man you say who came called Rwamakuba.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	If I suggested he was 7-foot tall and weighed 150 kilos, that's not something that you would agree or disagree with.  You just wouldn't know, would you? 
A.	I have no idea.  You are the one who know him.  Maybe you know his weight. 
Q.	And how far were you from the vehicle when all this happened?  Just remind us, please. 
A.	I told you between **************. 
Q.	And were you in your shop or standing outside your shop? 
A.	I was outside the shop with other people. 
Q.	Did you remain outside the shop until the vehicle drove away or not? 
A.	We remained there and we kept looking until the vehicle left. 
Q.	Even though you thought it was very dangerous; is that right? 
A.	I haven't quite understood you, Counsel.  Would you please repeat your question. 
Q.	You thought it was dangerous being seen there, didn't you?  As a Tutsi? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And yet, you just stood there in front of your shop for -- for an hour -- whatever it was.  Did you see your brother -- 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...
Q.	Sorry, I interrupted you.  Sorry, I interrupted you.  You -- you said something and I spoke over you, which I shouldn't do, so can you just repeat what you just said. 
A.	You have asked me whether I was outside for an hour.  Well, my answer is that I was in front of my house and I was there for some time. 
Q.	And did you see your brother standing in the same spot?  
A.	I have already answered that my brother was in the centre. 
Q.	Did you see him standing in front of your shop with you?  Yes or no? 
A.	I have already said that there were several people there. 
Q.	Was your brother one of them?  Yes or no? 
A.	It is -- it is obvious that he is one of them.  There were several people and, in fact, nobody paid attention to who was standing next to them. 
Q.	As a -- would you -- would you say that anyone in Ndatemwa would know that you were a Tutsi? 
A.	Everybody knew that I was a Tutsi.  People know you in the area where you are born.  Everybody knows you. 
Q.	And I'm sure you -- I -- I hope you won't be offended if I was to suggest that you look like a Tutsi, don't you? 
A.	Well, you'd be mistaken, Counsel. 
Q.	Are you saying that you don't think you do? 
A.	You cannot take my ethnic group away from me.  Which ethnic group would you assign me to? 
Q.	And you saw these sacks being unloaded.  How were they carried into Muhire's?  Was it one man or more than one man who carried a sack? 
A.	One man carried one sack. 
Q.	Over his shoulder or just hanging down by the side of him, can you remember? 
A.	They picked up the sacks in their hands and took them into the house. 
Q.	And today was the first time you said they came from the boot of the vehicle, is that correct? 
A.	What would I have said previously, Counsel, in connection to those sacks? 
Q.	That they were unloaded from the vehicle.  Nothing specific about the boot of the vehicle. 
A.	I'm certain that I have stated previously that the bags were taken out of the boot. 
Q.	Well, it's not in your statement.  Did it -- did it look to you as if they contained machetes, these bags? 
A.	I already told you that I was not close enough to those bags, but I saw those who were lifting them up -- who picked them up.  I saw the persons who picked them up. 
Q.	Now, what happened after the car left?  What did you and your brother do? 
A.	Nothing. 
Q.	And how long did you stay at the shop? 
A.	I have already told you at what time I left the shop, Counsel. 
Q.	What time was that? 
A.	I think I told you the day on which I left the shop. 
Q.	Well, did you leave the shop at all the day that you say the car came? 
A.	I remained in my home. 
Q.	And that's the shop, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I lived in that shop. 
Q.	Did you leave the shop to go and tell your relatives about what had happened? 
A.	No, I did not leave the shop. 
Q.	Did your brother go to warn them or to tell them? 
A.	I have no idea.  You need to ask him. 
Q.	Well, the two of you are there.  You'd seen something remarkable.  Why didn't either one of you go and tell your family? 
A.	I didn't have time to go and give them this information. 
Q.	Why didn't you have time?  You had the whole evening.  
A.	I didn't have the time. 
Q.	So you left your family in ignorance of what had happened at what was a crucial and a difficult time in your lives; is that right? 
A.	My family members themselves were in a position to see that for themselves. 
Q.	Were they all in the centre then? 
A.	No.  They were in their homes, not in the centre.  It was a trading centre.  This was -- this was not a residential neighbourhood. 
Q.	And don't tell us where, but how far from your shop to the family home, your father's house, how far is it? 
A.	Quite a distance. 
Q.	But you're not able to help us in metres or distance like that, as a soldier? 
A.	I do not know.  I didn't measure that distance and, by the way, this was a rural area and I cannot speak in terms of kilometres. 
Q.	Did anything else happen in the centre that evening? 
A.	Nothing else.  Well, in fact, I was not a witness to any other event. 
Q.	You weren't aware of a big meeting at Muhire's that night? 
A.	Meetings usually took place in that meeting (sic) and it was not only that evening that a meeting held at his place. 
Q.	I've asked you if you witnessed anything that night?  That evening, did you witness anything? 
A.	I didn't step out or go out to find out.  I already told you that I was afraid; I was scared.  I went back into the house and I lay down. 
Q.	And you didn't go to the sorghum field to hide?  Is that right? 
A.	No, I merely went to bed.  I was no longer -- I no longer feared death. 
Q.	Did you hear that a famous Interahamwe called Ephrem had visited the centre that day? 
A.	Even before, he used to come to that trading centre. 
Q.	Did you see Ephrem at the centre that day? 
A.	I told you that several people were there.  I wasn't in a position to determine who was there and who wasn't there, and it's possible that he was there. 
Q.	Well, anything is possible, but you didn't see him?
A.	I have told you that many people were there.  I couldn't identify them, so it is possible that he himself was there but there were many people present. 
Q.	And let's come to the next day just fairly briefly.  The distribution of machetes, what time did that happen? 
A.	The machetes were distributed in the morning. 
Q.	And where were you when you saw that? 
A.	I have told you that when I awoke in the morning, I saw the distribution of machetes and I immediately fled. 
Q.	So what time did you wake up? 
A.	In the morning.  But at what time does one arise in the morning, Counsel? 
Q.	Well, I understand that it's quite common in Rwanda for people to get up at first light, at half past five.  Was that your practice? 
A.	I don't know.  Anyone can get up at any time that suits them, but anyhow, it's in the morning. 
Q.	What time did you get up on this troubled day? 
A.	I cannot remember what time I got up.  I saw that they were distributing machetes.  I took fright and I immediately fled.  What is more, I did not have a wristwatch to know at which time I had arisen.  
Q.	I think we can forget wristwatch -- watches at the moment.  This is a day when anything can happen and you have to be very alert to that possibility.  You're not going to lie in bed for three or four hours, are you -- in the daylight hours before you decide to get up?  So would it be fair to say that you got up at first light? 
A.	Yes, one gets up with the day.  One doesn't get up at night. 
Q.	And having got up, how long after you got up did you notice this distribution taking place? 
A.	I have said that when I arose, I noticed they were distributing the machetes, and I took flight. 
Q.	All right.  Let me ask you this:  Where was your brother? 
A.	At the same place, but when we fled, we each fled on our own -- in our own direction. 
Q.	And where did you go? 
A.	I fled.  We met at home and then we went to Kajevuba. 
Q.	And that's you and your brother met at home, is that right or not? 
A.	When he fled, he went on his way and I went on mine.  But we met at home and then fled together. 
Q.	So you're both together now, going towards Kajevuba; is that right? 
A.	Yes, we were together. 
Q.	Just coming back to the distribution, on one point, can I ask you this:  You say in your statement that you saw Muhire entering his house and coming out with a few machetes in his hands and handing them over to Hutu youths.  Is -- is that correct?  Is that your evidence? 
A.	Yes, that is what occurred, but it wasn't Muhire who was -- there was also Ndoli and Murangira who were helping him to distribute -- to do -- to do the distribution. 
Q.	Yes, I understand you to have said that.  And you watched all that for a bit and then you flee, as you told us, going home, joining your brother, and then making your escape with other members of your family.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	There's an old lady called Kankindi who was killed, who -- who lived in or near the centre.  She was the only Tutsi who was killed in the centre.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	She did not live at that trading centre.  She lived in the countryside and other people were also killed. 
Q.	Of the Tutsis who lived in the trading centre, aside from the two -- *************************** -- who were killed at Kayanga health centre, not at the trading centre, of the Tutsis who lived in Ndatemwa trading centre, were any killed, to your knowledge? 
A.	Some were killed, others fled.  ****************, his elder brother and his sister, were killed. 
Q.	They were killed at Kayanga.  I'm asking you, sir, whether any of the Tutsis at Ndatemwa were killed, and can you name any at Ndatemwa trading centre? 
A.	No one was killed there; they all fled. 
Q.	You refer in your evidence to learning at some point that the man, Rwamakuba, was a minister.  Do you agree that today is the first time that you've ever told anybody that he was a minister? 
A.	That is not true.  I have said it before that he was a minister.  It is not the first time I've mentioned it here -- it's not here that I mentioned it for the first time. 
Q.	Well, I'm afraid again it's not in your statement and you didn't take the opportunity at confirmation to add that perhaps significant detail. 
A.	I know that I did say that he is -- was a minister and I'm now repeating what I said before. 
Q.	And my very last enquiry is -- as to what happened when you did flee, you returned to Gasabo where you join the Inkotanyi.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	I said that I did not return to Gasabo.  I joined the army; I did not go back to Gasabo. 
Q.	Well, you may not have said it but my note read, "We spent two or three days in surrounding hills and the Inkotanyi finally overran Gasabo and one evening we went there.  In April, I no longer remember the date.  Yes, with my family."  Now I can, scribbling away quickly, get it wrong.  But, what's your position?  Did you --
A.	I said that after Gasabo was taken by the Inkotanyi, the people went where there was no fighting and I continued on my way with the soldiers -- that is when I joined the soldiers.  I did not return to Gasabo. 
Q.	So where did you actually join the soldiers? 
A.	It was at Gasabo, but I didn't return to the trading centre of Gasabo.  You're mixing up Gasabo trading centre and a place called -- locality named Gasabo. 
Q.	Well, I hadn't understood I was saying "trading centre," but just "Gasabo," so maybe I caused you to misunderstand what I was saying.  And you joined the Inkotanyi two or three days after you fled, which would be the 15th or the 16th of April.  Would that be correct? 
A.	No, that is not what I said.  I said that three days after we fled, I joined the army.  We fled after the 13th and it was after those days that I joined the army. 
Q.	I don't want to take up too much time on this, but you said this morning that you spent two or three days in surrounding hills.  The Inkotanyi finally overran Gasabo.  "We went there.  I don't remember the date."  How long do you say after you fled the trading centre, did you join the Inkotanyi at Gasabo?  How many days elapsed between those two events? 
A.	Two or three days later, we went there. 
Q.	Well, that is what I said, you see, and that would make it the 15th or the 16th of April.  Now, when you joined them, where did you next go with them?  Where did you go?  Where was the next place you went after Gasabo? 
A.	I don't think that it is adequate to put questions to me on military matters.  I came here to testify and not to speak of military matters. 
Q.	Just, please, answer the question.  Where did you go after Gasabo? 
A.	We went towards Kigali. 
Q.	And which route did you take? 
A.	Why do you want to know which route we followed, Counsel? 
Q.	You just answer the question --
A.	That does not concern the matter in hand. 
Q.	Can you just answer the question.  Briefly, which route did you take to get from Gasabo to Kigali? 
A.	We took several routes.  I can't describe them.  We went through the brush, the valleys, even through ravines.  I could not describe to you the route we took. 
Q.	You were born and brought up in this area, you tell us the route you took, please. 
A.	I have told you we went through the bush and the brush in the countryside, ravines.  We didn't take a straight route.  I cannot describe to you exactly what route we took.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President.  Mr. President, I avoid as much as possible intervening so as not to disturb my learned friend in his cross-examination where there are several opportunities where I could have done so.  I do not think this line of questioning is pertinent and I should like to avoid getting up each time to object -- that I feel that I should.  I think that we have insisted at some length on points that do not bear on the matter in hand (sic). 
MR. HOOPER:
The positions and activity of the RPF are part of my case, and this witness has got, quite clearly, direct personal evidence.  These are simple questions to answer and it won't take very long -- a matter of minutes, and I wonder what he is hiding. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I don't think that we could, on the basis of the answers just given by the witness, say that he is hiding something, and I do not think that he went down ravines.  I don't know that the route that he followed -- I don't see how that could be relevant or pertinent in the matter at hand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we think that the question of the route was a relevant question, but we think that the witness has -- has answered.  It's a question of how do you proceed because there's a level at which to push this exact question much further amounts to -- almost amounts to badgering. 
MR. HOOPER:
I won't -- I won't badger him, I hope.  Perhaps I can ask a more specific question relating to the area that we're concerned with, if that's permitted.  And the question is this: 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in going to Kigali did your route take you through any part of Gikomero commune? 
A.	No, I did not go via Gikomero. 
Q.	Gikomero commune, the entire commune, did you pass through any part of it? 
A.	No, I did not pass through Gikomero commune. 
Q.	All right.  That's as far as I think I can usefully take that.  But I'd just like to -- just understand something about the process of your recruitment.  When you met the RPF, what happened?  Were you just given a gun and joined the -- the file or -- or what?  Did they send you for training?  What happened? 
A.	You cannot exercise a function if you haven't been trained. 
Q.	Well, did they give you a gun when you joined up? 
A.	You cannot get into an office, pick up a pen and start taking down notes without having been to school, so you need to be trained before you can perform in any position or any function. 
Q.	Just answer that one question.  When you joined up, did they give you a gun? 
A.	I believe I have answered the question.  My answer is that you cannot write if you have not been taught to write or if you have not learnt writing.  So you cannot write if you haven't been to school. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, the answer you gave might contain -- might contain the information, but we would have to guess at what you actually mean.  Can you tell us just plainly what you meant by that answer? 
THE WITNESS:
I said that one cannot just pick up a gun and get engaged into fighting if one has not been trained in manipulating arms.  So you must, first of all, be trained in handling weapons before you can use them. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, maybe we would lose -- we'll waste more time if we put the question more directly to the witness.  For example, asking him whether he was trained as a soldier and at what time -- that might help us to gain some time. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you joined up, did they give you a gun?  Yes or no? 
A.	No, I wasn't given a gun. 
Q.	And so you followed the RPF to Kigali without a weapon?  Is that correct? 
A.	I, first of all, learnt how to manipulate these weapons before I was given one. 
Q.	Let me ask you it in another way.  When were you given a gun? 
A.	After I was trained in manipulating or handling weapons, but I don't remember the date. 
Q.	And -- and when did you get to Kigali?  What date was that? 
A.	I do not remember.  You know, in times of war you do not count days. 
Q.	Are you honestly trying to help this Chamber with your answers? 
A.	I am under the impression that the questions you are putting to me are not related to my statement.  You're questioning me on the army, on military activities.  That is not the reason for my appearing here to testify.  I didn't come to testify on the activities of the military in general. 
Q.	Perhaps you were even told not to mention it.  But let me finally -- and, I mean, finally -- ask you this:  After the RPF arrived in Gikomero commune, and in May and June of 1994, I suggest hundreds of innocent Hutu men, women and children were murdered by RPF and local Tutsi supporters.  Do you know anything about that?  Have you ever heard of such a thing happening? 
A.	No, I don't know anything about that. 
Q.	Have you ever heard that such a thing happened? 
A.	No, I never heard anybody say any such thing. 
Q.	And you, with your new gun, didn't play any part in any of that?  Is that right? 
A.	No, I didn't do any such thing. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will now continue your evidence.  The Prosecuting counsel will ask you a few other questions and you must answer them.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will be brief and I'll be putting a few statements arising from his statement and pertaining to the charges in the indictment. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	This morning, Witness, we talked about your cattle at length before and after 1994.  Let me avail myself of this opportunity to ask you a question on that point.  It has been your testimony that you owned some cattle in 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, we did have some cattle, some cows. 
Q.	How many cows did you own? 
A.	Six cows. 
Q.	Could you tell us who the owners of the cows were? 
A.	Those cows belonged to our family. 
Q.	When you talk about "our family", without mentioning names, could you tell us who the owners of the cows were? 
A.	Those cows belonged to my older brothers and to my sisters. 
Q.	Witness, what happened to the cattle that you owned in 1994? 
A.	The cattle were attacked with machetes and others were taken away. 
Q.	Did you talk about this in your statement or --? 
A.	Yes, I did mention that our cattle had been attacked -- 
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you --
A.	-- attacked with some cutting instruments. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, you have also mentioned that you provided information to the Gacaca every **************; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Could you be more specific, Witness, as to the time at which you provided such information to the Gacaca on **********? 
A.	Whenever I came into possession of any new information, I would forward it to the Gacaca. 
Q.	For how long have you been doing this, Witness?  One year, or two years, or three years? 
A.	The Gacaca proceedings started recently, less than a year ago. 
Q.	Witness, has it been your testimony that virtually all the members of your cellule were involved in the Gacaca proceedings; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	In answer to a question from Defence, Witness, you said that you are not in a position to provide the exact number of persons participating in the Gacaca. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us the exact number of members of your cellule? 
A.	No, I do not know the exact number of persons who live in our cellule. 
Q.	Witness, it may be surprising or it may appear surprising that you are not able to provide details as to dates.  Could you give us a reason for that? 
A.	The reason for which I am not able to give you specific dates is that during times of war you do not have a calendar to -- to check, and it is only those who probably expect a salary at the end of the month may want to -- who may want to do that in order to find out what they would earn.  So if you are not sure of your survival even until the next day, you do not pay such attention, because you are not sure what will happen.

1515H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, we talked at length about the day on which machetes were distributed and the time at which you got up.  
A.	Yes, I do remember. 
Q.	Could you tell us what your main concern was?  Was it with the distribution of the machetes or were you concerned about the time? 
A.	Well, I didn't pay attention to anything in particular because I wasn't sure that I would survive to the next day. 
Q.	Are you saying that you were in a state of fright? 
A.	I saw that and I was frightened, so I didn't pay attention to anything else because I expected death to come or to visit upon me by any means possible.  I was going to be killed. 
Q.	Witness, did you at any time, in your statement, mention that you knew André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, I did say so in my statement. 
Q.	How did you come to know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I heard people talk about him, and I am referring to people who knew him. 
Q.	Witness, you testified you did not know anybody from your centre who had been killed; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You also testified that you had left over an extended period and only returned to the centre in 2002, if I'm not mistaken? 
A.	No, I returned in 2001.  It is in 2002 that I left the army. 
Q.	I'm sorry, Witness, and we take good note of that. 

Did you become aware at any time whatsoever of people having been killed in your secteur?  I'm not talking of people who were beaten up, but I'm talking about people who had been killed.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us, to the best your knowledge, those persons who were killed? 
A.	I'm not in a position to name the names of all those persons. 
Q.	When you say that you cannot be aware of the names of all those persons, would it be that it is a significant number of persons? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, is this a re-examination --
THE WITNESS:
Yes, several.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this a re-examination issue?  

MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think the question was put to him about the victims and he did answer.  And it is in that connection that I am putting questions to him for clarification.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may ask the question.  I'm not sure you will get much further because the witness's answer, but -- 
MS. FALL: 
Obliged, Mr. President, and I will move on to something else.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I simply want to ask the witness to remind us, because this is something we talked about at length, under what circumstances he met the Inkotanyi when he sought refuge in Kajevuba.  
A.	I told you the following:  It was two or three days after that I met the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Hooper, two matters:  First question, were there any exhibits that you wanted to tender arising out of the examination?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  The statements in English and French, and the confirmation certificate of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are they available?  
MR. HOOPER: 
We have them except for the French, so can I defer that to tomorrow?  But I do have --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, any objection?  
MS. FALL: 
No objection, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we can do that in the absence of the witness tomorrow.  
MR. HOOPER: 
But I do have AVC in French, English, and that's -- all the documents that were not submitted yesterday.  We now have in order and perhaps this is a suitable moment, looking at the clock, just to deal with that.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I deal with that now?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I will just excuse the witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have come to the end of your evidence and you are free to go now.  I'd just like to thank you for coming to give -- testify before the Tribunal.  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused)
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I just seek a formal position from the Prosecution in respect of whether there was any pre-trial briefing or discussion with this witness prior to giving evidence today?  Sorry, Mr. -- 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I would like to say to Counsel Hooper that the Prosecution has its strategy, and it is not for me to disclose that to him here.  It is true that we do see some of our witnesses, but some we don't.  So, maybe I didn't have discussions with those witnesses in person, but I would probably use other people who the witness may not be able to identify here within the courtroom.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I asked the witness a very pointed question, I hope, in terms of whether he'd had any discussions and his response to me was that he hadn't, and I told him I'd have to -- I necessarily had to accept that statement.  But if the Prosecution have contrary -- contrary knowledge that there has been discussions, and it doesn't matter who held them, then, in my submission, they are duty bound to -- if it's the situation -- that's the situation, to correct the witness's evidence on that.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think my answer is clear enough.  Now, you have noticed the level of education of this witness.  When you talk about the Prosecutor to the witness, he may not be in a position to fully understand that concept.  What I have said is that we do have discussions with our witnesses, but maybe he had not recognised anybody here.  And on looking at the Prosecutor's bench, he probably didn't see any of the persons who may have had that discussion with him.  That is my position, and I believe it is very clear, Mr. President.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I will just say this, that I have received no will-say statement at all from this witness, but it's quite -- it's our case that there were significant discrepancies and that this witness has had an opportunity to put those discrepancies forward before today and hasn't had the two opportunities I know to correct those errors.  And so it's highly significant if there has been further discussion between the Prosecution and this witness.  And if those discussions have taken place, for my part, I can see no reason other than -- no reason for the Prosecution to withhold that information and, in fact, compelling circumstances to disclose it.  And the independence of the Prosecutor requires that.  
MS. FALL: 
I would like to thank my learned colleague for his concern about the independence of the Prosecutor, but it is not from him that we expect the independence.  We have it and we don't expect to receive it from him.  Whenever there has been any -- whenever any notes have been taken down, we have disclosed them to the Defence.  And if we didn't disclose any this matter -- in this matter, it is because no notes were taken.  

Now, during my re-direct, I believe that we can confirm from the transcripts and from the examination-in-chief whether I asked the witness as to whether corrections had been made to his statement and he said yes, he had effectively corrected his statement but that he wasn't aware whether those corrections were taken into account.  So I think we need to check at that level.  

Now, during cross-examination, the witness did clearly say that with regard to some facts, particularly the beatings, that those persons were beaten before André Rwamakuba arrived.  He said that he had made the correction but it wasn't effectively taken into account.  May I further say that reconfirmation is carried out, and as you have seen, we went to Kigali and conducted this reconfirmation, and sometimes we do get the material back and sometimes we do receive it, but we do not always have the time to cross-check and determine whether all the materials in the confirmation has been effectively taken down as provided by the witness.  But as far as the witness is concerned, once the confirmation is done, he doesn't have to see the document again to determine whether or not all the corrections have been taken down.  

Mr. President, I would not like to get into any polemics with the Defence team on this item, but as he has already said, we are the ones who determine the manner in which we work.  I can provide clarification on specific points that may be raised, and it's for me to disclose my strategy or the manner in which I want to conduct this case as far as this matter is concerned.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think the time -- this may be a suitable time to have the break.  We will consider the submissions that have been made and express a view when we resume after our break.  We adjourn this matter now.  

MR. HOOPER: 
Just before you adjourn, Mr. President, just -- can I indicate that I know Mr. O'Shea has a point that -- wishes to raise a point in respect of the signing or non-signing of will-say statements, and I don't know if that's a matter that would, in fact, perhaps be of interest prior to a decision being taken by the Chamber because it involves not -- a similar area and he -- I know he suggested to me that he'd take it perhaps at a convenient point this afternoon.  And I think it's an argument that will last ten minutes or so.  And I know it's a prepared argument.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, has the other side seen the argument?  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, this -- it will be an oral argument, but it has been discussed with the Prosecution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It has been discussed.

Ms. Fall, are you in a position to answer?  
MS. FALL: 
Yes, Mr. President, Counsel O'Shea did come to see me to ask me if it will be possible to accept that in the case of the will-says, that the documents were signed by the witness.  I objected to that request.  I told him we could not accept that to the extent that will-says are -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, there has been suggestion that he would like to present the argument to us this afternoon, and my question is whether you have sufficient information to be able to respond.  Would you be able to do that if the matter is raised today?  
MS. FALL: 
Yes, because that's what I was saying, Mr. President.  He already developed his arguments to me and I have already responded, so I can -- I thought I would give my response now, but I can wait.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we prefer to take the break now and address it when we return from the break.  Thank you.  So we'll take the break now.  
(Court recessed from 1535H to 1603H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have power?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have power?  

MR. O'SHEA: 
Not at all.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. O'SHEA:
We are back.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  But I think -- we have a technical problem with the power.  I have been informed by the technician that it will take about ten minutes to restore us to active work.  So we rise again for about ten minutes.  
(Court recessed at 1607H)
(Pages 48 to 53 by Gifty C. Harding)


























(Court resumed at 1617H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we are back on air.  I thought that we should separate the issue that arose just before the break from the legal arguments that we are about to hear, because Ms. Fall, you made certain hints in your response to Mr. Hooper's request.  And we think that -- that the Prosecutor -- that you should clarify the position with regard to the interview conducted by the Prosecution with the witness.  But that is something which can be done tomorrow; maybe I don't think it necessarily needs to be done now.  I don't want to complicate that with the submission that is being made now on the will-say statements.  

Yes, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
I'm grateful, Your Honour.  

Yes, may it please Your Honours, this is an application to request that the Chamber direct the Prosecution in relation to all future will-say statements which are not yet disclosed on the Defence, but may be, that such will-say statements, the content thereof be either read by the witness or read to the witness and the witness sign those will-say statements.  

Let me at the outset describe the parametres of this application.  I am not here addressing the admissibility of will-say statements.  We fully accept and we assert that will-say statements, as any other kind of witness statement, are discloseable and admissible.  That is not the issue.  The issue here is what is the fairest procedure to be adopted in the course of investigations for ensuring a fair trial and the minimum guarantees under the statute of this Tribunal, which I will come to.  

Secondly, I would just like to say in reference to the parameters of this application that it is not our application that the Prosecution go back to witness statements, note d'enquêteurs, will-say, or whatever the nomenclature might be which have already been disclosed on the Defence.  We do not impose or wish to impose that burden on the Prosecution, we confine our argument to future will-say statements.  

If I may refer Your Honours, to begin with, to the minimum guarantees in the statutes for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda which I say form the primary basis of this application, I refer to Section 20(4)(b) which gives the right of the Accused to adequate facilities for the preparation of his defence.

Secondly, I refer to Section 20(4)(e) which affords the Accused the right to examine the witnesses against him.

And, thirdly, I refer to Section 20(4)(c) of the statute which affords the right of the Accused to a trial without undue delay.  

In my submissions, Your Honours, Rule 54 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence gives the Chamber a fairly broad discretion to adopt procedures which it believes are fair and favour the fair administration of justice.  Rule 54 is, in a sense, akin for Rules of Procedure to 89(B) which deals with Rules of Evidence.  Some days ago I referred to 89(B) which refers to the fair administration of justice where the Rules do not specifically provide for matters, the Chamber has the power to adopt such Rules of Evidence which are favourable to the fair administration of justice.  And I say that Rule 54 is, as it were, the procedural limb of that inherent power.  

Now coming to will-say statements, in my respectful submission, there is no magic in the title given to a document which is produced as a result of an interview with a witness.  We have seen during the course of this trial a number of different types of terminology used to describe a document which reflects the content of an interview with witness.  In my respectful submission, what has been called in this trial a witness statement and what has been called a will-say statement, or a confirmation, or a note d'enquêteurs, all of these are essentially the same.  They serve essentially the same function, which is to put the Accused on proper notice of the case against it, and to enable the Defence to have proper facilities in time to prepare its defence.

Your Honours, I hope, have received a copy of an authority through your assistants.  Is that right,    Your Honours?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The name of the case is -- 
MR. O'SHEA: 
The name of the case is Prosecutor against Samuel Hinga Norman, et al. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have received it. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, thank you, decided on the 16 of July 2004 before the special court of Sierra Leone decision on disclosure of witness statements and cross-examination.  I should just note at this juncture, for context, that the Rules of Procedure ane Evidence of the special court for Sierra Leone effectively adopted the Rules of Procedure of Evidence of the International Criminal Tribunal For Rwanda and have been amended, subsequently, in various ways during plenary sessions of that court, but they remain very similar in content and, indeed, in numbering.

The reason I refer Your Honours to this decision is with regard to the meaning of a witness statement.  So, the actual issue in this case, the issue of the rights of disclosure to the Defence is not the issue before us.  But what is of interest is the way in which the Court defined the witness statement and defined it in accordance with how other Trial Chambers and Appeal Chambers in other international tribunals have done so, it is I, think, in one of the decisions or one of the lastest decisions that deal with that.  And if I refer Your Honours to paragraph 10 which is to be found on page 5 of this decision, the Chamber embarks upon a definition of witness statement, having referred to Black's law dictionary, the Chamber goes on; "Indeed, the Chamber observes that nowhere in the Rules is a witness statement defined.  It is worth noting that the Appeals Chamber of the --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you please just slow down -- sorry.
MR. O'SHEA: 
 -- an account of -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, could you repeat that at a slightly slower pace.
MR. O'SHEA:
-- translation --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can you hear the English booth, sorry?
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Thank you for that reminder.  And I apologise to the interpreters.

Well, I indicated to one of the interpreters before the break that I had not made sufficient copies, but I lent my copy over the break so that they could examine this paragraph, and then it was brought back to me; but I will read -- I will read the paragraph slowly.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The photocopy machine wasn't working, that is why we didn't get a copy. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I think if I read it slowly -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, that will be all right.  Could Counsel O'Shea listen to the English channel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, is your hearing on?  The English channel thinks it would be sufficient if he just read it slowly. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I will read it slowly, but I found one.  I apologise, I realise how important it is not to upset the interpreters, and I will try not to do so in the future.
Right, I have an indication that we have it.  If the interpreters could go to page 5 of that decision, paragraph 10 of that decision, that is what I am reading.  I will start again:  "Indeed, the Chamber observes that nowhere in the Rules is a witness statement defined.  It is worth noting that the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY has considered that the usual meaning to be ascribed to a witness statement is "an account of a person's knowledge of a crime which is recorded through due procedures in the course of an investigation into the crime." And I just note at that juncture that the decision cited is in the case of Blaskic before the ICTY.

The Chamber goes on that: "The Tribunals have also considered that transcribed trial testimony, radio interviews, unsigned witness declarations and records of questions put to witnesses and answers given, constitute witness statements."

This decision was confirmed in a later decision, which I don't have, which was dated the                      1st of October 2004 where the special court applied that definition to the issue of whether the notes of investigators needed to be disclosed, and held that they did.  But the issue here is not disclosure, but the point here being that in my submission, a will-say statement is to be considered as a witness statement.  So, whatever is the fair position with regard to how one should deal with witness statements, applies equally to will-say statements as it would do to what has been referred to as an original witness statement.

Having argued that these statements are all essentially the same, effectively, being a recount of facts from the witness, let me draw the Trial Chamber's attention to the consequences of drawing a difference.  And they are significant.  

In the course of these proceedings, Mr. Morley, who I notice sitting at the back listening to this argument, at one point attempted to develop the Prosecution's view on what was the significance of will-say statement and note d'enquêteurs notes and, indeed, witness statements, placing emphasis on the fact that it was the testimony of the witness before the Trial Chamber which was the most important aspect of how the Trial Chamber looked at the evidence of the Accused.

And it is noteworthy that the way in which that point was developed by Mr. Morley clearly shows the problem in my submission.  The first problem which arises, if one draws a distinction between a witness statement and a will-say statement for the purposes of signature, and the reading of it by the witness is this, that there are occasions when a will-say statement may contain more information than the original statement itself.  That was the case, for example, in our submission with Witness GLM.

An original statement was produced, the will-say which came subsequently was, in my submission, far more thorough in its treatment of the evidence than the original statement, yet the will-say statement was not signed and the original statement was.  

The second consequence of drawing a distinction is this, that when the Accused is exercising his right to cross-examine the witness, and is attempting to draw out inconsistencies between what the witness is saying in the box and what the witness has said on a prior occasion, that task becomes all the more difficult, and to some extent almost hopeless, in the event that the witness can easily escape from his prior statements, or easily escape or discern those prior statements.  Obviously if a statement is not reread by the witness and not signed by the witness, then it is easy for the witness to say, well, I disown that statement.  This affects the right to cross-examine effectively.  

The third consequence of drawing a distinction between will-say statement and witness statement is this:  That if such a distinction is made, we come to this; if the original statement is shorter or less substantial than the will-say statement, and then the will-say statement goes into a number of matters which were not gone into in the original statement, and then it is not signed and, therefore, its accuracy is not assured, it increases the likelihood of new evidence coming out in the witness box.  The consequence of that is a potential adjournment and potentially unprepared cross-examination.

The fourth consequence is this; lack of transparency.  In some jurisdictions, which adopt the adversarial system, not only is the interview with the witness signed, but there is some recording of that event, such that it can be gone back to.  That is not the case here, except insofar as the words are written down on a piece of paper.  Somebody speaks to the witness behind closed doors.  There is no way that the Defence or the Trial Chamber can determine what happened behind those closed doors.  But if the witness statement has been signed and read through, at the very least, we can be assured that the witness has actually seen the document which has been produced out of that interview.  And that assurance promotes the transparency of the proceeding.

The fifth difficulty, and perhaps the most dangerous one for the Defence of drawing a distinction between different types of witness statements is this, and this is what Mr. Morley alluded to some days ago, at the end of the day when Your Honours are deliberating on this evidence, and drafting a judgement, it is inevitable that once the Defence has attempted to draw out inconsistencies with prior statements, that the Chamber will attach far less weight to that kind of point with regard to an unsigned will-say statement than it would to a statement which has been read by the witness, or read back to him and signed by that witness.  And that, in essence, is the greatest danger for the Defence and almost renders useless the right to cross-examine the witness, certainly insofar as prior inconsistencies are concerned within witness statements.

So, Your Honours, in conclusion, for us this is a neat and small, but it is a very significant and important point.  It may be a point which has not been addressed properly or raised properly before, but that does not detach from its worth.  These are -- these international criminal proceedings are developing.  And we constantly attempt to improve the procedures as has been done over hundreds of years in national jurisdictions.

Under Rule 54 Your Honours have the power to make such a direction.  And such a direction, in our submission, would promote the fairness, transparency and integrity of these proceedings, and promote the most effective accordance to the minimum guarantees which are set out in the statute of the Tribunal.  In our submission, in an adversarial system, it lies on the Prosecution to act as fairly and squarely as possible with its evidence, and to promote transparency to the greatest extent possible.

And, therefore, we say that Your Honours should exercise this discretion in order to prevent the kinds of problems which I have outlined, recognising that on the one hand any kind of statement taken from a witness serves essentially the same function; and on the other hand, drawing distinctions between them could cause difficulties.

Your Honours, those are my submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  

Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will not be -- I will not take as much time as my learned colleague.  Let me simply say that the references made with regard to the court in Sierra Leone, have not been very useful to me because I received them just a while ago and it is in English.  I need them translated so that I may understand properly.  However, the same instruments seem to have been upheld in a decision from our own Tribunal with an appeal decision in the Niyitegeka case, a decision of 9 July 2004.  I think an excerpt was read from a decision.  I hope that I will enjoy the same benefit of reading an excerpt from the Niyitegeka decision.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
I'm aware of its existence but I didn't know you were going to refer to it. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the interpreters, Mr. President, do not have a copy either.  Thank you. 
MS. FALL: 
Well, I didn't know that my learned colleague was going to refer to that decision from the special court in Sierra Leone and I wasn't aware of its existence.
May I proceed, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that all the interpreters were saying is that they are requesting that you read a bit slowly to facilitate the translation. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Page 15 of the Niyitegaka decision in French, and in respect of will-say and witness statements refers to 62(A) which provides that, "The Prosecutor shall disclose to the Defence copies of the witness statements and all statements Prosecutor intends to call."  None of the two international tribunals have clearly defined the term witness statement, as defined under rule -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, we missed that quotation by the Prosecutor.  If she would repeat the reference. 
(Pages 54 to 60 by Donna M. Lewis)

























1645H
MR. PRESIDENT:
You heard what the translators said?  They have requested that you repeat a bit.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And specify the rule because we don't find it under the rule referred to.
MS. FALL:
(Not interpreted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would request you also to go back to where you specified the rule.  I am just alerting you to the problem the interpreters expressed and they wish that you go back to where you specified the rule and start your quotation from there. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Rule 66(A) (iii) -- Rule 66(A) (ii) -- I believe that's where the problem arose.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It previously came out as 62(A).  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, may I just indicate that I have found the judgment on Mr. Hooper's computer, but I -- could I just be told the paragraph number again.
MS. FALL:
In my version which is French, a translation of Niyitegeka v. Prosecutor or Prosecutor v. Niyitegeka, page 15 of the French version -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Page number, please?  
MS. FALL:
There is no paragraph number in my version.  

May I proceed, Mr. President?  No clear distinction has yet been made between witness statement as defined under Rule 66(A) (ii) and the internal documents that may be developed by a party which need not be disclosed or exchanged, pursuant to Rule 66 and 67.  

I proceed.  Records of questions put to the witness by the Prosecutor and answers provided thereto shall constitute witness statements as defined under Rule 66(A) (ii) of the rules.  So these will include records of questions put to the witness by the Prosecutor.  It is necessary to underscore the questions put to the witness in order to understand the statement.  Once the question has been put to the witness, it is no longer part of an internal record.  It does not fall within the purview of sub A of Rule 66.  Therefore, it is not covered by the provisions of this rule in terms of protection.  

However, if one of the representatives of the Prosecutor or any member of the Office of the Prosecutor were to write down a sentence which is not subsequently put to the witness, that question need not be disclosed.  And I proceed.  Similarly, no records or notes written by a representative of the Prosecutor or any other member of that office within an interview of a witness is subject to disclosure except such information were brought to the attention of the said witness, and I will stop there for now.  

Mr. President, in view of this decision, may I submit that there is no clear definition of what these internal materials or documents may be.  As far as witness statements are concerned, we all agree that these are the statements that were prepared by the investigator, which were read to the witness and which were corrected by the witness and signed by the witness.  I believe that this does not apply as far as will-says or investigator's notes are concerned.  

I believe that a will-say is part of the documents that are defined under Rule 67(D) of the Rules, and it is for this reason that such material is disclosed to the Defence as required by the Rules.  "If either party discovers additional evidence or information or materials which should have been produced earlier pursuant to the Rules, that party shall promptly notify the other party and the Trial Chamber."  

I believe this is what we have done out of a desire for transparency, and that is why the Prosecutor, whenever a witness is being prepared, gathers information or clarification in respect of the witness statement, and upon the Prosecutors returning to the office, a document is prepared along the lines of the written materials and if there is notice that some information ought to have been disclosed, the Prosecutor so proceeds. 

I would like to thank Counsel O'Shea when he said that will-says are, indeed, statements which ought to be signed in order to establish that the witness effectively saw the said will-say and signed it.  But, unfortunately, that is not the case.  When we prepare will-says, quite often those materials are not prepared in the presence of the witness because they are developed when the investigator or the Prosecutor comes back to the office, and quite often, the witness does not get to see the will-say.  Quite often, between the time we meet a witness and take down his or her statement and then subsequently find out that there is additional new information upon our return to the office and sometimes this is even the day before the witness appears and that could be one of the reasons for disclosure taking place either the previous day or on the same day.  It does happen that the witness may not even be aware of the existence of a will-say.  Therefore, a will-say statement is not a witness statement because the witness does not necessarily see it, and, therefore, cannot sign it.  

Mr. President, to be brief, I would simply say that while agreeing with the position of the Defence in respect of rights of the Accused, all the relevant instruments 20, 24, 54 -- yes, we do agree with all of those instruments because, indeed, it is within the purview of the Trial Chamber's competency to determine as it wishes for the delivery of justice.  All what we can say as of now, is that we would simply defer to the Trial Chamber because there might be contradictions that exist and Counsel O'Shea is speaking about will-says and statements, indicated that there might be a number of contradictions, but it falls on the Trial Chamber alone to determine whether there are any such contradictions between that which is contained in the witness statement as compared to his will-say and his effective testimony before the Court.  I therefore respectfully defer to the Trial Chamber regarding this matter of will-say.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honours, in my submission, the reference to Rule 66 and Rule 67 somewhat confuses the issue.  This is not an issue of disclosure or non-disclosure.  We are not saying here that there is an issue of disclosure or non-disclosure.  My assertion is that a will-say statement is a witness statement within the definition following the jurisprudence that I have cited and, therefore, would have to be disclosed and Rule 66 has been disclosed, but the disclosure is not the issue.  The issue is the extent to which we can effectively cross-examine prior inconsistent statements and the extent to which we have proper notice of the case against us, in the sense that if we don't have the most accurate notice of the case against us; that may cause difficulties.  

Now, the frank admission of my learned friend that the will-say statement is often not even shown to the witness, in my respectful submission, only reinforces my point.  It is not that it cannot be shown to the witness.  The witness is here in Arusha by that time.  It is just a question of going from one building to the other, or from one room to the other.  So the will-say statement can be shown to the witness, can be read by the witness, its contents can be confirmed by the witness and it can be signed to be correct or incorrect.  And in our submission, that procedure should be followed.  Experience has shown that the will-say can produce a substantial amount of information which the Defence has not seen before, and in those circumstances, it is in the interest of justice that the Defence have the most accurate picture of what the witness wants to say, and also that the Defence has the ability to cross-examine effectively in the sense that the prior statements of the witness cannot be disowned so readily. 

Let me just say because I was trying to listen to the reference to Niyitegeka, and I am a bit handicapped because I haven't seen it in front of me, but let me just say that it is not our assertion that there has been some grave violation of a minimum guarantee here.  What we are saying is that there are minimum guarantees which include the right to examine a witness, the right to trial without undue delay, and the right to adequate facilities for preparation, and what we are asking of Your Honours is to give a direction under Rule 54, which will assist in ensuring that those rights are respected to the greatest degree possible.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I thank both counsel for -- this is a very interesting discussion.  I think it will be -- we all think that we should take some time to consider the arguments and we will give our decision as soon as possible.  I don't -- to an actual detail, but we will address it promptly and give our decision as soon as possible.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I am grateful, Your Honour.
MS. FALL:
I also thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, thank you.  

Well, we still have 30 minutes.  I don't know if we could start the next witness now. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The witness is here and we can put those 30 minutes to good use. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We could deal with the exhibit issues tomorrow morning, if that would probably be better for everybody when the first documents can be arranged.  

Mr. Hooper, we could deal with the exhibits issue tomorrow morning.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When all the documents have been organised properly.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness does not have a headset, Mr. President, points out the Kinyarwanda interpreter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think she has just put it on now.  

Yes, good afternoon, Madam Witness.  Can you hear me?   
THE WITNESS:
Yes, good day, Mr. President, I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have now - you are going to commence your testimony and I am going to ask the registrar to give you the oath to tell the truth.  Are you willing to take it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar.
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  I am ready.
(Declaration by Witness GIN in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
May it please the Court. 
WITNESS GIN,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good day, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good day, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, you are a protected witness.  I will undertake your identification now by submitting a document to you and you will tell us whether the information the document bears is correct.  

Madam Witness, can you tell us whether you see your name on that document?  
A.	Yes, I see my name on this document.  
Q.	Yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We can't here Counsel's questions because she is speaking before the interpretation is finished.  
THE WITNESS:
There is not my date of birth; there is only the year of my birth.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	You are quite right.  There is only the year of your birth? 
A.	Yes, the year of my birth is indicated here. 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel wait after the witness answers, please?  We are not getting the questions.  
BY MS. FALL:

Q.	And the reference to your ethnic group?  
A.	Yes, there is such a reference.

Q.	You mean that this is no longer correct, that that reference is no longer correct?  
A.	Yes, the occupation indicated is not my current occupation, Counsel.
Q.	Can you correct the document and indicate what your current occupation is, should you have one?  
A.	At present I have no work *************.  
Q.	Could you make that -- the correction on the document by saying presently no occupation, unemployed, no occupation?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the correct status ****************, I think.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we have gone through this procedure to prevent the possibility of revealing your identity by disclosing details about you.  Now, the question required you to write your present status and not to state it publicly, do you understand me?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, should I move the reference from the record?  

Yes, I order that these references be put under seal.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President, for helping to protect the witness.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	And your occupation in April 1994, is that reference correct?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Could you correct it and indicate what your occupation was in April 1994?  
A.	If you will authorise me to do so, I can do so.  
Q.	Please do so.
MS. FALL:
The witness asked if she could make the correction and I told her she could do so.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Are you ready, Witness?  The information pertaining to your place of birth; is that correct?  
A.	No, the information is not correct.  
Q.	Could you please make the necessary correction?  
A.	(By order of the Court this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, I must remind you again, that you are asked to write the information and not to state it publicly.  And again, I direct that this information be placed under seal.

A.	That information is correct.  
Q.	And the information concerning where you were in April 1994; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Madam Witness, can you write down the date, indicate the date, today's date on the document and sign it, please?
(Pages 61 to 67 by Sithembiso Moyo)






















     1715H
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we should like this document to be admitted as evidence as a Prosecution exhibit and, unless I'm very much mistaken, it should be entered as Exhibit P. 46. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence and placed under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 46 admitted, under seal)
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GIN, have you ever testified before this Court? 
A.	Yes, I have testified before this Tribunal. 
Q.	Can you specify in which matter you testified? 
A.	Yes, I came to testify in the Prosecutor versus Kamuhanda. 
Q.	Was that the only matter in which you testified? 
A.	I also came to testify in the Rwamakuba trial. 
Q.	Can you specify on what date you came to testify in the Rwamakuba trial? 
A.	I remember that I came in April 2005.  I came on several occasions, but I don't remember the dates. 
Q.	Was it the 10th of April 2005?  Can you confirm that date, 10 April 2005?
A.	No, it was in 2004. 
Q.	(Unintelligible).  Now, Madam, we've have had so many (unintelligible) that's why I made that mistake. 
	Madam, have you had the occasion to testify in Rwanda? 
A.	To date, the trials have not restarted, but I have provided information as to the events that occurred in my area. 
Q.	Can you tell us in what context you provided that information? 
A.	I did not testify before any court but I was interviewed by judicial police investigators and it is to them that I provided the information. 
Q.	Madam, have you been convicted?  Please answer in very general terms so that your identity is not revealed. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Have you already had occasion to meet the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I have.  I did meet them. 
Q.	Could you tell us the number of times you have met them? 
A.	On several occasions, in several different places, so I cannot specify the number of times we had the opportunity to meet. 
Q.	Did you, on those occasions, make any statements? 
A.	Yes, I made statements. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many statements you made? 
A.	Are you speaking of the statements made before this Tribunal or any other court? 
Q.	I'm referring to the statements you made to the investigators of the ICTR. 
A.	I made a statement in the Kamuhanda trial on three occasions, I think, and then the present trial.  I also made three statements, if my memory is correct. 
Q.	For the time being, Madam, we will stick to the statements made in the André Rwamakuba trial.  So in this trial, how many statements did you make? 
A.	I think, it was three written statements. 
Q.	Did you sign those three statements? 
A.	Yes, some statements are signed, others are not. 
Q.	Can you tell us the number of statements that you signed? 
A.	I think I signed one statement, and on the other two occasions, I didn't sign because the written statements were not brought back to me. 
Q.	Can you tell us on what date you made the statement that you signed approximately, if you can't remember exactly -- 
A.	I don't remember the month or the date, but I believe it was in 1998. 
Q.	But, Madam Witness, before signing that statement, did you re-read it? 
A.	I ran through it rapidly because I was alone at work and I was not given permission, and I couldn't tell them to go away because we'd already met on three occasions, so I read through it quickly and I signed. 
Q.	Where were you living in April 1994?  And, here again, please answer in general terms in such a way so as not to reveal your identity. 
A.	I was living in Kigali-rural préfecture. 
Q.	Can you tell us in which commune? 
A.	Yes, in Gikomero commune. 
Q.	On the 6th of April 1994, did you still reside in Gikomero? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I mentioned the date, the 6th of April 1994.  Did something eventful occur on that day that affected you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us about it? 
A.	During the night, the president of Rwanda's plane was shot down. 
Q.	Can you tell us how you learnt of that incident? 
A.	We live on top of a hill in Kigali, so we -- so we could see the airport and when the aeroplane crashed, we saw lights and we heard explosions.  And about midnight, there was then -- music was broadcast over the radio, and at midnight we were told that it was the president's aeroplane that had been shot down and that the president was dead. 
Q.	And what did you do after the announcement of President Habyarimana's demise? 
A.	What could I do?  I couldn't do anything. 
Q.	Did you stay at home? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How long did you stay at home? 
A.	I'm speaking on the day in which the plane was shot down, but subsequently, we would flee and then go home. 
Q.	You said you would flee.  For what reasons did you flee?  What reasons motivated you to flee? 
A.	It's because in the vicinity of our residents, they had begun killing the Tutsi. 
Q.	And can you tell us who were the people who had begun to kill the Tutsi? 
A.	It was somewhat distant.  We couldn't see and identify the killers, so I can't tell you who it was -- whether it was someone or other and, also, I don't know the names of those people. 
Q.	Now, can you describe who were the people doing those murders, even if you can't name them?  
A.	I cannot name them, but I can say that there were some policemen, Interahamwe and ordinary inhabitants of the area who took part in the killings. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, it's 1730 hours.  Should I proceed or is this the right time for the break? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think it's the right time for the break.  Thank you. 

Madam Witness, we're going to have to take the evening break now and you will continue your evidence tomorrow.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As you have already taken the oath of a witness, you are not to discuss the case with anybody during this or any other adjournment of the trial while you are giving evidence.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

We will take the adjournment now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, just before we rise, I'm wondering if the witness could leave the court, I just want to raise something.  It doesn't directly, necessarily concern her. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness is excused. 
(Witness excused)
MR. HOOPER:
One matter has been superseded by events, I'm told, so I - I won't even mention it.  The other matter is this.  In a way, it touches on a difficulty that arose earlier today, but it's specific to this witness.  I don't know whether she was spoken to by anyone from the Prosecution prior to giving evidence, whether there was any preparation to her case.  I suspect there probably was, but I don't know. 

I'd like to take this opportunity, without seeking a direction from Your Honour, or necessarily a response from my friend at this moment, to really put the Prosecution on notice that if there has been any such meeting and if the Prosecution, as a consequence, are aware of any expected changes in detail of her evidence  -- any alterations in that way -- that we haven't received a will-say statement, and that we'd like the Prosecution to consider carefully, whether or not or reconsider -- if they have already thought about it -- to reconsider carefully whether or not the Defence should be put on notice of any such possible changes. 

I think it would be unfortunate if it was to develop in the course of this witness's evidence if she were to say, for example, that she told so and so this or mentioned this a little while ago and the Defence haven't been put on notice by the Prosecution.  So that is my concern, in effect.  Again, I don't seek any direction from Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Ms. Fall, you don't need to respond at this time, unless you particularly wish to, but I think that Mr. Hooper has raised the point that is worthy of some consideration.  But we can take the adjournment now. 

Yes, we will adjourn now. 
(Court adjourned at 1737H)
