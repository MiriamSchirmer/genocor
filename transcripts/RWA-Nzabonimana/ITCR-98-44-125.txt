MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, comprising of Judge Byron, 
Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday the 14th of June 2005, for the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  
MR. PRESIDENT:

MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honour, Don Webster and Dior Fall for the Prosecution. 
MR. HOOPER:
Good morning, unchanged since yesterday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
UPENDRA SINGH BAGHEL,
RE-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Baghel.  

We're going to pick up where we left off yesterday.  I think the last thing we were discussing was what Mr. Hooper referred to as composite photos, and I was asking you to look at that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we have it handed up to the witness again, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER 
Q.	Mr. Baghel, looking at the composite and not relying on any other information, would you be able to tell that this was, in fact, Gikomero centre, based on your recollection?  
A.	Good morning.  If I look at it, then it seems to be a long row of houses where only eight or nine houses have been shown on one side.  In fact, on this side these are the houses.  But, other side, is not covered at all, so it does not give the appearance of centre exactly.  It gives a road is passing through, and only on one side, eight to nine houses are there.  If you go to Gikomero centre these eight to nine houses, the front portion if you measure, may not be more than 50 metres.  So, it does not give exact picture of the centre; it gives only one side of the road.  
Q.	Okay.  It's understood that only one side can be shown because the camera is looking in one direction, so you don't see the houses that are behind the photographer.  And my concern is looking at those series of photos that have been assembled in a composite, can you tell just looking at it that this is Gikomero centre?  Does it fairly represent what you saw when you were in Gikomero centre in November 2003?  
A.	If camera is focused to take all these houses at one time, then I do not think that all the houses can come, unless a large area will also come in the photo.  
Q.	Well, does the photo make the area look bigger than it is or smaller than it is (microphones overlapping)...  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster (Microphones overlapping)... 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is your witness.  You can't really cross-examine him. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't believe I was cross-examining him, Your Honour.  What I'm trying to do or what I'm trying to elicit is whether the photo makes the area look bigger, smaller or the same -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)... You have a view, which your witness does not seem to share exactly.  That seems clear from the testimony up to now.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, can you identify GIN's house on this composite simply by looking at the photograph?  
A.	By looking at the photograph, the house of GIN has not come at all. 
Q.	In relation to issues that are relevant to this case, based on your understanding of the case, is there anything depicted in this photograph that will be helpful?  
A.	If I see the case and from my experience and my testimony also, house of GIN has come into picture.  But in this photograph, the house of GIN has not been covered at all.  
Q.	Would you be able to say what end of the photograph we would find GIN's house, if we were looking at it at a different angle?  Would it be the right end of the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But Mr. Webster, he has just said that the house is not shown at all.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Judge, my understanding from what Mr. Hooper was saying was that this is a composite of the side of the square where GIN's house is.  Now, the fact that GIN's house is not seen on the photo -- (Microphones overlapping)...  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Hooper was not giving evidence. 
MR. WEBSTER:
He was giving evidence, that's the problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hoop -- Mr. Webster, that's a conclusion which you have drawn.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper was not sworn as a witness and we are taking note of what Mr. Baghel, who is a witness, and is giving evidence on oath -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay, my concern -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, Mr. Baghel -- it was just your question that I thought was not proper.  Mr. Baghel had said that the house of GIN was not shown at all.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR PRESIDENT:
And then you asked him which side of the photograph the house was.  So that was not a proper questioning following what you had just said.    
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is all.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, what side of the square of -- excuse me, what side of Gikomero centre is Witness GIN's house?  
A.	If you -- if you approach Gikomero centre from Kigali side or Gikomero commune side, then when the centre is start (sic), the house is in the beginning.  And if I take this photograph as a reference, then on the right side of the photograph.  
Q.	Thank you.  I'd like to direct our attention now to what has been marked for identification as ID. 1.  This is the drawing with the red and blue lines on it.  Mr. Baghel, looking at this sketch, if there were no markings on it indicating the various locations and you were solely directed to look at the red and blue lines, would you be able to distinguish what was depicted on this sketch?  
A.	If there are no marking on the sheet ID. 1 then even though I was staying in Kigali for more than 
	four years, I cannot make out the meaning of the lines.  
Q.	Now, looking at the sketch and taking into consideration the mark -- the -- the place names that Mr. Hooper had put on the sketch, where you see CND in the middle, and Nyarugenge to the left-hand side, looking at it as he drew it, does it seem drawn to scale to you in relation to what is indicated on the sketch?  
A.	It does not seem to be drawn to the scale.  In the study, I had opportunity to see the CND and through CND, I could guess that it's a rough drawing done on pen to (unintelligible) or some kind of software.  
Q.	Do you find it helpful at all, based on your knowledge of Kigali, to understand the roadways that lead into and out of Kigali?  If you were looking at this sketch, how helpful is it to you, in terms of understanding the layout of the roads?  
A.	If there is a sketch that is presented, a long with the markings, the place names, then it makes some sense.  But not the holistic sense of the roads going out and going in -- or coming in.  
Q.	You had compiled -- or you had assembled a map which was included in your booklet at page 8, 
	I believe, and we looked at that on a separate sheet of paper during the first day of your testimony. 
	I believe that's what we had looked at separately.  It was marked in evidence as 2C where you had put colour coded -- where you had used colour highlighters to indicate routes into and out of Kigali.  

Comparing the two, which is Exhibit 2C, in what has been marked for identification as 1, based on your knowledge of Kigali, which do you think is more helpful in terms of laying -- showing the layout of roads into and out of the city?  
A.	In my opinion, the document 2C, which is according to the scale, because there's a copy taken from a larger map, having more features, is more helpful.  Obviously on that map there are extra lines, like dotted lines and solid lines.  They've been highlighted and they represent a few roads, but there are some of the roads which can be seen from the map.  
Q.	Tell us how you made this particular image that was included in your booklet.  What procedure did you engage to reproduce this map in Exhibit 2?  
A.	The procedure, as I told you earlier in the court, that I'd been to this area on many occasions, and most of the time I had a map, the larger map.  Either the extract of the map or sometimes a full map, so I know the locations which are in the map; they exist on the ground also.  But to prepare this map, which is 2C, I travelled specifically on the dates which are noted.  And that day, I noted the timings and distances specifically to draw it.  The roads which I travelled, I marked them and I also noted the time taken and the distance covered.  And other roads, which I'm telling possibility they are there (sic), only I can tell on the basis of my experience and during my trips, by visualising those branches and referring map on my different occasions, that those roads branch off or branch in.  That's how I told there are many possibilities that are there.  
Q.	All right, thank you.  But my concern is the image that we see on page 8, the reproduction that you used to highlight the routes.  Where does that come from?  
A.	From the larger map, which has been given to the Court, is photocopied and after that, reduced by 
	50 percent, so that it can come on A4 sides.  
Q.	All right.  So, if we looked at the larger map, which we've marked for identification -- excuse me, marked in evidence as D. 1, would we see the same image around the city of Kigali?  
A.	Yes.  
Q. 	(Microphones overlapping)...Yes, we see a similar image. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, this is re-examination.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was not challenged in cross-examination, was it?  
MR. WEBSTER:
What was challenged -- what I'm challenging is this image --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but that's -- I won't stop you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we have D. 1 shown to the witness, please.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	D. 1 is the map.  I'd like you to direct your attention to the portion of D. 1 that you used to make the markings on 2C.  Tell us when you've found it on the larger map. 
A.	Yes, I've found it on the larger map.  
Q.	I believe you have colour-coded highlighters on your desk.  Would you be table to take the orange one and trace the same route on D. 1 that you've traced on 2C.  
A.	Okay, I can do that.  
Q.	Only go as far as you have on 2C, so that the line on 2C would be reproduced on D. 1.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, what's going on here, because --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I don't understand -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Please don't mark the map.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I don't understand it, was this challenged in cross-examination?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It was introduced in cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know, but you're in re-examination now.  Was there any challenge to this drawing produced by Mr. Baghel?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour, but we have a new exhibit before us -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but you're not dealing with a new exhibit.  You're asking the witness to demonstrate that the drawing that you produced in evidence depicted something from D. 1. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's a fact which has not been challenged by anybody.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes --
MR. PRESIDENT:
So why are you addressing it in re-examination?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Because it's an exhibit that the Defence reproduced.  The Defence brought forward D. 1.  I should have an opportunity to examine D. 1 in relation to the witness's previous testimony, and that's what I'm doing. I'm asking him to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that's not what your re-examination was about, and there's been no challenge to the witness's map, 2C.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's been accepted as an authentic map.  Now, why are you examining him about that?  Trying to establish its authenticity?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not examining him -- examining him about 2C.  I'm examining him about D. 1, which is an exhibit that I did not introduce to the (Microphones overlapping)...
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you're asking him to show on the map how you drew 2C.  You don't examine about D. 1 in that manner.  You aren't getting him -- you are examining him about the map that he drew, which has not been challenged at all.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I am asking him to draw on D. 1 the same route that he has identified previously in his direct-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Precisely, you are not allowed to do that.  That was not challenged in cross-examination at all; nobody challenged that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, neither am I challenging it (Microphones overlapping)...  What I'm asking to do --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you can't have the second bite at what you could have done in examination-in-chief.  (Microphones overlapping)... At the start of your case, you could have introduced that map; you did not introduce the map.  But, it is in evidence now and it has not been challenged.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My submission -- (Microphones overlapping)... the fact that it is in evidence now as a Defence exhibit should provide me with an opportunity to examine this witness in relation to the Defence exhibit; that's -- that's my concern.  If we have an overhead projector -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that is not what you're doing.  You are getting the witness to show how he drew 2C and that you are not permitted to do.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  I'll move on.  
MR. HOOPER:
Before we move on, can I clarify one small matter -- has the witness in any way marked the map D. 1?  
THE WITNESS:
There's a small marking around 1 centimetre because -- I'm sorry, by the time I could listen to the conversation, I took a pen -- that is, a highlighter orange, and around 1 centimetre I could draw. 
MR. HOOPER:
So, the only map we have has now been written on.  Is it possible for the Prosecution or Mr. Baghel to produce another clean map, please.  That is a formal request.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, directing your attention to 2C --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I just ordered that you're not entitled to examine him on 2C; that was not challenged in cross-examination.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, in terms of the routes from Kigali moving eastward towards Gikomero, there was testimony during your cross-examination about the access -- the road -- the access roads along the route to the airport.  Would you be able to explain to the Court if it was possible and how it was possible, if so, to get to the Rwamagana Road without passing in front of CND?  
A.	Again, in this case, in reference to Exhibit 2C, if I start from point number 4, which is almost centre of the town.  Go, take a road, towards the right or to the east, go to point number 6.  This road passes through Gikondo.  The area 6 is known as Gikondo.  Come to 7, from 7 take a road which is highlighted by green and come to 9.  CND is point number 1.  Come to 9, towards 10 and go to -- and go to Rwamagana site.  This is one possibility.  
Q.	Okay.  Directing your attention to the portion of your last answer, will you discuss points 7 and 9.
	I'm concerned with the roadway between those two points.  Travelling along that road, would you -- would one travelling on that road be in the direct -- would -- would you -- if you were travelling along that road heading towards Kanombe, would you be able to see the CNB -- the CND building or the
	Amohoro stadium, if you were simply on the roadway between those two points?
A.	If you are simply on the road, because in Kigali, a lot of buildings -- houses are there.  There's a town area, so by travelling from 7 to 9 on this tarmac road I don't think that you'll be able to see CND or Amohoro stadium, unless you go on the top of high-rise building.  
Q.	Now, if you wanted to travel along that road and take a diversion that leads you to the north, so that you could join what you had outlined in blue on the previous exhibit, is that possible?  Could you do that without passing directly in front of CND?  
A.	Yes, it's possible, after point number 7, again you go around a kilometer or so.  Then the road to airport comes.  And there are various roads in this state which can take you to from green -- which, I've highlighted in green to blue without passing through or in front of Amohoro stadium (unintelligible) CND -- because CND is very far.  
Q.	Can you tell us approximately how many -- that you have travelled, to make that connection between the green road and the blue road -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, this is re-examination.  This is a completely new matter which was not dealt with in cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, my recollection is that Mr. Hooper examined this witness extensively on whether shots being fired from CND would prevent passage on the road going eastwards towards Kanombe. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)... What is the question again, what is the point?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the question you said Mr. Hooper had asked?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Hooper had asked about shots.  If the RPF in CND were firing upon Sonatubes, in the direction of Sonatubes, would that prevent someone from travelling along those roads -- the roads on the eastern side of the map, for there to be access from Kigali, to the main roadways going into Gikomero.  I believe there was extensive examination on that point over my objection, in fact.  So, I'm going back to that issue, that there are, at least, three or four different roads that anyone that was interested in taking to avoid CND -- but to use the eastern access roads -- could take.  That's the concern here.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just clarify the position, the word I used was "firing weapons" and I had mortars in mind.
Not -- not straight-line bullets -- if that's what the Prosecution took it to mean, mortar fire.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, let's take up where we left off.  I believe your previous response was that on the roadway itself you could not see CND from point 7 to point 9?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	How many different points of access are there between the green road and the blue road in that area that you're aware of?  
A.	There are many, around half a dozen or more.  It depends on which point you want to branch off.  
Q.	And if you take any one of those access roads between the green road and the blue road that you've indicated on your exhibit, would you see the CND building?  
A.	No, from the roadside, no, because the more -- the more you are going far off, you will be far off from CND and Amohoro stadium.  
Q.	Now, your last few responses had to do with accessing the blue road from the green road.  I'm going to ask you a different set of questions, but the issue is the same.  If one were travelling from the centre of Kigali and were trying to access the Rwamagana Road into Gikomero, is it possible to do that by passing behind Sonatubes? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, with respect, surely the question should be:  How is it possible to do that?  I think the last question, is again, a leading question.  I haven't interrupted much, but I think -- I'd ask Mr. Webster to be careful how he phrases his questions, particularly as it's entering an area which he himself could have explored and perhaps should have explored but didn't do so.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, can you tell us how it's possible to pass behind Sonatubes and still regain the 
	Rwamagana Road?  
A.	The road which is shown by the green highlighter, number point -- and passes through point 6, if one does not want to take this road, even though where I've shown after point 4 and going towards point 6, I have shown there's a right diversion, going to south, you take that road, enter into Gikondo locality -- Gikondo residential area.  You can avoid the whole -- the road which is by green, just go parallelly, maybe after 500 -- like 500 metre or a few hundred metre down, go into Gikondo residential area, and directly from that side, you can reach the Kanombe airport.  

There are many possibilities in this.  One is not -- if one is not interested to take green, highlighted portion because this is highlighted, because this is asphalted road, when I drew this map.  But there are many possibilities in the town.  So, like, one person can avoid the whole green and directly reach to Rwamagana Road through the streets in Kigali town.  
Q.	Mr. Baghel, do you know who -- do you know the airport in Kigali at Kanombe was under the control of what force during the period -- during the first half of April?  
A.	Again, as far as my knowledge goes, depending on various sources, the airport -- 
MR. HOOPER:
May I interrupt this particular line of questioning.  This witness has already demonstrated in cross-examination that he is not, by any means, qualified to answer this kind of question.  I do not stand in the way of the Prosecution calling someone who can.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I didn't notice that Mr. Hooper had any difficulty with these types of questions when he was asking them of this witness yesterday.  He asked him at least three or four different questions about the positions of RPF troops and FAR troops.  I objected and he was allowed to -- the witness was allowed to respond based on his knowledge at that time.  And I'm asking the witness the same line of questioning; he can respond to the extent that he knows.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness indicated first what his level of knowledge was.  He said he had not read the relevant reports.  But he had -- he could make -- express general opinions.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we had not even established that the reports that Mr. Hooper mentioned were relevant reports.  The whole point is that those reports are not relevant.  But the witness was asked to comment on those reports.  What I'm asking the witness to do is the same thing that Mr. Hooper asked him to do yesterday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you ask the witness the same question then?  What knowledge he has.  And maybe you might be able to get him to say what reports he did read, because I got the impression that those questions were asked and he had expressed a lack of knowledge on this particular issue.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I stand to be corrected, but my recollection is that the witness was asked about positions of RPF in Gikomero.  The witness responded and then Mr. Hooper went on with a litany of questions about, "Did you read the KIBAT report?  Did you read the UNAMIR report?  Did you read any number -- a series of reports?" 

It had not been established that those reports contained any information at all about the question that was asked.  That's what triggered my objection yesterday, because it had not been established that those reports were even relevant to this issue. So, I will not ask this witness whether he's read the reports, because I do not assume that the information that I'm eliciting from this witness is in those reports. What I'm asking the witness to tell us is based on his review of the file and his familiarity of the case -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you ask him that question in that way, I will permit the Defence to question him on that issue again.  You see, you -- part of your objections were that the witness had not been called to give this type of evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My objections were overruled yesterday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But -- but I'm just telling you that I'm not stopping you from doing it.  But it seems to me that you're opening up a slightly new line of inquiry now, which if you do, I would think would require some other examination on it.  But I'm not stopping you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
With due respect, I think Mr. Hooper opened that line of questioning yesterday; the witness answered to the best of his ability yesterday.  I'm simply picking up on the witness's response from yesterday to clarify the record.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, can you tell us to the extent that you know and, you can even tell us the basis of your knowledge, whether Kanombe airport was in the hands of either UNAMIR, the RPF, or the government forces during the first half of April?  
A.	In this respect, the airport was under UNAMIR and on the side of airport, is the Kanombe military camp, and it was  under the government forces much -- up till much late the first half, even the second half of April.  
Q.	Do you have any knowledge of when the government forces lost control of Kanombe airport?  
A.	The government forces did not lose the control of the area around airport till the RPF took over Kigali, which was in the month of July.  
Q.	With respect to the city of Kigali, do you have any -- any understanding of which parts of the city of Kigali were occupied by the government forces and which parts were accessible to the RPF within the city itself?  
A.	As far as my knowledge goes, RPF occupied a small portion of Kigali town -- a very tiny portion compared to whole town, around CND and around Amohoro stadium.  And even they could not occupy, but they're not having territorial control over the area in Kacyiru - Kacyiru, which is number 2 around -- only part of that.  

In fact, like yesterday also, I pointed out this issue.  I had an opportunity to examine in the last previous case and my opinion is that the RPF in that time was basically a defensive force, not an offensive occupying the territory in Kigali town.  It was defensive, operating in certain areas just to protect some of the civilians in Amohoro stadium.  
Q.	The government forces that occupied the centre of Kigali, where the Hotel Diplomat is located is at one end of Kigali, or would you agree?  Tell us, where Kanombe is in relation to downtown Kigali?  
A.	Downtown Kigali, which is point number 4; Kanombe is on east side, which is around 11 and 12.
	11 is the Kanombe airport, 12 is the Kanombe military camp.  RPF could not occupy, while not having -- by not holding the territory around number 4 till RPF took over Kigali, which was in the month of July.  The whole Kigali town was under the government forces except tiny portions around number 1C and D, number 8 or 13 or maybe near around number 2.  The whole city was under the government forces, till the -- till the whole town came under RPF in the month of July.  
Q.	Based on your knowledge, were government forces able to go back and forth between downtown Kigali and Kanombe airport?  
A.	Yes, Kanombe camp was operating, so troops were able to move.  Vehicular movement was there.  Even civilians at some point -- it's again my opinion, again and again actually -- the Hutu civilians who were fleeing from the area around N -- that is, Ndera, they flew to Gitarama -- they went to Gitarama only to command that area. Came to Kigali town, went to Gitarama, so this was the route taken by them.  
Q.	Mr. Baghel, you testified in the case against Jean Dieu Kamuhanda, I believe that was your statement yesterday; is that accurate?  
A.	Yes, I testified in that case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, are you cross -examining him?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I'm not, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you challenging his truthfulness?
MR. WEBSTER:
Not at all. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's what the question suggested.  This is re-examination; you can't challenge a witness's truthfulness like this.
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't believe my question was challenging --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You asked him what he said was accurate. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I asked him if it was accurate that he testified in the Kamuhanda case.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In the Kamuhanda case, was there a similar issue concerning the movement of RPF troops in Kigali?  
A.	In fact, I do not know because similar questions were not asked during my examination.  But I suppose similar issues came during that trial; that's why a part of inquiry was therefore given to me, to find out, and on that basis of that inquiry, I gave this opinion which just now, I told.  
Q.	In the Kamuhanda case, did you offer testimony concerning the presence of RPF troops in Gikomero?  
A.	No, my testimony was limited to the work which I did -- like, taking photographs and drawing a sketch.  
Q.	In regard to the roadways crisscrossing Gikomero and your investigations of those roadways for the Kamuhanda case and for this case, did you speak to witnesses that were present in Gikomero in 1994?  
A.	Yes, I spoke to the witnesses from Gikomero, from the area around Ndera and some other places in Kigali town. 
MR. HOOPER:
I think this is approaching a dangerous area in the sense that if there are statements that are now going to be in any way referred to, I should be provided with them.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not referring to statements.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Based on those conversations and your familiarity -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I must object to this.  This anecdotal referencing is wholly inappropriate.  
MR. WEBSTER:
May I ask my question first, please.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Based on your familiarity -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Baghel, you don't answer the question until I authorise you to do so. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Based on your file and your conversations with witnesses in this case and the case of Kamuhanda, can you offer any comparison between the state of the roads and the infrastructure in 1994, and the state of the road and the infrastructure in 2002 -- excuse me, 2003 when you travelled them to make your sketches and your photographs?  Do you understand my question?  
A.	Yes, I understood.  Should I answer, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, I'm going to allow you to answer the question, but it may open you up to inquiries about the sources that you used to form that opinion.  But I will not stop the witness from answering the question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me explain my concern before we go on Judge -- Your Honour, excuse me.  Yesterday, 
Mr. Hooper --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I've authorised the question.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I've just indicated that it may open the witness to an inquiry about the sources upon which his answer is based.  So, if you wish to ask the question in that format that may be a consequence. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's fine.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, please answer the question.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt.  Could the question be repeated because I think it's important that I appreciate the words of it.  I'm sorry, I didn't quite get it.  I was distracted momentarily, I'm sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, based on your knowledge of the file, the investigations you have undertaken, your conversations with witnesses from Gikomero, are you able to explain, if any, a difference in the infrastructure of the roadways through Gikomero as they existed in 1994 and in relation to what you observed and what you were questioned about yesterday in relation to 2003?  
A.	As far as my familiarity goes, the sketch and the road conditions which I've drawn in 2003 -- which I've documented in 2003, they are on the basis of my personal and physical observation in 2003.  I can comment after 2002 because from 2002 -- no, sorry, from 2000 to 2003, I did not see any perceptible difference.  About 1994 -- what was the road conditions?  With regard to this as far as I know, that I did not record any statement.  Only I can express the roads should have been similar or same as in six years or eight years.  The roads do not change much, except the repairs.  But about the movement of people from Gikomero to this site, which I told in my last question -- yes, I remember after recording a few statements, but I don't have the names and the details of those sources now.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Baghel, when you were being cross-examined by Mr. Hooper, I was left with the impression that he was alluding to the difficulty that a car would have travelling those roads into 2003, as you've described them.  And my question to you is, based on your knowledge of the file were the roads in better condition in 1994 than they were in 2003?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster  --
THE WITNESS:
Again -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was a leading question.  The question, "Were the roads in better condition?"  Is not an appropriate question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, and this is the last question I'll ask on this, based on your familiarity with the file and your familiarity with the area, do you have a basis to conclude that the roads were in any different state of care in 2003 than they were in 2000 -- than in 1994 -- excuse me?  
A.	Yes, again, this is my general observation and knowledge gathered during my stay in Rwanda.  In Rwanda, most of the roads which are not asphalted like commune roads, they were maintained in 1994 through the community service called Umuganda.  And, this community service called Umuganda was very seriously done in 1994 and before that.  So, the roads which were not asphalted in the communes, they were in much better condition than now -- because now Umuganda is being done now also, but it's not as serious as being done earlier.  But this is my knowledge gathered during -- like, by talking to the people in general.  Not like recording the statements about Umuganda or community service.  
Q.	I'd like to turn to a slightly different matter and I'm concerned now with Defence exhibits 2(3) and, I believe it was 2(2).  That we can begin with 2(3).  When Mr. Hooper was cross-examining you, he described this image as having fingers and depressions.  Did you understand what he was referring to when he made that statement in his cross-examination?  
A.	In fact, when these maps, which are -- which are D. 2 or D. 3 that are given, I consulted on the names, locations, and the lines dotted by red.  So, come from the (unintelligible) locations of these pictures -- not in the exact locations, and more or less the connectivity of those places.  And I could not think at all that green represents something else and white something else, only when it was explained to me later.  
Q.	Even with Mr. Hooper's explanation of what the green referred to and what the white referred to, did those configurations on 2. D or 2(3) help you to understand what the terrain was like in Gikomero?  Looking at these images, did the various colours -- the white and the green -- assist at all in understanding the various elevations?  
A.	From these two sketches, I could not make out any kind of elevation.  And leaving aside such a thing, which is difficult to make out even from the larger map, so only I can express my opinion, or I told variations are there on the basis of my familiarity to the area and frequent trips.  

So, I cannot confirm how much elevation is there, where it is there, where the water body -- where the water body is clearly represented here or not.  I can say, "Yes, some river is fast flowing, when I was there."  The places -- and the places which I visited.  So from the map I cannot comment whether this is the exact replica, unless it is taken from authenticated source.  
Q.	Mr. Baghel --  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, just to clarify that, it's never been suggested this is an exact replica.  It's a sketch; it's symbolic.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you for that, Mr. Baghel.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, with Mr. Hooper's additional qualification, Mr. Baghel, if you direct your attention from Kajevuba to Gikomero commune, along that road he has indicated on D. 3.  Would you be able to estimate the number of hills that you would see or travel up and down along that pathway from Kajevuba to Gikomero?  
A.	In fact, I have not counted the number of hills on both sides.  But the whole area is mountainous, hilly.  Sometime it's a little flat hill; sometime it's a little more elevation.  That's how where -- here, it is a little bit more flat, agriculture being done -- farming is being done.  There's a centre part there, a little bit flat area.  And, if you travel on this road from Kajevuba to this side -- the Gikomero side, on your left, there's a valley which can be seen, just to leave the road and go 10 metres or 20 metres on your left.  So, the whole area is mountainous.  I don't know how many number of hills are there.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Hooper described Kigali as the Rome of Africa because of the number of hills and I'm aware that Rwanda is described as the country of a thousand hills.  If you wanted to count the number of hills from Kajevuba to Gikomero, do you think it would be possible for you to do so?  
A.	For me, it will not be possible to do.  I think if you -- if a larger map is taken and in that map there may be some contours and then peak of contour might be noted down, so those contours and peaks can be noted down and approximate number can be counted.  
MR. HOOPER:
Just on this, where is Gikoro?  We're unclear.  

MR. WEBSTER:
I'm looking at D. 2 and I'm also looking at D. 3 and I've noted that you have placed Gikoro in the lower right-hand corner.  So, my question to the witness was to look at what has been indicated in red as a roadway between Kajevuba and Gikoro commune, which are things you have described in your sketch. 
MR. HOOPER:
Indeed.  Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'm going to go into a slightly different area, Mr. Baghel.  You were cross-examined on the memorandum that has been entered into evidence as P. 5, I believe.  It's the memorandum by Anathase Gasana, which is P. 5.  And Mr. Hooper read the last paragraph on page 17 where it's stated that the MDR, the party of the working masses, had launched a crusade for a free world, and it goes on and on.  Do you recall those questions from yesterday?  Do you recall those questions from yesterday? 
A.	Yes, I recall the questions from yesterday.  
Q.	I believe Mr. Hooper also stated that the document was signed May 14th 1992?  
A.	Yes, I can see the document was signed on May 14, 1992.  
Q.	In May of 1992, was there any split in the MDR party?  
MR. HOOPER:
I think I object -- I object to this -- this line of questioning.  First, the line; and secondly, this was a leading question -- wholly inappropriate leading question.  Thirdly, the questions were confined to this document and they were confined to the observations that this witness had made in relation to this document.  

Now, if there's any contradiction to be found in this document contrary to the proposition that I was putting to the witness, then that is a legitimate area of re-examination, if it corrects any misleading impression I've created; that there was no misleading impression given of this document.  And, we're dealing with a document that was in 1992.  

Nor has this witness demonstrated in any way or been asked at any time by anyone, as far as I know, anything about his awareness of the larger and, may I say, intricate political position of the MDR.  And, I object on those grounds.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My recollection is that Mr. Hooper went into the substance of the document in his cross-examination of Mr. Baghel.  It would be unfair to the Court, is my submission, not to explain the context in 1992 when this document was generated, and my question is framed with that in mind.  

That in 1992, the document represents one position -- one particular position and that within seven or eight months thereafter --
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)... a significance.
MR. WEBSTER:
When Mr. Hooper was asking questions that went into the content of the exhibits, I objected.  My objections were overruled and we went substantially into the content of the case, through the exhibits and through this witness to the extent that Mr. Hooper has already opened the door, and gone into the substance of matter of these exhibits, and this witness's familiarity with events of 1994.  The Prosecutor as well, should be allowed to explore the substance of issues through this witness.  
MR PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, this was your witness and so the issues which you are addressing were matters which would normally be apparent of examination-in-chief -- would normally be apparent in examination-in-chief.  If you chose not to do that and you've re-opened -- you opened these matters now, it would mean that these are issues upon which the defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine. 

And I think you have crossed that line on more than one occasion in your re-examination.  This is also on the border of that position.  If you open matters on which the Defence ought to have an opportunity to cross-examine, I will allow them to do it.  But it seems to me that this is opening a new area, but I'm not stopping your question.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand, Your Honour.  My submission is that the Defence has gone into substance -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and I've already ruled.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah, okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, you will choose.  If you open new matters on which the Defence ought to have a chance to cross-examine, they will be given a chance to cross-examine.  This is re-examination; you are not normally permitted to rebuild your case in re-examination, when you could have done it in examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, are you aware of the relationship between Anathase Gasana prior to July 1993 --  
MR. HOOPER:
Before this question is answered, this is an area of expertise.  And, it is, in my submission, necessary for the Prosecution to demonstrate the expertise of this witness before he answers this question.  One must bear in mind, that Mr. Baghel came late to Rwanda.  He's demonstrated not always a total grasp of matters there, even within the remit of his own limited investigations.  And I'm very concerned that we're entering an area here where he hasn't begun to demonstrate any expertise at all.  So, if you're going to go into this area, I think it's -- it's my submission, so if the Prosecution are going to go into this area at all, they must lay satisfactory ground to show the competence of this witness to answer these questions.  They should also comply, I'm reminded, with the rules of expert testimony in respect of this witness.  That is to say, we should be furnished with a report.  

And may I -- may I just add, I've no objection if experts are called in this area, but you can't turn the photographer, exhibiter -- as he was described yesterday by the Prosecution -- in re-examination to his own witness, you surely can't now lead him into these areas.  
MR. WEBSTER:
This witness was cross-examined on the substance of this document yesterday or the day before.  I objected at that time and questions went forward and he was asked to comment on the document.  The follow-up questions went on the following day, and we returned to that document.  

If the Defence has opened the door by going into the substance of the document, my submission is that the Prosecution should be able to go back to the same issue that the Defence opened, to close those doors or to clarify issues.  And that's what I'm trying to do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I know, but your questions are not connected with the content of the document because that is why he said they are in your area.  And the other issue that Mr. Hooper has raised is also a significant one; that if you're asking for opinion evidence of the witness, you'll have to allow him to establish the basis upon which those opinions are allowable in evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Hooper elicited opinion evidence from the (Microphones overlapping)...  
MR. PRESIDENT:
He was cross-examining the witness.  You are re-examining; this is your evidence.  This is your witness. There are different rules that apply.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, would you be able to explain to us, at what point in the history of the MDR party a document such as this was generated?  
A.	Again in this area, my view will be on -- on the basis of limited documents and which I cannot quote now, or limited material which I had because in the exhibits we produce a document which was in July 1993, about the MDR national congress.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, before we go any further, we are, again, about to fall into an opinion which is being put to the Court as fact.  And the witness has said to the question, "Can you explain the context of this document on the history of the MDR?"   No mean feat, even with diligence, one would have thought, that he can give an opinion from limited sources that he cannot quote -- probably the same as anyone in this building.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness did not complete his answer, Your Honour.  
THE WITNESS:
So that the MDR national congress, which was held in July 1993, the split in the MDR was very much apparent around this time -- around that time.  This document is cited in 1992, which was around the year -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you recall the exhibit number?  
THE WITNESS:
The exhibit number P. 5, this was signed on 14 May, 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 5 was signed?  
THE WITNESS:
14 May 1992 by Anastase Gasana.  At this moment in time, MDR was one party and -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I'm concerned about the application of Rule 94, it's not a question of trying to shut a witness up, it's a question of the Prosecution getting its house in order.  

They have had ample time, if they wish to, in fact, ask this witness evidence about the MDR to give us notice about it.  Now, my objection in the geography of this case is, I think, routed in good cause.  And can I just take the opportunity of revisiting the area that we're concerned with? 

Exhibit 22 is a document which I'd invite the Court to read.  It was put in evidence.  Its relevance alludes me at the moment. 
(Pages 1 to 20 by Jean Baigent)











1000H 
MR. HOOPER: 
But there's certainly no harm done within that document to the Accused's interests or that of the MDR -- 

And I'm on feet, Mr. Webster.  You can give way to me for a moment. 

The concern is that the questions that were put to this witness were, effectively, what's the relevance of this document to us?  And -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  I will not have both counsel on their feet at the same time.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Rather, the particular question, as the transcript, I think, will show, in respect of this document was, well, there's nothing damaging in this document.  That was the thrust of the question to which Mr. Baghel answered; that it was his opinion that there was criticism within this document of members of the MDR party, indicating that there was some indication in this document of -- of waywardness of a group of MDR members, or the like.  

So we took the document away.  You may recall I said, "Well, I may have to come back to that."  We took the document away and there's not a comma, a full stop, a letter that could possibly on any reading fall into that category.  And so I've come back yesterday and I've invited Mr. Baghel -- he hadn't had the chance -- to reread the document, and I read two extracts from it.  

My entire cross-examination in respect of the document was confined to misleading comments that he had made on that document, nothing at all to do with the history of the MDR.  No questions being asked of Mr. Baghel are of that.  Had I thought that he was competent to answer those questions, we may have pursued the MDR matter with keen interest.  I have no doubt, from my point of view here, that he is not competent to answer those questions, which is why none of those issues were raised with him.  

I repeat, I'm surprised that the Prosecutor, who in re-examination yesterday was effectively trying to belittle his own witness by indicating that he had a technical cameraman role in cases, should now try to introduce a significant aspect of the evidence of this case through this witness.  It's plainly never been envisaged by the Prosecution that they do so.  The Prosecution have never suggested for a moment that he was competent to answer those questions.  

And I don't mean competent, Mr. Baghel, in the sense, if I can put it, of not being adequate to do it if it was your job to do it, but it isn't, and that's why in terms of legal vocabulary we use the word "competent".  I don't mean it in a term of offence.  I mean, you're not competent to give evidence in respect of that any more than I'm competent to give evidence on the runnings of the Calcutta railroad. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we do not think this is an appropriate line of re-examination of this witness.  He has stated in evidence on a number of occasions that he has what the exact area of his knowledge and involvement in the investigation in these cases, and the question that you are asking him call for knowledge which he cannot have based on the answers he gave yesterday.  If it's important to you to address the issue of the conditions of the road in 1994 and matters of the history of the MDR party; it is open to you to call witnesses to address these issues.  But we don't think that's an appropriate line of inquiry to ask this witness in re-examination when the entire previous testimony has indicated he has a very limited role in the investigation of these matters.  He cannot answer these questions with the level of knowledge which would be required of the expertise that you're requesting.  So we think that that line of questioning should not be asked of this witness in his re-examination. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, I'm going to move on to the final area of your re-examination.  I believe it was yesterday or the day before Mr. Hooper asked you about exhumations on the grounds of the Butare university hospital.  Since those questions were put to you two or three days ago, have you had an opportunity to review the database or the evidence -- the collection of evidence within the Office of the Prosecutor to ascertain if there's any evidence at all of exhumations in Butare -- or on the grounds of the Butare hospital? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Didn't the witness say yesterday that he had in fact obtained the exhumation reports?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And we've received a copy, Mr. President, and we have no objection to that being put in evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we mark that in evidence?  It's P. --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Baghel, would you please describe the document?  
THE WITNESS:
This matter I referred yesterday briefly.  While searching the database, I found that exhumation report titled "Report of Exhumation," in French "procès-verbal d'exumation," dated 30th October 1997.  And while reviewing the document, I realised that from ICTR Kigali office, five staff members attended the process when it was carried out by the local authorities.  At that time a videotape was also made apparently by the local authorities and a copy was given to ICTR.  And in ICTR evidence database this videotape is marked at HKV000179. 

And in the report somewhere it is mentioned that 31 bodies were buried at the site.  It's like, judging from the number of skulls remaining, at least 31 bodies were buried at the site.  

This is K number K0052125 to 2126 in French, and K0052127 to 2128 in English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence. 

Mr. Registrar, what number is it?  
MR. FRY:
P. 28, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  P. 28.  And you'd -- it would also be A and B French and English versions, right?  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 28A and P. 28B admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I propose to deal with the video clip that Mr. Baghel has just mentioned on Wednesday morning when we deal with the other CD-ROMs, the video and audio clips. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, is Mr. Baghel going to come back to give evidence at that stage, or do you want simply to lay the foundation now?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I prefer to lay the foundation now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
My understanding was that Mr. Baghel would be back on Wednesday morning in any case.  His presence may not be necessary, but he will be in the building and he will be here in the courtroom.  But my understanding from our last -- our earlier discussions was that he would also be here on Wednesday morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, he might not be required to give evidence, but it would be useful if he was present just in the event that something arose.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, with respect to the video that you've just described, have you had an opportunity to look at it?  
A.	The video K000179, I had a chance to look into that, but not the full video, only some parts, because I do not have much time.  And the part which I reviewed I found and I noticed the place which is mentioned in my sketches is the same place where the exhumation was done -- exhumation was done. 
Q.	Do you know where the video came from? 
A.	As I mentioned in the report which I gave just now, it's mentioned.  The video recording was done by the local authorities, so the tape might have come from the local authorities to the ICTR.  And ICTR investigators who attended the process, they confirm in the report the videotape was made when they were there. 
MR. WEBSTER:
This concludes my questioning of this witness.  If we need additional foundation on Wednesday morning, the witness will be available for that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I seek leave to re-examine this witness in respect of the opinion that he expressed on the military situation, military situation in Kigali town, which he referred to this morning.  That was an area that was entered into in re-examination but was not an area that I was able to enter into in cross-examination, and specific and new matters have been sought to be introduced in respect of government and RPF positions, and those are matters I'd seek to briefly explore with this -- with this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster, any comment?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I believe my re-examination was in direct response to the cross-examination.  These are areas that Mr. Hooper himself went into on cross-examination.  In fact, when he entered these areas in cross-examination, I objected.  My objections were overruled, we went into the area in cross-examination, and my re-examination was intended to clarify the record.  So my submission is that there is no basis for additional cross-examination.  If the Court is going to allow additional cross-examination, if it's appropriate, I will also request a re-examination of the further cross.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will allow the re-examination on this issue, but, Mr. Hooper, we would expect you to confine yourself only to the area which was raised in Mr. Webster's re-examination. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would not want to allow any additional investigations which would open the door for the need for Mr. Webster to have to re-examine again.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'll do my best. 

FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Taking the points in the order that you gave them, you were asked about who held Kanombe airport, and you replied that Kanombe airport was held by UNAMIR; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it's correct. 
Q.	And that the Kanombe barracks, which was government forces, the FAR or RAF, was held by FAR until the end of July, is that correct -- or, I'm sorry, until the RPF eventually conquered Kigali? 
A.	Again, when I told these things, I told this is my opinion based on different sources, and I told Kigali was taken over by RPF only in the month of July.  Until the month of July the RPF was only a few places, which are tiny places, in Kigali town.  They were not holding major territories including Kanombe camp, but exactly when it was taken up by RPF, I cannot tell.  So my understanding is that when Kigali was taken over in July, then only all this area came under RPF. 
Q.	Now, before we give any particular weight to your opinion, you can confirm, can you, that you've read none of the military material? 
A.	And this issue was raised yesterday also.  I told I read some of the military material, so I cannot say none of the military material.  Our evidence unit is having documents on different sources, so I cannot count which material I read at which point of time and how many documents.  So while scanning, either reading -- either investigating or -- this lead or maybe different lead, I come across some documents, some documents I might have read, but I -- I cannot count, I cannot give which document, but it's not an exhaustive search or exhaustive reading of all military documents. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Rather than wait for a re-examination that may not come, may I ask Mr. Hooper to clarify for the record what military materials he's referring to and what military materials would contain information about RPF troop movements in Kigali between April and July.  I'm not sure what military materials he had expected this witness to consult.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I -- thank you.  I'll make that clear to the witness in a moment.  They're the same material as I referred him to yesterday, all or none of which -- none or most which he'd seen.  You may recall his evidence.  I'm not going to retrace my steps over that.  Unless you need me to, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You say the RPF held just a little bit of Kigali.  In fact, wasn't the position this, that the RPF with great military intelligence and decisiveness divided the FAR army in Kigali into two, one bit in Kanombe camp and the other bit occupying the west of Kigali with the RPF line at Remera separating them?  Isn't that, in fact, what happened? 
A.	Again, this opinion, like RPF dividing a line or having a dividing line in Remera, it's a subject of little bit more expertise because my limited investigation in this field in previous case was like that.  The road which passes through CND, and this road, let's say, on my sketch 2C, point number 2, 1, 8, 13, towards this side was RPF, but on the other side was control under the government forces.  The vehicles were scared to move on this road from 2 to 1 or 8 or 13 because this -- this road has become line of fire, so they were scared either the government forces or the RPF may fire.  But on this road there may not be any roadblocks, or if they are there, they were temporary.  That is why even the government vehicles, the Rwandan government vehicles, were scared to use this road.  But RPF did not take an offensive position holding a territory or running their administration or controlling on the territorial administration.  

Number point 13 was Amahoro stadium.  Tutsis, even some Hutus, took shelter in that stadium because they were scared.  So Amahoro stadium, which is point number 13, did not become only the shelter place for Tutsis.  Even the Hutus who were staying in this area like 2, 1, 8, 13 who were around Remera.  Remera is on the both sides of the road which passes through 1, 8, 13.  On the other side of the road towards, let's say, 5, 7, 9, 10, Remera persons are there.  But after one street, let's say, one street is deserted, but second street is normal.  It is my opinion which I gathered while interviewing the witnesses and finding out, so I cannot understand which way the opinion is that the RPF was having line of control monitored by some agencies or anything.  This is not a line of control which was in Arusha Accord which were near Byumba or somewhere where RPF was there.  So this is a totally different defused picture.  

This is again my opinion.  Again I am telling you the Court is asking me to give my opinion.  This is opinion.  I cannot quote the sources.  I don't have the sources.  This is opinion formed by me on the basis of interviews, certain interviews, parts of the interviews from different sources.  
Q.	Right.  So you can't quote them, but you've relied on certain interviews, and I formally request that you provide me with those sources, if you can, Mr. Baghel. 

Camp Kanombe you've talked about.  Isn't it right Camp Kanombe got cut off to the point where it couldn't even be supplied by government forces?  
A.	Again, Defence is asking me the areas where I don't know whether I'll be able to provide the sources.  It would be my opinion only.  Camp Kanombe initially, let's say, first week of April or so, the soldiers which went to Gikomero commune site, they were deployed from Camp Kanombe with different authorities -- 
Q.	Sorry, Mr. Baghel, can I just bring you back to the question?  I'm not asking where they could get to from Camp Kanombe.  What I'm saying is that they were cut off from the rest of the FAR army in Kigali because the RPF were at Remera to the point where the FAR army in Kigali couldn't supply their own soldiers in Camp Kanombe.  Have you heard about that? 
A.	This is a question of military logistics, and I do not know of -- 
Q.	Is the answer, "No, I don't know"? 
A.	I cannot comment.  I don't know. 
Q.	You've mentioned Amahoro.  The stadium became a place of refuge under UNAMIR protection largely protected there by the Bangladeshi contingent.  Is that correct? 
A.	Again, I do not know.  I have not gone through extensive -- extensively UNAMIR records. 
Q.	You said this morning the RPF were only holding Amahoro to protect some civilians.  The RPF now become the protecters of Hutus and Tutsis at Amahoro according to you.  Is that your opinion? 
A.	Again, this is my opinion on the basis of certain things, so I cannot go into the detail, if you ask the detail which RPF, why RPF, and other things, because you ask me to give opinion, I gave my opinion. 
Q.	Wasn't the position in fact this at Amahoro, that the RPF and UNAMIR reached a modus vivendi, that is a -- I'm sure you know what it means, but an arrangement whereby the RPF who controlled that area allowed UNAMIR to continue to function in its refugee-protecting duties?  Is that not the position? 
A.	I do not know, and I cannot comment on this also. 
Q.	You say the whole of Kigali town was under government forces.  Wasn't the position this, that from the 12th of April the RPF allowed government forces to remain in western Kigali and didn't attack them but left them pinned down effectively doing little or nothing while the RPF busied itself advancing in other parts of country?  Isn't that what happened? 
A.	I do not know.  I cannot comment on military logistics and their strategy. 
Q.	You've mentioned civilians could move about.  It's been said that civilians in these situations, refugees, flow like water, they go everywhere, they risk life and limb to escape whatever threat they fear.  That is often the case with refugees, is it not; they go where others wouldn't dare tread? 
A.	This is a question I could not understand.  What do you mean by the question?  
Q.	These refugees weren't travelling about in vehicles, were they? 
A.	I do not know whether the refugees travelling in the vehicle in Rwanda.  The people who are changing the places to save their lives, either in the night or daytime, whenever they find it convenient and they can hide themselves.  So I do not know which refugees travelled in vehicles, so that's why I cannot comment because I was not there in 1994. 
Q.	You said a moment ago even civilians could move between these areas, between, as it were, Kanombe and the city.  Have you, in your reading of statements, come across any civilian who travelled from the 7th of April to the 30th of April across that area in a vehicle?  And if so, please provide me with the statement.  
A.	I do not know whether civilians travelled in the vehicle or they walked or part of their travel they went in the vehicle, part walking in the bush.  It's a question of surviving and hiding.  But if I recall correctly, Gikomero people, particularly Hutus, they were camping near Gitarama in the last -- in the end of genocide period.  There is -- 
Q.	I'm sorry, I'm not concerned with Gitarama.  Have you come across any statement from a witness moving between east and west Kigali to Kanombe in a vehicle? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me.  Mr. Hooper had asked a question, the witness was trying to respond to it and he was cut off.  I suggest that if he asks questions, that the witness should at least be allowed to complete his answer. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Well, I heard Gitarama.  I'm not at all concerned with Gitarama.  But, Mr. Baghel, if you feel it contributes a useful point, please conclude. 
A.	The people who moved towards Gitarama, I think few minutes back I told, even after response, the people from the area around Ndera -- that is N in my sketch 2C -- they came to Kigali then went to Gitarama, which is in the west.  They did not take the road going to west from Ndera towards the pink line road.  So they came to Kigali near Kanombe camp, did not follow the route to Remera, went behind Kanombe camp, Kigali town towards Gikondo and to Gitarama.  That kind of movements can be traced of the people.  

Now, how did they go, by vehicle part -- part journey in the vehicle or part journey hiding themselves in the bush for a night, only the concerned person can respond.  But people have moved; that's how people from Gikomero moved to Gitarama and had a camp in the area near Gitarama, the Gikomero area people.  
Q.	That was camp -- was Camp Kagirawenga (phonetic).  Is that right? 
A.	I do not know the exact name now of the camp. 
MR. HOOPER:
Please don't ask me to spell it because it's -- I'll come back to it later, perhaps. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, I'm not talking of a tide of refugees walking to the east of Kigali to Gitarama.  I'm talking about vehicles between the 7th of April and the 30th, say, or 25th moving along the axis from central Kigali through towards Kanombe.  
A.	At this point, again, I explained earlier also, from centre of Kigali vehicles can move to Kanombe by a green road or any road can be taken which are known as (unintelligible) on the right of the green.  And through 1 and 8 I told just now the people were scared. 
Q.	Mr. Baghel, let me put my point.  You can move along those roads, but you don't move if you're under mortar fire, do you? 
A.	I cannot comment whether people move under mortar fire or not and whether those mortar fires was regular or intermittently. 
Q.	Have you ever heard a mortar go off?  Have you ever experienced a mortar bomb go off? 
A.	Sorry, I was not there in 1994 to see the mortar fire. 
Q.	And you've had no military experience?  Not been in the army in India or anything like that to experience that kind of thing? 
A.	This is again going into the area (unintelligible) military experience, but the military does not mean the mortar fires or the different operations from military.  We have been the -- we have undergone military attachment during our police career.  So this is not like somebody is -- I'm on the firing line or something.  I'm not experienced this thing because I never been -- I'm from civilian police.  I'm not from military.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Has it been established on the record that there was mortar fire in that region of Kigali?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, let me ask you this:  On the 8th of April the United Nations KITBAT forces -- and I'll put it to you and then ask you if you've come across it in your general reading but might have forgotten about it.  On the 8th at 0700 in the morning, KITBAT signal that the RPF were at the Méridien.  You know where the Méridien is, don't you?  Please, yes or no? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	At 10:30 on the 8th of April the RPF occupy a zone -- this is UNAMIR -- that comprises CND, the Méridien, car 4, N4, the (French spoken) N5.  Are you familiar with those places?  
A.	I'm not familiar all the places except CND and Hôtel Méridien.  The other places I do not know.  
Q.	On the 9th do you remember reading at 11:25 Camp Kanombe under RPF mortar fire?  That's as early as the 9th.  Can you remember, yes or no?  
A.	No. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, it seems to me that Mr. Hooper is cross-examining the witness on the basis of materials he's already stated several times he has not read.  So I see little to be gained from him reading into the record information that's not on the record and that this witness has already stated several times that he's not consulted.  It seems to me that this is just a deft maneuver to put information on the record that no one is in a position to contest or confirm.  
MR. HOOPER: 
In response, I merely say this witness has said he's read some, but he can't remember which, so I'm attempting to jog his memory, and maybe one of these references will ring a bell and he'll be able to say, "Yes, I did see that" and whether he saw it here or in a general statement, and I feel it's a valid question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not stopping you yet, Mr. Hooper, but the -- we think that you're actually close to the limit now.  
MR. HOOPER: 
All right.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You referred just a moment ago when you were asked in re-examination to your map 8 and to your symbols 6 and 7.  Let's not get too lost in 6 and 7.  What's 6?  Is that Rwandex? 
A.	Six is the area known as Gikondo. 
Q.	Is it known as the Rwandex junction to anyone who lives in Kigali? 
A.	Yeah, one of the junction there will be called Rwandex junction.  This is -- I'm representing the area, so you can say near around Rwandex junction. 
Q.	But the main road there, the junction, is called the Rwandex junction; is that right? 
A.	Junction is called Rwandex junction.  I'm representing the area locality which is Gikondo.  It's a larger area on the right of the road. 
Q.	Point 7, is that known to everyone in Kigali as the Sonatubes? 
A.	Yes, Sonatubes, circular Sonatube, yes.  
Q.	And are both those in fact marked as such on the Defence skeletal sketch, Rwandex and Sonatubes? 
A.	Yes, you marked them and you marked Gikondo also. 
Q.	Have you come across references in your general reading that you recall stating that those two junctions were from the 8th of April onwards under -- leaving Sonatubes -- Rwandex, the furthest west, was under heavy mortar fire from RPF forces, that's Rwandex, under heavy mortar fire from RPF forces, a contested position.  Have you come across anything to support that? 
A.	I have not come across of such document. 
Q.	And you haven't looked at any of the United Nations contemporary observations; that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	Right from beginning my position is that any -- I cannot say I have not looked at any of the document.  Some of the document, but not the exhaustive list of the documents. 
Q.	Have you read -- and this isn't a little detail -- that on the 10thth of April '94, UNAMIR was sending faxes, secret faxes, to the UN in New York, that have been published and available, saying that early on the 10th of January -- sorry, 10th of April the RPF had reached the outskirts of Kigali city.  Did you -- that's as early as the 10th.  Had you seen anything about that? 
A.	This area again, like, once I was looking into some UNAMIR reports.  I cannot recall the exact content of dates.  In one day, like, in the initial period it was mentioned RPF has taken certain area.  Second fax says RPF has not taken that area.  So I do not know what was the truth.  It's very confusing picture at that time.  That's why I'm telling you that I'm not read all the things, then cross-check through some other sources the -- how the records -- how these reports have come.  There is little bit some confusing or misleading fax come if you read few thing.  That's why I told it's my opinion, which may be one-sided opinion.  Now you're quoting each and every document which I don't remember. 
Q.	Well, see if you can remember some of the principal points.  I have only three more questions.  Three more questions, if I may.  

Do you recall seeing anything from UNAMIR stating RPF troops -- this is, on the 12th -- entered the city from all directions?  Have you ever seen or come across anything like that?  
A.	I told there are confusing reports from UNAMIR which I mention just now.  I don't remember which reports.  I read few them -- few of them and they were, like, one day telling something, second day telling something.  So I don't know whether -- so these reports to be seen in the light of testimony of witnesses who were moving or who might have moved that time. 
Q.	All right.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me.  It may be helpful for the record if when Mr. Hooper is reading from a report he at least indicates what port -- what report, what date, the source so that we can go back and look at this information.  As things now stand, all we hear is his question, and we don't know where it's coming from and what it's based on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  What I hear is not his question.  I hear the witness's answer.  The witness has not given any weight to the questions because he says he doesn't know.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	A consequence of RPF pressure, is this within your knowledge, was that the FAR -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, but what was my concern a few minutes ago was that you're pushing to the limits of the knowledge which the witness has said he has. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And there's a point beyond which those questions are no longer helpful; they're just harassing.  
MR. HOOPER: 
All right.  All right.  Yes.  Can I ask, then, one last question?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you know where these places are, their general location:  Kicugiro, that's K-I-C-U-G-I-R-O, Kagarama, K-A-G-A-R-A-M-A, Nyarurama, N-Y-A-R-U-R-A-M-A, and Kagasa, K-A-G-A-S-A?  Can you just help us as to where that is in Kigali or its environs? 
A.	This place Kicugiro, if it is the same place as Kicukiro, then it's near Sonatube.  I don't know whether you are referring same Kicukiro as Kicugiro.  The other place, Kagasa, Nyarurama and Kagarama, I do not know where are these places in Kigali. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  Your microphone, please, Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphone not activated)...
MR. WEBSTER: 
Who is testifying here, Mr. Hooper or the witness?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I have no other questions.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We'll take a break now.  And on our resumption we will address the evidential issues that we need to deal with.  
(Court recessed at 1048H) 
(Pages 21 to 32 by Sherri Knox) 































(Court resumed at 1120H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now we're resumed.  We were at a stage where we had to deal with the admission of exhibits.  There were just the -- Mr. Registrar, which were the exhibits we have, matters marked for identification?  There were two Defence exhibits.  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, if I understood your question, today we have Exhibit P. 28A, the Procès-verbal d'exhumation, and P. 28B, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Hooper, any objection to admission of this?  
MR. HOOPER:
No objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence is P. 28.
(Exhibit No. P. 28 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, anything else?  Mr. Hooper, you had two matters which were -- two applications for admission of exhibits which were -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Mr. O'Shea will take -- take the argument.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

There's no guarantee that the Prosecutor will still maintain his objections, so just identify what your exhibits are at this stage.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, very well, Your Honour.  The one exhibit is, I believe, D -- ID. 1 --  would I be correct in saying that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Prosecutor, do you maintain your objection?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, we do, Your Honour.  
MR. O'SHEA:
And then the other exhibit, Your Honour, is the long stretch of joined -- conjoined photos of Gikomero, which, I believe, was not given a number.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you.  

Mr. Webster, with regard to both of these matters, the points that you raised deal only with the issue of the weight of the testimony, so we think that we should admit them, and then we will deal with them as we consider their value as evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Are you inviting a response, or is it just a decision?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  You're entitled to say something at this stage, if you wish, but that is the view that we have at the moment.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It seems rather pointless.  The photo, itself, is a photograph of an amalgam that was pieced together.  So it's not even taken from -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I understand that, but you see, we have heard what Mr. Baghel said about it --  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and that will affect the weight that we give to it.  So those issues, to me, to us --
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- deal not with admissibility, but with the weight that is attached to the photographs.  The same thing with the other diagram.  We have had the evidence of Mr. Baghel, and that will assist us in the way in which we review and deal with these matters.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Fine.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The ID. 1 is admitted in evidence.  Exhibit number?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, D. 6.  
(Exhibit No. D. 6 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the composite photograph is admitted.  Mr. Registrar, that becomes D. 7?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.
(Exhibit No. D. 7 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Were there any other outstanding exhibits that we need to consider at that stage?  The other two matters we'll deal with tomorrow.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, there's just -- there's just the CD which basically contains existing exhibits, but it's just to facilitate viewing of them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes.  We will admit it in evidence as well because the reason why we didn't do it yesterday was, we had to wait until we decided what to do with ID. 1.  So that's admitted in evidence, and that becomes Exhibit D. 8.
MR. WEBSTER:
Before we admit it, may I raise a caution that the Prosecutor does not have a copy of the CD, and we prefer to have a copy so that we can use it effectively as well.  If it's admitted in evidence, is that going to place an impediment on getting it copied for us?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, how many -- how many copies have you tendered to the registry?  
MR. HOOPER:
I only burnt the one, hoping that Court Management would then make copies of the CD.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think that's usually an acceptable procedure.  

Mr. Fry, what's -- 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Normally speaking, the party tendering an exhibit should provide sufficient copies for all the parties.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we can, but we do have limited facilities, and we are aware that Court Management Services have access to far better facilities than we have.  We -- we provide a CD, which has had things copied into it.  That becomes the exhibit.  It's arguably for Court Management then to preserve the integrity of that document by copying it, itself, rather than having us copy it when there might be deviations.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see the problem in this, I don't think that is the rule that we have -- that we follow.  We expect that the party who is tendering an exhibit would supply -- 

Is it four copies, Mr. Fry?
  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, one for each Judge and one for the Prosecution, as a minimum.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And one for -- and what about the registry?  
MR. FRY:
Plus one for the registry, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's five copies, right?  So I think that's the normal procedure.  The problem in this case is that if we take this as -- as an exhibit now, we would want to maintain control of it.  That's a problem.  
MR. HOOPER:
So I'm going to have the exhibit back in order to make four further copies of it, and then we can exhibit it --  there will be no objection, as I understand it -- in a few days' time, but -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may, Your Honour, fundamentally, and I raise the issue only now so that we can set the right -- get the procedures in place for the rest of the trial.  We see it as an issue of reciprocal disclosure.  If copies had been made and delivered to us ahead of time, then it wouldn't be an issue now.  So if we could do that in the future, it's really not a -- I -- in one sense, I agree with Mr. Hooper.  Once it's delivered to Court Management, I don't see why they can't make duplicates for everyone, but we would like to see the exhibits before they're even tendered to the witness.  So I'm asking the Court to reinforce the regime of reciprocal disclosure that we had discussed during the status conference.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think that position is quite clear.  We knew that this was created during the evidence of            Mr. Baghel, and that's the reason why it didn't exist before.  But I think the position on reciprocal disclosure is quite clear.  

Mr. Fry, in this case, could we ask the CMS to make an exception?  Because I think that if -- if you're going to tender this, it would be preferable for you to maintain control of the CD at this stage.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, in this case, we can copy the CDs and distribute them to the parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, CMS is making an exception in this case at our request, but we'll expect within the future that you would make arrangements to supply five copies of each exhibit.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  And I -- yes, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is admitted as D. 8.
(Exhibit No. D. 8 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Was there any outstanding issues on your side, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Aside from the two CD-ROMs, I assume that we'll deal with that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Tomorrow.
MR. WEBSTER:
-- on Wednesday -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wednesday, yeah. 
MR. WEBSTER:
 -- there's going to be the issue of video clip of the exhumation.  I mentioned that at the tail end of      Mr. Baghel's re-examination, that we will deal with on Wednesday as well because it's a video clip.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  
MR. WEBSTER:
There are, I believe, four newspaper articles that we had discussed that were marked for identification that we were going to come back to as well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
On Wednesday. 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- on Wednesday as well.  Well, we can deal with that then.  Other than those items, I think that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's all.  That's all for now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
-- the four newspaper articles and then the two CD-ROMs, plus the CD-ROM that -- the clip that we'll introduce of the exhumation.  And just during the break, it was brought to my attention that we also have photographs of the exhumation.  We don't necessarily have to introduce those in evidence, but we will make copies of them and serve them on the Defence, and then we can deal with that on Wednesday morning as well.  So it's all part of a piece.  It's the exhumation report that was served this morning; we brought to the Court's attention the existence of a video; and just 20 minutes ago, I was informed that there are over a dozen photographs.  So that as well we can make available to             Mr. Hooper.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Baghel, thank you very much for your testimony.  I think you can be excused now.
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  Thank you very much.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the Prosecutor calls their next witness, Mr. Hooper, we are considering the Prosecution motion for -- with regard to alibi notices.  And with regard to the document that you had filed, entitled, "Confidential Alibi Notice," there were some problems with some dates on it.  And we wondered -- I don't know if you are aware of those issues, but there are certain dates described as 2004 --  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and 2005 --  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- which we --
MR. HOOPER:
There's an error. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- in the context, they appear to be erroneous. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I let Mr. O'Shea deal with this?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.   
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, we apologise for that, Your Honour.  We'll put in an appropriate corrigendum.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that would be acceptable, but in the meantime, I would just like to know what is the position, because it's relevant to something we're dealing with at the moment. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, the position is that it should say 1994 instead of 2004.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, there's also a date missing, which seems to be 1993 from the context, on the line before.  
MR. O'SHEA:
That might be correct.  If I could just have a look at the alibi notice.  

I apologise, Your Honour.  We're just looking for the alibi notice.  
Perhaps if I may ask Your Honour just to read me the sentence, I'd be able to deal with it in that way more simply, cause I'm looking for a copy of the alibi notice this side and can't find one at the moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's entitled "Confidential Alibi Notice."  
MR. O'SHEA:
Oh, of course.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you wish me to read it into the Court record?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, it's -- the only confidential -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)... I can show you the document.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  All right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registry.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I see the difficulty, Your Honour.  It's where -- it's where it says "23rd of September," that should say "23rd of September 1993."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much.  

Yes.  Mr. Hooper reminds me that I should just indicate to the Court and the parties that it's Anvers in Belgium, Aswan in Egypt if that's not already clear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
And in addition to the two names that are there, there's a -- in addition to the two names that are there, there's a third name which is -- I'm sorry.  

Yes, I appreciate we're in open session, but in the circumstances, the third name is                  Professor Van Balen, B-A-L-E-N, and we'll provide a amended copy of that and just one -- one other matter --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'll be -- I'll be grateful if you could be as specific as you can be as we are in the process of addressing the Prosecutor's motion today.  

MR. HOOPER:
Can you give me one moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And there was just one other question.  There was a missing date -- a missing date -- although the context might make a suggestion -- on the second line, 6th April -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Second line?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes -- and the first line of the fourth paragraph.  The years are missing.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Again, that's 1994, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you very much.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I should indicate that with regard to the addresses of the witnesses, we do intend to provide those.  We're just trying to get in contact with them at the moment, as a matter of courtesy.  
MR. HOOPER:
I should also say that I've brought each day to Court, but not today, the statements of the three persons, two named here, and the one I've just added today.  We have statements from two of them, formal statements, and a -- well, I think a statement from the third one as well.  And they are -- they can be inspected and seen.  Our concern at the moment is that I haven't been in contact with -- with those witnesses.  The first witness whose name appears Pierre Mercenier was the principal professor at Anvers, now in retirement and living in Italy.  He's Belgian.  And I met him there and took a statement from him, but I haven't been able to contact him.  I confess, I haven't tried to in the sense of, I haven't actually found the time to phone him up or try to phone him up, which is my means of contact with him.  So that's an oversight on my part since last week.  

Secondly, the second doctor, Dr. Francois Monet, is again a Belgian doctor working in Burkina Faso at the moment and only contactable, I think, through internet.  And I've sent him an e-mail, but I haven't had a return back.  So, again, in respect of Van Balen, I haven't contacted him either since I saw him two or three years ago.  I have a statement from him, but I owe, I think, each of these men at least the courtesy of telling them that I'm putting their names about.  They expected that, of course, when they provided the statements, but I think at the same time, it's a proper courtesy.  

I have no objection to the Prosecution looking at these statements.  I am concerned, though, that if there is any meeting or contact between the Prosecution and these witnesses that it's done on notice to the Defence, giving the Defence a fair and proper opportunity to be represented at any meeting.  And I say that in respect of any witnesses that -- whose names we put forward.  

As a class of witness, I don't think any three of those gentlemen would, for a moment, consider himself in need of being a protected witness -- a protected witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Mr. Prosecutor, you may call your next witness.  
MS. FALL:
Can the witness be called, please?  This is a request.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there an existence of a signed statement by the witness, of identity?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you please issue the oath to the witness, please.  
(Declaration made by Witness ALA made in Kinyarwanda) 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
WITNESS ALA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
MS. FALL:
We'll now move into identification, and in order to do that, Mr. President, I'll have to -- after showing the Defence, I'd like to give this witness an identification sheet which actually reflects the first page of the procès-verbal of identification.  And this has been signed and has a date -- or, rather, he will sign, and the date will be placed.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you in a position to identify on that document your name?  
A.	Yes, I can see my name on this document.  
Q.	What about your first name?  
A.	Yes, I can also see my first name.  
Q.	What about date of birth?  
A.	Yes, I can also see the date of birth.  
Q.	What about your nationality?  
A.	Yes, my nationality is also mentioned on the document.  
Q.	What about your ethnic origin?  
A.	Yes, my ethnic group is also shown on this document.  
Q.	What about reference to your current occupation?  
A.	Yes, I can see a reference to my occupation on this document.  
Q.	What about your occupation in April 1994, is it reflected on this document?  
A.	Yes, I can see that on the document.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us whether the information concerning your date of birth is correct?  
A.	Yes, the information regarding my date of birth is correct.  
Q.	What about the information concerning your current residence or place of board, is that information correct as well?  
A.	Yes, that information is also correct.  
Q.	What about the place where you used to live in 1994?  
A.	Yes, that information is also correct.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, could I request the registry to assist the witness so that the witness can sign the document and also write down the date on this document?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I'd like to request that this document should be entered as Prosecution evidence and that it should be placed under seal due to the confidential nature -- or the confidential nature of the contents therein.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence and ordered to be placed under seal.  

Mr. Registrar, the number is P. 1?  
MR. FRY:
P. 29, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 29, thank you very much.  
(Exhibit No. P. 29 admitted, under seal)
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness ALA, I would like to ask you what -- what was the level of your studies?  I mean, up to -- how far did you go in your studies?  
A.	I did six years in primary school, and after my primary education, I attended secondary education for three years.  
Q.	Is this your first time coming here to testify before the Tribunal in Arusha?  
A.	Yes, this is my very first time to come here to testify.  
Q.	Did you have the opportunity of testifying before any national court or courts in Rwanda?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Have you met investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I met investigators of the ICTR.  
Q.	Can you tell us how many times you met those investigators?  
A.	I met them three times.  
Q.	Can you tell us whether, during those three occasions, you gave them statement -- or statements?  
A.	I made a statement to them for the first time in 1998; and then they came back to see me again on the second occasion in 2003; and then they came back for the third time in 2004; so I met the investigators of the ICTR on those three occasions.  
Q.	Can you tell us how many statements you gave them?  Can you say that you gave them only one statement?  
A.	Yes, I made only one statement.  
Q.	Can you tell us -- can you confirm that that was in 1998?  
A.	Yes.  I met the investigators in 1998.  If my memory serves me well, maybe it was in June.  
Q.	And did you sign the statement you gave the investigators in 1998?  
A.	Yes, I signed that statement.  
Q.	Before signing that statement, was that statement read back to you?  
A.	That goes without saying.  They first -- they read back the statement to me, and when I saw that actually it was in conformity to what I had said, I duly signed it because I would not have signed that statement had it not been read back to me.  
Q.	Witness ALA, can you tell us, where did you live in April 1994?  
A.	In April 1994, before the massacres which occurred in Rwanda, I lived in the Kayanga secteur, but because of the killings, I fled Kayanga in the month of April.  
Q.	Can you tell us, when did you flee Kayanga in April?  
A.	I remember that after -- six days after the president's plane was shot down, that is,                    President Habyarimana's plane was shot down, I fled my locality.  
Q.	Can you tell us, when was the president's aeroplane brought down?  
A.	The president's aeroplane was brought down on the 6th of April 1994, at around 7:30 in the evening, if I am to rely on the information which was broadcast -- which was broadcast at that time.  
Q.	So from your answer, should I deduct that you left Kayanga on the 12th of April, because you said that you left your area of residence six days after the president's plane was downed?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I left that area on the 12th of April.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you know the person called André Rwamakuba? 

MR. O'SHEA:
With respect, that's not an appropriate way to approach the matter.  It's -- the knowledge of                 Dr. Rwamakuba is a matter of contention.  Therefore, that area should be approached by a different way, in my submission.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that I'm the best-placed person when it comes to leading my witness because this is examination-in-chief, and I think -- I know that I have to avoid leading questions, but at this point in time, with regard to his knowledge of Rwamakuba, I don't think that the Defence is in a position to actually tell me how I should conduct my examination-in-chief in this regard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I thought that their remarks were addressed to me, asking for a ruling as to whether the question was a leading question or not.  It's a question of law how you approach these matters, and it might be of interest if you inquired his method of knowledge first, and then the conclusion of knowledge could be drawn from that.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I should like to understand the information that is being required, and if it is the Defence which is going to tell me how I should conduct this examination-in-chief, then I should like to know the precise examination that is required -- information that is required of me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, the Bench rules on the legal issues in the trial, not the parties.  The Defence made an application, which I interpreted to be a complaint that your question -- "Did you know" -- was a leading question.  That's a matter of law.  I didn't think it was necessary for me to say anything about it because I thought, as a matter of course, you would have rephrased the question and asked questions which would have drawn out the information without having put it so bluntly to the witness.  That's all.  But I don't think it's necessary to make a formal ruling on a matter of this nature.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I did not say, "Did you know."  I asked him if he knew.  I do not know whether there is a problem at that level.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, continue.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Did you know André Rwamakuba?  
MR. O'SHEA:
We're still in the same area, aren't we?  Why can't the witness say where he was, what he was doing, who he saw?  I mean, why do we have to go straight to a matter of highly contention?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. O'Shea, the French interpreter says that he cannot hear you if you do not use the microphone that is on the stand before you.  
MR. HOOPER:
So Mr. O'Shea's listening to the French, so could the French interpreter tell him that 'cause he didn't hear that.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry, Your Honour.  
MR. HOOPER:
He said, can you repeat what you just said.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Oh, yes.  Your Honour, I don't see any difference in the question which has just been put from the one I objected to before.  My -- my -- my complaint is that -- sorry, is there a problem?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's a request that you use the other microphone.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Oh, I apologise.  Yes, the objection was this, that the question which Ms. Fall just put is no different from the question that she put before, that the knowledge of this witness of the person in question is a matter of dispute, and under those circumstances, it would be better to take the witness to where the witness is and who he knows, who he saw.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I would not expect to have to make formal rulings on a matter of this nature, and I thought the issue was one which you could handle without me having to intervene.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I don't want to quarrel about it, but we are not trying someone who is not known.  We're trying André Rwamakuba; everybody knows this; and that is why I wish to establish some basis.  And the witness has seen this person several times, and that is what I was driving at. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)... That is exactly the complaint that is being made.  You asked him to say something which is a conclusion that would be drawn from certain statements that he would normally make.  So what was being requested was that you ask him to set the foundation from which that conclusion of knowledge would be drawn.  That's all.  For example, what you just said now, which you should not have said, should have come from the witness, and then the conclusion of knowledge could be drawn after that.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I shall rephrase.  Where were you in January 1994?  
A.	In January 1994, I was on my hill in Kayanga.  
Q.	In what precise location of Kayanga were you?  
A.	I was in *************.  
Q.	And in January 1994, what did you observe?  Can you tell us?  
A.	The matters that I observed, I did observe many things, but I was able to see a vehicle on board which were three people and which was equipped with a megaphone.  And from this megaphone, one could hear words which were not very correct.  So do you wish -- if you wish me to give you the identities of the people who were in the vehicle, I'll tell you then.  Amongst these people there was a person known as André Rwamakuba.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to ask you a few questions before we come to the identity of the persons that you saw.  You said that you saw a vehicle.  Can you describe this vehicle?  
A.	I did not see the vehicle arrive.  I was at home, near the commercial centre where the vehicle was parked.  And my house is close to this centre, so I could hear the noise coming from the megaphone or loud speakers.  It aroused my curiosity, so I went out to find out where the noise was coming from.  When I got there, I realised that it was a vehicle in which three men were.  Amongst them were Anastase Gasana, Aloys Munyangazu and André Rwamakuba.  The vehicle was parked, and these three people called me, and I approached them.  
Q.	Do you know the brand name of the vehicle?  
A.	It was a Peugot 505 of khaki colour, and the numberplates were yellow, which corresponded to government-owned vehicles at the time.  
Q.	Can you confirm, how do you know that government vehicles -- government-owned vehicles had yellow numberplates?  
A.	Anastase Gasana was a minister at the time, and the vehicle on board which he was had yellow numberplates.  And the number was preceded by the letter M, which meant ministry, and this was a distinctive sign that identified ministers' official vehicles.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you began your testimony, you said that you saw the vehicle and that it contained three persons referred to as Anastase Gasana, André Rwamakuba, and a third person.  How could you have been sure about these three persons and their names?  How could you have known that these were the three people in question?  
A.	I knew Gasana even beforehand, and he, too, knew me.  I knew him when he was still a university professor in Nyakinama campus, because I used to visit him.  Gasana lived with his younger brother who was my friend, and that is how I got to know Gasana.  And when the vehicle got to the centre and I went to find out what was going on, Gasana called me because I was, by profession, a *********************.  So I heeded his call.  He introduced me to the other gentlemen, Aloys Munyangazu and André Rwamakuba, without, however, telling me what their jobs were.  Then he told me about the mechanical problem that their vehicle had, and that is how I came -- I got to know the people who -- the other two people who were on board the vehicle with him.  
Q.	Can you tell us what mechanical problem the vehicle had?  
A.	As ***********************, I tried to fix the vehicle, but I was not able to do so.  And when I -- when I -- I tried to start the vehicle, but I was not able to do so.  When I examined the vehicle, I found that the clutch plate had been damaged, and the smell could be -- it could be told from the smell when one tried to start the vehicle.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) (No interpretation)
A.	No, I was not able to repair the vehicle because the clutch plate was completely damaged, and this part had to be changed, and we did not have spare parts right there.  
Q.	Witness, so in the meantime, what happened?  So you were with these three people --                   André Rwamakuba, Anastase Gasana -- 
A.	During the time we spent together when I was trying to repair the vehicle, André Rwamakuba took the microphone.  He called to people who were at the centre and other people who were in their homes, and he told them that it was time for the Hutus to get rid of the enemy.  At that time when reference was made to "the enemy," it was clear that the enemy in question was Tutsis.  
Q.	Witness, did you personally hear these words?  
A.	He did not say this just once.  He repeated this several times while the vehicle was parked at that place before he left the centre.  
Q.	For better clarity and for the record, you said "he" repeated them.  Who repeated them, since there were three people?  
A.	I shall say this again.  André Rwamakuba is the person who took the microphone and who said      these words.  He said, "The time has come for you Hutus to get rid of the enemy." And it is            André Rwamakuba who said this.  It is not Aloys Munyangazu or Anastase Gasana.  It is               André Rwamakuba.  It is him.  It is he who said these words.  
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whom he was speaking to? 
A.	In principal, he was talking to Rwandans, more specifically, the Hutus, so that they could all get together and work together towards eliminating the Tutsis.  So the words were addressed to the Hutus.  
Q.	Can you tell us whether there were many people around the vehicle or not?  
A.	There were at least a dozen people around the vehicle when these words were said.  
Q.	Can you tell us how long André Rwamakuba and the people who accompanied him stayed at that location?  
A.	I cannot tell you how long they stayed at that place because I found them there, where the vehicle had broken down, but if I consider the time that I spent there, I would say that I stayed there for about 25 minutes.  
Q.	And after these 25 minutes, can you tell us what they did?  
A.	After these 25 minutes, they realised that the vehicle could not be repaired immediately, and they asked the people who were present to push the vehicle.  The people pushed the vehicle to a place called Rutunga, to the home of one person -- of someone called Innocent Kayumba who was a trader.  
Q.	I shall return to this point later.  I would like you to give a date.  When you saw André Rwamakuba at that time when he was making speeches, can you tell us the precise date when this occurred?  
A.	I cannot remember the date, but I think it should have been around the third week of the month of January.  If I base my calculation on New Year's Day, I think it was around the third week of January.  
Q.	Witness, you say that after these words, they went towards Rutunga to the home of a trader called Kayumba, Innocent; is that what you said?  
A.	Yes, you're right.  You understood correctly.  
Q.	Can you tell us the distance between Kayanga and the place where the home of Innocent Kayumba was located?  
A.	Kayanga and Rutunga share a border, but from the commercial centre where we were and the place -- to the place where Kayumba's home was -- I think that's what you're trying to find out -- the distance between the two points is about three kilometres.  
Q.	If it is three kilometres or thereabouts, as you say, could you personally know that they actually went to the home of Innocent Kayumba?  
A.	I did not go with the people who pushed this vehicle because I stayed in my home, but later on, a friend who was the former accountant of the commune, who is called Mathias Rubanguka, told me that he had met these people, the people who had pushed the vehicle, and he even told me that they had held a small meeting at the home of this trader, Kayumba, who had, in due course, lent them a vehicle that they had used to return because the vehicle that had broken down stayed at Kayumba's home.  So this is what Mathias Rubanguka told me, that they had held a meeting at the home of Kayumba.  
Q.	Can you tell us what Mr. Mathias Rubanguka did for a living?  
A.	At that time before the massacres of 1994, Rubanguka was accountant for the commune.  
Q.	Do you know where the said Rubanguka, Mathias, is at this time?  
A.	Last I heard of him, he was in Muhima prison, but I do not know whether he is still in that prison today.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, apart from these events that you have just recounted to us, was this the only time that you saw André Rwamakuba?  
A.	This is the only time when I saw Rwamakuba face to face, in January 1994, but in 1993, around October, I saw Rwamakuba when he passed through Kayanga on board a vehicle.  
Q.	Could you try to give us a date, even approximate, of that time?  
A.	I do not remember the exact date, but it was in October.  My birthday is the 15th of October, and I remember that I saw them -- I saw him about a week after my birthday.  I might say that it was in the third week of October when I saw André Rwamakuba go past on board that vehicle.  
Q.	During the period that you have just described to us, did you see Rwamakuba speak or make any statement whatsoever?  
A.	He spoke to some people, but I cannot tell you the content of their discussions because I was not close to the group when they were talking.  
Q.	Can you tell us, if you know their names, who he was talking to?  
A.	It wasn't a large group.  There was Mathias Rubanguka, whom he met each time he passed through that place.  The other person was Gerard Gakuba (phonetic), who was also a friend of Rubanguka.  I no longer remember the names of the others because this took place a long time ago.  
Q.	Apart from these two meetings, Witness, were you able to see André Rwamakuba under other circumstances?  
A.	I did not see André Rwamakuba on other occasions apart from this meeting in January, but I also heard that he was organising rallies in various locations of Gikomero commune and more specifically in his area of origin, that is, Nduba, in Sha and Musave as well.  
Q.	But you do confirm that you did not attend these meetings, do you?  
A.	No, I was not present.  This is information that was reported to me.  
Q.	Were you aware of the distribution of weapons in your area?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Again, Your Honour -- 
MS. FALL:
I shall rephrase.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, I shall ask you, apart from these statements made by André Rwamakuba, are you aware of other events that occurred in your commune?  
A.	Yes, other events occurred in my commune that I was aware of, particularly, training was organised for young Hutus.  These were, in fact, military-style -- this was, in fact, military-style training, and yet the young people who underwent this training were never absorbed into the army.  These exercises were organised with a view to the massacres that would occur in due course.  
Q.	You have referred to massacres.  When did these massacres take place?  
A.	The massacres I witnessed were those of the 13th -- 13th of April.  There were massacres during an attack that was led by Mathias Rubanguka and Nyarwaya, who was brigadier of the commune.  They were accompanied by other Hutus, and they were chasing the Tutsis who had not been able to flee, and they were killing the victims.  At that time they had a vehicle on board which they travelled, but there were other assailants who were going about on foot.  
Q.	If I understood correctly, Witness, you said that these massacres occurred on the 13th of April in your commune?  
A.	Yes.  In my commune, the massacres that I witnessed were those that occurred on the 13th of April.  
Q.	Witness, you told us beforehand that you left your commune on the 12th of April; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, I left my commune on the 12th, but on the 13th I was not far from my home.  I was in Giti commune in Karagari, just opposite my locality of origin.  The only thing between us was Lake Muhazi.  So I was on the lake shore, and I was, therefore, able to see what was occurring on the other side of the lake.  
Q.	You are telling us that from the place -- between the place where you were and the place where the massacres occurred, there was not a great distance.  Can you give us an approximate idea of it?  
A.	It wasn't a great distance.  It was 40 to 60 metres as the crow flies, about 40 to 60 metres, yes.  
Q.	And you say that from where you were located, you were able to observe what was happening on the other side of the lake?  
A.	Yes, I could see the happenings clearly.  If anyone on the other side of lake -- is on the other side of Lake Muhazi, he can hear someone who is across the lake.  So I could see what was happening fairly clearly.  
Q.	Were you able to identify some of the authors of these massacres?  
A.	Yes, I was able to identify a few of them.  The attack was led by Mathias Rubanguka and              Michel Nyarwaya.  Other assailants were citizens including Ernest Karemera (phonetic) and many others whose names I do not remember.  In any case, there were many -- very many assailants.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, it's just after 12:30.  Is it a convenient time to break now?  
MS. FALL:
I agree, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll resume at 2.00. 
(Court recessed at 1236H)
(Pages 33 to 50 by Wendy Molnar)






















1410H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon everybody.  We can resume our session now. 
MR. O`SHEA: 
Your Honours, before the break Your Honours drew to our attention some errors in our alibi notice.  I would just like to inform the Court that we have corrected those errors I hope satisfactorily.  We have filed it with the court coordinator and provided copies to Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We have already seen it and taken note of it. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I also wish to thank the Defence for the corrections they have made; however, I wish to ask a question.  I wonder -- should I start over again, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought I had understood you but it might be safer to start again. 
MS. FALL: 
I was saying that I was thanking the Defence for having made the corrections to the notice regarding alibi, but I want to find out from them whether this is a final document insofar as the information which has been provided only deals with witnesses. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
If I may, I would like the witness to remove his head phones, I don't know what Ms. Fall is about to say. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, maybe it might not be so appropriate to discuss that now.  What has happened is that we are, in fact, going to be delivering, probably later this evening, a decision on the Prosecution's motion with regard to the alibi notice.  So it may very well be that these issues are covered in our decision. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

May I continue? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness ALA, before the break you had told us that from where you were, in other words, on the other side of Lac Muhazi you were able to witness killings and you were able, therefore, to see the perpetrators of those killings.  You, in fact, gave us two names of alleged perpetrators, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I was able to observe the killings as they were being carried out.  I was in a banana groove by the shores and I was hiding there.  I was able to see the leaders of the attacks.  They came on board vehicles, but there were also attackers who came on foot.  There were also those who were carrying firearms on the opposite side in relation to the banana groove where I was hiding. 
Q.	So you are telling us that these persons were armed.  Could you please describe to us the weapons that they were carrying? 
A.	The attackers were carrying traditional weapons and they also had guns because they also used these guns to shoot towards where we were.  But when they had killed people on the other side of the shores they had machetes.  After they had killed them with the machetes, they threw the bodies into the lake.  And when they used the guns, they wanted to shoot at the place where we were, in other words, the opposite side of the lake. 
Q.	Witness ALA, concerning these weapons, these guns, do you know how the attackers came by those weapons? 
A.	In fact, the plan for the massacre had been pre-established because the weapons, which were used during those killings, had been distributed well before that date.  So it is not surprising that those people were in possession of those weapons.  Mention was made of this well in advance, it was said that these people had received training and that they had also received weapons in order to get rid of the enemy. 
Q.	Can you inform the Chamber about the people who distributed those weapons? 
A.	I was not present when the weapons distribution took place but, for example, in the area where I lived people were saying that one Mathias Rubanguka -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
(Microphone not activated).  Can the Prosecutor assist me on whether I have been put on notice of this aspect of evidence, weapons distribution? 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, we disclosed the statement of the witness together with investigator's notes, which we disclosed.  And in one of those notes by the investigator there is, indeed, mention of the distribution of weapons. 
MR. HOOPER: 
One difficulty may be that I only received the English version this morning of the notes, which are fairly extensive, could the Court give me just a moment to reread or refresh my memory, I won't be a second. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.  I must confess that I am in the same position because I only received a copy this morning myself. 
MS. FALL: 
You are quite right, Mr. President, because for a long time we have been asking for translation from the language services section.  Unfortunately, we are unable to ask them to provide us with the document at a given date.  I believe it was only last evening when the documents were given to us.  And as soon as we had the translations we -- we communicated the documents to the Chamber, disclosed them to the Defence. 

MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  I have reminded myself and I see in paragraph 3 of the French that there is a reference there to someone.  Anyway, I will let my friend continue.  I am sorry to have interrupted. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Let me repeat my question.  Can you tell us by whom these weapons were distributed, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I was not present when the weapons distribution took place but it was said, where I lived, it was said that weapons were distributed by one Mathias Rubanguka because it would seem that he was the major leader of the attacks.  He was the one who received instructions from the higher up authorities. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please tell us, if you know, whether there were many victims during those attacks? 
A.	The killings took place on the 13th of April when I was on the shores of Lac Muhazi; I saw five bodies at that time.  Apart from the shores of Lac Muhazi, the attacks also took place at the Kayanga health centre, where the attacks caused the death of about 100 people.  I wouldn't be able to tell you names of all of the victims but I do know that many people were killed during those attacks. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are speaking about attacks which took place at the Kayanga centre, were you present when those attacks took place? 
A.	No, I wasn't present there either, but there were survivors of those attacks who told us what had happened, and even today they continue to tell us what had happened. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you able to tell the Court, since you say you saw some of the victims, are you able to tell us what was the ethnic group to which they belonged, those victims? 
A.	I think I have said this, it was the ethnic group which was being hunted down, it was the Tutsi who were being pursued to be killed.  So it was the Tutsi who were killed during those massacres, during those attacks. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think at this point I am done with the witness in regard to his testimony, for the time being. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

Mr. Witness, you have indicated that this is your first time in the Court environment.  You will now be asked questions by the lawyer representing the Accused person and you will be obliged to answer his questions, so he will be questioning you now.

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  

MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS ALA
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good afternoon, sir.
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	My name is David Hooper and I am one of the groups of people who represent André Rwamakuba in this case.  I am wearing this strange thing on my head because that is the tradition of where I come from in London, in England for lawyers to wear; I hope it doesn't put you off.  But the first things I'm going to ask you may reveal your identity and so we are going to go, with the President of this Court's consent, into a closed session so that members of the public won't hear what is discussed, and so that your privacy is maintained.

Now, if at any time when we are not in closed session I ask you anything that you think is -- may reveal who you are that you must let me know if nobody else does; you understand, because you come here as a protected witness and we are all here to serve that purpose.  Do you understand, sir?  
A.	Very well, Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
.	If there are any people in the public gallery --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper that was my first question, the estimate of time; you were about to answer the question I was about to ask. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Fifteen or 20 minutes, it is difficult, we will see how --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that. 
MR. HOOPER: 
But I think -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The comments I wish to make is that I'm interested in preserving the idea of a public trial.  In order to facilitate that, I would be grateful if you could group all of the questions that may fall into this category into one closed session as far as that is possible.  And I would also -- at this stage, do you have any questions, Ms. Fall?  Does the Prosecutor have a position?
MS. FALL:
I have no objection as to the closed session, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, well we will go into a closed session.  Now, for the benefit of the people in the public gallery, I will indicate that the closed session is estimated to last for approximately 20 minutes.  At that stage, we will go back into open session and you may return to continue listening to the proceedings.

(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 56 to 65] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera).
(Pages 51 to 55 by Donna M. Lewis)






























MR. HOOPER:
May I say, I believe I can complete -- I can complete my cross-examination this afternoon. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	We're now in -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, the witness is signaling that he would like to say something.  

Mr. Witness, you may speak.  
THE WITNESS:
It is not a problem as such or a question, but I would like to ask for a break of a couple of minutes.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm glad you ask for that, Mr. Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
So, that I may go out and attend to a call of nature.  
MR. HOOPER:
I share that with you as it were, Mr. Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take our 15-minute break now.
(Court recessed at 1515H to 1537H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, we'll resume our session now.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Just dealing or recapping with some matters that don't identify you, but for the purpose of a public hearing and your evidence, you told us that there had been a period when you had trained Interahamwe in your area, and you believed this was in December of 1992, for a period of two weeks; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	You weren't in your area in June or July of 1994, you told us but in Giti; is that correct?  
A.	(No interpretation)  
Q.	You know nothing of any killings of local people in your area by the RPF in June or July or at any time; is that correct?  
A.	I was in Giti and the RPF forces were never in that location because there were no killings that took place in Giti commune.  If, by chance, the RPF forces went to the area where I was born, coming from another area, and that those forces were guilty of reprehensible acts, I wouldn't have known because I wasn't an eyewitness.  
Q.	Well, there's many things you've told us about to which you were not an eyewitness.  When you got back home, did you learn that, in fact, such atrocities had taken place?  
A.	The only killings that I was able to speak of were those which I witnessed, the killings which were perpetrated during the times when Hutus were pursuing Tutsis.  But, I was not a witness to killings and on which I had not received any information.  
Q.	I'll just ask one last time:  Did you ever become aware that local people had been killed by the RPF?  Did you ever hear that from anybody?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, please allow me to raise an objection.  The question has been put to the witness many times and the witness has invariably replied that he cannot answer that question because he wasn't an eyewitness to those facts; that he can only testify on what he saw and heard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question being asked is a different question now.  He is being asked if he had heard about it.  He has said he didn't witness, and now he's being asked has he heard.  So, I think he can answer that question.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can we have your answer, please, Mr. Witness.  Had you heard of killings by the RPF in your area?  
A.	As I have already told you a moment ago, no-one spoke to me of any killings that were allegedly committed by the RPF in my native area, and I was not an eyewitness.  
Q.	You've also told us when I put the names of various people who I suggested had been killed in the area in June and July, that you were not familiar with any of the names; is that correct?  
A.	There are some names which I recognised, but there are others which I was unable to recognise.  I told you, for example, that I knew Father Mathias Ngarambe and I also said that I knew 
	Pierre Ngarambe but I did not know Paul Ngarambe, to the contrary, and the other names that you put to me.  
Q.	The point being the names I put to you, I was suggesting were people who had been killed.  You couldn't help us.  You didn't recognise any of the names that I put to you; is that correct?  
A.	I can confirm that even now I do not know anything about the death of those people because I was not a witness to the events that led to their deaths.  
Q.	It would follow that you didn't participate in any of their deaths; is that correct?  
A.	No, because in June and July, I was not at the locations where those events took place, and I didn't receive any information concerning the culpability of the RPF forces in such acts.  I only worked with the RPF after the war.  But I would say that I did not know the RPF or its forces before the war.  
Q.	And where did you work with the RPF after the war?  
A.	Let me say, that I worked with the RPF because after the war it was the RPF which was giving instructions throughout the country during the time when we were leaders of the structures at the grassroots.  And, it's in that context that I was saying that I worked with the RPF.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, can I come to your statement, and you've confirmed what we know and that is that you made your first statement on the 11th of February 1998; that's correct, is it? 
A.	I told you that I gave my first statement in 1998 and I do believe it was in the month of June and, most likely, on the 2nd of June.  
Q.	Yes.  Well, I think -- I stand corrected -- but our statements show that it was 11th of February, some months earlier.  And not very long therefore after the events to which your statement relates; that would be correct, would it not?  
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel.  Can you please repeat it for me.  
Q.	It may have been as much a comment as anything else, so let me pass on to the next matter.  

The two people who took that statement from you is a Mr. Sidibe and a person called Allagouma.  Can you remember if those were the two people who came to see you?  They're the names on the statements, so you can perhaps take it from me that those were the two people who came to see you.
A.	I do not have a copy of my statement here before me and I didn't know their names before.  But, if they are the names that are in the statement, it must be those two people that I met.  
Q.	And as you said, you -- it goes without saying that the statement was read back to you and you wouldn't have dreamt of signing it unless you were happy that the contents fairly reflected what you had said and wanted to say; is that correct?  
A.	You're quite right.  
Q.	Now, turning to your evidence -- can I ask you, first of all, to look at a sketch of your area.  I know you've had considerable schooling and I hope that the sketch is something that is not going to present a difficulty to you.  But, could you be shown our Exhibit 3, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
I've got a copy here the witness can have.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, all of rest of us here have a copy of that, so -- but just take a moment looking at it, because it's a sketch of the area where you live showing the names of towns, which won't need translation, but there will be words there you won't understand because they're in my language.  And if you look at the little box on the top right, it has "commune" and a yellow line.  Do you see that?  And then it has a red, wormy-line with black spots on it and that's got "road paved," and then it's got an ordinary red line with no spots on it, which is an unpaved, unmade road -- in other words.  And the blue represents a river.  And if you go to the bottom left-hand corner -- the bottom left-hand corner, you'll see it's not very clear, I'm afraid, "Kigali", with a bit of a brown splodge there or marking.  

And -- and if we go up to -- can you find Kayanga on it?  If you have any difficulty let us -- let us know.  You have got Kayanga.  And it's got -- looking at the top, it's got -- 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)... It's got Gasabo, Gikomero.
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And that area is all coloured green, do you see?  And that represents the hills.  The fact that it's highland as opposed to the valleys below; do you understand that?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Good, can you see where Lac Muhazi is indicated in blue?  Just below and to the right of Kayanga.  
A.	Yes (Microphones overlapping)...
Q.	I'm sorry, and on the other side there is more uplands or hills, which is Giti commune; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And that's where you fled and told us that you stayed in June and July of 1994; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that's right, Counsel. 
Q.	In Giti commune, can you see the word "Rwesero" indicating that village or area?  
A.	Yes, I can see that location, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, when you went to Giti commune in June or July -- well, from April the 12th you told us, so you're there, what?  Are you there for April, May, June, July; is that the position?  
A.	Yes, I stayed there throughout that period of time.  
Q.	And if it doesn't compromise you, where did you stay?  
A.	I was on the hill known as Karagari in Giti commune on the shores of Lac Muhazi at one gentleman's home known as (By order of the Court this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  
MS. FAUL:
Mr. President, I would like to say that it's possible that this name, which has just been mentioned by the witness, may reveal his identity.  Maybe it can be struck from the record, the name that he mentioned, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it will be sensible to direct that this name be -- I'm not certain about the correct order, Mr. Fry, but would we order that it be placed under seal?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the correct -- well, I make the order accordingly.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	May I ask why did you take so long before you went back to Kayanga?  
A.	There's a reason for that, Counsel.  I realised that peace had not been restored in the country, whereas in Giti commune, there had never been any killings.  And I also realised that I didn't have any problem remaining in that commune where there -- there was security. 
Q.	Now, can I come back to your evidence on André Rwamakuba and you told us that you saw him twice:  A week after your birthday on the 15th of October, which would be approximately the 22nd of October 1993 when you saw him; and then secondly, with Munyangazu and An Gasana in Kayanga with the car and the loudspeaker.  And that was in the third week of January 1994; is that correct?  
A.	That is right.  
Q.	Did you know André Rwamakuba before you saw him in October, on your evidence, on or about the 22nd of October '93?  Did you know him before that?  
A.	No, I didn't know him physically.  But, I knew of his name.  He had just founded a school located in his secteur of origin, and it was he and his brother Nkubana who were the promoters of that school.  
Q.	This is the school ETO, is it?  At Nduba?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And that was the school that had been opened by Nkubana and Rwamakuba to educate local children; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that's right.  
Q.	Whether they be Hutu or Tutsi; is that correct?  
A.	I don't know what their objective was and the school had not yet begun teaching.  It's only the buildings which had been completed, but we wouldn't have been able to tell what the objective of those persons were before the school courses started.  
Q.	But the school was up and running, wasn't it?  With children being taught there?  
A.	As far as I know, the school had not yet opened its doors and, if such were the case, I didn't have that information.  However, I do know that they had just finished the construction of the buildings.  
(Pages 66 to 70 by Jean Baigent)












1600H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So before the 22nd of October '93, you had not met André Rwamakuba; is that correct? 
A.	No, I hadn't met him. 
Q.	In your statement dated the 11th of February '98, you say, "As regards Dr. André Rwamakuba, I met him two years before the events of April 1994."  Is that correct or incorrect? 
A.	That is what is written in my statement, but I meant that I had heard mention being made of him two years before the events of April 1994.  I said that I had heard mention made of him, but I had not seen him, but I had heard of him. 
Q.	When you saw him in October on or about the 22nd, what was he doing? 
A.	He was in a vehicle, and although he was at a certain distance away from me, I saw him speaking to two people, including Mathias Rubanguka and Gérard Gakuba.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There is a correction being made to the name by the Kinyarwanda booth.  Unfortunately, I didn't hear it myself. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So your evidence is that he stopped and what, got out of the car and was speaking to Rubanguka, Mathias -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's an interpretation difficulty. 

Mr. Witness, would it be possible for you to repeat the names of the two people to whom you saw him speaking?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The names of the persons to whom André Rwamakuba was speaking was -- were Mathias Rubanguka, who was an accountant in Gikomero commune, and the other person who was with Mathias Rubanguka was known as Gérard Gakuba. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And had André Rwamakuba got out of the vehicle to talk to them?  
A.	No, he didn't get down from the vehicle.  He was speaking to them whilst he remained in the vehicle. 
Q.	On the 5th of June 2003, investigators came to see you on what we know is what is called here a confirmation exercise to discuss your statement with you and to see if you still hold to it.  And it gives you or gave you an opportunity to add something, and one of the things you added was that you mentioned for the first time seeing André Rwamakuba before 1994, other than the reference to the meeting him two years before, that is.  And they recorded that you were saying, apparently, that you had seen him towards the end of 1993 at Kayanga, and indeed that is what you're saying here today, isn't it? 
A.	Let me repeat once again.  I saw Rwamakuba for the first time when he was in his vehicle in 1993, and that was after my birthday, which I said was on the 15th of October.  I saw him a second time in January 1994 in the company of two other persons whom I identified as Gasana, Anastase, and 
	Aloys Munyangaju.  

So I was saying that I saw André Rwamakuba on two occasions, but it was during the second time that I saw him that I was able to approach him and see him at closer quarters.  I also even had the opportunity to greet him on that second occasion. 
Q.	Thank you.  I'm going to come to that second occasion in a moment, but I'm just dealing with the first one and you'll see the reason for it because you were seen again by investigators, together with Ms. Fall, who's the lady who asked you questions for the Prosecution today, on the 10th of February 2004.  And in that confirmation exercise it's recorded that you said, "I saw him only the one time when he had the loud speaker.  However, I learnt from others that he had participated in meetings in the region, notably Nduba and at Musave."  

So the question I'm putting to you is that when you were seen by the investigators and Ms. Fall as recently as February of 2004, you seem to be correcting or wanting to correct your evidence that you'd given, and in contradiction to what you say today, to "I only saw him the once."  But you now say that's not right, you saw him twice.  That's where we fetch out; that's where we end up, is that right?  You saw him twice. 
A.	I think that if you read my statement attentively, you will realise that I'm not denying that I saw him on two occasions.  The first time he was passing by in his vehicle, but he didn't get down.  I just saw him pass by.  Now, during the second occasion I was able to get close to him, and I stood next to him and I even shook his hand.  And it was on that occasion that I can confirm that I indeed met him, because the first time around I just saw him pass by in his vehicle and he didn't stop. 
Q.	I'll come to the second occasion.  Let me just deal with the first one, then.  When you were seen by the investigators and Ms. Fall again, the first confirmation exercise on the 5th of June 2003, it's recorded that you said -- it's my translation from the French, but it's reasonably accurate, I think:  "Moreover, he had seen the target another time apparently, towards the end of 1993 at Kayanga in the course of meetings that he'd held, in the course of finding followers of the MDR Power after the split."  So there you're saying that when he stopped the car and had this conversation, you describe it as a meeting he held in the course of finding followers of the MRD Power after the split.  Is that right? 
A.	At that time in October I saw him speak to the two individuals I mentioned by name.  As for saying that he was looking for members for the MDR Power, this means that the persons he was speaking to and Rubanguka himself later confirmed to me that André Rwamakuba was recruiting for the MDR Power wing.  As for the rally that which -- that was held in Sha and Musabe, I wasn't a personal witness of such, but this is the information which was given to me by other persons, so I didn't personally see him there. 
Q.	Just let's keep those two incidents separate for the moment.  I'm dealing with the first one when you saw him in October.  Are you saying that that was a meeting that André Rwamakuba held in the course of finding followers of MDR Power?  Is that what you're saying that meeting with the car was and Rubanguka? 
A.	Let me explain to you this point, Counsel.  There was no meeting on that day.  He was just passing by like someone who wanted to contact people to whom he wanted to leave a specific message.  Therefore, he did not organise a meeting, but he was looking for people to whom he was going to entrust the mission of looking for members who could join the MDR Power wing.  And I've already told you that Rubanguka was the person who subsequently revealed that information to me. 
Q.	Rubanguka was one of the principal local members of the MRND party, was he not? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, Rubanguka was a member of MRD -- RND -- MRND. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I beg your pardon, corrects the interpreter. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So why would a member of the MDR party at this point in October 1993 be talking to a leader of the MRND? 
A.	That was something which was public knowledge because MRND had caused a split within the other political parties in the country, and this led to the birth of power wings in other opposition parties.  The fact that Rubanguka was a member of MRND and that he was cooperating with the Accused who was a member of the MDR is not a surprising thing, because all the Power wings in the opposition parties allied themselves with the MRND, and they had the same objective, namely, the extermination of Tutsis. 
Q.	When did you first hear the word "Power" used? 
A.	I do not remember the date when I heard that word being used for the very first time.  However, I have to say that I heard that word being used several times. 
Q.	Do you remember when President Ndadaye of Burundi was murdered?  Do you remember that date? 
A.	No.  However, I was told that President Ndadaye was the president of Burundi.  I do not know when he died.  I've never been to Burundi.  I have never lived in Burundi.  All that I know is that he was a president -- the president of Burundi at one point in time and that at one point in time he was assassinated.  
Q.	Do you remember André Rwamakuba coming to Kayanga as part of -- for an MDR meeting, quite a big meeting, in May of 1993, together with Anastase Gasana, who you've mentioned and 
	Faustin Twagiramungu, T-W-A-G-I-R-A-M-U-N-G-U, who was leader of the MDR, or one of the leaders?  Do you remember that meeting in Kayanga? 
A.	I heard that a meeting had been held in Kayanga, but with regard to the participants in that meeting or with regard to the organisers of that meeting, that's something that I don't know.  At that time it was a known fact that if you attended a meeting, whereas you were not a member of that party, then you could have problems.  Therefore, I did not attend a meeting of their parties.  So I don't know whether they actually were -- I don't know whether they were at those -- at that meeting. 
Q.	Were you a member of any political party, and if so, which? 
A.	I was not interested in political parties.  I just wanted to cover myself by saying that I was a member of the MRND so that I could not have any problem at my workplace.  So in order to cover myself, I used to say that I was a member of the MRND simply in order to avoid having any problems at my workplace. 
Q.	But didn't you have any interest in politics? 
A.	No.  It's just that I thought that I did not have time for politics, and I didn't see any importance for me to be -- get involved in politics. 
Q.	So you can't help me very much about the MDR, can you? 
A.	Well, you can ask me questions on that subject, and if I know the answers, then I will answer your questions. 
Q.	Now, let's come to the second meeting, the one in the third week of January 1994.  You believe it's the third week of January, you told us, by reference to the start of the new year; is that right? 
A.	Let's understand one another, Counsel.  I don't know whether you've understood me.  What I said is that in the month of January I saw Rwamakuba, Munyangazu, and Gasana.  They had come to that locality and they had a breakdown, their vehicle had a breakdown, but there was no meeting as such.  They had just arrived at that place.  They had a vehicle problem.  And I've explained that.  I don't know whether you didn't quite understand me, but if you so wish, I may repeat my explanation. 
Q.	I don't think you need repeat it, but just clarify it, because you seem to be shifting your position there.  I thought it was the case that there was a loudspeaker on the car and that that loudspeaker was saying not very pleasant things and that you were attracted by that noise and that you made your way *********************************************************************** and there you saw the car with a loudspeaker on the top and someone talking into a microphone and making political announcements to everyone.  Isn't that your -- isn't that what you're telling us? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you on that point.  However, he had not organised a specific venue for a meeting.  They had a loudspeaker mounted on their vehicle, but he did not have a specific plan with regard to specific areas.  They were in the process of moving about.  They had -- their vehicle broke down, and that's what I told you about.  
Q.	I understood your evidence, and please correct me if I'm wrong, to be that you went out of interest and curiosity and concern about what was being said and that you stood there, and Gasana, who knew you ********************* or someone with skills, then asked you to have a look at the car that had a problem.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you saw Aloys Munyangazu there as well and you saw André Rwamakuba there? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	This was a man you had seen in October passing by, but on this occasion you tell us that you shook hands with him and you were introduced to him, is that right, by Anastase Gasana?  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And when he was introduced, what were the words that -- if you can remember them, that Gasana introduced him by? 
A.	Thank you.  I greeted Gasana and he asked me to greet the other people who were with him.  He told me their names, but he did not tell me what their occupations were.  He added that those people were natives of the same area, same secteur as Rwamakuba, Nduba, Nduba secteur to be more specific. 
Q.	Now, was this on the weekend or during the week? 
A.	I think it was on a Sunday. 
Q.	In the morning or the afternoon? 
A.	I don't know what time they got to that place, but when I got there, it was around one in the afternoon. 
Q.	In your statement you say that you left after 25 minutes, but now it's you, you say, who left and you don't know what time they left.  Is that right? 
A.	I think that what I said is that there were people who came there and pushed the car, and those people had gone there in order to listen to what was being said on the loudspeaker.  After the vehicle had left, after the people had pushed it, I did not do anything else.  I just went back home. 
Q.	So I thought you said that you hadn't seen the car pushed away; you had been there for 25 minutes and you left, and you don't know, but you had heard that that had happened.  What is the position on that?  Did you see the car being pushed away?  Just clarify that for me, please.  
A.	Let me repeat what I said.  When I talked about 25 minutes, I was talking about the time I spent with those men when I was trying to help them.  I don't know for how long they had been there prior to that.  I told you that the clutch had been damaged and it needed replacement.  So what they did was to decide a group of men who would push the vehicle up to the house of the businessman to whom I referred. 
Q.	And while you were looking at the clutch and seeing if you could repair it at Gasana's invitation, 
	André Rwamakuba was on the microphone saying, "It is time that the Hutus got rid of the enemy," which you understood to mean get rid of the Tutsis.  Is that correct? 
A.	If I'm to refer to the comments made by people who used to attend meetings there and rallies at that time, and if I'm to rely on teachings which were provided in the various regions of the country to the people, it was being said that the enemy is the Tutsi, and Rwamakuba was saying that it was high time that the Hutus got rid of their enemy.  So if you're a reasonable person, if you're able to analyse the situation, then you would have understood that he was talking about Tutsis.  If someone talks about uniting in order to get rid of the enemy, then that meant that he was -- they were referring to Tutsis. 
Q.	Would it be fair for me to suggest, sir, with respect to you, that no one would mistake you for a Hutu, would they, in Rwanda? 
A.	It was easy at the time because we had identity cards which said whether one was Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa.  This was noted on your identity card.  It was therefore not difficult to determine a person's ethnic origin.  Obviously for the Tutsis it was said that they were tall and slim and that Tutsis had seven ribs, whereas the Tutsis -- the Hutus had six ribs.  I don't know whether this is true, but this is what they said.  Either -- either they used identity cards or they counted ribs to determine what origin the person was. 
Q.	Thank you.  I'm not counting your ribs.  I'm suggesting, sir, that you (a) are a Tutsi, and with respect to any Rwandese person looking at you, they'd recognise you as a Tutsi, would they not? 
A.	I do not know the -- exactly how Tutsis look like.  All I know is that there was a Tutsi ethnic group, a Hutu ethnic group, and a Twa ethnic group.  You might examine someone, a short person; he might be Tutsi.  I mean really short, and he might be Tutsi.  He might be tall and be Hutu.  But they said that there was a difference in the number of ribs -- ribs between the two ethnic groups.  I don't know how true these -- this is.  I've never counted anyone's ribs.  But they were saying that women, since they were tall and slim, that they were tall and slim, had seven ribs and the Hutus had six.  But if you look at me and you decide that I am Hutu or Tutsi, then you might be wrong.  I think you will be wrong. 
Q.	Let me ask you this:  Do you think you look like a Tutsi or a Hutu?  Can I put it like that?  Or are you saying, "I don't know"? 
A.	I look like a Rwandan.  
Q.	See, I suggest that when you were introduced to André Rwamakuba, being a Rwandese, it was probable that he realised you were a Tutsi.  Isn't that right? 
A.	I am not in his head.  I don't know how he thinks.  All I wish to emphasise is that this is what Rwamakuba said when he spoke through the loudspeaker.  
Q.	So there are -- 
A.	As to whether it can be determined upon looking at me whether I am Hutu or Tutsi, I know nothing about it. 
Q.	Well, that's your answer, and we've heard you.  So as you worked on this car to help them to repair the clutch, you must have felt pretty upset when you heard André Rwamakuba very rudely saying, effectively, "Let's get rid of the Tutsis." 
A.	Yes, that got me thinking.  I wondered why such a figure of authority would say such things, but since I knew that he was not the only one and that such words were commonly being spoken around the country, I was not surprised.  This proved to me that he was one of those who wished to get rid of the enemy.

1635H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Have you ever provided a description of Rwamakuba to anyone?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Nobody's asked you to describe him at all, at any time up till today, up to this moment?  
A.	Not to my knowledge, no.  
Q.	Can you describe him to us, please?  
A.	It's a long time ago, but I'll try to describe him.  Rwamakuba is a short man.  He is fair-skinned with thick lips -- fairly thick lips.  I never saw him wearing glasses.  That is all I can say of him.  
Q.	Did you know what he did?  
A.	No.  However, afterwards, I learnt that he was a physician, but at that time, I did not know what his job was.  
Q.	You told us, from others, that you found out that he had had meetings in Nduba, Sha, and Musave.  Who did you find that out from?  
A.	Many people told me about it.  I might name in that regard (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), as an example.  (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) was, in fact, ***************, and he saw him very often.  
Q.	That's (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), number -- he's number ten on the list that you indicated and put across against; is that right?  
A.	Yes, this is the person.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, at this point, I should like to recall that this is also a protected witness with a pseudonym.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I would just strike the name from the record.  It should be kept under seal, and one could refer to this person by the number on the list.  
MR. HOOPER:
May I say, until my friend intervened there, there was no indication it was a protected witness.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mathias Rubanguka was the commune accountant; is that correct?  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	You describe him in your statement as your friend; is that correct?  
A.	That's right.  
Q.	Did you train the Interahamwe together?  
A.	Yes, he was present at the training.  
Q.	And your understanding is that he's currently in prison in Kigali, and I accept that that's correct.  Have you ever visited him in prison?  
A.	Yes.  I have visited him, and I visit his family -- his wife and his entire family.  
Q.	And he's currently in Remera prison; is that correct?  
A.	I do not know in which prison he is detained.  The last I heard of it, he was in Muhima prison.  I do not know whether he was transferred afterwards.  
Q.	Can you confirm he's under sentence of death for his participation in the genocide?  
A.	I don't know.  I don't know whether he's been tried or not.  All I know is that he pleaded guilty to his crimes.  
Q.	And he's the man you saw from Giti commune with the brigadier, Nyarwaya, killing your neighbours, you say; is that right?  
A.	Yes, you're right.  
Q.	But you still find it in your heart to visit him; is that right?  
A.	Yes.  It is best to visit him so that I can advise him to ask for forgiveness.  If I did not visit him, then I would not be his friend, and I would not be better than he is, if I did not advise him to ask for forgiveness so that he could be released one day, as many others have.  
Q.	Just two more areas I want to deal with, with you.  The first is quite a brief one, I hope, and it's Gacaca, the court process that has been adopted in your country to deal with the great number of people who were guilty or affected by the genocide.  And you told us that you had engaged in some preliminary gathering of evidence; is that correct?  
A.	Anyone who is involved in the collection -- is involved in the collection of information, this involves every citizen.  So it is in this guise that I take part in Gacaca sessions.  Right now -- even right now, I am ready to appear before these courts to provide information, any information that I might have.  
Q.	Has there been a Gacaca hearing in Kayanga?  
A.	I didn't quite understand your question.  Are you referring to a meeting inside the Gacaca court?  
Q.	Let's -- you help us on this.  Is there a Gacaca court in Gikomero commune?  
A.	In Gikomero commune, at the district office, there is a Gacaca court.  Further down at secteur and at cellule level, you have courts, Gacaca courts.  There is also -- there are also Gacaca appeals courts.  So at every level, at every administrative level, there are Gacaca courts which will soon be functional.  
Q.	You've engaged in this in the sense that you've been subject to some process of evidence-gathering; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And is that something that happened in your secteur of Kayanga?  
A.	The collection of information I referred to involves Kayanga secteur.  I was asked to come and explain the circumstances under which I provided training to the Interahamwe.  That is how I appeared before the Gacaca court of my area.  
Q.	And who is the responsable of this Gacaca court?  
A.	I don't know whether we have not gone off topic.  I thought we were discussing the Rwamakuba case and what I know about Rwamakuba, but if you think it wise to talk about Gacaca courts, well, I'll tell you what I know --  
Q.	I've asked you a specific question, sir.  Will you tell me the name, please, of an authority or responsable, responsible for these courts?  Who is the person in charge in your area of Kayanga?  
A.	There is a chairman, a vice-chairman, and two secretaries in each Gacaca court, so that is the composition of the persons in charge of a Gacaca court.  
Q.	So who is the chairman of the court in Kayanga?  
A.	The person's name is Gaspar.  For the time being, I cannot remember his family name.  I'm sorry.  His name is actually *************** (phonetic). 
Q.	And who keeps the records of this court?  Can you help me?  
A.	They have the equipment required for storing these documents.  There are two secretaries who are assigned to the task of keeping documents.  The Gacaca court in our area meets every ********.  
Q.	And how long has that been going on, please?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, Mr. President, I really must intervene.  I have refrained from doing so all this while, but I do not see what the purpose of the line of questioning followed by Defence is.  This was not mentioned in examination-in-chief.  I do not see why he is focusing on this Gacaca time.  The witness has answered the question.  I don't know whether the composition and the responsibilities of the Gacaca courts are not, in my view, relevant matters.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, this witness introduced Gacaca, and I'm exploring it with him.  And I'm interested to know from this witness, unless the Prosecution are in a position to provide me with this information, how long this court has been running.  We found out that records are kept.  We found out who the responsable there is.  And this is dealing with events in Kayanga, and this is clearly a matter of keen interest to the Defence as it relates, of course, to the events there, events where Rwamakuba is said to have participated.  This witness, himself, has said that he's now provided some evidence to them.  So, again, one would be interested to try and find and trace that document as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The question of the documents is permitted.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So in respect of the Gacaca court, Mr. Witness, how long has that process been going on in Kayanga?  Can you assist me as to that?  
A.	As is the case everywhere in Rwanda, if I am not mistaken, about four months -- it's been four months since information has been collected.  If I'm mistaken as to the number of months, you will forgive me, but what I know is that after the collection of information, the trials, themselves, will begin, and Kayanga is not yet at the trial stage.  
Q.	You mentioned your friend, Mathias Rubanguka.  Can you confirm that within the prison there's also a Gacaca process that's been going on now for some time, involving the prisoners, including your friend, Mathias Rubanguka?  Are you in a position to confirm that?  
A.	If you remember what I said about Rubanguka, you will remember that he confessed and pleaded guilty.  I suppose that there is a Gacaca court which is functioning in prisons.  Persons who follow the confession-and-guilty-plea process have reduced sentences.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Before I -- 
A.	I, therefore, think that there is a Gacaca process in operation.
Q.	Excuse me, sorry.  Can I just ask you one thing:  You said, in respect of Kayanga, to my friend, that you know the names of victims who survived; is that right?  Is that in respect of the Kayanga health centre; yes or no?  
A.	Some people survived the massacres of Kayanga -- Kayanga centre, a very few.  
Q.	Can I just ask you, so that I -- so that I come to my point, do you know the names of those people?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	I don't ask you to do it now -- well, subject to what the Judge President directs as appropriate, but would it be possible for you to write down those names, rather than take up the time and thought now, to write down those names so that I can see who those people are?  Could you do that for me, sir, if that's appropriate?  
A.	I can't do that.  I don't have some of the survivors' names in mind.  However, I might remember one, two, or three names.  Amongst the survivors there are people I knew because I had seen them.  So I cannot give you an exhaustive list of the survivors.  
Q.	How many survivors do you say, approximately, there were, as far as you know?  
A.	Regarding the health centre, we have a camp there which shelters survivors of the genocide.  I think they are 32 in number, that is, at the centre.  
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	There are other survivors who are spread out over the various hills of the cellule.  
Q.	Right.  So there's -- sorry -- 32 survivors of the killing at Kayanga health centre who are at the place you've just indicated and others who are (Microphones overlapping)... No, please, can you clarify this for me.  Just clarify the position, please.  Just let us know -- repeat the position for us, please.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to object to this question.  The witness -- witness never said that there were 32 survivors of the Kayanga health centre.  He said that there was a centre that sheltered 32 persons.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is an appropriate matter for re-examination because the clarification should come from the witness.  The clarification should come from the witness.  
MS. FALL:
I agree with you completely, Mr. President, but this is in relation to what Mr. Hooper, the Defence, has just said because the Defence said that there were 32 survivors from the centre and that is not what the witness said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The clarification should come from the witness.  That can -- Mr. Witness, would you mind just repeating what you said about the survivors who were at the camp, their number?  Could you repeat that, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  At the health centre there is a camp that shelters survivors of the genocide.  People came from all cellules to meet there, and they are 32 in number.  This is approximate.  Yes, it is an approximate figure.  It might be less or slightly more than 32.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'll come back to those in a moment, but my question was, can you provide me with the names of people who survived the killings that were done at the Kayanga health centre?  Can you do that?  
A.	I can give you a few names.  
Q.	Can you give it to us now, please?  Is that possible?  
A.	I remember some names of survivors which I am going to write down.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, while the witness is writing, I would just draw your attention to the time.  It's just gone 5.00.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I had said I was going to finish, and I have, at ten minutes, to which you would think 20 minutes of, and Mr. O'Shea was precisely right.  So we can conclude here for today.  I have very little more to put to this witness, but, of course, there's re-examination as well.  So he'll need to come back tomorrow.  I'd forgotten that.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, we're finishing now, I think.  I've got just a few more questions to ask you tomorrow.  Can I invite you to consider the names overnight so that you can provide as full a list as possible of survivors from Kayanga and, in particular, those who you understood to be at the Kayanga health centre when the health centre was attacked by Interahamwe, and people there were killed.  If you know any survivors who were there, I'm particularly interested in that, but survivors from Kayanga and what happened would also be a helpful addition to the list.  So I don't ask you to complete that now.  Thank you very much.  

And it may be appropriate for the witness to be reminded he shouldn't speak to anyone about -- about the case while he's giving evidence, if that's appropriate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I will do that.  I think that the list that the witness wrote should be retained by the registry, and it should be marked for identification.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, what's the identification number?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, it's ID. 2.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let it be so marked.  

Now, Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of today.  We take the adjournment now, and your evidence will continue tomorrow morning.  Under the rules of our Court, you are not supposed to speak to anybody about your testimony after you've been sworn in until your evidence is completed.  So I trust you'll observe that.  

We'll take adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1707H)
