MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Jøensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 26th of May 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of 
the Prosecutor vs. Édouard Karemera et al; Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Karemera. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How are you doing this morning?  
THE WITNESS:
I'll be all right.  I'll be fine.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can proceed now. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning to the Court, and to the parties, and to you, Mr. Karemera, and, of course, to the interpreters and stenographers, who have been having a hard time with me.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. Prosecutor, by your leave, I would've liked to make two small clarifications before you continue with your questioning.  

Mr. President, at the adjournment yesterday at 12:30, the Prosecutor had just put it to me that after the telegram of the 12th of June 1994, sent by Préfet Kayishema to the minister for defence, with copy for the minister for interior, and following my letter of the 18th June 1994, which was communicating to the commander, the camp commander -- or, rather, the secteur commander of Gisenyi, 
Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, the commander of the group at Kibuye and of the gendarmerie in Kibuye, Major Jabo, who had been transferred to the eastern front -- and I was trying to respond to him by saying that it wasn't correct.  And the Prosecutor had somewhat interrupted my explanations, because I was speaking of the position of Urugwiro village.  And he spoke of Habyarimana's village. 

Mr. President, if you allow me, I wish to make two corrections, the first being that in June 1994, the front -- as I had explained it on the map, the front was right in the middle of Rwanda in June.  The front line went from Ngenda commune in rural Kigali préfecture, to go up to the Ruhengeri préfecture in Kinigi commune.  So, contrary to what the Prosecutor claims, there was no need to send Jabo to the eastern front, which no longer existed.  

Secondly, in my response to his question, I had tried to tell him what I knew about the transfer that had been effected in respect of Major Jabo.  But it was in 1994, in the month of April, when he was called to Kigali to strengthen the Kacyiru group, and at that time he remained with his troupes.  I think he came with a contingent of some 100 gendarmes.  And they remained on that position at Kacyiru.  

And Kacyiru is spelled K-A-C-Y-I-R-U.  

And, specifically, he was guarding the Urugwiro village, which at the time was, in fact, the hotel where the president would give audience.  Sometimes he worked there, and sometimes meetings were held there of the central committee of the party, because the government was holding its meetings -- as I have already said yesterday -- at the hotel of the 5th of July in the centre of town. 

So it was in April, for a period of two or three weeks, I believe, that Major Jabo and his men -- his troupes remained in Kigali defending the Urugwiro village, which was opposite the front line at that location.  That was the first clarification I wish to make before the Court.  

The second, Mr. President, by your leave -- I don't know whether the Prosecutor has concluded with the telegram and the letter.  But, at any rate, he had also put it to me -- he made a proposal to me, but I hadn't responded before he moved on to the next question.  And I want to go back to this so that I have everything in the clear. 

Mr. President, the terms used in the telegram sent by Kayishema, I wish to remind the Chamber of this.  And this is at paragraph 2, and this is document 02.  The telegram says -- Kayishema was saying in his telegram:  
"For the security of the Bisesero secteur in Gishyita commune, the population of the area is determined to be involved in the cleanup operation within the framework of civil defence." 

And Kayishema was, therefore, asking for equipment which he believed would be 30 gun grenades and 50 hand grenades, and -- and -- and other equipment.  This is what Mr. Kayishema was asking of the government through the minister of defence.  And I explained to the Prosecutor that the government did not follow through with this request, which was considered inappropriate by Kayishema.  

And I would like, Mr. President, by your leave, to read the contents of the response so that it be clear.  In my letter of the 18th June 1994, written to Anatole Nsengiyumva on the decision of the 
government -- because that decision of the government was not a decision taken by the minister for the interior.  And I wrote the following:  

"Commander of the secteur, I have the honour to inform you that during a meeting of the 
council of ministers this Friday, 17th June 1994, the government decided to ask the operational commander secteur of Gisenyi to support the gendarmerie group in Kibuye in order to carry out, with the support of the local inhabitants, the cleanup operation in the Bisesero secteur in Gishyita commune, which has become a sanctuary of the RPF." 

So you can see that the préfet is claiming that if he were to be given the equipment he's asking for, the local inhabitants in Gishyita, which is composed of more than 30 people -- because I don't see how the government could send only three grenades, which were going to be shared among the local people in Gishyita, in order to carry out a cleanup operation.  But, moreover, the government was not in agreement with the suggestion of the préfet to the effect that the local inhabitants were ready to carry out a military operation.  

A cleanup operation is a military operation.  And this is why we had asked the secteur commander of Gisenyi to support the gendarmerie group of Kibuye, because both Gisenyi and the gendarmerie group are military persons -- officers.  They are technical persons who know how a cleanup operation is carried out.  And if they need assistance of the population, we didn't disagree.  But this is why we asked Colonel Nsengiyumva to do so.  

The Prosecutor also put it to me -- or asked me the question as to whether, aside from myself, there were other people who considered Bisesero as a sanctuary of the RPF.  I had responded that there was Radio Muhabura and that Préfet Kayishema had made a report, and that there were speakers at the meeting of the 3rd of May 1994 on pacification.  But I had forgotten -- no.  I had also told him that there was a Lieutenant Ruzibiza, who was an officer of the RPF, who had complained in his book, "Rwanda, the Secret History" -- or story -- "of the Genocide", I believe, is the title.  And it was saying that the commander in chief of the RPF, General Kagame, had prohibited him to provide support, that they had promised through broadcast of Radio Muhabura to combatants who were specifically in Bisesero.  

But I forgot our key -- or witness on this key issue, Alison Des Forges.  Alison Des Forges admitted that the RPF did have infiltrators.  And she recognised that Bisesero was an area which was traditionally lived in by combatants.  And she also admitted, although minimizing, of course, the fact that communes of Rusenyi -- Rusenyi is written in the following manner:  R-U-S-E-N-Y-I.  I had already said that Rusenyi was a natural area which brings together the Gishyita commune, Rwamatamu commune, Gisovu commune and Gitesi commune.  

So what was intended for these three communes in the sous-préfecture of Ngoma -- so 
Alison Des Forges admitted that, indeed, there were young people who left these communes to go for training in the ranks of the RPF, and the training which was ideological and military at the same time.  But she challenged the report of Préfet Kayishema by trying to minimise it.  But she did, indeed, admit that there were young men who left these communes and joined the ranks of the RPF.  And it is on that basis that the Kayishema report was written. 

The last aspect, which is in the knowledge of the Prosecutor, is the presence -- the presence both at Bisesero of the 65 brigades of the RPA -- that is what they were referred to.  But they were not soldiers who were infiltrators, as the investigators would wish to make us believe.  Because, if 
Alison Des Forges said that the people were not seen in uniform -- in combat uniform, it means that there were no RPF infiltrators.  That is their theory.  But it's a wrong theory.  It's totally false.  

But in Idjwi, an island on Lake Kivu, when Kayishema made his report in June, he was complaining mainly because all the information which reached him indicated that the RPF was preparing an attack on Kibuye, but before going forward with that attack, it was preparing to join up its forces using the positions from Nyanza and Gitarama to go up to Kibuye, but having gone through the Idjwi island.  

So when I was writing on the 18th of June 1994 to say that Bisesero area was a sanctuary of the RPF, or that it was the rallying point of the RPF allies, it's on the basis of all this information, which the Prosecutor did not allow me to develop.  

Mr. President, I thank you for having allowed me to do so.  


ÉDOUARD KAREMERA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Thank you for your 15-minute presentation, Mr. Karemera.  It was somewhat helpful, because it is an issue that we're going to pick up with right now.  And I'll begin where I had proposed to begin, actually, which is to clear up some issues from yesterday, which is exactly what you attempted to do. 

The Defence is not usually pleased when I start the sessions this way, because it usually involves a document.  But I think they're just going to have to grin and bear with me.  
	
	But yesterday I asked you about the entry that Pauline Nyiramasuhuko made in her diary on the 17th of June, when you had a meeting of the interim government.  And at that time, I wasn't referring to a document; I was referring to my memory.  But today I have with me Exhibit P. 224, which is already in evidence, which are excerpts from her diary in her handwriting with French and English translations.  

And I did take the precaution, or, rather, extend the courtesy of sending an email to the Defence yesterday with the page numbers that I will be referring to this morning.  

So I'd like you, Mr. Karemera, to have an opportunity to look at this.  And I will continue with my questions while Mr. Issa shows this initially to the Court and to Mr. Karemera.  And I'm going to describe its contents so that the record is clear.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if Mr. Issa would show that to the Judges first, and then to the Defence, and then place it in front of Mr. Karemera.  

The exhibit itself is rather confusing when you look through it because it does not have page numbers.  So I will give the K number on the top of the pages that would concern us.  And for the 
handwriting -- the handwritten entry by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, which is in both French and Kinyarwanda, is K number K0043686EK.  And at the top of the page that concerns us, there's the printed words "18th of May", because she's writing on the page for the 18th of May, but her notations concern the meeting on the 17th of June 1994.  

There is an English translation of that page at K number K0271190.  And there is a French translation of the portions of her entry that are in Kinyarwanda at page K0246978.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And what I read, Mr. Karemera, in the handwriting of your fellow minister of the interim government, is that with respect to the council -- the -- and -- let me read the English translation.  
With respect to the council of ministers of Friday, the 17th of June 1994, there's a notation halfway down the page, "There are some Inyenzi in Bisesero".  And then a little further down she writes, "Bukumatamu (phonetic) and Major Jabo are preventing concerted action to finish business".  And, 
of course, this is right under the discussion of Bisesero.  

So this is what I was relying on, Mr. Karemera, to suggest to you that the issue of Jabo came up at your meeting on the 17th of June, and the reason Kayishema had to write to you in the first place was because Jabo did not want to conduct further operations in Bisesero, and he resorted to your authority initially and then to the authority of the minister of defence so that the interim government would take affirmative steps to ensure that he would be able to conduct ratissage in Bisesero.  

So that's the basis of my question.  And when Pauline Nyiramasuhuko comes to testify in this trial as a witness for Joesph Nzirorera, you will be able to cross-examine her on this particular point. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I'm sorry, Mr. Prosecutor.  Can you please tell us where you can find the document in question?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May I also say, Mr. President, that the interpreters are in the same quandary.  We cannot find the document.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I began my comments this morning by saying that it's not a document in the bundle, it's a document that I produced this morning which I referenced in an email that was sent to the Defence yesterday.  And it's a document that is already in evidence.  It is P. 224 in evidence in our trial.  

And I gave the K numbers of the pages where the inscriptions are made, and I mentioned those same page numbers in the email that I sent last evening to all of the Defence teams and the Trial Chamber coordinator.  So there are only two sentences that concern me.  I can actually read it in French if the booth is concerned.  And I'll read exactly -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Excuse me.  Excuse me, Mr. Prosecutor.  If I understood you, you sent yesterday emails to the Defence with references, and you asked us to carry out searches so that we could have the document this morning, which we could be able to use it this morning.  Did I understand you correctly?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe if Ms. Diagne refers to the email itself and reads it, then she would understand perfectly.  I sent an email indicating -- providing a reference to the document -- or to the exhibit that I referred to yesterday, along with the page numbers where the information could be found.  I didn't request anyone to make any searches.  I simply made an indication of where the information that I was relying on could be found.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, therefore -- no.  I'm sorry, Mr. President, if I'm not allowing you to do what you need.  But I -- I'm seeing that we're not having any disclosures made to us.  We are given -- being given an exhibit number on email and we are being asked to work on that basis.  

Now, Mr. President, I do not wish to go too much into this, because I believe the Prosecutor was clear in what he said as regards the procedure he used that regards the document before my client now.  I just wish you to kindly set aside this document -- because we do not have it -- in order to look at it so we can work appropriately.  Otherwise, we should have an adjournment so that all parties can have this document before them before we move on and work under appropriate conditions.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, yesterday I did not have the text before my eyes.  But I wish to quote a phrase from the transcript of the 21st of May.  You were speaking, Mr. President, and it is probably the best quotation I can make.  

You were saying, "Mr. Webster, this is not the same thing as a disclosure.  And, as we have said from time to time, you have the right for the -- a surprise effect in your cross-examination, but what we have tried to underscore throughout this trial is that, at the beginning of your cross-examination, the information you intend to use has to be disclosed to all the parties in order to facilitate the proceedings and the cross-examination, and the same goes for the redirect.  So we hope that this will not happen again.  So you may proceed."  

Mr. President, I believe yesterday morning Mr. Webster demonstrated that the only thing he retained from your reminder were the last three words, "you may proceed", while flouting all the previous decisions or rulings which fated.  Mainly we're hoping that this will not happen again.  This is happening incessantly, systematically.  We have to put an end to this, Mr. President.  Otherwise, counsel for the Prosecution will continue using new elements that will come as a surprise and will not even disclose such elements.  Mr. President, enough is enough.  

I thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'd like to proceed.  I'm not going to question Mr. Karemera on this document.  I was actually trying to be as honest as possible with the witness by showing him exactly what I was referring to so that he would have an opportunity to comment on it if he chose to.  He's already done that, so we can proceed.  
THE WITNESS: 
Well, I wish to make comments.  I have not yet spoken, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Only the lawyers have -- 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You will have an opportunity after I ask a question.  But I will continue to respond to your 
	intervention -- your 15-minute intervention from this morning.  
	
	You suggested that Major Jabo was transferred to Kigali sometime in April.  I don't -- the Prosecution does not dispute that.  Are you also aware that, towards the end of April, Major Jabo was transferred or returned to Kibuye; in fact, he went back to Kibuye before the end of April 1994?  
A.	Yes, I'm aware of that, and I agree with you.  
Q.	Well, if you agree with that, wasn't your intervention or your comment this morning rather deceptive insofar as you were trying to suggest to this Court that, since he was transferred in April, he would not have been there in June to be the subject of Préfet Kayishema's telegram to you?  
A.	No, not at all.  There is no link.  What I meant, Counsel for the Prosecution, is when you say that he was transferred to the eastern front in June, that you are confusing his intervention in April with what you assume as being a transfer on the eastern front.  I do know with certainty that in June he was in Kibuye.  I knew that.  And I was the one who said that he was probably the one who coined -- or, used the word "clearing up" along with Kayishema because they were members of the same préfectoral security committee.  

But with your intervention, I came to the realisation that Major Jabo -- was a good soldier -- could not be mistaken on the nature of this clearing operation to the point of believing that he would be able to carry out that operation with hand grenades or gun grenades, because clearing up operations involved other things than that.  

So I did not try to deceive anyone or mislead anyone in the Chamber.  I simply noted what I knew and that Major Jabo was, indeed, called.  And he is not the only one, as you know, because you have General Ndindiliyimana's diary.  And he was the chief of staff of the gendarmerie.  So you know on what date he called Jabo and Habyarabatuma in Kigali.  You are aware of it and so am I.  So I believe we can proceed. 
Q.	We can proceed, Mr. Karemera.  And, again, you've demonstrated how you were trying to deliberately and purposefully deceive the Chamber.  Because it's true.  You know what happened and the Prosecution knows what happened, but the Court only knows what they hear through your testimony.  And, with your statement this morning and your response yesterday, you were attempting to suggest to the Court that Jabo could not have been in Kibuye, could not have been the subject of -- of 
	Préfet Kayishema's message because he was transferred to Kigali in April.  That's clear.  It's clear on the record.  There's no point in denying that now.  So I'll move on.  

You used -- or you put the term "ratissage" in the mouth of Jabo in your last response.  But let's look at that word a bit.  And let's start with the definition of that term that Trial Chamber I gave in its judgement in the Bagosora trial, because it addressed that very term since it's a common issue in your case and in the case against Anatole Nsengiyumva.  

Would you give me one second please.  

At paragraph 1821 in the Bagosora judgement. 
A.	May I be given a copy of this document since I don't have it?  
Q.	I am reading exactly what the document says.  And it's not a document.  It's the judgement of Trial Chamber I in the Bagosora trial at paragraph 1821.  And the Chamber states as follows -- I will read exactly word for word what the Chamber wrote.  This is in the middle of the paragraph:  

"The Chamber notes that the verb "ratissage", in parenthesis, has a specific military meaning."  And then in quotes -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
And for the interpreters I will be reading in French since the judgement has the quote in French.  

"Clean up the field, search methodically of a zone with elements that are very close to one another.  It's the dictionary, page 2177.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So Trial Chamber I also notes that it has a military definition.  And I would go further, because the information that I have from military experts is that ratissage follows a major assault.  In other words, it's not the beginning of an operation; it's at the end of an operation.  It's a second or ancillary operation.  

So after there's a major assault that presumably is successful, there's an operation of ratissage, which is a follow-up operation to sweep the area or clean up the area, to look for the remaining enemy.  

Do you dispute that characterisation or that definition of the term?  
A.	Whose definition is it?  Is it yours?  Is it the Tribunal's?  Is it Robert's definition?  You quoted the definition from the Robert.  You quoted an excerpt from the Bagosora judgement, and you commented upon it.  So what definition do you wish for me to choose among the three?  I have given my own definition, and the definition I gave is the one I wish to stand by.  
Q.	We'll move on.  And we'll go right back to your letter of 18th of June 1994.  Actually, before we do so, let me at least refer to another portion of your 15-minute presentation this morning.  And it concerns Abdul Ruzibiza.  Because, after your testimony last night, I went back to his book and I spent quite a bit of time looking through it.  And, quite frankly, I don't see any reference in his 489 pages of text to secret brigades in Kibuye.  I looked for every reference to Kibuye in Ruzibiza's book.  And I have tabbed them, as you can see here.  And every reference that I see refers to massacres of the Tutsi.  For example, on page 257, he refers to -- let me see -- actually, we can move on to the -- 

On page 265 he refers to events on -- in mid-May.  And, according to Ruzibiza, who you've relied on to defend yourself to some of the allegations -- to some of the issues that we're discussing -- he talks about it.  And in French, again, I'm sorry.  

"Beginning of the massacres of Tutsis in the commune Rukira -- in the communes of Rukira, 
Kibungo préfecture; Bwakira, Kibuye préfecture; and Musambira, Gitarama préfecture."  

On page 267, at the end of the page, he has the following paragraph:  "The Tutsis of the 
Kibuye préfecture and, more particularly, those in Gitesi commune and those in Kibuye town were grouped at -- regrouped at the Gatwaro stadium and killed indiscriminately, women, children -- the elderly and children.  At least 3,000 people were executed.  Those killings were supervised by the local authorities from the top to the grass roots, the nyumbakumi." 

There are others.  I simply wanted to make a point, Mr. Karemera.  So, perhaps, this evening or during the lunch hour, I would be happy --
A.	Mr. President --
Q.	I would be happy to lend you this book during the luncheon hour.  And if you can find the pages where Mr. Ruzibiza -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- is talking about clandestine brigades -- RPF brigades -- in Kibuye, I would invite you to bring it to our attention.  

So let me continue now. 
A.	May I respond?  
Q.	Go ahead, please.  
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, you have been very selective.  Or maybe you are overwhelmed and you have not -- or maybe it's because the book was in French that you were not able to find the reference.  So please do not lend your book to me.  Do not lend your book to me, but check without being overly selective.  

I did not say that Ruzibiza had talked about brigades.  I told -- I said, rather, that Ruzibiza had deployed the prohibition by the government, or at the time, the head of the Rwandan patriotic army, the armed branch of the RPF, of coming to the assistance -- to come to the assistance, rather, of the RPF supporters by abandoning their offensive positions.  

We're not talking about the same thing.  You are talking about the Tutsis who were killed.  I was talking about the RPF supporters who were faced with difficulties in the enemy zone, and who had been promised that there would be interventions.  And all those Tutsis and Hutus who were fighting on the side of the RPF wanted to provide assistance to them.  But, since the priority -- Paul Kagame's priority was not to save the Hutus and the Tutsis who were getting killed for him.  His priority was to seize power.  And for him, power -- seizing power meant seizing Kigali and subsequently carrying out a cleaning-up operation, if you want me to make use of your definition of "cleaning up".  

I am not going to mention that name.  You prohibited me from doing.  But I believe he has especially explained the military definition of the word.  And if we agree on this cleaning-up operation by soldiers, then you can bring all the definitions you want.  And if they were soldiers, what was the 
Gishyita population -- what did it have to do with the cleaning-up operation, with the 30 hand grenades or gun grenades mentioned?  

You said that the definition of cleaning up was to search a specific area with elements or members of the team very close to one another.  And I believe one is not referring to grenades right now; one is referring to soldiers who are in the line and who are advancing on a specific area so as not to leave any empty space.  

And when Kayishema used this to say that the Gishyita population is able to carry out such an operation, I am saying that he is wrong.  And if you are taking this opportunity to say that it was, in fact, the civil defence system that was operational, I'm saying, Counsel for the Prosecution, that you are entirely wrong.  

So I did not talk for 15 minutes to say things that are nonsensical.  I took 15 minutes to try to explain a situation where you are trying to bring confusion.  You have said that -- for example, regarding the Bagosora judgement -- I would have opportunity to explain later on.  But it was only my counsels who were able to comment on it.  I have things to say, with the assistance of my counsel or not.  

You have brought a document which you have forged.  Why don't you bring the whole diary?  I will show you where Pauline wrote the price of meat in her diary.  I will show you what a hodgepodge it is, the meetings that were held at different -- on different days.  On your diary you have item 19.  You have the date 19 and the date 18.  You have "Karongi" -- "Karongi" with a dash.  What does it mean, since it's your document and you have brought it here?  She wrote, "Karongi" and then a dash and then "unguarded".  What do you understand by that?  Do you understand anything about that?  

And you were expecting Guichaoua to come and arrange all this for you and now you're putting such questions to me.  Let me tell you what she means, because I know the area.  Karongi was an antenna, Counsel for the Prosecution, an antenna.  There was an antenna of Radio Rwanda there.  And the radio antenna was no longer guarded because the RPF had dislodged the few people who were to guard this antenna.  In spite of what your Witness GK said, Karongi had been captured.  

Let me continue.  Gisovu tea factory only has two gendarmes.  The Gisovu tea factory was where Musema was.  There were only two gendarmes, and there were probably stocks of tea worth 
50 million Rwandan francs.  Do you realise what it meant?  Two gendarmes.  

Let me continue.  GTZ project; do you know what it means?  You don't?  Well, let me tell you what it means.  It was an electrification project that was based on the area.  And the RPF had started with (inaudible) by destroying all the infrastructures in the country.  And it was unguarded.  There was 
no one there.  

Let me continue.  And this, I will -- this leads me to your witness, Alison Des Forges.  And this is what Pauline is repeating, "Abasesero", former feudal warriors of the RPF.  Polisi recognises from the region.  Polisi and Rwigara are from the region.  And Bisesero was chosen by Biseruka, because, known as being a strategic point by him.  

Why do you not -- don't you say such things to the Trial Chamber?  And you're saying that I am trying to deceive the Trial Chamber.  I was not the one who wrote that.  It was Pauline.  I told you, with all due respect, and I said -- what did I say?  I said that I had the utmost respect for Pauline and that I was sincere when saying so, but that I knew what she was able to do and I knew how she took her notes.  

I was one of her teachers, because when she read law, I was teaching law.  
Counsel for the Prosecution, I was one of her -- one of her teachers.  I know what -- what she had.  But that is not what is being discussed here.  The issue at hand here is that her diary is her diary.  And when you're saying that we'll be able to cross-examine her, I will not do that.  I think we should wait until she comes and then this can be presented to her with my co-Accused, Nzirorera, when he will be here.  I did not call her as a witness.  You can call her as a witness.  And then I will be able to challenge her with these documents.  

But you were relying on Guichaoua.  Guichaoua did not come.  So please do not show these documents to me since you do not understand them.  
Q.	One little question with regard to your last tirade, Mr. Karemera.  

Is it your testimony that Karongi had been captured by the RPF before July of 1994?  Is that what you just said?
A.	No.  I'm saying that there were RPF infiltrators at Karongi who had dislodged the few reservists who were guarding the antenna and who had fled.  And we have heard witnesses here say that Karongi was, indeed, occupied by RPF soldiers.  Your own witness said that he would send people there to get information from the refugees who were there, who told them that there were no RPF soldiers, because for him -- as for them, soldiers were those who wear military fatigues, not a person who knows how to shoot or someone who knows how to run -- who can run after you if you are Musema and take the gun from you.  Witness AMM made such a statement.  He said, "We almost caught Musema."  And Musema was armed.  He was with soldiers.  You know that.  
Q.	And, Mr. Kayishema (sic), when do you suggest that the RPF captured Karongi?  Just tell us the period please, the month and the part of the month.  It's a simple question; just a simple response, please.  
A.	I do not wish to answer with a simple answer.  

Karongi is part of the area that is next to Bisesero.  That is one thing.  Second, let me tell you that Karongi was a strategic position for the RPF infiltrators.  You -- 
Q.	Your answer is not responsive.  
A.	That is my answer. 
Q.	My question to you was when, not where.  And your answer is not responsive and you're evading the issue.  And you're evading the issue because Karongi was directly on the path that you had travelled from your home in Mwendo to Kibuye town, if you were travelling by road.  

So your answer is non-responsive.  And it's non-responsive strategically, because the minute you tell us when it was captured, you would have to explain how you got from your home in Mwendo to the préfecture office in Kibuye.  You're right.  It is right on the foothills -- 
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, have you ever been to Karongi?  Have you ever been to Karongi?  Tell me if you have been there.  
Q.	You are correct.  It is right at the foothills of Bisesero, as is the tea factory in Gisovu, as is the commune in Gisovu.  And your entire testimony has made every effort to avoid placing you right smack in the middle of Bisesero.  

You went all around Kibuye, and the only places that you admit to going are those that skirt Bisesero; isn't that true, Mr. Karemera?  
A.	Did I not tell you that when going home or coming from my home, I pass through Karongi?  Karongi is a mount.  And the antenna is at the top of that mount, Counsel for the Prosecution.  You do not have any idea of the layout of the area.  Karongi is at the top of the mount, but the road -- I cannot find the exact word, so I will ask for the assistance of the interpreters.  

The road passes through the valley, but not at the top of the mount.  You're not going to pass by the top of Karongi to go to Kibuye.  
Q.	We are finished with Karongi.  We are returning to your letter of the 18th of June; all right?  Let's go on to the second paragraph, because we still have quite a ways to go.  And looking at the second paragraph, it states -- and this is your letter -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And for the benefit of the parties and the Chamber, this is document 04, which is also in evidence at 
	P. 53; A for the French and B for the English.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You state in paragraph 2, "The government asks that this operation" --

The English is difficult to read.  Let me read it in the French, please.  And this is in French.  

"The government is requesting that this operation be definitively terminated on the 20th of June 1994 at the latest."

When you say "the government", I'm assuming you're referring to the decision that was made during the cabinet meeting of the 17th of June.  

Tell us who was present for that meeting, please.  We know there was the prime minister, because you got information from him.  We know there was Pauline Nyiramasuhuko because we have her diary.  We know there was you.  Who else was there?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I'm going to surprise you.  I did not do that arithmetic.  I was not responsible for attendances.  And I know that the council was meeting when the ministers were there.  Now, asking me who was there, I no longer remember.  This was 15 years ago.  Had I thought that necessary, I would have put it down in my diary.  I did not do so because it wasn't important.  It was not my role to check on attendances.  And if you ask, you can be given the minutes of the government meeting, and you will see.  And 15 years later, I'm not able to do that kind of job.  At least I was present, and the 
	minister for defence was not present.  I can tell you that.  
Q.	You don't remember one single other name of a person that was present out of 19 ministers, plus the heads of political parties that are usually associated in these meetings?  

For each of the five political parties there were at least two people that were the top of the hierarchy that could be included in meetings of the interim government, two or three people.  Concerning the MRND, it was four, because it was you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Kabagema who would habitually participate in meetings with the interim government.  

For other parties, it may have been less.  But of the 25 people that could have attended this meeting, the only name you remember is your own, and the minister of defence that was not present?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, are you convinced with what you've just said?  Are you convinced that the 
	council of ministers meeting met together with the heads of parties?  Is that your conviction?  And you want me to share it with you?  

Do you have any single iota of evidence of what you're saying, or are you repeating what Ruhumuriza told you, that sometimes Kambanda would invite -- Kambanda and Ruhumuriza are your witnesses, 
Mr. Prosecutor.  You brought them here so that they confuse.  So please do not associate me with their lies.  

The government is the government.  When we formed that government, we gave it a specific mandate:  Three items.  And that government had to report to the president of the republic.  If you don't believe that, that is your right.  But please don't come here and say things which have absolutely no meaning or legal basis.  For your theory, you want everyone to be there.  And if you're saying that in Muramba, where the government was meeting, there was no longer any political officers of -- official -- officers of political parties -- because the government was staying in Muramba.  But in Muramba -- in Gitarama.  But in Muramba there was no security.  The minister -- the prime minister was staying there.  There was only Kambanda.  And he had a small room which was given to him by the nuns.  The others remained in Gisenyi at -- and they would only come on Fridays for the council of ministers meetings.  

So are you saying that the heads of political parties were in Muramba?  And you have no proof to support what you are saying.  You have absolutely no evidence.  
Q.	Mr. Kambanda (sic), I don't want this to generate into an argument.  But I think if you review --
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we should all just calm down a little bit.  (Inaudible)
MR. WEBSTER: 
What did I say? "Kambanda"?  Maybe it was wishful thinking.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Karemera.  I don't want us to argue with each other.  But I think if you review the transcripts of your direct evidence, you will find in your own testimony before this Chamber that you suggested that the heads of political parties often met with the interim government ministers to address questions of policy and that your role was to assist them.  

So when I asked the question in the way that I did, I'm also relying on information that you provided to this Court back on Monday or Tuesday.  But we can move on. 

The fundamental question for me is how it is a meeting that seems to be quite significant in your trial, which certainly you must have recognised the importance or the significance of this particular meeting for the case that you're defending yourself against -- that you can't recall who was present other than the names that have been documented:  The prime minister, who was referenced in your letter; the minister of defence, who was absent; yourself; and now Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, because we have her diary. 

Is it reasonable, Mr. Karemera, for you to tell this Court that you don't remember any other person that was present on the 17th of June?   
A.	But, first of all, I would like to tell you that all the ministers of the council of ministers are very important, because the government -- even if it lost the war, it was the government responsible for managing the affairs of Rwanda.  Rwanda is not as powerful as the United States, but it is a government which is respected.  So all the meetings that it held was in order for it to deliberate on important issues for the Rwandan people.  

Secondly, let me repeat that I was not responsible for drawing up a list of those in attendance.  If that had been my role, you would have found that in my notebook.  What I put down was what was important for me.  And you have that with you.  What I did not write down, I did not write down.  Now, for you to ask me now, 15 years later, to remember who was there and who wasn't, I have remembered those that -- well, I was there.  I remember that the minister for defence was on mission abroad.  And I am quite categorical there were no political party leaders at that meeting.  

And I think that President Sindikubwabo himself was there.  But maybe his directeur de cabinet, 
Daniel Bangura, was present.  But you are -- I'm trying to show that I'm of goodwill.  But please don't ask me -- don't ask me to give you a list of who was there or who wasn't there.  

Rwamakuba was certainly not there because he had already left.  Ruhumuriza also -- he was already where you know he was.  But this is really from the top of my head -- from memory. 
Q.	Well, we've gotten a few steps ahead.  So now we know that President Sindikubwabo was there, and most likely, Daniel Bangura, who was his chef de cabinet, by June 17th.  

Do you recall if the minister for justice, Agnès Ntamabyariro, was present?
A.	I don't remember.  She often went on mission.  I don't know whether at the time she was in Rwanda or abroad.  
Q.	All right.  We'll move on.  

The sentence ends with the suggestion -- or, actually, the instruction that this ratissage operation should be terminated at the latest by the 20th of June 1994.  

Was there a reason for selecting that date in particular?  
A.	Yes, of course.  You have the reason in Kayishema's telegram.  He says the duration of the operation is four days, beginning from the 15th of June to the 18th of May.  

And since we -- we're not in agreement with Kayishema, we did not agree with his request for grenades.  But since we were convinced that the operation should be carried out, rather, it was better.  But, since he had indicated a period of time, it was on that basis that we determined the time frame, knowing that soldiers are much faster than the local inhabitants in carrying out a clean-up operation, if they are of good will.  And this is what you have in the telegram. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, I would suggest to you that the reason that the 20th of June was significant for you, writing on behalf of the government, is because you knew Operation turquoise was likely to start a few days later, as it actually did start on the 22nd or the 23rd of June.  
A.	I'm sorry to the interpreters.  

Mr. Prosecutor, when was the decision made by the security council to send that operation?  You know that date, don't you?  How would we know that the operation was going to take place if it hadn't been ordered yet?  Secondly, you can look at my notebook.  Did you not see that we were not informed of that operation?  And you want us to believe that we were informed.  We were not informed.  And this is what we regretted.  No one wanted to inform us.  Probably, had you been there, you would have been kinder than everyone else, because you are supposing that I was informed of everything.  But people didn't inform us.  

The French arrived, and they sat down -- settled as if in a conquered country.  And humanitarian involvement -- interference -- this can explain to you.  Humanitarian interference; do you know what that means?  And this happens in weak countries.  Because, in the United States, no one can carry out humanitarian interference, and yet, God knows that many people had benefited from humanitarian assistance.  And I know that where there is poverty -- even in your country, there is human poverty.  But humanitarian interference happens only unilaterally.  
But since the French had conquered, they came to save the very happy human lives.  But since this doesn't go with the will of Americans, they are still being pursued today -- prosecuted.  And you are very well aware of this.  The former chef de cabinet of President Mitterrand, where is he today?  
Q.	(Inaudible)
A.	No, I'm not answering.  I'm going to speak.  

(No interpretation), he was a foreign minister at the time.  You know that he's being prosecuted for that.  Let me stop there. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I appeal to the Chamber.  We have no problem listening to Mr. Karemera's lengthy responses if it's not going to place us at a disadvantage in terms of me going through my entire outline of his cross-examination.  But at this pace, it will be impossible.  

Now, I've asked him to be focused in his responses.  And what I understood from the Chamber is that he has to be given an opportunity to explain himself.  So we have to find a happy medium here.  And I'm asking the Chamber to intervene and direct the witness to be more responsive.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that you have been a little bit argumentative in the way you've put the questions to the witness.  And maybe if the technique or question is modified somewhat, we may be able to get a different type of response from Mr. Karemera.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you made an enquiry of me -- 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	-- when -- when -- your enquiry was, "When was the Operation turquoise initiated?"  
A.	Yes -- no, "had been decided upon by -- or authorised by the security council".  
Q.	And my response to you is information that, no doubt, you already have, which is that the operation was authorised on the 22nd of June, but it has been under discussion for at least a week before then.  And there was extended discussion.  

	And my suggestion is that you were aware that the issue was being debated in the security council, even though the decision was only made on the 22nd of June.  
A.	But my comment, Mr. Prosecutor, if you allow me, is that your suggestion ignores the fact that there was a lot of discussion in the security council which doesn't lead to decisions.  There are discussions every day at the security council.  They are paid to do that.  But all these discussions do not end up with a decision to send a military intervention to Rwanda when everyone, except the French, were thinking that you need to leave Kagame to take over power, first of all, and then solve the problems later.  That was the position.  And God knows who was -- the idea for the Clinton administration in these events which took place in Rwanda.  

So when you put it to me, I do understand you.  But he is not facing up to the issue, because 
the 22nd of June, the decision had not yet been made.  Now, if you believe that humanitarian interference by the French was going to happen on the 22nd of June, well, it didn't happen.  We thought that these were our friends who were coming to help us, but that's not what they did.  And now they are being considered as Hutus.  They are being considered as Interahamwe.  

Ask Mucyo, Mucyo is the chairman of the national commission on genocide, a title he received from Paul Kagame.  And you know what he has written and what we have written against this, because we also have written things against these events. 
Q.	I'll continue with the text of your letter.  And I'm going to read in French again.  

"In the absence of the minister of defence, who was on mission abroad, the minister of the interior and communal development had been mandated to communicate this decision to you and to ensure its follow-up."

Do you recall where it was that the minister of defence went on mission?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I told you that missions were decided on by the president and the prime minister.  Do you think that during that period of time of insecurity for the nation, the president would decide to send his minister for defence to -- on a mission abroad and the minister of defence would start by saying it out loud that he was going on mission?  I don't understand why you're asking me this question.  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, a simple "I don't know" would suffice.  If you don't know the answer to a question, just simply say, "I don't know."  
A.	I do not know.  
Q.	When you say in your letter that the interim government was going to conduct a follow-up or 
	assurer un suivi, what did you mean?  
A.	It is not the interim government.  It was the minister for the interior who was supposed to ensure the follow-up.  So it was I, myself, who was to ensure that the colonel, Anatole Nsengiyumva, had received the decision -- communication of the decision, and that -- wanted to know what he was going to do about it, what he intended to do.  Maybe it's a problem of the French rather than anything else.  
Q.	You continue, reading in French:  

"The préfet of Kibuye préfecture, as well as the group commander in Kibuye, to whom I have issued a copy of this letter, are kindly requested to make arrangements necessary to facilitate the realisation of this operation in the time allocated." 

That's the entire text of your letter.  Where is it that you tell Préfet Kayishema that his request demonstrated an excess of zeal or was inappropriate, or could not be conducted by civilians?  
A.	But in the last paragraph that you have just read -- "The préfet of Kibuye préfecture, as well as the group commander in Kibuye, to whom I have assigned -- I have issued a copy of this letter, are kindly requested to make the arrangements necessary to facilitate the realisation of this operation allocated to you.  And the time is allocated to Anatole Nsengiyumva, and the government is asking him to support the gendarmerie group commander and not the population of Gishyita.  The decision is to ensure that the operation is terminated by the 20th.  And the préfet, who had wanted to carry out the operation, he, himself, is informed of the decision of the government.  

So Kayishema is informed that his proposal is dismissed because the operation is assigned not to the population of Gishyita, but the soldiers under the leadership of Anatole Nsengiyumva and the commander of the gendarmerie in Kibuye.  They are being asked to -- he is being asked to give instructions to the group commander.  

"I have the honour to inform you to give a formal order to the Kibuye group commander."  He is not being asked to direct the operations, but he is being asked to prepare to receive the support, the support which would come to him from Gisenyi.  But you will see that he was against.  

So maybe this is another reason for you to know that the operation did not take place -- could not take place.  Because you also see that Nsengiyumva, as soon as he received my letter, he objected to say that I had planted myself, because I was not enabled to give him that kind of order, and that I did not know anything in military procedures, and that it was the army headquarters which needed to communicate to him the decision of the government.  

But, in the framework of the follow-up which I was responsible for, I, in fact, did see that the operation could no longer take place within the time frame assigned.  But I informed the prime minister of the time whilst waiting for the return of the defence minister so that he could take over the relay and communicate the decision by respecting the military procedure that he was better -- better aware of than myself.  

And you know the rest, because in the interim, as you will see, the operation -- Turquoise operation, the humanitarian interference, was already in place and we no longer had the means.  But, better still, in the interim, the RPF had also advanced and was on the ground.  And I think this is mainly because the operation did not take place.  
I'm going beyond your question, and I apologise for doing  so. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I notice the time.  Is this a good time for us to take the break?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can take the mid-morning recess now.  

Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, yesterday we had a problem of time management.  I'd like to draw your attention to this before it is too late.  As you are well aware, at the break at 12:30, the Accused were waiting to receive their meal, but unfortunately -- normally this takes one hour.  And it was only at around 1:30 that they were called to go and have their meal.  So they only had 30 minutes.  

Yesterday, once again, there was a problem which arose.  And I spoke about this to Mr. Constant, who said he was going to do due diligence.  And since we're now taking the 10:30 break, maybe it will be useful to ensure that all measures have been taken so that the Accused can have their meals at 12:30, have their meals and rest a little before we resume.  

Mr. President, this is a matter I wanted to bring to your attention.  And I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

I'll ask the registrar to (inaudible).  

We'll take our mid-morning recess. 
(Court recessed at 1030H)
(Pages 1 to 21 by Lisa D. Smith)













(Court resumed at 1105H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, when we left off, I believe you were answering my question -- oh, I'm sorry.  
A.	I'm sorry, Mr. Prosecutor.  I didn't have my headphones on. 
Q.	Okay.  You gave us a rather elaborate response to my last question.  And, as I recall it, what I suggested to you is that nothing in your letter of the 18th of June 1994 seems -- would indicate that you who wrote it or the interim government had disagreed with Kayishema's request to you.  

I know that you went on to explain that since the letter was directed to Nsengiyumva, that 
implicitly -- that it was somewhat of a rebuff to Kayishema.  But you do confirm -- do you -- you do agree, don't you, that nothing on the text itself -- in the text itself, indicates, to any of its recipients, clearly, that Kayishema's request is unreasonable?  
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, Kayishema was asking that he be given hand grenades, gun grenades, and magazines for an operation to be carried out by the local inhabitants.  The government said, "No.  It is not you who should carry out the operation.  Rather, it should be the gendarmerie group in Kibuye supported by the Gisenyi military secteur."  

What do you want me to say?  If you didn't understand that as what it is, I can do nothing.  And if you don't understand it, as such, I can do less.  So -- so you understand it as you will.  For me it is clear, and this is why Kayishema is among those who are included in the letter -- in the letter copied to those people.  

And secondly, you didn't ask me the question -- but I wanted to mention it also -- the transparency of this matter, the way in which the matter was dealt with, both within government as well as my own level, when I needed to communicate.  If the objective was what you are suggesting, we didn't need to write anything, since you yourself said that I was in Gisenyi.  It was necessary simply for me to go and plot with Anatole so that the operation can continue.  

But that is not how things happened.  The préfet made the request, and he took the responsibility to inform the government.  Because on the 3rd of May, at the meeting for pacification, he had already raised this issue, and Kambanda was there.  And Kambanda had required reports to be made beforehand so that he is sure that what Kayishema and the others who were intervening at the time on the 3rd of May was a security operation and not a matter of going to liquidate refugees.  Kambanda was clear on the 3rd of May.  

So now the question was not to be decided on.  And this is why Kayishema comes back to this when he wrote first on the 9th and the 12th.  And he is writing in line with the intervention that he had made and which was also made by two bourgmestres, that one of Gisovu, Aloys Ndimbati; and that one of 
Gitara (sic), Charles Sikubwabo (sic).  And he is writing in line with that idea.  

Kambanda, who was aware of the situation obtaining in Bisesero, had the matter placed on the agenda of the council of ministers meeting.  The council decides that that situation had lasted for too long and asked the soldiers to go and see what they could see -- do and instructs the minister of the interior to communicate the decision to Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, and that is what I did.  But inappropriately so, because I was not a soldier and I didn't know what the procedure to follow was.  And given the fact that I didn't follow the procedure, Nsengiyumva did not implement the directive, and that -- this is what is in this letter.  

What do you want me to say to you?  You can always make your suggestions and proposals, but I maintain -- stand by the explanation I gave you, that it was all very transparent.  There was nothing which was hidden.  There was nothing coded.  There was nothing criminal in all this.  

The objective was to respond adequately to a request made by the préfet, who was right in being concerned about the security situation in the area but who was suggesting an inadequate solution.  Since the government had discussed the issue -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We missed that Kinyarwanda saying by the Accused. 
THE WITNESS:
This may not suit you, but that's what was decided. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Kambanda (sic), the interpreters missed what you said in Kinyarwanda.  If you want to repeat that, they can get it for you.  
A.	One always needs the contribution of the support of others.  That's a literal translation.  I would wish you that there is only one head -- or, rather, the head of a single person -- one is alone when one becomes mad.  So if you are thinking alone, you can decide on doing something mad.  But if you are many, you can help one another and consult one another in time.  But what you decide will not be a bad thing.  

It's not a translation.  It's an explanation. 
Q.	All right.  Once again, thank you -- thank you for your very elaborate response, and we'll move on to the next line of questioning.  

Because it appears that you did communicate directly with Préfet Kayishema in writing on the 20th of June 1994.  There's a document that has been circulated.  It's identified as 05 in our bundle, and it's already admitted in evidence.  In evidence it is P. 54, and it's a letter that you wrote, Mr. Kayishema -- excuse me -- Mr. Karemera, that you wrote, you addressed to the préfet of Kibuye on the 20th of June 1994.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If the registrar could give that document to the witness, then I'll proceed with my next question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you have the document already?  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  28th June, did you say?  Did you say 28th or 26th?
Q.	I said a letter of the 20th of June 1994, which is identified in the bundle of documents that I circulated as 05.  I believe it's 06 in French.  It's already admitted.  
A.	No.  I don't have it yet. 
Q.	The registry is looking for it.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	The French text is 06.  
A.	Yes.  I have it.  
Q.	And that's your signature at the bottom, is it not? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	And you sent this letter to Préfet Kayishema? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And this is two days after you sent a letter to Colonel Nsengiyumva; right? 
A.	Yes; since it's the 20th. 
Q.	The subject is "Protection of development infrastructures and projects".  It starts out:  "Dear Préfet, I refer to your telegrams of 9 and 12 June 1994 and would like to inform you that with respect to the search operation in Bisesero secteur, the cabinet meeting of the 17th of June 1994 has requested that the commander of Gisenyi secteur should support the Kibuye gendarmerie groupement to carry out the operation by the 20th of June 1994 latest."  

All right.  Just focus on that sentence, to begin with.  Now, when you say that "I refer to your telegrams of 9 and 12 June 1994," which telegram are you referring to in regard to the 9th?  
A.	But on the 9th and the 12th -- if you look at the document that we have just been considering, the telegram of the 12th, the préfet is referring to an earlier telegram which he had sent on the 9th and to the one he was sending on the 12th.  And in the one on the 9th, as well as in the one on the 12th, he is speaking of the same thing, same subject.  

At any rate, Mr. Prosecutor, I told you that the telegram of the 9th of June I did not receive.  But the document that you issued, Pauline's diary -- Pauline's diary, the part that I read to you speaks of infrastructure which were not protected -- Karongi, GTZ, Gisovu -- in order to tell you that the prime minister, who had items of the agenda included, also spoke of the contents of that telegram of the 9th at that meeting.  And apart from the clean-up operation that the préfet was dwelling on, he also referred to the protection of those in development infrastructure in Kibuye region.  So it's because he's referring both to the telegram that he sent on the 9th as well as the one he sent on the 12th that I also refer to the two.  

This is an administrative piece of correspondence.  And if you wish that I speak to you of my experience, on the occasion of writing a letter, you try and solve the problem as best you can when you have a solution, rather than do -- writing several different letters.  So here the letter is addressed to the préfet.  It's no longer addressed to Colonel Nsengiyumva.  And that is why you are going to see that I'm stressing much more on the initiatives or the arrangements to be made with regard to the protection of infrastructure and projects of development in the Kibuye region or préfecture. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, the short point is that, on the face of it, your letter of the 20th of June would suggest to Préfet Kayishema that you had actually received his telegram of the 9th of June.  Because you, yourself, are suggesting to him or telling him that "I refer to your telegrams of the 9th and the 12th of June."  It's not a major point, because you're responding to the same request, presumably.  

But you told the Trial Chamber in Bagosora -- in the Bagosora trial that you never received the telegram of the 9th, and you repeated that same account to this Trial Chamber.  But the simple -- or the plain text of your letter of the 20th of June would suggest otherwise. 
A.	But I have just explained to you, Mr. Webster.  I've just explained to you that during the meeting of the council of ministers on the 10th -- 17th, the prime minister, who had more ease with having access to this information, spoke about the contents of that telegram of the 9th.  But I have said that I didn't receive it.  

When I testified in defence of Nsengiyumva, I said it and I explained how I got to know about its existence.  But if I got to know about the existence of that telegram in the meeting of the 
council of ministers and I say so, what is your problem?  And I'm answering it because the 
council of ministers deliberated on the issue.  It's not my initiative.  I am gave -- I am giving the response depending on the conclusions that were drawn during the meeting of the council of ministers which I attended.  

So please don't throw the book at me by saying that I don't know the contents.  I am aware of the contents, but I physically did not receive the document because the communication chain did not enable me to receive this document.  In fact, I don't see how I would have received it.  I didn't have an office.  There were no postal services in operation.  There was nothing. 
Q.	Let's move on.  The second sentence:  "In his response to my letter of the 18th of June 1994, which was copied to you, the minister of defence confirmed those instructions in the telegram he sent to the army and gendarmerie headquarters on the 20th of June 1994."  

So what we have here is information that is made available to us implicitly, because we do not have the letter from the minister of defence, but you have referred to it.  To repeat, you say, "In his response to my letter of the 18th of June".  We have your letter of the 18th of June, which you copied to Préfet Kayishema, and you make reference to a letter that the minister of defence -- that the 
minister of defence wrote to you confirming those instructions and sending a telegram to the army and the gendarmerie headquarters on the 20th of June.  

Now, on -- isn't that the very same procedure that you explained was the appropriate procedure to ensure that your instructions would be carried out?  Don't you remember in your direct evidence when you were being examined by Madam Dior Diagne?  Isn't that the very procedure that you suggested to her was the appropriate procedure for having your instructions followed?  
A.	What is your question?  
Q.	I've just read a sentence of your letter to Préfet Kayishema.  
A.	Do you want me to interpret or for me to explain myself?  I don't know. 
Q.	What I'm suggesting to you is that when you were giving your evidence in chief, you explained to the Chamber what the appropriate procedure would be to have instructions from the government or from the minister of the interior arrive with Colonel Nsengiyumva.  And you explained at that time that the minister of defence should communicate with the army chief of staff or the gendarmerie chief of staff who would in turn communicate with the operational commander in Gisenyi.  That was the procedure you suggested as the appropriate one to be followed.  

And my suggestion to you is that the second sentence of your letter of the June -- of the 20th of June 1994 has adopted the very same procedure that you suggested or that you deemed appropriate.  So respond to that.  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  I'm going to answer you briefly because I don't want you -- because you don't want me to be too long.  

	Now, in the letter of the 18th, you have seen that I was speaking about what the government assigned me to follow up as for the minister for defence, who was outside and not in the country.  When it was said that I didn't respect the procedure, that the government didn't want to respect the procedure -- and I myself, I took action.  And when the minister for defence came back -- I believe he came back on the 19th or the 20th -- the first thing that I did was to tell him what my unfortunate action had been, that the government had given me the task of communicating an urgent message to Colonel Nsengiyumva but that I had done so without knowing that that was not how it should have been done.  And he, in fact, told me that it was not -- that that was not the appropriate way.  

So he even said that he himself, minister for defence, could not give an order to the commander of the military secteur of Gisenyi because the other person would not -- if he had not respected the procedure.  He explained that the procedure would have been to inform the head of the army headquarters, who was the superior of the secteur, the military secteur, because it is the chief of staff of the army who organises operations.  He is the one who knows what is the unit which is the most appropriate to carry out the said operation.  

The minister for defence was -- went further to tell me that even if we did not have to indicate that it was necessarily in Gisenyi that the support should have been provided, we simply had to ask the 
chief of staff of the army and others who would consult with his chief of operations.  So they would look at the military operations map to find out which is the best suited to support the group in order to carry out the operation.  These are the exchanges that I had with the minister for defence.  And he said that he was going to inform the army headquarters so that the operation can, in fact, be undertaken but within the confines of the appropriate measures.  

But I, once again, say that I did not see the telegram.  And I'm explaining myself by saying the minister of defence, following up on my letter of the 18th of June, a copy of which was sent to you, confirmed those same instructions by telegram -- by the telegram sent to the army and the gendarmerie headquarters.  Because Kayishema was also asking that the commander of the Kibuye group, Colonel Jabo - and, there also, sending him a copy didn't mean anything.  It was necessary to go through his chief of staff of the army, who was Ndindiliyimana.  And for Nsengiyumva we had to go through Augustin Bizimana -- no -- Bizimungu.  I apologise.  Augustin Bizimungu, minister for defence, Augustin Bizimana, and the head of the gendarmerie, Augustin Ndindiliyimana.  

The interpreters should not be mistaken on the names.  I cannot change names, but there are many -- I cannot change the surnames, but there are many Augustins as first names.  

So, if I were to write to him, this was still within the follow -- the framework of the follow-up.  And here I say that I've already given the matter -- handed the matter over to the minister of defence, and he was responsible for follow-up.  And I suppose that he continued with the follow-up operations.  But what he told me on that day, and which I am telling Préfet Kayishema, is that he had informed the army and the gendarmerie headquarters. 
Q.	The short point is that your -- is that initial request on behalf of the government was processed and approved and forwarded and put into effect by the minister of defence; right? 
A.	No, that's not it.  The minister for defence could not execute any clean-up operation, because you are forgetting the fact that what is expected is the operation clean -- clean-up operation.  So the 
	minister for defence, according to what he told me, informed the two headquarters of the army and the gendarmerie.  And after -- according to your information, Jabo did not want to comply.  And that is the information you have yourself.  

According to what Anatole told me, in the interim, he was no longer commander of the Gisenyi secteur.  And maybe he will tell you this when he comes to testify, because he is Joseph's witness, and I've even told you that Joseph's witnesses are also mine.  So we are going to put to you -- to him that question.  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, your initial explanation -- Mr. Karemera, your initial explanation was that the 
	minister of the interior did not have the authority to send instructions of this nature directly to the operational commander in Gisenyi, Colonel Nsengiyumva.  And here you are correcting yourself by referring directly to the minister of defence who did have that authority, who communicated with the army chief of staff and the gendarmerie chief of staff, which is the appropriate thing for him to do, as you explained it.  It's clear.  
A.	Yes, it is clear.  Yes.  That was how it happened, I believe. 
Q.	So the orders of the government from the 17th of June were put into effect.  The chain of events started with the cabinet meeting on the 17th of June, with your letter on the 18th of June, and with your follow-up letter to Kayishema on the 20th of June; right? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  You are pretending you have not understood, but I believe you have.  

This is the 20th.  On the 20th I am saying what follows:  The minister of defence, following up on my letter of the 18th of June -- and let me remind you that the minister of defence was not here until the 18th.  I cannot confirm whether he came back on the 19th or the 20th.  What I can confirm is that on the 20th I had already had a discussion with him, and I had been able to explain to him the problems I faced when I tried to transfer the -- or forward the decision made by the government on the 17th to Colonel Nsengiyumva.  

And on the 20th the minister of defence told me, "Well, what you did was indeed not correct but that 
I -- and I am now going to correct that error."  He explained to me that he could not directly order Anatole or Jabo to take care of the implementation of the -- that government decision but that he would forthwith send a telegram to the chief of staff of the army and of the gendarmerie.  On the 20th that was the stage we had reached.  

So the conclusion you are drawing whereby the decision was implemented, I don't see how you can draw it, because this is only the 20th.  This is only the 20th.  So tell me, when you are stating that the decision was implemented, where can you find that information in this letter?  It does not appear anywhere, unless you do not understand French. 
Q.	Let's continue with the next sentence.  "Therefore, it is your duty to closely monitor this operation, which requires the support of the inhabitants of Gishyita, Gisovu, and Gitesi communes, and to give me a feedback before the end of this month, that is, June 1994." 
A.	There. 
Q.	So here you are instructing Préfet Kayishema to participate in this operation with the support of the inhabitants of Gishyita, Gisovu, and Gitesi, which are the three communes that cover the region that we refer to as Bisesero, and to report back to you.  
A.	Yes.  What is your question?  Is this a suggestion you're making and you wish for me to comment on it or what?  
Q.	Usually, you're so verbose.  I'm really taken by surprise that it takes more than that to provoke a response.  What I'm suggesting to you is that this letter demonstrates that an operation of ratissage was put in motion, that you were part of the chain of events that led to the massacre of Tutsi civilians, noncombatants in Bisesero towards the latter part of June 1994.  

You started the ball rolling by organising a civil defence programme.  Kayishema complied with your programme and your directives.  He told you what was needed in order to effect the operation and to get rid of the obstacle, which was Major Jabo, and you complied by getting the weight and might of the interim government behind the army to send militiamen into Bisesero.  And I'm suggesting to you that this letter demonstrates that.  So what is your response? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I wish to say that you have made this statement, which is your right.  Is this testimony, or are you, in fact, making submissions?  In both cases, this is something you need to take responsibility for, not me.  

Now, as "to give me a feedback before the end of the month of June, we agree that the follow-up and the report is to be provided before the end of June," I don't know whether you want the Trial Chamber to believe that on the 20th of June I had such a report.  If I had received that report by the 20th of June, I would have congratulated the witness -- the préfet -- sorry -- rather than asking him to report to me once again.  

The other thing is that you are saying that I organised the civil defence and that I agreed with the préfet for him to ask the government, through you and MINADEF, for hand grenades, et cetera, in order to carry out the operation within the frame work of the civil defence system.  Throughout the morning and beginning of the afternoon, I told you that the position of the government was to even prohibit that such an operation be conducted.  

And now you are saying -- you have decided since -- you have decided that this is what happened.  I wish to tell you that that was not how it happened and that Préfet Kayishema did not report on the implementation by the army of this clean-up operation which was to take place in his administrative area, because such an operation did not take place, and you are aware of that.  

The -- you have taken these documents from the archives of Kibuye préfecture.  I know APG (sic), judicial and administrative affairs.  The person in charge was your witness who did not come to testify.  You know that Ignace, Counsel for the Prosecution, he was the one who gave all those documents to you.  If a report had been made on the status of the implementation of this operation, why would he have given you all these documents and not the report on the implementation of the clean-up operation?  Why?  Tell me.  You do not have such a report, and this means that the operation was never implemented.  And, in any case, Préfet Kayishema did not report to me on this issue.  

You have Kayishema's case file since he was convicted.  Can you tell me in whose judgement, in which paragraph, mention is made of the implementation of this clean-up operation or mention is made of the report on the implementation of this operation?  You do not have such documents, Counsel for the Prosecution.  You don't.  Because even with Kayishema, who was supposed to produce the report, you were not able to show this report to him.  If you have the report, bring it to us so that we can talk.  But do not draw any conclusions which are simply the result of your imagination running wild, as a prosecutor, in order to accuse innocents. 
Q.	Since you're on the topic of Kayishema's report, Mr. Karemera, let's turn to document S12, which was distributed yesterday.  If you thumb through the document, you will see that there is an English typewritten translation which is followed by a handwritten text, which is followed by several pages of trial transcripts from the Kayishema trial.  The original document, which is the handwritten text, was admitted in evidence as Prosecution Exhibit 348 in the Kayishema trial.  The court -- the trial transcripts that follow it is a portion of the cross-examination of Mr. Kayishema in relation to his handwritten letter which you have before you.  And then we have the English translation, which is the first 
	three or four pages.  

Now, directing your attention to the handwritten text, you have never seen this document before, have you?  Or maybe you have. 
A.	I never -- I've never seen this document.  Even yesterday, when it was distributed, it was distributed to the others and not to me.  I'm seeing it for the very first time.  What is its date?  What is the date of the letter?  
Q.	Everything will be clear to you in a few moments.  If you didn't see this document in 1994, it's completely understandable.  Because Mr. Kayishema himself says that this was the draft of a report he was writing which was never dispatched, probably because he didn't have the time to type it up and send it to you.  And, according to his testimony, it was drafted around the 5th or the 6th of July.  And that is his writing, except for the very last page.  The last page in the handwritten text was written by the sous-préfet, Gashorore (sic).  You know that person, don't you? 
A.	Gashongore?  
Q.	Gashongore, yes.  
A.	Yes, I know Gashongore.  He was a sous-préfet in Kibuye.  But I do not know Gashongore's handwriting or Kayishema's handwriting.  So I do not trust you when you are saying that it is Kayishema's handwriting.  Where is the proof that it is so, Counsel for the Prosecution?  You cannot make a statement just like that.  

And, besides, Kayishema did not sign this document.  He did not send it, since he said during his trial -- why are you showing this document to me?  To tell me that Kayishema intended to report to me and he did not report to me, as you suggested to him, as a thesis during his trial?  But he certainly challenged this document, because he probably said that it was a draft.  And now you're showing this document to me.  I do not understand. 
Q.	Mr. Kayish -- Mr. Karemera, you have an --
A.	I am Karemera.  Counsel for the Prosecution, I am Karemera, Mr. Karemera.  

And this is -- this makes me furious.  I am not Kayishema.  He was convicted, as you well know.  If this is what you wish to suggest, please do otherwise.  My name is Karemera, K-A-R-E-M-E-R-A, Édouard.  Enough.  

I have been in your hands for 11 years now, and you don't even know my name.  Why don't you let me go to unite with my -- reunite with my children?  And bring the person you wish to convict, because you do not have anything against me, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I apologise.
Q.	You asked for a report -- or, you wanted to discuss the issue of reports from Karemera, and that's why we're dealing with this issue now, rather than later.  And here we have a document which Kare -- Kayishema himself acknowledged writing, which was corrected and in draft form in one or two places by his sous-préfet, who added another two paragraphs, which was entered in evidence in his case.  And, as you have just stated, he was convicted for the same crimes that we are charging you with, because you were his superior and you were acting in concert with him.  

Let's look at some of the things he says in this draft report that was assembled on the 
5th of -- 6th of July -- between the 5th and 6th of July 1994, by his testimony.  He is the one that dates this memo.  I'm sure that everything he says in this memo you know already, because you met with him on the 11th of July, by your own admission earlier yesterday, as indicated in your diary, that you had a meeting with territorial authorities in Buta -- in Kibuye on the 11th of July, which would include Kayishema.  And the same things that he recounts in his handwriting in this memorandum are probably the same things that he told you on the 11th of July.  
So let's look at some of the things that he told -- he says in the memo, which I put to you were discussed on the 11th.  
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, before we go any further, you are speculating.  

Is the Prosecutor authorised to speculate?  

You are saying that Kayishema is not even aware of the date of the document.  You're saying that it is a draft.  You're saying that he probably told me about it and that I know the content of the document.  

My answer is no.  And I do not wish to continue with this document unless you bring Kayishema here for us to discuss it.  You cannot just offhandedly use a draft -- you are qualifying it as a draft 
yourself -- and ask me to discuss it.  

What I sent to Kayishema I signed, and I take responsibility for it.  During the meeting of the 11th -- you can put questions to me on what he told me during the meeting on the 11th, but you should not tell me that he suddenly mentioned a draft to me.  I was minister of the interior, as you know, and I was doing my work properly.  So no one would come and tell me about a draft.  

So you should keep your draft.  And do not put questions to me on it, because I shall not respond to such questions, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I shall not. 
Q.	Let's look at what he says in enumerated paragraph number 1 on the first page.  And it starts, "On the matter of security, several meetings with the townspeople and the administrative authorities were held regarding the organisation of patrols and roadblocks in the context of civilian self-defence."  

	Wouldn't that sentence suggest to you that the civil defence programme was up and running and operational in Kibuye préfecture as headed by Préfet Kayishema? 
MR. SOW: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, if I may. 

Mr. President, I wish to address the Trial Chamber.  Mr. Édouard Karemera has refused this document in its entirety.  Is it possible for counsel for the Prosecution to proceed?  This is a question I'm putting to the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We consider that we cannot prevent the Prosecutor from putting questions to Mr. Karemera on this document.  But we also consider that we cannot compel Mr. Karemera to answer. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, Mr. Karemera's refusal to respond should not ultimately be considered as shying away from things, because, Mr. President, I believe the jurisprudence on this issue is clear.  The jurisprudence states that when a document is not admitted -- that is not admitted into evidence contains evidence that is contrary to the testimony of the witness during cross-examination and that that document has not been discussed by that same witness or is not a document that has been accepted by the witness, such document cannot be produced to the witness for him or her to comment upon it, because if the witness challenges the document in its entirety, as well as the facts as alleged in that document, the document cannot be shown to this witness.  And this is the case law.  

The fact that you are saying that one cannot prevent the -- counsel for the Prosecution from putting questions to the witness on such a document, which, according to him, is a draft, and that you cannot either force the witness to respond, this might be misinterpreted.  And I do not want my client to be subsequently accused of having refused to answer the questions put to him by counsel for the Prosecution because he did not have any answer for -- to these questions or to hear later on that the witness was put in a tight spot.  So this is a matter of jurisprudence, and this is an issue that has to be ruled upon by the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, you would not have been making this proposition if Mr. Karemera had said, for example, that he recognised the document.  So the question could be put to him.  

Now, depending on his answer, the Chamber can draw its own conclusions in due course.  And I expect that time -- the appropriate time for discussion as to what conclusions you may draw would be presented during the closing arguments.  

But we are here for the testimony.  We've got the question.  We've got Mr. Karemera's answer.  And let's move on. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Karemera, going back to the document, that enumerated paragraph 1, where it states:  "On the matter of security, several meetings with the townspeople and the administrative authorities were held regarding the organisation of patrols and roadblocks in the context of civilian self-defence, " wouldn't that statement, in a handwritten memorandum from Préfet Kayishema on the 6th of July 1994, suggest to you that the civil defence programme was operational in Kibuye? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I do not know the source of this document.  You are the one stating that it emanates from Kayishema.  That is one thing.

Second, I told you that I was not ready to discuss a draft that was never forwarded to me, even if you are insisting that this is a document from Kayishema and Gashongore, since it was written by 
two different people.  Now, I ask you how you were able to make a difference between the excerpts that were drafted by Kayishema and those drafted by his sous-préfet, since this is your statement.  

I merely wish to say that I am setting this document aside and I am waiting for us to move to another line of questioning. 
Q.	On page 2 of the English translation, there is the statement at the top of the page, "The creation of civilian defence committees has progressively taken shape, but there is a lack of military officer reservists and gendarmes."  It continues:  "The civilian defence fund has been set up.  The account number is 91935 at the BCR in Kibuye.  More than 50,000 francs were recently raised, and the awareness campaign continues."  

Wouldn't these two statements in a memorandum from Kayishema on the 6th of July 1994 suggest to you that, where he is concerned, the civil defence programme was operational in Kibuye préfecture?  
A.	Nothing in here proves that these are statements by Kayishema.  This is what you are saying.  These are words you are putting in Kayishema's mouth.  And I will not answer on any document that was not forwarded to me by Kayishema, since he was my subordinate.  He did not forward this document to me. 
Q.	On page 3 of the English translation at the very top of the page, Kayishema talks about the 
	French army.  And it states:  "The French army arrived in Kibuye to make the first administrative 
	context -- contacts on the 24th of June 1994.  On the 26th of June 1994, the army set up camp in Kibuye on the premises of the école normale technique in Kibuye, and it began a reconnaissance of Kibuye préfecture."  In parentheses, "A detailed report will be sent to you soon."
A.	This report never was said -- was never sent.
Q.	At enumerated paragraph 3 Préfet Kayishema continues:  "The Bisesero area between 
	Gisovu and Gishyita communes still presents danger -- a danger for the people in the area.  The people have not succeeded in clearing the area.  Today a thousand refugees have formed a camp protected by the French soldiers." 

Let's think about that sentence for a second -- for a few minutes actually.  Just looking at that sentence, when Préfet Kayishema talks about a danger, that the Bisesero area presents a danger, and then goes on to say that the people have not succeeded in clearing the area, clearing, as in ratissage, and then goes on to say that a thousand refugees have formed a camp protected by the French soldiers, wouldn't a reasonable reading of those three sentences together suggest to you that the clearing that was to be done was of the persons who eventually became refugees protected by the French, noncombatants -- children, elderly, women -- who had nothing to do with fighting the FAR?
A.	This does not suggest anything to me.  It would rather suggest that there was no clean-up operation in Bisesero.  

As for the rest of your inferences, you'll have the opportunity to make them, and you know that. 
Q.	On the following page Préfet Kayishema goes on to say -- and I'm reading from the middle of the page.  And this is the page that bears K number K0032960.  This is Kayishema speaking now.  "Mr. Minister", addressing presumably you, Mr. Karemera -- "Mr. Minister, I will not allow the problems raised by the people during the security meetings to go unheard" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, to interrupt.  

Could counsel please read slowly. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In Kayishema's draft memorandum he writes:  "Mr. Minister, I will not allow the problems raised by the people during the security meetings to go unheard and for which we would like the government to give some directives.  These problems may degenerate into conflicts.  These problems include, number 1, secret meetings of political parties; number 2, dividing up land left behind by refugees or missing persons during the unrest in the months of April and May 1994; number 3, the punishment to be imposed upon persons who do not participate in the patrols, night or day, and at the roadblocks for various reasons, such as men having Tutsi wives and not wanting to leave them for fear that they would be killed, people who do not want to leave their looted goods, and people who simply do not want to participate.  The townspeople have incriminated these people as Ibyitso." 

What do these types of problems suggest to you, Mr. Karemera?  This is how your préfet, Kayishema, viewed problems, problems that required your intervention in July of 1994.  The massacre of civilians was not a problem.  Killing Tutsi women and children was not a problem.  The problem he identifies is that the men who had Tutsi wives didn't want to involve themselves in the killing and the roadblocks.  And some people didn't want to get involved in the civil defence programme as you had mandated.  That's what he sees as problems.  What do you have to say about that?  
A.	First of all, Mr. Prosecutor, to tell you that Kayishema is not my préfet.  He was the préfet of Kibuye préfecture.  He was not appointed upon my proposal, and you also are aware of that.  

Number 3 (sic), he did not send me this report, because I see where you want to go.  You want to say that I shouldn't -- that I didn't punish him.  You can punish him on the basis of a draft which he did not send me?  How can I do that?  

You don't have any argument, Mr. Prosecutor.  Please move on to your next line of questioning. 
Q.	On the final page of the memorandum, which is at the very top of the page in the handwritten text, this is the portion of the text written by the sous-préfet.  
MR. NIMY: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I have a concern with regard to the interpretation of the provisions of our Rules of Procedure and Evidence concerning the harassment of a witness.  I would like to understand when this does actually obtain.  When I observe that the Prosecutor is persisting in using a document which the witness has set aside -- he said that, "I don't want to speak of it, and I don't want to hear mention made of it."  I understood your ruling when you said that you cannot stop the Prosecutor from reading that document, and neither can you oblige -- obligate the witness to respond.  But what is happening, is this not harassment?  We are trying to push the witness to the end of his nerves on grounds which he has refused to speak about.  He doesn't want this document.  

The Prosecutor -- allow me the expression.   It is not very French.  But the Prosecutor is not bothered and he moves from the first page, second page, third, fourth, fifth page, until, according to him, he wears the witness out and the witness ends up by discussing the document which he has set aside from the discussions right from the beginning.  

Mr. President, is this not what is known as harassment of a witness, which is prohibited by your Rules of Procedure and Evidence?  If it's not harassment, then well, we can continue.  But I was made to understand that this was a good example of harassment or badgering of a witness.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We don't think the situation has reached anywhere close to what we would consider to be the badgering or harassment of a witness.  

Mr. Karemera is responding as he sees fit.  There are sections that he does not respond to, sections he responds to.  What we are interested in is his testimony, and that's what we will be evaluating as time goes on.  

So I think we -- the examination can continue. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, on the last page of the handwritten text, which is also the last page -- 
A.	Now you are calling me Karamira.  

Quite honestly, Mr. President.  Where are we?  

Karamira is dead.  There is a mistake.  What do you mean?  I have been here for 11 years.  I am in the witness box for two weeks.  Why are you calling me Karamira here?  Is it to destabilise me because Karamira was killed without trial?  Is that what you want?  
I am astonished, Mr. President.  One time I am Kayishema.  Another time I am Karamira.  And finally, who is going to be convicted?  Is it Karamira?  Yes or no?  Is it Karamira?  Is it Kayishema?  Who is it?  Can I be told?  
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, you know, you could apologise.  We have noticed that for some time now there has been a little bit of slippage with names, and we thought it was just the pressure of the proceedings getting to everybody.  

	So let's just -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Is the Court suggesting that the - that it's under the impression that I was deliberately trying to misidentify the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I said just the opposite. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just thought that you could have -- you could have even in a nice way just tell Mr. Karemera that you're sorry for calling him by the wrong name.  
MR. WEBSTER:
	All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	That's what I'm saying.  
MR. WEBSTER:
	Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	And I'm saying that we have noticed that it's happened before.  And we thought it was just that the pressure of the proceedings had been getting to everybody.  So if you can just reduce the temperature a little bit. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Édouard Karemera, I can assure you that I certainly meant no disrespect if I mispronounced your name and no disrespect if, under pressure, I called you Kambanda or Kayishema when we all know that you are Mr. Édouard Karemera, who was the first vice-president of the 
	MRND party in 1994 -- 90 -- 1994.  

So let's continue.  On the last page -- 
A.	I believe everybody is tired.  We should just rest.  And then we come back.  This cannot go on like this, Mr. President.  

I am proud.  I am proud of who I am.  Kambanda is not myself.  A renegade at the stand, that was his position.  

Karamira, I know him.  And I mourn him because he was ignominiously killed.  

Kayishema, I know him.  I know how he defended himself here.  I know what he had as punishment.  

So please, please do not confuse me with others.  And particularly, don't confuse me with Kambanda.  Please don't take me for someone dead, because I am still here.  And please don't confuse me with a convicted person.  

I know that for you the accused person is presumed guilty.  But now I am asking myself why.  Why are you putting me under such pressure?  If I am guilty, as Kayishema, as you are suggesting, let us stop all this.  

Let's not continue, Mr. President. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President --  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I cannot continue. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. Karemera, one minute please. 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot continue.  I am destabilised.  I would like to ask Mr. President that I be given five minutes so that I can go to the restroom. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Since it's time -- close to the time of the break and it is obvious that, voluntarily or not, Mr. Karemera has really been pushed, Mr. President, I really wish that we take the break now, because I even have the impression that it is deliberate, when the information has not been had, to destabilise him.  It is just a mere matter of wanting to humiliate him.  So I'm asking you kindly at this stage that all become calm and collective once again, that we take this break at this present moment, by your leave.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We -- we think -- 

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I -- simply, I followed in French, and I didn't follow in the English the last incident which provoked the response or the reaction of Mr. Karemera.  I don't know whether the Chamber had the opportunity to hear the explanation by the interpreters.  The interpreters seem to have been trying to indicate that Mr. Karemera was a member of the MDR.  And that is what brought about the reaction from Mr. Karemera.  I don't know whether the Chamber had the opportunity to hear that from the interpreter.  I just wanted the Chamber to hear this because this is -- seems to be what brought about this particular difficulty.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, may I take this opportunity to confirm what was said by Mr. Weyl just now.  The interpreter had wanted, in the French booth, to apologise and say MRND and not MDR.  But there was no opportunity provided to her, and I was not able to continue either because Mr. Karemera was also speaking at the same time.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We -- we have been paying attention to what's been going on.  I can assure you, Mr. Weyl.  

We also think it's reasonable to take the luncheon break now.  So with we will resume at 2 o'clock.
(Court recessed at 1216H) 
(Pages 22 to 39 by Tanya West)



















(Court resumed at 1410H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everybody.  Mr. Karemera, good afternoon.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How are you feeling now?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I am feeling very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  I'm very pleased to hear that.  
THE WITNESS:
But -- Your Honour, I feel okay, but I'd like to tell you why I feel okay in a few words.  Your Honour, I understand your concerns and worries a while ago.  When you adjourned the session in the morning, you stated that -- that the atmosphere -- I don't know if those are the words you used, but you noted that there was a lot of tension.  And I'd like to tell you that, as a matter of fact, I also felt my own 
	blood pressure rising.  I was going to ask you to -- for leave to consult the doctor.  

Because, at your request, Your Honour, the Prosecutor had agreed to excuse himself for having called me Kambanda and, three minutes after, having called me Kayishema.  

	And while, Mr. Prosecutor, I was about to agree -- accept your excuses, because I believe you were sincere, you called me Karemira once again.  And for the icing on the cake, the interpreter put into your mouth that -- that I was, indeed, Édouard Karemera, member of the MRND.  

	Your Honour, as -- to err is human, but the Prosecutor and the interpreter should not insist, because now it becomes devilish, and it raises my blood pressure.  

So with your authorisation, Your Honour, I would like to state to the Prosecutor that -- that, as a matter of fact, I have nothing at all -- nothing -- against him.  I had told him it has to do with positions.  I told him that I would collaborate, and he can attest to that, because I believe he is sincere.  I believe that his duty is to prosecute me, and he knows that I have a role to play, because I'm an accused.  And, as an accused, I do not agree to collaborate -- collaborate with the Prosecutor, because that would have been very quick.  Because, quite simply, he would have asked you to sentence me to 20, maybe 15 years; I can't tell.  But I did not choose to collaborate.  

So he needs to understand that I am doing my best to present my case so that at the end of the trial the Bench should be able to determine.  And I would subject myself to your decision.  

But with your leave, so that he shouldn't say I've taken 15 minutes to say nothing, I would like to let him know that I accept his excuses.  And I also accept the excuses of the interpreter who recruited me into the MRND, which no longer exists, and the MDR, which no longer exists.  And that -- I understand that they can make slips of the tongue, but when it is done over and over, it becomes something difficult, and difficult for all.

When the Prosecutor was asked by you, Mr. President, whether he was tired, I understand you.  
But -- but he needs to understand how tired I've been, because he asks questions, and I have to answer.  

So let me end here by telling him to try harder and by promising that I would try my best to answer his questions and for us to carry on and finish in peace, because I have nothing to hide.  

I wouldn't -- I don't want to accuse him for having denied me access to recordings of the Muhabura radio, but he knows that during those events you had Radio Rwanda, Radio Muhabura and RTLM.  All the documents that I've been given are transcripts from Radio Rwanda, Radio RTLM, never from Radio Muhabura.  

Really, to be candid, look at me straight in the eyes.  Can you tell me that there was nothing recorded from Radio Muhabura?  Straight in the eye of the Bench, can you state that in your investigations you never asked yourself that question?  No.  

I am not trying to blame you for anything.  I'm not even going to ask you to -- ask you to give me those documents so that I can defend myself.  Quite simply, I am asking you to respect me in the same way as I respect you, to consider me as Karemera, Édouard Mibira Mukusi (phonetic).  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Karemera.  

Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good afternoon to everyone, to the Chamber, to the parties.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good afternoon to you, Mr. Karemera.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And I quite sincerely respect everything that you have just said, and I think we do respect each other.  This is not the first time that we have spoken to each other.  We've spoken to each other outside of the context of a cross-examination, and I think I've made it clear to you, or I hope I have, in any case, that I certainly do respect your right to defend yourself.  And I've a fundamental respect for all persons to express themselves.  So I don't think anything further needs to be said on that point.  

I would, however, comment that it's ironic that, even with respect to the statements that you've just made -- I've been listening both in English and in French -- and the last time the interpreter was interpreting what you said about the MDR, he used the expression "MRND" in the English.  And he corrected himself the second time.  But the first time -- and I think the transcripts will bear me 
	out -- when you said "MDR", which I heard in French, what I heard in my head piece was "MRND".  So, clearly, we're all at a disadvantage here.  Everyone is working under stress.

I'm certainly -- I didn't make those comments to criticise the interpreters, who have a very difficult job.  But I say that only to indicate to you, Mr. Karemera, that these lapses are just that.  They're lapses.  They're not a deliberate attempt to diminish you or to excite you.  It's simply that we're all trying to do -- we're all processing several thoughts at the same time when we -- when I open my mouth or when the interpreters open their mouths to help us communicate with each other.  

So I will proceed, and, hopefully, we'll make some headway this afternoon.  I'd like to begin by going back to the document that upset us, but just for a second.  I'm not going to ask you any questions on it now.  I'll put it -- I'll put it to the side.  I'd like to come back to it if we have time, but I'll move on to something else.  

But I just wanted to correct another slip that I made unintentionally, because when I was reading enumerated paragraph number 3 in the English text, on page 3, I misread something which appears in black and white and in English.  So I make mistakes not only with your name but with other words as well.  

The last sentence of that paragraph 3 reads correctly as, "Today, a thousand ref" -- "Today, a thousand fugitives have formed a camp protected by the French soldiers."  And when I attempted to read it this morning, I said "refugees", and I almost made the same mistake a second ago.  But I simply wanted to correct the record, that what Mr. Kayishema was referring in his draft -- referring to in his draft memorandum were people that he characterised as fugitives that were being protected by the French.  So that's just for the clarity of the record.  We'll come back to that memorandum, if we have time, later on.  

Now I'd like to move on to another document.  First of all, let me clarify one more thing for the record.  In document number 06, which is the French text of your letter to Préfet Kayishema of the 20th of June, there's a notation in the document, in the French document, at the top in handwriting, which I believe you referred to in one of your responses.  

And just to make sure that we're clear on the record, it's in handwriting, and it says "AAJ" in parenthesis, the French word "sécurité", and near it there are some indications of numbers.  And I believe it was your testimony that you could look at that -- those notations and determine that this document had been received in the office of Préfet Kayishema.  Is that correct?  
A.	I stated that AAJ stands for "administrative and judicial case" or "affairs", which is a service that was in the Kibuye préfecture.  
Q.	And would that indicate to you that your letter of the 20th of June 1994 had been received in the Kibuye préfecture?  
A.	No.  Rather, it means that the letter was found by your services in the archives of the Kibuye préfecture.  There are other things.  I can't find those in my documents, but I can see that these were from the services of the préfecture that you took those documents.  But maybe I'm wrong, and that's not a very crucial part -- something too important for me, unless if it is Kayishema who brought it to you.  
Q.	No.  For your information, the document was recovered from the préfecture office.  But I did recall in your testimony you said the same thing.  So I just wanted to confirm that, and I think we've done that, so I'll move on to the next document I want to address.  
A.	Okay.  
Q.	And that would be document, in our bundle, 09.  And this is one sheet of paper, but it has both the French and the English text.  Of course, the French is the original text, and the English is a translation.  It has been admitted in evidence in our case as P. 57.  
A.	Yes.  I have it.  
Q.	This is a document you've seen before because it was displayed to you when you testified as a Defence witness in the Bagosora trial.  So it comes as no surprise to you.  

And it's a letter from the bourgmestre of Mabanza commune, and it's being directed to the 
	préfet of Kibuye, Kayishema, and it's dated the 24th of June 1994.  And he states in his letter -- and, by the way, this letter -- or, actually, an original copy of this letter was found in the préfet's office in Kibuye.  And going back to the text of the letter, it says, "Dear sir, I refer to our conversation of the evening of Wednesday, the 22nd of June 1994 regarding the Interahamwe who had come from Gisenyi to reinforce the attacks at Bisesero between the 19th and the 22nd of June 1994 and who were to stop at the Rubengera centre at Mabanza to launch an attack, and regret to inform you that this has happened." 

Now, when the Mabanza bourgmestre refers to his conversation of two days earlier with Préfet Kayishema, which is after he received your letter -- after Préfet Kayishema received your letter, my suggestion to you is that it's clear from this correspondence, or at least from that sentence, that militiamen had been dispatched from Gisenyi in response to the order of the interim government decided on the 17th of June, which you conveyed to Colonel Nsengiyumva.  What do you have to say about that?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  With regard to my letter I sent to Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva -- we stopped on the 20th.  When I was following up the minister of defence and when he ensured me that they were going to correct the procedural errors by contacting both the gendarmerie and the army chief of staff, that was on the 20th.  

Now, what you're suggesting to me is -- you know, that suggestion is -- is part of your argument but which does not correspond to reality.  And the reality is as follows, which is something I've already stated before, that, firstly, at that time, when people talked about Interahamwe, we were not talking about militia, and especially not Interahamwe za MRND.  We were talking about all those people who had simply taken advantage of the chaos and who were carrying out extortion and looting and violence in general.  

Secondly, with regard to what was written by Bagilishema, Ignace, from the Mabanza commune, I explained that, when he is referring to Interahamwes who had come from Gisenyi, he was talking about Bakiga, who had come from neighbouring communes to Kibuye.  And this I'm going to state again for the record.  

This is -- these are the Ramba commune, Ramba is spelt R-A-M-B-A; the Kayove commune, K-A-Y-O-V-E; it's part of the Gaseke commune.  Spelling of Gaseke, G-A-S-E-K-E.  And all these 
	three communes are on the highlands in the Gisenyi préfecture, what is known as the Zaire-Nile crater.

And you would add a certain number of secteurs in the Rutsiro commune, in the Kibuye préfecture.  The spelling of Rutsiro, R-U-T-S-I-R-O.  And you would add it, though Bagilishema doesn't say so because he doesn't want to implicate his administrators -- there's some people from the Mabanza commune, because this commune has part known as -- I will say it in Kinyarwanda -- and part of the highlands.  

And as I said a while ago, there was permanent conflict between the inhabitants of that secteur -- of that - the highlands where the main crop is peas, maize and Irish potatoes.  And they were combating with the people in the lowlands in the Kivu, who farm sorghum, beans and who also farm bananas, and so on and so forth.  

So I hope that is finished.  So, I mean, I hope these rivalries are over.  But you had rivalries between highlanders and the people who lived in the valleys.  And I wouldn't deal on this too much, but I would like to say, even during the 1959 social revolution, people left those highlands to carry on with the revolution to the lowlands.  And that is why Bagilishema states that he does not need the involvement of these people who come from Gisenyi.  

And that is what he meant to state.  That is, people from Ramba, Kayove, parts of Rutsiro and parts of Mabanza, those are the people that were called the Interahamwe from Gisenyi -- Gisenyi who were involved in Bisesero.  

I would like to also remind you that one of your witnesses, AMO, who's from Gasenyi -- and Gasenyi is still on that Zaire-Nile crater.  He was also a mountain dweller, and he stated that those people had come from Bisesero and that they had -- they had gone away with cattle and sheep and saw them go through Gasenyi.  I don't believe I'm wrong.  

So to sum up myself, Mr. Prosecutor, your suggestion is in line with your theory, but you need to understand that when Bagilishema spoke of the Interahamwe who had come from Gisenyi, he was not saying the same thing as you want to suggest.  He was not thinking about people who had come from Rubavu, which is on the border with Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.  

And that is where you brought Witness AMB, who stated that he took militias to Bisesero.  But, 
	you know, the investigator -- the people who had taken him to show him where Bisesero was, and they pretended to state that he was the one who went and showed them where Bisesero was, although they had spent two or three years, if not more, in investigating and drawing maps of Bisesero.  

They said that this gentleman, AMB, would go and show them the residence of Mr. Ruzindana, who went to -- came to Gisenyi to lead militiamen.  And Bizumuremye -- Bizumuremye was working under the orders of Nsengiyumva, Anatole.  

But you all -- you know, Counsel for the Prosecution, that this is pure fabrication.  AMD said that he was a driver in Kigali, international driver.  You know that -- since you saw it in the file, that Obed Ruzindana was a transporter.  He had lorries that transported goods from Kigali to Mombasa.  And the people who were working in the same secteur did not know him.  Would you believe that?  If you do not recognise this -- if he did not recognise this, it was obvious that he would not be able to recognise the residents to be able to show it to the investigators of the Prosecution.  

	I will tell you why they took him.  On the 15th of March 2005, Mengalle -- I believe that is his name -- along with the two others -- there was three of your investigators; there were the drivers; and there was AMB, and I will not use his name because he is a protected witness.  But I have remembered his name because he is a big liar.  

The investigators went to ask the public prosecutor in Gisenyi for the authorisation to take this AMB, who could not leave Gisenyi.  As you know, he had been provisionally released, and he could not leave Gisenyi.  So it is with the authorisation that was granted that they took him to coach him for him to come and repeat this here.  

But, unfortunately, because he is a peasant, he did not learn the lesson correctly.  Since he didn't know Gisenyi beyond Rubavu, he mixed up Rubengera and Gitikinini.  And most of all, he mixed up Mushubati.  But he does not know, and he did not mention, and which is in Bagilishema's letter, and this is an issue you will certainly raise in the following question.  

So, Counsel for the Prosecution, I believe you have had time to check the information with -- well, I don't see how to say so otherwise -- with Bagilishema, Ignace, because he appeared before this Tribunal.  You did not do it -- do not try to make him say what he did not say.  He did not say that he saw Interahamwe who had come from Rubavu commune sent by Anatole, who passed through Rubengera.  He said Interahamwe who had come from Gisenyi.  And in all of his letters, for him, Gisenyi includes the three communes I just reminded you of and which have common borders with Mabanza commune.  
Q.	Right.  Thank you once again for your very elaborate response.  But, Mr. Karemera, wouldn't you agree that Ignace Bagilishema was a member of the MRND party?  
A.	Yes, I agree.  
Q.	As a member of the MRND party, don't you think he would be able to distinguish between Interahamwe and other militiamen in June of 1994?  
A.	No.  In 1994 Bagilishema, as well as the others and even myself, were not able to distinguish them from one another, because the distinction between the MRND, Interahamwe and all the others -- unless you knew any of the persons individually or what they wore, the MRND uniform.  But that is not even certain, because at a given point in time, as you know, the national temporary committee of the Interahamwe discovered that it had been infiltrated, that the Interahamwe za MRND had been infiltrated, and they prohibited -- they banned the wearing of the MRND Interahamwe uniform.  

So during the war, this uniform was banned, or whatever was worn was not -- whoever was wearing this uniform were not necessarily Interahamwe za MRND.  So you should be lenient with Bagilishema because there were no distinctive signs between the Interahamwe of Gisenyi, the militiamen, the Bakiga.  

He spoke as everybody else did after the 6th of April.  Everybody called it Interahamwe, all those killers who had taken advantage of the chaos brought about by the RPF and who were wreaking havoc and killing everywhere.  He was using the same terms as everyone at the time.  
Q.	Let's continue with the document.  You go on -- excuse me.  Mr. Bagilishema goes on to say, referring to the Interahamwe, as he identified them, "When they arrived at the roadblock mounted outside the commune office, the Interahamwe fired a lot of shots, which terrified the people and caused them to flee their homes.  I tried in vain to calm some of the people, for those in Rubengera secteur had fled.  A member of the civil defence committee from that secteur came to Kibuye to notify the gendarmerie." 

Now, when Mr. Bagilishema is referring to a member of the civil defence committee from that secteur, could that be the civil defence committee at the level of the secteur that you mandated to be set up in your instructions of the 25th of May 1994?  
A.	No.  Counsel for the Prosecution, let me explain it to you very rapidly.  Civilian self-defence include -- involving the setting up of roadblocks and having them manned by the populations in the cellules or organising night patrols existed even before the directive of the prime minister on civilian self-defence.  It existed -- so it was popular self-defence, or people's self-defence, and it existed and was set in motion according to the situation prevailing in the country.  

So with the directive -- and I'm not in a position to confirm to you whether the document was forwarded to all the bourgmestres, but that Ignace Bagilishema had probably received -- the term itself was not changed.  What changed is its contents.  And the people who understood that there was a change in the contents are few and far between.  

And I am even tempted to believe that you have not understood the difference between the structure that we established from the 25th of May 1994 and what was being carried out up to that time.  Bagilishema had not understood.  But if he's using this term, and here you have the translation -- I would have liked to have the text in Kinyarwanda -- and you would have seen that it was making reference to the people who were manning the roadblocks and who were participating in the night patrols.  

I wish to tell you that civilian self-defence or civil defence, as mentioned in the directive of the prime minister, has nothing to do with that situation.  And I explained it to you when I put the document on the overhead projector over there.  

What we did with the directive, what we were aiming to do, was something different than the organisation of night patrols or the setting up of roadblocks, because this was an operation which was brilliantly managed by the local authorities since the RPF attack in 1990 and which was evolving as the front advanced.  

But in 1994 the war spread to the whole territory, and the government had the feeling that, instead of recruiting for the army, in keeping with the law on defence -- that it would be better to have a structure to organise the population for it to be able to participate in its self-defence.  And this self-defence, as organised by the directive, should not be mixed up with the manning of roadblocks, with the night patrols that are referred to by Ignace Bagilishema in his letter of 24th of June 1994.  
Q.	Well, once again, you've given us a very elaborate response, and I appreciate it, because there are aspects of it with which I agree, quite frankly.  It's always been the Prosecution case that the civil defence was set up before your directives of the 25th of May 1994.  So you and I are on the same wavelength so far as that is concerned.  

So it definitely existed before May of 1994.  In fact, it was made operational a few months before the crash of the president's plane in April of 1994.  You -- since you mentioned it in your book, the book that you published, have already made reference to the memorandum from Déogratias Nsabimana dated the 30th of March 1994, where he outlines a programme that had been set up.  So we're agreed on that.  It certainly was a programme that was set up before the 25th of May 1994.  

But, as you also suggest, Mr. Karemera, the content was different, because when you issued your directives on the 25th of May 1994, the civil defence had already incorporated the Interahamwe.  It was essentially a cover for the Interahamwe.  The committees had already been operational at the secteur level from months before -- or, from weeks before.  

So in certain respects your response and my understanding of the events are perfectly consistent one with the other.  The programme was set up before your directives, that your directives certainly gave them a greater degree of force.  

And what I suggest to you is that nothing you have just said discounts the proposition that I've just made to you, that the civil defence committee that Bagilishema is referring to in his letter right here is one that was consistent or set up in reliance upon your directives.  

Now, you were the one that earlier suggested that the civil defence programme was not operational, that it was not implemented.  And what I'm suggesting to you is Bagilishema's own words in this letter would indicate the contrary.  
A.	No, Counsel for the Prosecution.  No.  We, indeed, agree on specific issues.  And how could it be otherwise?  Because we have to agree on some things.  But we disagree on a number of things.  When you're saying, for example, that it started with a note by General Nsabimana on the 30th of March, my answer to you, Counsel for the Prosecution, is no.  

You know that before being a general and a chief of staff -- Counsel for the Prosecution, since you're saying that you read my book and that you even had it admitted into evidence, because you thought I would not come here and that you had to have it admitted as a precautionary measure, if you read my book correctly, Déogratias Nsabimana, the colonel, when he was the commander of the 
	military sector in Mutara, sent a letter on civilian self-defence to the minister of defence.  I do not remember -- I would not give you an incorrect date, but I believe it was on the 29th of March 1991.  If I had brought my book with me, I would have referred you to the page.  But I will check.  

This to tell you that, with the RPF attack in 1990 and the acts -- the criminal acts perpetrated in Bwusuge, B-W-U-S-U-G-E, in Muvumba commune, in the Mutara communes that had common borders with Uganda, the populations asked for -- asked, rather, that they be organised in order to face the attacks of the RPF combatants who would pass behind the lines of the Rwandan armed forces at the time and would massacre the populations.  That was in the years 1990-1991.  

You know that.  You know that under the Nsengiyaremye government, people's self-defence or 
	civilian self-defence was discussed.  You know, Counsel for the Prosecution, even if you are not prosecuting him, that the minister of the interior, your witness and the director of cabinet -- this Trial Chamber is aware of that.  Since you have brought the statements of Mr. Munyaseza, Faustin, former minister of the interior, you know that Faustin Munyaseza had weapons distributed in the Byumba communes and -- in the Byumba and Ruhengeri communes.  And this was following a governmental decision.  If you do not have that decision, I wish to refer you to the Military I trial.  In the Bagosora trial, those documents were admitted into evidence.  

You are aware, Counsel for the Prosecution, of the fact that, under Agathe Uwilingiyimana or Dismas Nsengiyaremye, on the 2nd of March 1993 all the parties -- and I insist all the parties, including those who were in the government and those who were not -- met and asked that the population be organised in order to ensure its defence.  

And this came in addition to the operations of night patrols and roadblocks manned by the population in order to stop the RPF infiltrators.  Because after the assassination, it was Museveni who had Freddie Rwigema assassinated.  After Freddie Rwigema's assassination, because he did not comply with the orders issued by Museveni and the Americans, Kagame came.  

The RPF had been chased back out of Rwanda.  There was a reorganisation, and that was when the war ceased to be a conventional war, to become a war -- not only a conventional war but also a war with guerilla warfare.  And this was the reason for the night patrols and the roadblocks, because we did not know where the enemy was.  The enemy had infiltrated the country, and especially the regions that were next to the front.  

So we agree that prior to the 25th of May directive, 25th of May 1994, that is, there were actions carried out by the population under the leadership of local administrative authorities, such as conseiller, members of cellule committees.  But such operations were taking place before this note of the 30th of March 1994 you are referring to.  These operations started in the years 1990-1991.  On that, we agree.

	1500H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Karemera, we'll move on to something else.  We're still in the framework of this letter from the bourgmestre of Mabanza, Mr. Bagilishema.  And you know as well as I that he mentions a certain incident with respect to the Interahamwe, using his word, that came from Gisenyi, which is also his term, around the 22nd of June.  And he talks about an incident that was very specific, about a car breaking down and a little girl being shot.  And this is the same information or the same incident that's recounted by AMB, who you've already referred to.  

So you have anticipated my question because you see the link between this letter from Bagilishema and the trial testimony of AMB that he gave on the 1st of October 2007.  You will recall that AMB, when he was giving his direct evidence, didn't say anything about Bakiga and didn't say anything about Kayove.  He said he was in Gisenyi town.  He was at a bar.  He was approached by Lieutenant Bizimuremye, who worked under the orders of Colonel Nsengiyumva.  And it was in Gisenyi town from where he was dispatched from Gisenyi town to drive Interahamwe into Bisesero to support the local population there.  

Now, you will recall also that there was at least a month between AMB's direct evidence on 
the 1st of October 2007 and the cross-examination that came four or five weeks later because your team wanted to investigate before they started their cross-examination.  Do you recall having challenged --  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
If I may, Mr. President.  If I may, Mr. President, I would like for the truth to come to the fore in this courtroom.  AMB told the Trial Chamber that there was a death in his family and asked for leave to go to Rwanda.  He even left without any authorisation, Mr. President, and you had to take measures for him to be stopped, and he stayed for long, and WVSS told us that he had to leave immediately because there was a death in his family.  

How can the Prosecutor come and tell us that one month elapsed before the Defence team was able to organise its investigations unless it is the interpretation that has come back to me.  But I do not believe we can accept such a statement.  We remember all that happened in this courtroom and under what circumstances Witness AMB was prepared, and this is what I wish to say, and this for the record at the time when you will deliberate. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I also wish to make an observation for the record.  I did not wish to interrupt the witness when he was providing answers to the questions put to him.  But earlier on when he introduced the document which is being discussed now for more than half an hour, Counsel for the Prosecution indicated that this document, 09 in the binder, is just a piece of paper with a version in English and French, and the French being the original, of course.  

I wish for it to be placed on record that this is not an original but that it is obviously a translation of a document that we do not have before us and which has not been disclosed to us, and the proof that this is only a translation of an original document in Kinyarwanda is that there are two annotations on this document, one, the république Rwandaise, Rwandan republic -- it is written in brackets "logo" -- and further down, "Subject to be treated by," and between, in parenthesis "illegible."  

If we had an original before our eyes, we wouldn't have those two words, "logo" and "illegible," between brackets.  We would have a document with a logo and with something that would be difficult to read.  But document 09 is not an original document, and we do not have the original.  

Mr. President, this is the clarification I wish to make for the record, and this is important because there are elements within that document that show that the translator focused on essential elements when he places the word Interahamwe, for example, between quotation marks on the third paragraph, which means that there are quotation marks somewhere in the original text, and this has some meaning for the person who is speaking.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
In response to Madam Dior Diagne, if I misspoke, I apologise for that.  My recollection, which may be flawed, was that there was some sort of disclosure issue and that the Chamber allowed the parties extra time or more time and there was at least four or five weeks between his direct examination and his cross-examination.  If I'm wrong, I apologise.  I will go back and check my notes or check the records on that.  But the essential point that I was trying to make in my question to the witness is that there was at least four weeks between the witness's direct exam and his cross-exam.  

So my apologies if I'm mistaken.  I'm not conceding that, but I will look into it and clarify the matter.  But if I may proceed with the witness.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you never challenged AMB about bringing Interahamwe from the Bakiga or from the highlands of Gisenyi when he was testifying orally before this Court back in November of 2007; 
	isn't that correct?  
A.	Now, let me answer that question, but since we need to remind you that when you are quoting off the cuff you might be making errors.  Earlier on you said that AMB was approached.  That is not correct.  AMB counted for nothing.  According to what he said, it was his chiefs who were approached, notably Mabuye.  So, according to his testimony, Obed Ruzindana arrived and arrived with Bizimuremye.  They talked.  And I am also speaking off the cuff.  And subsequently the leaders, including Mabuye, 
	went -- or, rather, were called -- they were at Yote, at the bar, Yote, I believe, having a drink.  And the chiefs were called by Bizimuremye and Ruzindana, and they were informed that it was urgent that they should go to Kibuye.  So this is the correct version.  It was not AMB who discussed with Lieutenant Bizimuremye or Ruzindana.  That was the correction I wished to make.  

Now you're saying that the version you are presenting now was not produced to AMB, but we cross-examined him, Counsel for the Prosecution.  We observed many contradictions in what he was saying, especially with regard to the incident we are referring to now.  

He said that once they reached the Kibuye hills -- why would those hills not be Bisesero, since 
Bisesero -- in Bisesero there are also hills?  When he is saying, "When we arrived in the Kibuye hills," it is because he is not in a position to determine where he was.  He did not know whether it was in Mabanza commune or in Rutsiro commune.  And since he is talking about the hills and he was speaking Kinyarwanda, (Kinyarwanda spoken), which means the upper hills.  

So once they reached the Kibuye hills, Michel killed a child who was between 12 and 14.  
Bagilishema -- as for Bagilishema, he refers to an incident that took place in Mushubati, and Mushubati is in the Mabanza commune at a distance of around 8 kilometres from that roadblock that you placed in front of the commune office.  It is the roadblock that was called TRAFIPRO roadblock for which you brought Witness AWB, who created problems for you, as you know, because he withdrew at the last minute, AWB.  He had come to talk about the passage of Mathieu Ngirumpatse at that TRAFIPRO roadblock.  It is the same roadblock.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, I am explaining to you because --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter wishes to apologise.  The witness is going too fast with the names, and we cannot follow.
THE WITNESS:  
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Karemera.  Mr. Karemera, the interpreters lost you a little while ago.  You're going just a bit too fast for them, particularly with the names that you are describing.  So we haven't got the translation of the last part of your statement.  
THE WITNESS:
Well, that's because I saw the Prosecutor asking me to stop, and I didn't want to stop before I finished.  So, once more, I'm sorry to the interpreters.  If you wish, I would just say what I just said because I don't want to use up too much of the Prosecutor's time.  I understand his concerns.  
I was saying that Mabanza, Gitikinyoni -- Gitikinyoni is spelt G-I-T-I-K-I-N-I (sic) -- Mabanza, 
Rubengera -- the TRAFIPRO barrier is the same area.  That is what Bagilishema is speaking about.  When he arrived at a barrier -- when he arrived -- when they arrived at the roadblock mounted outside the commune office -- 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'm stopping you right there because my question had nothing to do with where they arrived.  We've already gone beyond that.  My question to you had to do with where they started out from.  You claim that the Interahamwe were coming from the highlands of Gisenyi, and this witness testified that he was coming from Gisenyi town, and that's the issue.  Now, if you responded -- you have already responded to that, and let's go on to something else.
A.	No, I did not answer, Mr. Prosecutor.  Let me explain.  
Q.	My question to you was -- or my statement to you was that you had an opportunity to challenge that witness on the issue of where he was coming from and who he was bringing with him, and you didn't.  Now you claim that he was bringing Interahamwe from the highlands of Gisenyi.  But when he was in this courtroom testifying from the same seat that you are sitting in now, you had an opportunity to put that to him, and you didn't.  And his testimony, which is consistent with this letter, is that he was coming from Gisenyi town where he had received orders from Lieutenant Bizimuremye.  So deal with that issue in your response if you feel the need to respond further.
A.	Yes, I will do so.  I will do so because I believe there is a misunderstanding between you and I.  When you are saying he came, Bagilishema states, where did he come from?  That they arrived Gitikinyoni.  Tell me where they came from when they arrived Gitikinyoni.  When they arrived the barrier there, where did they come from?  According to you, they came from Gisenyi.  And I am saying that they were coming from the highlands in Kibuye.  No, Mr. Prosecutor.  I am assisting you.  They came from Bisesero.  And they were going back to their hills in the Kayove commune in Rutsiro, Ramba and so on and so forth.  

And also, if you would rather that these would be militias from Gisenyi, they had come from Gisenyi, and they had moved, according to your witness, for four days to Bisesero.  And since they didn't have ammunition, I will remind you that during your witness's testimony, which I know by heart, because they didn't have ammunition, they went to see Jabo.  Jabo didn't give them any ammunition, and they returned to Gisenyi.  

So if you want me to assist you in your presentation of the facts, what I am stating, that they came, that they arrived from the TRAFIPRO barrier, and that TRAFIPRO, Gitikinyoni, Rubengera, Mabanza are the same thing, that is, to look at myself with regard to Mushubati where the incident, which Bagilishema is referring to in this letter, took place.  

So when -- when the words you just read, the people who were in the group, 
Rubengera groupe scolaire, whom I presented as being a case of displaced persons, which I presented during (inaudible), were scared, and that is what Bagilishema wrote and said they started to flee.  And among these people there was one -- or families that had a vehicle, and they went in a vehicle towards Rutsiro because that is what is written.  And now you are trying -- you want me to say that they were coming from Gisenyi and going to Gisenyi.  That is illogical.  

So they were coming from Mabanza.  They were going back to their home -- rather, they were coming from Rutsiro after having looted, killed, and they were returning to their homes in the Kayove hills, Rutsiro and even Mwanza and other hills.  And when they arrived in the TRAFIPRO barrier, the people got scared, and the people who were at the groupe scolaire, in the Rubengera groupe scolaire, who had the chance of fleeing because they believed that it was likely the Inyenze  were arriving, they started to run, scatter about.  

And when they arrived Mushubati, that is to say, 8 kilometres from Mabanza, that gentleman who is known as Ndakize had a breakdown because the sump of his car broke, and that is what Bagilishema has described.  And while your witness who does not know the area describes the fact that when they arrived at Kibuye hills -- and I'd like you to tell me what AMB -- what hill he is referring to because in Mushubati there is no hill.  Mushubati is in the valley.  That is what I've been trying to explain.  And you tried to -- going up as from Mushubati, you climb towards Rutsiro.  If you don't know where that is, your investigators, they will confirm what I'm saying, that what I'm saying is the truth indeed.

You go up towards Rutsiro, and when you reach Rutsiro, you can see Kibuye below you.  And that is in the hills indeed, and it is no longer the same incident, and that is what I've been trying to have the Chamber understand.  And I believe that the Chamber has finally understood me.  So I can now wait for another question because I think I have answered that question fully, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Let's move on to another document.  Could you show the witness PQ-2, please.  The first page is in English.  Attached to it is the French translation.  And just to deal with this issue of how -- 
A.	PQ what?  I don't have that document. 
Q.	The registrar is looking for it now for you, Mr. Karemera.  
A.	Okay.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'll wait. 
Q.	And just to put a full stop on this issue of how Bagilishema refers to militiamen from Kayove and Rutsiro and how he refers to the Interahamwe from Gisenyi, let's just take a look at the letter he wrote, and I believe this is sometime in late June/early July.  In any case, it's after his letter of the 24th of June.  

Now, your testimony is that the accomplices that were being eliminated in Bisesero and in Kibuye were RPF brigades; right? 
A.	RPF partisans.
Q.	Okay.  Let's look through the text of Mr. Bagilishema and see what he tells us about how accomplices were being defined at the time.  You should be familiar with this exhibit, this letter.  It was admitted in evidence as P. 327.  Certainly it's been discussed before because it was being discussed through the testimony of Witness LSP.  And in this letter he complains to the préfet of Kibuye, Mr. Kayishema, the same person that received his previous letter.  And here he is referring to the Interahamwe or the militiamen that you were talking about, those coming from Kayove and Rutsiro, but -- 
A.	Kayove. 
Q.	Kayove.  
A.	Kayove. 
Q.	-- it's clear from what he says in this letter that the common understanding that he shared with 
	Préfet Kayishema and probably yourself and the other regional and national authorities was that the accomplices were the Tutsi because look at what he says.  I don't have to read the entire letter.  I'm sure you are reading it to yourself now.  So I will just highlight portions of it.  

He's complaining that he is aware of an attack that is going to be launched.  Preparations of a series of attacks are reportedly on the way in zone Murunda and zone Rutsiro.  They're going to be launched against Mabanza from the 1st to the 5th of July under the pretext that accomplices are still hidden in Mabanza.  Bagilishema is complaining to the préfet that, "They have also dared to include myself among the accomplices, stating that I am married to a Tutsi woman."

Bagilishema goes on to say, "I am sorry to inform you that there are no more accomplices in Mabanza.  Even if that were true, the population of Mabanza is self-sufficient.  We do not want to be considered as the defeated so that the people from Kayove and Rutsiro communes need to come and loot at any time and any how in our commune."  And he goes on to ask the préfet to keep these attackers from Kayove and Rutsiro away.  And he feels constrained to clarify concerning "the problem of my wife.  People believe that she is a Tutsi, and that leads them to think that I am an accomplice."  He discounts what he claims is a rumour and goes on to say -- to defend his mother-in-law, who also should not be considered a Tutsi and goes on to give her family history.  

Wouldn't the very text of this letter suggest to you, Mr. Karemera, that Bagilishema is quite capable of distinguishing Interahamwe from Gisenyi from the attackers in Kayove and Rutsiro that you were referring to and that when he talks about accomplices and defends himself against that label, he has a clear understanding that he is sharing with the préfet of Kayishema -- the préfet of Kibuye, Mr. Kayishema, the thinking of authorities is that anybody that's married to a Tutsi woman would be an accomplice? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you asked several questions which are tied up in one single question.  I don't know how to disentangle them.  But my understanding is that you are using the Bagilishema's definition of an accomplice and you are attributing it to Préfet Kayishema and even to myself, and you say that that is our understanding of the terms.  I would like to say that that is speculation from your part.  

	Regarding the distinction that you believe to see in that letter between Interahamwe and militia from Gisenyi, I have to state that I didn't quite get the meaning of your question -- I mean the crux, the meaning, the core of your question, because what I explained, Mr. Prosecutor, is that Bagilishema, when he talks about the Interahamwe in the letter we have just set aside, he was talking about these mountain dwellers who had come from the Gisenyi commune.  And when he said that they came from Gisenyi, you understood it to mean Rubavu.  Of course, Rubavu is part of Gisenyi, but Ramba is also Gisenyi and so on, but you get the fact that he had not been specific in saying that it is the Kayove commune in the Gisenyi préfecture.  

You had a chance of putting the question to him.  You didn't.  Now you are telling me why did you not ask the question to AMB to know whether -- what he was referring to when he was talking about the Kibuye hills.  You know, let us call it a draw.  Let's say neither you nor I on that field of play have carried our reasoning to the end.  But the truth, the reality, is what I am saying as a native of that area who knows the distances.  When he is referring to Kibuye hills, AMB, coming from Gisenyi, it is a proof that he does not know where he is.  That is what I am stating.  Nothing further.  

When you are trying to establish or to corroborate the document which you are using as evidence because now you are suborning me to Ignace Bagilishema, when you are trying to corroborate this with AMB's testimony, I was telling you that you missed a chance of corroborating it, Mr. Prosecutor, because the incident, the relevant incident, took place in Mushubati, and Mushubati is in the valley.  If you wish, go to -- the Chamber should go there.  You will see where Mushubati is found with respect to the Rutsiro hill, with respect to the crater area or the Mabanza commune or even to Karongi.  You will see that there is no relationship.  

So what AMB talked about is an incident in an area which has nothing to do with what you want to corroborate in Bagilishema's letter.  That is all I'm trying to explain to you.  Everything else, you know, is deductions which you are making and which I'm sure you will be able to make in your final remarks, but those are the facts.  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you will recall that when you testified in the Bagosora trial as a Defence witness for Anatole Nsengiyumva, you were asked a question in cross-examination.  The Prosecutor in that case asked you about a statement that she had.  She identified it by K number.  She didn't identify the maker of the statement by name.  We can call him Benson, which is his first name.  And the K number for the statement, which you will see in the transcripts from your testimony in the Bagosora trial, is K0278523.  

When she asked you the question two years ago, you refused to answer because you wanted to address the issue in your own trial.  So now you have that opportunity, Mr. Karemera.  She put it to you that in the month of May and June, according to this witness, he says, "We often received reinforcement from the Interahamwe and soldiers from Gisenyi.  Their uniforms were the same as those of the Interahamwe and soldiers from Kibuye.  I recognised the Interahamwe from Gisenyi by their songs.  I recognised the soldiers from Gisenyi by their accent, Kigoyi.  Also, on several occasions Sindikubwabo mentioned that he had come with soldiers from Gisenyi or that he was to come with soldiers from Gisenyi.  I know that in Bisesero, while defending themselves, the Tutsi killed some soldiers from Gisenyi."  

Now, you didn't answer that question a couple years ago.  What do you have to say now?  
A.	Yes, there's a lot of things I have to say, firstly, that Benson was on your witness list.  Why didn't you have him appear?  I was expecting that you would bring him before the Court so that I would ask him how he could dare, Mr. Prosecutor, state that -- that while waiting -- so by hearing a military -- a soldier speak with a Kigoyi accent, he was sure that that soldier was in the Gisenyi military barracks.  It is an aberration.  

The national army had soldiers from all over Rwanda.  Whether they spoke Kigoyi or Kinyanduga or they spoke Gicyiga, they were recruited and were found in the army, and they were transferred.  So it could be -- have been a soldier who was found in Kibuye who had been transferred to the 
gendarmerie -- Jabo's gendarmerie group but who was a native from the Nyamyumba commune because the Nyamyumba commune is in Kigoyi itself -- Kigoyi itself.  The people who speak in -- who spoke in Kigoyi, red -- blue-blooded Kigoyi, original Kigoyi, you find them in Nyamyumba.  You have a youth from the Nyamyumba commune who was recruited in an army and who was transferred to the Presidential Guard.  You do not send him to Gisenyi because he speaks Kigoyi.  I mean that should be understandable to you.  

So Benson, who is not as intelligent as you are, thought that he could identify people who had come from Gisenyi and Mabuye -- and AMB, because they could hear them speak with a Kigoyi accent.  That is -- it is laughable.  That is ridiculous, Mr. Witness (sic).  But Benson was your witness.  You didn't have him appear.  You didn't hand over that document to me.  If you gave it to me, I wouldn't have turned it up.  It is because you believed that it was not important.  So let us carry on with the next question.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Karemera, on the issue of Nsengiyumva and the Bagosora trial, no doubt you are aware that Trial Chamber I convicted Anatole Nsengiyumva on the basis of the same evidence that the Prosecution was -- or similar evidence that the Prosecution has introduced against you in this case, specifically concerning the dispatch of militiamen from Gisenyi to Bisesero after you sent your letter of the 18th of June to Colonel Nsengiyumva.  

In fact, if you look at the Bagosora judgement, which I'm sure you've done already, at paragraphs 1823 and 1824, ending with paragraph 1824, you would see that Trial Chamber I dealt with the same defences that you are raising now when Nsengiyumva raised them in his trial.  Colonel Nsengiyumva claimed that there was improper procedure in giving him an order, which is something --  the same reasoning that you have adopted.  He claimed that there was never an attack, that he never sent soldiers and militiamen to Gisenyi.  

And Trial Chamber I discounted his evidence.  They refer to the same correspondence that we've reviewed today -- Kayishema's letter to you, his telegram to the ministry of defence, your meeting and the notes of your meeting from the interim government meeting on the 17th of June, your letter of the 18th of June to Colonel Nsengiyumva, your letter of the 20th of June to Kayishema, and the testimony of other witnesses who claim that they were part of the crew of militia that travelled from Gisenyi to Bisesero to attack the Tutsi.
A.	What is the question?
Q.	Why should this Court, listening to you now, assess that evidence any differently? 
MR. SOW:  
Please, Witness.

Mr. President, I believe that that question shouldn't be posed.  I mean this is not the time for assessment for now.  We are listening to the witness, and I believe that even the grounds are baseless.  Is Mr. Édouard Karemera accused of having sent militia from Gisenyi?  Is that what is being -- he is accused of in the indictment?  The grounds -- there are absolutely no grounds, and I don't believe that a groundless hypothesis should be used against the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Does the Chamber have a ruling on the Defence objection?  I take it that I should rephrase the question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You are really inviting him to address evaluation of the testimony, which really is a matter for argument at the close of the case.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, I'm going to read you the factual finding of Trial Chamber I in regard to Anatole Nsengiyumva at paragraph 1824 of its judgement.  It states, "The Chamber finds it established beyond reasonable doubt" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel for the Prosecution read at a slower pace, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  

"The Chamber finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that in the second half of June, Nsengiyumva sent militiamen from Gisenyi préfecture to participate in an operation in Bisesero to kill Tutsis in Kibuye préfecture on orders of the government.  As an operational commander of a neighbouring secteur, he was aware that the RPF was not in the area and that the attack was directed at civilians." 

What do you have to say about that?
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President --
THE WITNESS:
I'm going to answer.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I wonder now what trial we are in.  Is it the trial of the other Chamber who ruled in the Bagosora trial?  Are we here as an Appeals Chamber?  And is Mr. Karemera asked to engage in an assessment of the relevance of a decision that is under appeal?  I don't think that is serious, Mr. President. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, Counsel Weyl has anticipated on what I wished to say.  I was merely wondering about the usefulness of this line of questioning by Counsel for the Prosecution, it being understood that the Bagosora case is on appeal.  So this is not an adjudicated fact, the Bagosora judgement.  It is on appeal.  So while it is on appeal, we are losing our voices over the Bagosora trial in the first instance.  I'm wondering whether this line of questioning is indeed relevant.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know Mr. Karemera should not advise himself, although he is a distinguished lawyer.  But at the same time, he's expressed his desire to answer the question, and I think we should allow him to do it.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I, indeed, observed that the factual findings in the first instance are not considered as adjudicated facts.  But the comment I wish to make, in addition to the objections raised by the 
	Defence Counsel, is as follows:  Can Counsel for the Prosecution indicate to the Trial Chamber which witness in the Nsengiyumva case was called to testify in my case, since he is saying that I should not expect the Trial Chamber to enter a judgement of acquittal in my favour?  Your Trial Chamber, Mr. President, since the Trial Chamber in the Nsengiyumva case convicted him on the basis of the same evidence, documentary evidence, I do not know to what extent Nsengiyumva provided the same explanations as I did.  He was not in a position to do that because he was not the author of such letters.  
I believe I have been able to demonstrate, Counsel for the Prosecution -- or, rather, determine the circumstances under which such letters were drafted, letters that I have signed.  Anatole Nsengiyumva has not done that, and he didn't have to provide explanations on the letters.  As for the factual witnesses, you did not call any of the witnesses that were called by the Prosecutor against Nsengiyumva.  None of them have come here as Prosecution witnesses.  And you know that AMB, who was on your list, was not called to testify in the Nsengiyumva case.  So what are you talking about?  

The Trial Chamber will have to assess the evidence you have adduced here.  I assume that the Trial Chamber is not going to assess evidence adduced in the Nsengiyumva case, especially since, in the meantime -- if, in the meantime, Nsengiyumva was acquitted and there were -- was no evidence against him for those allegations.  

Last observation, Counsel for the Prosecution, the militiamen you are referring to.  Well, the government never asked Anatole Nsengiyumva to send militiamen, and that is what Counsel Sow was reminding you of, and you are forgetting your indictment.  In my letter dated 18th -- of the 18th, I was not referring to any militiamen.  I am not Kayishema.  I forwarded the order of the government to Anatole Nsengiyumva -- that was by mistake -- to conduct  cleanup operations with soldiers, and you are talking about militiamen.  So we are not talking about the same thing.  

If Nsengiyumva was convicted for having sent militiamen there, well, that is his problem.  But he was not asked to send militiamen there, but I do know that that was not what he did.  He didn't even send soldiers when he was being asked to send soldiers.  So he didn't send anyone.  Your witness, AMB, who was driving the vehicle carrying the militiamen, because they were not soldiers, claimed that there were two soldiers in front who were with them throughout the killings in which he participated in Gisenyi for a month.  When Counsel Diagne asked him what was the name of the two soldiers, you remember what your witness answered.  He did not know their names, in spite of the fact that he had spent two months with them.  

Counsel Webster, is this serious, to bring a witness who comes to state before this Honourable Trial Chamber that he spent two months taking two Gisenyi soldiers and that they travelled together from Bisesero -- two soldiers, not 100.  We're not asking him for a hundred names -- and he doesn't know how those two soldiers are called, and you want me to believe you?  I hope the Trial Chamber will not believe you -- or, rather, I am convinced that the Trial Chamber cannot follow you on this matter.  It cannot, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think it's time for the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our mid afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1540H to 1600H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Karemera, we left off with your comments on the Bagosora judgement, and we are going to pick up there and move on.  And I will repeat the last line of the sentence -- excuse me, -- the last line of the paragraph that I read to you earlier, which is -- and this is Trial Chamber I speaking -- "As an operational commander of a neighbouring secteur, he," referring to Nsengiyumva, "was aware that the RPF was not in the area and the attack was directed at civilians."  

	And what I suggest to you, Mr. Karemera, is that you knew the same thing.  You have manufactured a defence of there being RPF brigades and combatants in Bisesero when you, as well as Nsengiyumva and Prime Minister Kambanda and President Sindikubwabo, all knew that the only people being attacked in Bisesero were civilians, were non-combatants, were Tutsi.  And the Hutu that were there were not fighting the FAR.  These were all civilians who you characterised as accomplices so that you could get people to commit genocide against them.  

What do you have to say? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  I would like to remind you that Kanyarengwe, Alexis, was the president of the RPF and Kanyarengwe is a Hutu.  I would also like you to note that Seth Sendashonga was a member of the steering committee of the RPF, and he was a Hutu.  Biseruka was a Hutu.  And Polisi Denis is a Tutsi.  Rwigara, Assinapol, is a Tutsi.  And those are the four people specifically who -- Kanyarengwe, who was minister of the interior for a long time before fleeing Rwanda; Seth Sendashonga was native from the Rwamatuma commune; Biseruka, who was the commander of the Kibuye military camp; and Rwigara, who is a native of the Rwamatamu commune, and were four personalities who were leaders of the RPF who had decided, even before they revived hostilities, to set up a protection area to rally their supporters and infiltrators in the enemy area.  

You are not a soldier.  Neither am I.  But soldiers, when they do not expect what happened to us, when they are unable to foresee, as Kagame was able to foresee, they had foreseen that  -- Sendashonga, Rwigara, Assinapol and others had foreseen that when the time came, reinforcements would be provided to units that were present in Bisesero.  And Kagame opposed that, and Kagame ordered that the priority was not to go and save the RPF supporters where they were being killed, as you claim, that the priority was to take over power.  
So we're not referring to the same thing.  You are -- you can try to convince me, but you can't let me know that these people used Radio Muhabura.  Your witness said that people came from all over to find themselves in Bisesero.  Tell me why they were going there.  Tell me why they were going there.  Because, as Witness late Des Forges -- you had witnesses who could fight with sticks, and they were going to ensure their protection.  That's why they were going there.  

Now, tell me why, since April up to July, they fought against the attackers.  Because I mean there were attackers.  I do recognise the fact that they would have fought those attackers and that they fought those attackers until the arrival of the French.  Tell me things you do know, although you didn't state.  Of course you know Sakufi because the Prosecutor has that file.  The Prosecutor has that file, which was disclosed to -- disclosed.  

Sakufi testified before the Swiss judge.  I don't remember the name, but I hope that my counsel will be able to disclose that document to you, and it comes from you.  Sakufi said that in Bisesero there were 500 armed combatants.  That all goes to show that what you're saying -- I mean you have to say it, but it is not useful.  And what I am saying are based on facts, factual evidence and things witnessed and things I learnt about because I was in the area.  

Bisesero you could not cross from Mubuga, which you know where it is, to go to Gisovu.  It was impossible.  You could not go from Gishyita, which is found 4 kilometres from Mubuga, to go up to Kucyapa.  Kucyapa, I know where it is.  Kucyapa is on the border between 
Gishyita and Gisovu communes.  There was no way.  And all of that is the reality.  

So the war, you define it differently from us.  Guerrilla warfare, you don't want to talk about it.  Witnesses who came and claimed that he came Gitabura -- let me tell you something and end it.  AMN is a witness left Gitabura when his tutor -- his tutor told him that, "Listen, if you stay here -- because there's one of us who came from Ruhengeri and who had been relieved at the centre at 
Kanyarengwe" -- if the counsel wants to check it, they can.  We are going to disclose it -- the person asked him, "If you don't want to die, you have to go and meet the others.  You have -- if you don't want to be killed, you have to join the others in Bisesero and resist with them."  

Now, what I'm asking -- what you are referring to as a combatant, that is not a combatant.  He was released at the same time as Lizinde, Biseruka, Muvunanyambo and others by the RPF.  He returned to his home in Gitabura.  He was in hiding.  The war started again, and he is the first person to say that, "Instead of staying here, it is better for us to go to Bisesero to meet the other people."  And you have Sakufi, who said that there were 500 people.  And you have AMN, who was a witness, Mr. Prosecutor.  And AMN, you know what he said.  He stated that "Musema, we nearly took him.  We were chasing him, although he was armed and was in the company of soldiers."  You were running after somebody who was armed, and you could even get him, and you're telling me that that person was not a fighter, a combatant.  So I don't know how -- what the definition of combatant is.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Karemera, no doubt you are well aware there are at least five or six judgments in this Tribunal which have established that thousands of civilians, Tutsi civilians, were attacked and killed in Kibuye during the period April to July of 1994.  

	There is the judgement in Ntakirutimana concerning Mugonero; there is the judgement in Seromba concerning the church at Nyange; there is the judgement in Kayishema concerning the attacks in Bisesero; there is the judgement in Muhimana again concerning Kibuye; there is the judgement in Niyitegeka, genocide in Kibuye, in Bisesero; there's the judgement in Ndindabahizi, genocide in Bisesero, thousands upon thousands of defenseless men, women, children killed, at least five or six different cases, most of which have been judged on appeal, some of which provide us with adjudicated facts in this case.  

Is it your testimony to this Tribunal that you're the only one that knows the truth, that you're the only one that can convince this Chamber that all of those people were killed because they were RPF brigades and combatants?
A.	But your hypothesis is -- your argument is, "Why are you not doing that in order to be condemned?"  Is that what you're asking me to do?  You are saying, "Why don't you do like Ntakirutimana, Seromba, Muhimana, Niyitegeka and Ndindabahizi in order to be condemned?"  

Mr. Prosecutor, I am telling you Ndindabahizi wrote to Judge Møse, who condemned him -- who convicted him.  Did you read the letter?  Niyitegeka's case is being revised because he doesn't agree.  But you know as well as you're asking me to comment on the way they defended themselves -- you know that Niyitegeka, Éliezer, the minister of information and government spokesperson, did not testify in his case.  You know that, Witness (sic).  And -- you know that, Mr. Prosecutor.  And you compare me with him.  Why?  You know that Niyitegeka believes, although he didn't say anything before the Chamber -- come on, Prosecutor.  I was not the lawyer.  I was not an investigator.  I did not prepare the file.  But I trust.  

Mr. President, I am confident because those are not the people I am defending.  It is not a revision I am asking for Ntakirutimana.  I am dealing with the baseless indictment of the Prosecutors against me, and I have shown, demonstrated that.  

Mr. Prosecutor, allow me to carry my response to the end because you're the one who has raised this reaction.  All of these gentlemen, all of these people, did not say things as they happened, and that is likely why they were convicted.  And I am telling you things -- there were things that happened and things that I know I am telling you, and my credibility is not in doubt by the Trial Chamber.  You are the one who is suggesting that I should not be believed.  
Q.	Are you denying that thousands upon thousands of Tutsi civilians, noncombatants, were killed on the 15th and the 16th and the 14th of May 1994?  Are you suggesting to this Chamber that that did not happen?  Put aside whether all of these four or five or six people were rightly convicted or wrongly convicted.  My question to you is are you denying that thousands of Tutsi civilians were killed in mid-May in Bisesero? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you cannot carry on in that manner.  Now you are behaving like your witness.  You know what is written in the indictment.  It is on the 13th of May.  Now, the 13th of May, you have raised it.  I told you where I was.  And you are the one who gave me the evidence.  On the 14th -- 
Q.	The issue is not mid-May, whether it be the 12th, the 13th, the 14th, the 15th, the 16th, mid-May 1994.  Thousands of people killed in sustained attacks, as established by adjudicated fact number 85 in our case drawn from the Kayishema judgement.  Independent of whether Kayishema is responsible or not, are you denying that thousands of people were killed in mid-May in Bisesero, Tutsi civilians, Hutu civilians, none of them combatants?  That's my question to you.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let me answer you.  I will state that I'm the last or maybe the last but one, Defence witness.  Now you are changing things.  Why are you changing?  You are changing the indictment to state that it's not the 13th of May.  It is mid-May on the whole.  Mid-May is from which date to which date?  Otherwise -- people were killed in Bisesero.  And I, indeed, asked a minute of silence.  People who were killed there were part of the victims of the Rwandan tragedy, which I deplore.  I'm not saying people were not killing there.  What I continue to challenge is that you have a selective presentation, because I have always told you about recruitment made by Hutu among Hutus and Tutsis.  So in Bisesero you had both Hutu and Tutsi.  You had attacks from out of Bisesero, but you have counterattacks.  And, indeed, many people died.  Of course, I don't argue that.  

If you want us to talk about figures, since you are talking about thousands, let -- I also challenge what you are saying because, Mr. Prosecutor, you need to know that the current government of Rwanda does not want that count to be made because the first attempt to count those victims demonstrated with names in dictionaries known as genocide.  This was not a count.  These are actually names -- names, first names, father, occupation.  The total in Kibuye was 59,000, a little -- a little much than 59,000.  I went and noticed it.  They were supplanted, and they stopped this, though it was supposed to cover the entire country.  If you don't know that, then let me tell you that is what happened.  Cross-check and you will see that is what happened. 
Q.	And these tens of thousands of Tutsi civilians, noncombatants, that were killed in mid-May in Bisesero is exactly what Sindikubwabo was talking about when he met with Kayishema along with Agnès Ntamabyaliro on the 16th of May.
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  I'm -- I am not going to ask you the same question.  But Sindikubwabo, you know where he was killed, and you know who killed him.  Otherwise, maybe I should ask him to ask his descendents about who killed him and when he was killed.  So I don't feel I should be answering in view and place of Sindikubwabo because he was the one you have quoted speeches.  Give me a speech, and maybe I can comment on it with you; but otherwise, while waiting, I don't know what he said.  I don't know what he said.  On the 16th of May I don't know what he said because I was not even there, and you are locating me there. 
Q.	Did you not hear it over the radio on the 17th of May when it was broadcast and again on the 
	18th of May when his interview was broadcast?  
A.	When did you say it was broadcast?
Q.	Rebroadcast on the 17th of May, and it was again rebroadcast on the 18th of May.  Did you not hear it on those two occasions or either one of those two occasions? 
A.	Not at all.  I didn't hear it.  And when did you hear about this?  
Q.	But you were present at the meeting on the 17th of June with Sindikubwabo, were you not? 
A.	On 17th May. 
Q.	17th of June.  
A.	17th June, yes.  Yeah. 
Q.	Let's have a look at what Sindikubwabo was saying on the 16th of May when he was interviewed or giving a speech at the préfecture office in Kibuye.  If we could turn to document N1, and I believe it's N2 in the French.  And for the English text, if we could look at the page that ends in K number 106, which in the French text is page 5, or at the top it's a K number ending in 517.
A.	Excuse me.  What did you say was the page number?  Page 5?  
Q.	It's page 5 or the page that bears K number ending in 4517.
A.	515.  
Q.	Turn the page over, and you will see the following page 517.  
A.	Okay.  I got it.  Okay. 
Q.	And in English it's the K number ending in 106, 2106.  Bearing in mind that just two or three days before there were massive attacks in Bisesero killing tens and thousands of people and, according to adjudicated fact number 85 coming from the Kayishema judgement, that these were the most extensive attacks in Kibuye or in Bisesero during the genocide, this is what Sindikubwabo has to say about it.  First Préfet Kayishema speaks, Kayishema, who has been convicted for ordering and participating in those attacks, and then Sindikubwabo starts to speak, and he says --
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, quite frankly, I can't follow any longer because Mr. Webster asked the question a while ago, "You were present at the meeting on the 17th of June with President Sindikubwabo; 
	is that correct? 

Mr. Sindikubwabo (sic) answered, "17 May?"  Webster -- Mr. Webster insisted on 17 June.  And now we are talking about a document which seems to be a transcript of Radio Rwanda 17 May.   Now, are we talking about the 17th May or 17th June?  
MR. WEBSTER:
For Mr. Weyl's benefit, my suggestion to the witness was that he had communicated with President Sindikubwabo on the 17th of June when they were both present for the meeting of the interim government in Gisenyi.  

But prior to that, President Sindikubwabo, on the 16th of May, made a speech that was broadcast on the radio the following day and then again the day after that.  So now we're looking at Sindikubwabo's speech from the 16th of May.  And he speaks after Kayishema has already addressed those persons who were present.  And Sindikubwabo says, "After the speech just made by the préfet in which he briefly described the situation in Kibuye, we would be tempted to stop there and say nothing more, except that it would not be correct on our part, since we have brought you a long message.  You have just said that the security situation in Kibuye is good, and that greatly delights me, for that exactly is the purpose of our visit.  We have come here because of that problem, to ask you if a climate of security reigns here and, if that is not the case, to ask you what the reasons are and what measures you have taken to bring back security.  He," referring to the préfet, "has just stated that the security situation is good.  Our visit is, therefore, useful for we have achieved what we are looking for."  

But then he goes on, and this is the interesting portion of what he has to say:  "But we need to consider together why security reigns in Kibuye préfecture while that is not the case in some parts of Rwanda.  That would be very useful for us.  It would be useful for all Rwandans listening to the radio, especially those who have not been lucky like you, those whose security situation remains precarious.

"Yes.  That will make us very happy because you would be a good example for the other Rwandans who have not yet well understood our objective, who have heard but who said no, who said they were not concerned.  That would be very useful because you would then serve as an example, and the fact that you are enjoying good security would be a lesson for the others who are not in the same situation."

1630H 
BY MR. WEBSTER (continued): 
Q.	Now, Mr. Karemera, having heard that, even if it's for the first time in this courtroom, wouldn't that statement by President Sindikubwabo on the 16th of May, just days after these massive attacks in Bisesero, led by Préfet Clément Kayishema, not suggest to you, or any reasonable observer, that is what President Sindikubwabo was talking about of the attacks against the civilian Tutsi population in Bisesero?  What do you think he means by talking of security, based on what he has said in those 
	three paragraphs? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, the indictment against me placed me in that meeting.  Now you are conceding that I was not there.  And I wish for you to also concede, as I said earlier on, that I did not hear that speech over the radio, because I did not spend my whole time listening to the radio.  Those were difficult times.  So I did not hear that speech pronounced by President Sindikubwabo.  But I wish to assure you that I did not wait until today to read it.  But I have no comments to make on the motivations of Sindikubwabo or of Clément Kayishema when he made a report on the situation as he had experienced it.  I do not see why I should follow you in your inferences.  But I understand that you would make such inferences and draw conclusions that would be in favour of your theory.  That is understood. 

	 But let me assure you that there's no coded language here.  If you believe that there is, you should refer to the original because this is also a translation.  Sindikubwabo probably spoke in Kinyarwanda because he was addressing Rwandans.  And he would usually rather speak in Kinyarwanda, but since I was not there and since I did not listen to the speech when it was being broadcast, I cannot state so with certainty.  He might have spoken in French, but I do not have any comment other than the one I just made. 
Q.	Let's go to the next page in the English text.  Page 4 for the English text and page 5 -- excuse 
	me -- page 7 at the bottom of the page for the French text.  And I am starting with the words, "According to reports".  It's at the bottom of the page for the English, because Sindikubwabo speaks at great length. 
A.	I am with you.  I follow you.
Q.	And he says, "According to reports reaching us, and from what we observe ourselves, in some regions of Rwanda, this objective has not yet been achieved.  We came worried, thinking that some people in Kibuye might be indifferent or recalcitrant.  We are happy to learn from the préfet that there are no such people here.  That is why we would like to tell you that we commend you, for you have just scored a point compared to the others who have not yet understood what the government wants."  And that statement is followed by applause -- congratulations, applause. 

	Now, you made a reference to coded language.  And what I suggest to you, Mr. Karemera, is that there's nothing coded about his language.  His language is quite direct.  And the language he uses here has a straight line of continuity to the language he used on the 19th of April in Butare, when he criticised the citizens of Butare for not being involved, for not becoming aware of what the government expected of them.  And after that speech the killings started in Butare.  And here he is in Kibuye, a month later, congratulating the people of Kibuye for understanding what other people in Rwanda had not yet understood, because they succeeded in conducting massive attacks just two or three days prior to his arrival.  So that's what I suggest to you.  What do you have to say? 
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, I did not say that it was coded language.  I said that it was not coded language.  So do not put words into my mouth.  So we agree that there's no coded language used here.  And this is probably why I said that if you had taken the text in Kinyarwanda, it would have been even more clear.  I did not say that there was any coded language, on the contrary.  You will understand 
	as -- you won't understand, because you have a selective approach.  

	Let me read the previous paragraph to the one you just read.  "By God's grace, we have been able to thwart their plan by putting in place a government that immediately sets itself three objectives that you already know.  The most important of these objectives is to put a stable government in place in a country, restore security of persons and property and restore law and order throughout the country.  This is the most important objective on which all the others depend.  Five weeks after this government has been -- was put in place we wonder if these objectives have been accepted, understood and implemented in the same manner in the country."  

	President Sindikubwabo was in Kibuye.  I was not in Kibuye.  President Sindikubwabo had 
	just listened to Préfet Kayishema.  I did not hear what Préfet Kayishema had just said in his 
	report to the president.  Préfet Kayishema probably talked about the situation of calm throughout the prefecture, according to your inferences, and I share them.  But Préfet Kayishema had certainly not told President Sindikubwabo that there were no problems in Bisesero.  I doubt that because even your witnesses who were not aware of that or who had been briefed by Eric Nzabihimana -- spelt N-Z-A-B-I-H-I-M-A-N-A.  

Eric Nzabihimana, Counsel for the Prosecution, he was a Prosecution witness on your list.  He did not come to the stand.  He was bourgmestre of the Itabire district, which is in my native area, the district of which your colleague, Mr. N'dow, went to take pictures of our Defence witness's place.  And he indicated on the sketch where Itabire headquarters was.  And Nzabihimana was the mayor when he went to recruit the four witnesses you called to testify against me.  They all, at least three out of the four, gave his address to your investigators.  And I wish to add that Nzabihimana, a member of Ibuka, is the one who coached them.  And he told them what they were to say in order to be rewarded correctly upon their return.  But Nzabihimana himself had made a mistake because he had assumed that Karemera could not have been in Kibuye when President Sindikubwabo came to Kibuye.  He said, "You are going to -- he told them, "You are going to testify."  But after President Sindikubwabo's visit, Karemera, Munyampundu and Kayishema came to pacify.  So you know all that.  

	Kayishema could not have told President Sindikubwabo that there were no problems in Bisesero.  But since I was not there, I cannot confirm what was said.  But I am convinced that he said -- and that is only normal that in light of the situation he had experienced in April, in May 1994, the préfecture was relatively calm.  Even on the 3rd of May when we went there, the killings had, indeed, stopped.  So he could not say that there were killings when there were none.  But when saying so -- I am not saying that there were no killings in Kibuye.  But I wish for you to understand me and understand that, since I was not in attendance at that meeting, I cannot share your deductions. Since the text is clear, I read and I can understand it as it is written.  You read it and you understand it in a different manner, and you want me to agree with you.  I cannot agree with you. 
Q.	And my suggestion to you, Mr. Karemera, is that any reasonable person can read this text in the context of the events and understand exactly what Sindikubwabo was saying.  He was informing the population that they had done right because they had succeeded in restoring security, which in his view -- which was also the view of the interim government and yourself.  Restoring security meant killing, exterminating, committing genocide against the Tutsi.  And it's clear.  In fact, when you make reference to the 3rd of May and suggest that there were no killings taking place, then you should know that that's false because during that very meeting, the children at the hospital right down the road were being killed, the same children that Dr. Hitimana spoke about when you were present in the room on the 3rd of May at the préfecture office.  Sindikubwabo in this speech on the 16th May is not only referring to what Préfet Kayishema told -- he says in his speech, based on what he could see in Kibuye town, in the préfecture hall, right down the road from Gatwaro stadium and Home Saint-Jean, where 20,000 people had been killed earlier that month.  Wouldn't it have been obvious to anyone in Kibuye town that thousands of Tutsi had been killed for no other reason than being Tutsi? 
A.	But, Counsel for the Prosecution, President Sindikubwabo is reminding everyone of the government programme.  Where did you find in this programme any plan to kill the Tutsi?  There's none.  It is your own fiction because you are the Prosecutor.  You have fabricated this whole story.  But the governmental programme referred to by President Sindikubwabo is the program that has 
	three objectives, and it has nothing to do with the genocide that you are talking about.  So if you deem that Sindikubwabo was unreasonable, well, that is your opinion.  But he was unreasonable when he stated what he said.  Well, he has to take responsibility for that. 

I am an accused person before this Tribunal, and I am being charged with having participated in this meeting.  Now you have conceded that I was not there.  Let us move on to the next question then. 

	 Let us let Sindikubwabo rest in peace.  I believe his death was punishment enough.  You cannot prosecute the dead.  And Sindikubwabo knows the circumstances of his death, and you know it or at least you can guess it.  And he was the president.  He was not just anybody. 
Q.	Let's reflect for a moment on the factual findings on several cases that have already gone to appeal, 
	all of these in regard to the meeting of the 3rd of May, in which you participated.  In the 
	Niyitegeka judgement at paragraph 251, factual findings where the Court states:  "This 
	meeting" -- referring to the meeting of the 3rd of May -- "Was called extensively for pacification purposes.  However, the killings and deteriorating security situation in Kibuye were not condemned.  At the meeting the prime minister, Jean Kambanda, referred to Tutsis as Inkotanyi and accomplices, and asked for the crowd to be vigilant against them as they were the enemy.  He also said that they had infiltrators everywhere in the country who had to be looted out.  He denounced the previous government as being made up of Inkotanyi accomplices."

	Listen to what the Trial Chamber in the Ndindabahizi said.  Referring to a defence witness again, "The witness explained that this term could have been understood either to refer to armed partisans of the RPF or to Tutsi in general, including civilians.  These speakers refer to Inkotanyi in Bisesero and Gishyita even though there were no RPF forces in these areas.  Witness DN, inferred that these speakers were extremists who were calling for the killings of Tutsi civilians.  

	And this is on paragraph 73 of the Ndindabahizi judgement.  Listen to paragraph 86 of that same judgement.  

"Niyitegeka, Witness DN was found to be a credible witness in relation to his description of the speeches made at the 3rd May meeting in Kibuye.  In particular, his understanding of the words 'Inkotany', 'accomplice', 'an enemy', as used by Prime Minister Kambanda and Éliezer Niyitegeka, were not intended to refer to armed RPF militants but rather to the Tutsi population in general was found to be credible."

That's the basis or that's part of the basis for the Chamber's conviction of both Niyitegeka and Ndindabahizi.  This meeting on the 3rd of May that you attended and in which you spoke where the government authorities deliberately and purposefully communicated to all in attendance that Tutsis should be considered accomplices of the enemy or the enemy and should be attacked and killed for that reason, what do you have to say about that? 
A.	Counsel for Prosecution, first of all, I wish to remind you, because you are aware of it, but it was not you who were making decisions.  You could not hope, Counsel for the Prosecution, because you know that the Trial Chamber before which I am appealing is not bound by previous decisions or previous rulings by other Trial Chambers.  You know that.  But later on you are going to say that I am wasting your time.  You are the one wasting your time.  You had these facts adjudicated.  They are in the case files.  I do not see why you are wasting our time when putting -- when producing such findings to me in cases in which I did not participate.  

But I wish to respond to you that the time has come for me, Counsel for the Prosecution, to kindly ask you to take the initiative, to take it upon yourself to withdraw -- to withdraw, because that is the only word that can be used, the document you had admitted into evidence through your colleague, Morley, while misleading the parties.  Because what you are saying here from Niyitegeka or Ndindabahizi and what was said in the meeting of the 3rd of May, as you well know, was recorded.  And you know that your learned colleague, Counsel Morley, rather than bringing the authentic and incredible transcribed document on the basis of the recordings, brought a report that was called "minutes" by a layman called Bugingo, who went to primary school for two years and who doesn't know what the difference between a report and minutes is.  And I remember having noted that.  And on that basis he tried to interview your witness who became an expert witness, GK.  You know it.  You know that this is not credible.  

What Éliezer Niyitegeka said -- what Ndindabahizi said during that meeting on the 3rd of May has been recorded.  It was transcribed.  When your colleagues from the Prosecution who were on the Niyitegeka case tried to have accepted what you are repeating now, they were not successful with regard to the meeting on the 3rd of May, neither in the Niyitegeka trial nor in the Ndindabahizi. 

So I am here now and I am answering your questions.  Why don't you produce what I stated?  And you are producing what was returned, which was challenged by Ndindabahizi and which was not by Niyitegeka because he did not have the courage to testify in his own case but that he is challenging now because this is being revealed.  Why?  Bring the document.  Take my statement and I will tell you that your witness who did not come, Dr. Hitimana Leonard asked Murego, and asked Éliezer and Kambanda why the MDR did not convey the same message to its supporters like the one by 
Mr. Karemera, Édouard, to supporters of the MRND.  He put that question.  So this is what is at hand.  And what you are doing is simply misleading and you should not shy away from the real matter at hand and hope that you will have me convicted because you have admitted into evidence through a rule of -- through the Rules of Procedure facts for which I have not been mentioned since you are saying that there's a national conspiracy.

Let me tell you, Counsel for the Prosecution, that at the national level I was the vice-president of the MRND.  I was, from the 25th of May, minister of interior.  Why, why are you producing what others have done and you don't have anything that I would have done and which might constitute a criminal act?  You have nothing and you are not acknowledging that fact.  

	And this is helpful to me, Counsel for the Prosecution, because I, Karemera, have been blamed by you for not having resigned from the government.  I told you why I did not resign.  I told you that I have no specific ambition because I had been a minister for eight years and an important minister, for that matter, since I had been a minister at the president's office for seven years and also minister for civil service.  

	So I was not running after any advantages derived from my post as minister of the interior.  And if I became a minister on the 25th of May it's because the party asked me to do so after Munyanziza kindly declined, even though if there was, indeed, a planning of the genocide, he must have planned it because he was minister of the interior since 1991, but he did not plan anything.  And I, Karemera, who became a member of the government on the 25th of May -- you are saying that I must be held responsible for this planning, because what you are looking for is to demonstrate that there was a joint criminal enterprise or conspiracy. 

	Honestly, Counsel for the Prosecution, if you don't have questions to put to me, just say that this marks the end of your examination, and then we can go on to the redirect.  But you have other documents because I still have documents that you have disclosed.  But I would have liked us to ask you to discuss on the basis of documents.  Bring me my statement on the 3rd of May and put questions to me on that statement for me to be able to explain to the honourable Judges what I did, why I did it and why I considered that it is in no way a criminal act.  But do not tell me that at the time when the others were fleeing you tried to stay with your compatriots.  No, I cannot be blamed for the fact of having been faithful to the ideal.  What was that ideal?  Our objective was to go to the elections.  

	And today, as 15 years ago, I am convinced that if we had been able to hold elections, there wouldn't have been any deaths, and even if we would not have won the elections -- if we had lost those elections, we would have become members of the opposition and we would have waited for the next elections to come back to power.  That was what I didn't want.  And no one in the opposition can challenge that.  I was for the sharing of power within a democratic framework.  And when we had to find solutions in an emergency situation, I was an advocate of this and for the government to restore peace, negotiate with the RPF and come to the assistance of the displaced population.  I shared on the map what the situation was regarding the population when I became minister of the interior.  That was the reason for which I became a member of the government.  And this is what I need to provide explanations on.  

	But when I am being asked to explain why Niyitegeka was convicted, I believe it was because he was not able to defend himself correctly; you wouldn't be convinced.  But that is the situation.  I am telling you that Éliezer Niyitegeka, who was the spokesperson for the government throughout these 
	three months, did not say anything during his trial.  He did not say anything.

1700H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Karemera, thank you once again for that very elaborate and edifying response.  

But what I suggest to you is the reason that you are sitting in the dock right now is because you were a member of a government that, instead of fighting a war with the RPF, committed genocide against the Tutsi people of your country.  That's why you are on trial today.  Instead of fighting a war, you committed genocide.  That was your strategy for victory.  And you did it by what you said on the 
3rd of May.  And what you and Prime Minister Kambanda said on the 3rd of May led to the widespread killings on the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th of May.  And then President Sindikubwabo came back to Kibuye and congratulated the people for killing and attacking the Tutsi in mid-May in Bisesero.  And then you, Mr. Karemera, initiated a ratissage, a clean-up operation, to get rid of all of the remaining people that were not killed in mid-May in Bisesero.  And that was planned, there was agreement, there was conspiracy, and that's why you're being charged today.  
A.	No, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. SOW: 
Witness, please, I wish to raise an objection.  

Mr. President, I'm under the impression that counsel for the Prosecution is pleading.  We are no longer dealing with questions.  Counsel for the Prosecution can make suggestions.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I need to recall that during the disjoinder of the Rwamakuba trial, the Prosecutor claimed that this was requested because he wanted to prosecute Karemera, Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse within the framework of the party.  But today he is coming back to the reason of the Rwamakuba separate trial.  

Unfortunately, it seems that Mr. Webster often loses his memory, but he has to remember what led to the amendment of his indictment.  And if we do not want Mr. Édouard Karemera to make long -- to provide long answers, he has to be specific in his questions and in his suggestions.  

So this is not a question that was put to the witness, Mr. President, but, rather, the Prosecutor was pleading.  And this is the reason for my objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Karemera.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I wish to add to what my counsel has just said, that there was not only this separate trial with Rwamakuba, who was from the MDR, but the Prosecutor has also tried to prosecute me jointly with Niyitegeka, but this was not successful because he did not have any element that would have enabled him to put me in a joint trial with Niyitegeka.  

And earlier on I asked him what it was that I had done that might have helped convict me, and he said that it was what I said on the 3rd of May 1994.  Very well.  Bring what I said.  Let us put it before the Judges and put questions to me on what I said, but do not confuse things and mention what Sindikubwabo said on the 16th or making false reports on what Kambanda said or Niyitegeka or Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, because you know that the three of them, Eliezer and Ndindabahizi, as well as Kambanda, made speeches that were recorded.  And your colleagues who were in other trials had to produce such recordings to them.  And in my case, you are giving me an imaginary document which was fabricated off the cuff by Mukingo and Kayishema.  And you did not do that with me.  You preferred to do it through your witness GK, who all of a sudden became an expert and even a psychoanalyst, to analyse what I was saying when I made my interventions, which he was misinterpreting with 
Counsel Morley -- Counsel for the Prosecution Morley.  

Now, this is a discussion you are avoiding.  You are trying to lead us elsewhere.  You're talking about Sindikubwabo, you're talking about Kambanda when you have already given us the documents.  I would like you to tell me what Kambanda told your investigators, Pierre Duclos and the other investigator, during the one year they stayed in Dodoma.  But you know the answer I would give you.  I would tell you that for that to -- I -- my position before the renegade states that there are wrong things that Kambanda is saying, and you have to untangle these and know what the truth is.  

I will stop there in order not to abuse the patience of the Court. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And my suggestion to you is the same, Mr. Witness.  My suggestion to you is that the meeting on the 3rd of May led to the killings that took place in Bisesero in mid-May, that the things that you said and Karemera said and the other speaker said and, more importantly, the things that you did not say -- you did not condemn the killings.  You did not criticise anyone for the massive attacks in Gatwaro stadium, or in Home St. Jean, which was right down the road from where you were speaking on the 3rd of May.  And what I suggest to you is that everyone in attendance took that as a signal from you and from 
	Prime Minister Kambanda that their duty and their obligation was to go out and commit genocide, which is what they did in mid-May.  

And after that, President Sindikubwabo came back, either with you or without you, but delivering the message from your government, the government that you joined on the 25th of May.  And he told those in attendance that they understood that they were different and more successful than other Rwandans in other parts of the country who did not quite understand the government message, but they understood it because they demonstrated it by what they had done just two or three days before, attacking and killing defenceless men, women, children, the elderly, noncombatants.  And then one month later, when Préfet Kayishema realised that there was still a pocket of resistance, as he put it, he engaged you to get the power and might of the interim government behind him to remove what was an impediment, Major Jabo.  And then you ordered Colonel Nsengiyumva to conduct a clean-up operation, ratissage, to get rid of the last remaining elements, which is what he tried to do by sending militiamen into Bisesero, one of whom -- or several of whom testified in this case, about ferrying militiamen all about Bisesero, with the objective of attacking men, women and children who had nothing to do with the armed conflict with the RPF.  

That is the evidence in this case, and that is the evidence upon which you are being accused of conspiracy, planning, and commission of genocide.  So there should be no mystery.  When you challenge me and ask me what evidence is there, that's the evidence.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, we are coming back to things we've already discussed, unless you want to substitute yourself through the Trial Chamber and assess your own prosecution evidence.  Otherwise, we have already discussed all of this, and I want to put it to you that we should carry on. 
Q.	I agree.  Let's go on to something else.  Let's have a look at document S13.  It was the document that was distributed yesterday.  

You would agree, would you not, Mr. Karemera, that the RPF did not welcome the prospect of the French arriving in Rwanda in late June to conduct what they characterised as a humanitarian operation?  Wouldn't you agree?  
A.	I am sorry, I am lost.  Could you please let me know where -- is it in English only?  
Q.	The last page -- or the last two pages is an article as it appeared in Le Figaro, which is a French newspaper, on the 29th of June 1994.  And the first five or six pages are the English translation of that article.  

But before we get to the text of the article, I'm asking you a general question.  Would you agree that the RPF did not look kindly upon the French initiative to send a humanitarian operation into Rwanda in late June, Opération turquoise?  
A.	Well, I can't see how I would answer this without disappointing you, but I don't know.  Now, I believe that the RPF did not need to -- the arrival of the French soldiers for two reasons, because they were intervening for -- on humanitarian basis to save people, and RPF was set on taking over power, even if they killed people.  So, if the French intervention was going to hinder RPF taking over power, of course, RPF would not have been -- seen that favourably.  But, of course, we know that was not the goal of France.  France's goal was not to stop RPF from taking over power.  It was, indeed, to save human lives that they intervened.  
But as you well know, as I did, that though Kagame -- Kagame shed crocodile tears that Tutsi had been killed, he regrets the fact that French came to save Rwandans.  And he states that, in any event, the people who were spared by fleeing to -- who escaped by fleeing to Zaire would not escape him again when he had a chance and that he was going to kill them.  He was going to crush them.  That is what he stated, "I"-- Kinyarwanda, "I'm going to crush them."  I'm sure you heard that, because you have been to Rwanda often.  And Kagame doesn't hide his ideas.  

So when you ask me whether Kagame was in favour of the French intervention, I believe that, firstly, he was scared that the French were going to be a hindrance to his access to power through -- by using weapons and marching over millions of corpses of Hutus, Twas and Tutsis, and that when he realised that the French were not stopping him from get -- taking power, he left them alone.  

He further showed his wrath when the French had the courage not to do as your president did, to go and kneel in front of him and congratulate him because he had had Rwandans killed.  And now the French are the only people who are being tried.  I don't know before which court.  And at a certain time Kagame tried to take them before a court, but I think he has some well-known lawyers and very intelligent advisers, especially Tony Blair.  And maybe they want to create a Gacaca court to try the French, because any other court that is going to convict France for genocide in Rwanda, I can't see any such thing.  
Q.	Thank you once again for your elaborate response.  

Wouldn't you agree that from the perspective -- from your perspective -- or the perspective of the interim government, France was regarded as a friend of the interim government? 
A.	That's what we believed. 
Q.	When Opération turquoise was launched towards the end of June, you expected it to assist you, did you not? 
A.	No.  When the Opération turquoise was launched, we believed that President Mitterand had understood the suffering of the Rwandan people at the time.  But we were -- we did not know that his minister of foreign affairs and his prime minister, Édouard Balladur, wanted to take advantage of his health situation to position themselves politically.  We were mistaken about who was the decision-maker in France, because François Mitterand was a Rwandan friends, but not -- was Rwanda's friend, but Balladur was not.  And Alain Juppé, now he started -- now he is being accused alongside Rwandan Hutus, he's beginning to feel that he's a victim, just like Rwandan Hutus.  But at the time, he -- you know, when he sent -- when Édouard Balladur sent -- Édouard Balladur sent François Léotard, 
	minister of defence, to Rwanda, he was not coming to -- to set up the interim government in very comfortable situations, because François Léotard was coming for humanitarian intervention and save lives, because when he came, he sped up evacuation of wounded -- of casualties found both in Bisesero, Rutare Rwa Ndaba, Gasenyi, Cyangugu préfecture, camp de Rushishi, everywhere you had people who had been wounded who had -- were suffering, people who could not access doctors for medical treatment.  He didn't do like you did.  He didn't take Tutsis and leaving the Hutus to die.  It was a humanitarian operation.  He took everybody by helicopter, and he took them to Goma and some others to -- to the hospital that had been set up at Kamembe airport -- K-A-M-E-M-B-E, Kamembe -- in the Kamembe -- in the Kamembe commune in the Cyangugu préfecture.  The French had quickly set up a hospital, a makeshift hospital, so to speak.  And they had another makeshift hospital in Goma where they evacuated the people who had sustained injury -- all casual -- people who were injured, both Tutsi and Hutu.  Now -- including Twas.  But, even now, there were not many of them.  I wonder if there are still any of them.  

So the operation was a humanitarian operation, and we did not expect the French to come and do for us what we couldn't do -- we had not succeeded in doing ourselves.  But we thought that they were friends and they were going to understand that there was a chance of salvaging the situation.  If François Mitterand, that is, the president François Mitterand, had not been as ill as he had been, maybe he would have done something else.  But, you know, that all is history, and I'm not here to cry over spilt milk. 
Q.	Yes.  And thank you for the explanation.  But the perception remains that France was sympathetic to the interim government and hostile to the RPF, right?  
A.	But, Witness (sic), I am going to send you the document which we wrote to respond to the 
	Mucyo commission.  That way you understand what was the Rwandan perception of 
	French intervention in Rwanda.  
Q.	Looking at this article, which was written by Patrick de Saint-Exupéry, the French journalist who was on the ground with Opération turquoise when it arrived on the 24th or the 26th of June, let's start at the bottom paragraph in the English text.  I'm sorry, I can't help you with the place in the French text, but I'm going to paraphrase.  

In any case, the author starts by referring to comments from general -- the force commander 
Roméo Dallaire, who confirmed that the RPF is still determined to fight the French if they advance to the front.  So basically with that sentence, he's encapsulating the attitude of the RPF, which was not in favour of Opération turquoise because they believed it as -- to be coming to the assistance of the interim government.  

And I would suggest to you that your militiamen and your government and the authorities of the interim government also believed that the French were coming to their assistance.  And the French arrived in Kibuye around the 26th of June and conducted a reconnaissance operation in Bisesero.  And this journalist travelled with them and recorded his impressions of what was transpiring.  And what I can suggest to you -- or what I can tell you, actually, is that when you read this article -- and we'll go over bits and pieces of it -- the journalist records the shock of the French troops arriving in Bisesero and encountering genocide as opposed to the war that they led -- they were -- they were led to believe they'd find.  

And where you suggest that there were RPF clandestine brigades and combatants in Bisesero who were attacking the Hutu population, this author, sometimes going ahead of the French soldiers, sometimes following behind them, simply recorded their impressions of the devastation, of encountering mass graves, corpses of civilians, militiamen who simply talked about wanting to kill more Tutsi, and that the impression of this French journalist, who accompanied the French troops to Kibuye and then up to Bisesero, found no indicia of combatants -- or RPF combatants anywhere.  All they found was the devastation of a dishevelled, bedraggled Tutsi population or the few thousand of them that remained.  And we'll look at some of the things that this journalist records.  This is not a Prosecution investigator.  This is a French journalist following French troops that expected to find one thing and instead found another.  

So let's look at page 2 of the English. 
A.	But, Prosecutor, let me -- let some clarification before you carry on.  Would you allow me to do that, please?  
Q.	Continue.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecutor, I would like you to reassure me that this is the remaining evidence, proof.  This is not evidence.  Patrick de Saint-Exupéry, who is that?  Do you think I know him?  Do you know him?  Have you ever met him?  In 1994, what party did he support?  You say that he was following, at times he was in front, behind, as if you were there.  What newspaper was he reporting for?  These are all facts which you lawyers -- you have to -- as you say, you have to lay the grounds.  On what basis do you want me to discuss this and for what conclusions?  

You confronted me -- confronted me with the Washington Post.  You tried to challenge me with what American media presented as their versions and the responsibilities that were attributed to Bagosora.  You said those people called Bagosora, but they did not call me.  Now you're saying 
Patrick de Saint-Exupéry arrived in Kibuye, he met you, he told you such-and-such a thing.  That is what I want to confront you -- is that what you want to confront me with?  I don't know.  Maybe that is what you want to do.  But I quite -- I don't follow what you're doing.  

But I am not ready -- as with your document on the Kayishema, that piece of paper, I am not ready to discuss newspaper clippings that were written in 1994 by reporters whom I, by the way, know, with the media and propaganda efficiency of the RPF, certainly distorted the truth; reported truths, but many wrong things as well.  And I do not know Patrick de Saint-Exupéry.  I don't know for what newspaper he was reporting, which party he belonged to.  And furthermore, I don't see how his article can be evidence against me.  I would like to discuss it since you apparently have the time for such a thing, but quite sincerely, I'm surprised.  I'm surprised, Prosecutor. 
Q.	Well, let me tell you this, Mr. Karemera:  Patrick de Saint-Exupéry was a witness in the 
	Kayishema case.  This article was entered into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit No. 107 in the Kayishema case.  He testified under oath in Kayishema about his trip or his -- his time in Kibuye and in Bisesero -- in Bisesero with the French troops.  And what I can tell you about his testimony before this Tribunal and about this article that he wrote back on the 29th of June 1994 is that he does not record any observation of combatants or war or troops or clandestine brigades.  His entire testimony and this entire article consists of a description of the massacres -- or the residues of the massacres that he saw and the shock of the French troops when they saw that the only people they would encounter in Bisesero were the victims of the assaults by Interahamwe and the local authorities.  

And my suggestion to you is that if anyone was interested in making a case against the RPF and against combatants being in Bisesero, it would have been the French in 1994, when they were your allies and when they had an interest to support the interim government version of facts.  But there is nothing here that is consistent with what you describe as happening in Kibuye.  That's the point.  So respond to that. 
A.	But I wonder if you listened to my answer.  Maybe I'm going to do -- follow your example and tell you this in English.  

I told you, Mr. Prosecutor -- and let me go slowly so the interpreters can tell you exactly what I'm saying.  With respect to the French position, I told you that we were under the illusion that 
President François Mitterand, who was a friend of Rwanda, was still in control of things.  But in France, at the time it was a government -- a cohabitation government.  The president was François Mitterand, who was a socialist.  And the prime minister was Édouard Balladur from the right -- the far right.  His foreign minister and minister of defence were people from his side, and these people turned out to have intervened under the excuse of humanitarian reasons.  You say they were there in favour of the interim government.  

Do you know that at some point in time the French government had refused to supply the Rwandan army with ammunition when the RPF attacked in Byumba so that the RPF should be able to have a basis for negotiations in 1990 and 1992?  Do you know that the French and Americans and everyone else have political imperative.  

You know, in the long run, I understand you.  You, Prosecutor, you are high ranking at the ICTR, but clearly you know nothing of what happens in the world.  Geopolitics means nothing to you.  And small Rwanda in that -- all of that was the innocent victim.  And now you want the Judges to believe that the French had come to defend the interim government, to protect the Interahamwe, and that when they were there on the advice of Patrick de Saint-Exupéry, who had noted that there was no RPF, they changed their minds and they started to pick up the Interahamwe at the same time as they were taking up the people who were wounded.  That is unrealistic, Mr. Prosecutor.  

I didn't say that the French had come to support the interim government.  You're the one who stated that.  Primo secondo, I did not say that this gentleman, Patrick de Saint-Exupéry, could not have been selective with regard to his reporting, just like you do, meaning he saw exactly what he wanted to see.  And that is why I said "this".  It's not a piece of evidence.  You said it was accepted and adduced in the Clément Kayishema case.  I hope it is not going to be accepted before this trial case, because this Chamber is comprised of professional Judges, and they understand what a piece of evidence means before an international court.  

And tertio, Prosecutor, I would like to tell you that if this gentleman is your last witness before this Court, you should have brought him.  Since you took him in Kayishema, why aren't you presenting to me what you presented in front of Kayishema, instead of presenting me the author, if he saw me ordering the Interahamwe to go and kill people?  Why?  Is he dead?  In that case, you can then submit it under 
Rule 89 -- 94.  Mr. Prosecutor, this is no piece of evidence.  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, certainly you're aware that in 1998, and I believe it was in December of 1998, the French authorities organised a parliamentary enquiry on French involvement or French implication in the Rwandan genocide to examine their own record of contacts with Rwanda.  And they published 
	four volumes of materials, one volume of conclusions, at least one volume of documents.  And they heard I don't know how many, but I would suggest tens of witnesses, all in relation to the French implication, or lack thereof, in the Rwandan genocide of 1994.  And in their book of conclusions, at least 50 or 60 pages are focussed on Opération turquoise and the development of Opération turquoise and interviews with the commanders of the French army or of the French humanitarian mission that arrived in Kibuye and did a reconnaissance mission in Bisesero.  

	And I can assure you -- and I'm sure you've looked at these materials yourself already -- that nowhere in this investigation was there any acknowledgement of finding combatants, RPF clandestine brigades, RPF soldiers, nothing of the sort in Bisesero.  The only thing that is documented is the French attempt to disarm the Interahamwe and their observations of the devastation wreaked upon the Tutsi or the civilian population of Bisesero.  And what I say to you is that if ever a party had an interest in documenting that there was war in Bisesero or RPF clandestine brigades in Bisesero, it would be the French.  And there is nothing in this report.  What do you have to say to that?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, why would the French have been interested in knowing if there were RPF brigades in Bisesero?  Why?  First answer:  Because that's not a question.  Indeed, it's an answer.  

Second answer:  What were those people who were heard -- who were those people who were heard?  

Third answer -- now third answer -- second answer, now third answer:  What were the questions that were asked?  Because you asked -- you've answered questions, Mr. Prosecutor.  And let me tell you to end.  Mr. Prosecutor, you know -- you know this because you took this down on 2nd June 1998 in Lomé, where I was with my family.  I wrote to the ambassador of France in Togo on the 
2nd of June 1998, stating to him what my responsibilities had been, including those of the minister of interior, during those events, and asking him to go and testify before that commission.  I would ask my counsel, if you don't have it, to disclose it to you.  And he was accompanied with - 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is to say, the letter was accompanied by somebody whom I didn't get.  
THE WITNESS:
Had I been listened to and had I been convened to that commission of enquiry, I would have stated it.  But you know who they invited?  They invited Twagiramungu.  They invited people who supported him, who at the time were in the grasp of the RPF.  If they invited Twagiramungu today and asked him the question, I believe the report would be different from what was made at the time.  They invited who?  James Gasana.  At that time James Gasana was -- who had been against -- was not against MRND.  

Who else did they invite from Rwanda?  Ndindiliyimana was in Europe.  Why didn't they invite him?  Yet he was in Belgium.  He was close by.  They did not invite him.  Ruhigira, Munyazesa, all who had been close to President Habyarimana who knew.  And you know they knew because you don't want to face the reality.  Otherwise, you would have brought as witness Ruhigira, Munyazesa, Mbangura, all those people who were in the know, because they were with President Habyarimana during the period which you allege his assassination had been prepared.  

You state that he was so silly that he prepared his own assassination in order to plan genocide against Tutsi.  I was no longer close to him.  I must admit that I was, indeed, in the central committee of the party -- rather, I was at the national committee of the party, that, indeed, I was in the bureau.  But I was struggling, Mr. Prosecutor.  I wasn't wealthy.  I don't have any other heritage apart from what is in my country.  I didn't sell vehicles before leaving my ministerial office.  

When I left the position of the secretary general of the party, the opposition -- the entire opposition stood up against me.  They told me, "You are going to see what you will see because you didn't want to let go of those people and that you have continued to be with Habyarimana.  We'll see if he's going to find a position for you."  Indeed, Habyarimana was not able to appoint me somewhere, but I had to survive.  Mr. Prosecutor, I had to survive.  And I struggled.  And I realised that I had not lost -- I had not wasted my time in saving the state and that I had acquired experience which served me in setting up my private practice.  

I -- I am not -- I am not part of the planification.  I'm not part of Akazu.  I am not the right hand of the general in April 1994.  The right hand of the general, Mr. Prosecutor, Munyazesa, Faustin, Rusatira, Léonidas, which your office arrested, incarcerated, and under the -- under pressure from 
Allison Des Forges, Philippe Reyntjens and all the experts, Guichaoua, of course, which your chief, not you, Carla del Ponte, released her -- he was less guilty.  Kanyarukiga, Gaspard, I wonder if you know him.  He is a person from my area.  He can't read nor write.  And your office took him here.  He's been here for five years.  You send him pieces of paper.  He cannot even read, and you're asking him to come and defend himself for having planned genocide.  Kanyarukiga, Gaspard.  This should go down for the records.  You have Rusatira, who was in communication with the Americans until he was fooled to believe that because the Americans were behind him they were going to push Kagame to take him as his vice.  And if Rusatira survived, and indeed I am glad for him, the fact that he survived is because the Americans intervened.  Otherwise, Kagame would have crushed him because Kagame said it.  And I'll tell you, "Mr. Rusarika, what did Habyarimana give you that I can give you to have your loyalty?"  The following day, Rusatira telephoned maybe to Bushnell, and he was taken out.  

I was in Nairobi.  Mbangura told him, Faustin Munyazesa, they are not guilty, and I'm happy for them, but you are trying to convince the world that I -- I was struggling to bring up my children, was working Saturdays and Sundays for my party -- that I planned genocide with Kanyarukiga, Gaspard.  That is unreal.  If I had to plan, I would have planned with Rusatira or Mbangura.  I would have planned (inaudible) Rusatira with whom we were in the central committee for -- for all those years.  That you know.  He was my senior in Christ-Roi church.  And I wrote to him, and he hasn't responded yet because he did not want to discuss the motives behind the fact that the Prosecutor released him in spite of the things against him in Kicukiro.  But you had (inaudible) convicted.  He was a major and the other one was a general.  You know Rusatira, don't you?  You know him.  He is a friend of the Americans, and that is why you released him.  But I, I'm not a friend of the Americans.  I'm not a friend of anyone.  No.  No.  I'm going to stop here.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you for your very elaborate response to my question about Opération turquoise.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And I think we've come to the end of the day's proceedings, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have.  It's time to take our adjournment.  
Mr. Registrar, you have an indication of how we are doing for time?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
So far the cross-examination lasted 12 hours, 20 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I just wanted to remind you that our examination-in-chief took 16 hours so that the Prosecutor can be aware that he has less than four hours remaining.  And I would like to thank you to keep an account of the exact time he takes in this matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We take our adjournment now, and we resume tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1745H)
