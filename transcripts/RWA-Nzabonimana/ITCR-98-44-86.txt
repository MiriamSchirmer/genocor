MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is now in session.  Good morning to the parties. 

We would like to make a suggestion to the Prosecutor regarding the names because the Court reporters are having problem with all of these names.  If you can prepare a list with all of the names that have been mentioned here by this witness, and perhaps with each name you can put a number next to it, and each time said name comes up, you can say which number that corresponds with.  The Court reporters, of course, will also have a list of the names and that will facilitate their work.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, that's acceptable, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 

Registrar, is the witness here?  Can you please bring in the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, before the witness comes in, may I raise a few matters with the Trial Chamber? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Briefly, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I have just three matters. 

First, I would ask the Trial Chamber to comply with Rule 79(B) and to state in open session its reasons for granting the Prosecutor's application to hear testimony in closed session.  You recall yesterday we had a closed session in which we agreed that Mr. Webster could give his reasons for closing the session, and that was accomplished, and, at the conclusion of that, the Trial Chamber granted his motion that testimony be taken in closed session.  And pursuant to Rule 79(B), whenever that occurs, the Trial Chamber is obligated to state in open session its reasons for this, and I would ask the Trial Chamber to do that. 

Secondly, I request certification for an appeal of your decision to close a trial session in -- I think this is a problem that is going to recur in the case, and therefore, an interlocutory appeal will materially enhance the trial.  And I also think that this is an issue of a fair trial for Mr. Nzirorera.  And, therefore, the two requirements of Rule 73 for interlocutory appeal are satisfied. 

In this particular instance, it's our position that the decision to close the session was erroneous because it was for the protection not of the own witness's -- this witness's security but the protection of others, and I think that it was a victory for rapists and perjurers and a defeat for victims, the Accused and truth and accountability.  And I feel that your ruling was a serious one and one which should be reviewed by the Appeals Chamber.  And so we make this request for certification at this time. 

Finally, my last point, with respect to the surprise testimony.  Yesterday we heard about the Interahamwe membership cards and the MRND membership cards.  I have information that an Interahamwe card was introduced as an exhibit in the case of Prosecutor v. Rutaganda and that an MRND card was also introduced as an exhibit in that case, and I'm asking that the Trial Chamber direct the registry to provide us with a copy, and, indeed, also the Prosecutor and any other parties that are interested.  My information is that this is Exhibit P. 472 or perhaps D. 472, that's the MRND card, and that the Interahamwe card was Exhibit D. 17, offered on the 9th of February 1999.  And I would ask that this material be provided to me before my cross-examination, because I believe it will show that the president of the MRND did not sign any Interahamwe card and it will be directly impeaching of the testimony of this witness. 

So that's my three requests, thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Good morning, Your Honour.  My difficulty is with that last part of the motion.  I should like to recast our position with respect to the disclosure of the Interahamwe card and the involvement of my client.  As I said yesterday, it came as a complete surprise, and it seems as though the Prosecutor is taking the position that Dr. Ngirumpatse was the chairman or president of the party, MRND, in 1992.  We didn't have any information on this before, and we didn't have any indication that this was going to be presented, and I had joined in Mr. Robinson's motion to strike that evidence and not have it admissible. 

Mr. Robinson's last motion requests the card.  He asked you to direct the Prosecutor to make available to us those exhibits that were presented in the Rutaganda case, and if that is proceeded with, it seems to me that it's not compatible with the motion to exclude the testimony altogether, which is my position. 

So I am going to ask that that be considered an alternative to the position or the motion to exclude the evidence with respect to the membership card.  Those are my positions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Roach. 
Counsel for the Prosecution, do you wish to respond? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  Yesterday we responded to the Defence application to exclude the evidence; I think I'll simply rely on my submission from yesterday.  We think that the questions put to the witness were proper, that his responses should remain on the record, and I think that this issue will simply have to await the Court's decision before we move further along with it.  So when the Court rules on that particular motion by the Defence, we will know how to deal with Mr. Robinson's application. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor. 

The Chamber gave the reasons for its decision yesterday as regards the closed session.  The Chamber did say that it was for the protection of the witness and it was in the interests of justice. 

The Chamber will give a ruling at a later date as regards the certification of appeal motion. 

As regards the cards, the Chamber urges the Prosecutor to avail the Defence with the said cards. 

We shall take advantage of this opportunity to respond to an application by Mr. Robinson regarding the preliminary or opening statement.  The Chamber is of the opinion that there is no reason for Mr. Robinson to give an opening statement at this stage.  He already had an opportunity to make an opening statement at the beginning of trial.  However, we may authorise another opening statement at the time the Defence begins to present its case. 

We thank you.  And now we would like to ask the registry to kindly bring in the witness.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor is going to continue with his examination-in-chief.  After that, you will be 
cross-examined by the Defence. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour. 

WITNESS GAF
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we left off yesterday when you were talking about attacks that took place on the 7th of April.  And I believe your testimony from yesterday also included attacks that continued on the 8th of April.  Would you explain to us if the attacks continued beyond the 8th of April? 
A.	The attacks did indeed continue, but there weren't as many attacks as there was before.
Q.	Was there a reason for that? 
A.	Well, in our region, all of the Tutsis -- practically all of the Tutsis had been killed.
Q.	Do you know of anyone who survived the attacks of the 8th of April in Busogo secteur? 
A.	Yes.  I know some.
Q.	If you are able to estimate, what percentage -- or how many of the Tutsis that were resident in Busogo before April 6th, 1994, survived those attacks, the attacks of the 7th and the 8th? 
A.	Those who survived in Mukingo, they are not more than 10.  I can say therefore that 90 per cent of the Tutsis were killed.  Only 1 per cent --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rather, 99 per cent of the Tutsis; interpreter's correction.  One per cent survived. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like to direct your attention to four or five days after those attacks on the 7th and the 8th.  Directing your attention towards the 14th of April.  Did anything happen on that day, concerning further attacks in the préfecture of Ruhengeri? 
A.	I don't remember dates very well and events that occurred on those dates.  What I do remember is attacks were launched against Tutsis who had taken refuge at the Court of Appeals in Ruhengeri.
Q.	Do you know who launched those attacks at the Court of Appeals? 
A.	I know some of them but I don't know all of the assailants, of course.  They were Interahamwe who came from Mukingo commune and they were working with elements from the CDR from Kigombe.  All of the groups worked together to kill those people who were at the Court of Appeals. 
Q.	How do you know that, Mr. Witness?  What is the basis for your statement?
A.	I'm saying this because, on the day of the attack, Kajelijeli called me.  I was at Byangabo centre in Mukingo commune.  He was at the Petro-Rwanda station, which belonged to Esdras Baheza.  When I arrived, there were two Daihatsu vehicles which were transporting CDR elements from Ruhengeri.  He asked me to gather my Interahamwe so that they could go and support those Ruhengeri youth, to kill the Tutsis at the Court of Appeals in Ruhengeri.  Interahamwe -- or gendarmes had been posted, there weren't many of them, to protect those people.  So I went to get my Interahamwe and, together, we went with those youth from Ruhengeri to go and kill the refugees at Ruhengeri.  So in the night, we heard that Inkotanyi had dropped a bomb against the Court of Appeals at Ruhengeri, to kill people, but we knew that it wasn't Inkotanyi who had dropped a bomb.  It was those Interahamwe and those elements from the CDR who had killed those people.
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, I'd like you to explain to the Court what you mean by the CDR. 
A.	The CDR was a political party which existed in Rwanda after the advent of multiparty politics.  It was only a Hutu party, and it collaborated with the MRND. 
Q.	Did the CDR party have its own youth wing? 
A.	Yes.  It did have a youth wing, and it was called Impuzamugambi.
Q.	Do you know if that youth wing also received military training? 
A.	Yes.  I can give the example of my region.  When the Virunga Force Amahindure was instituted, the Impuzamugambi came with us, and we did training together.  As regards those in Mukingo, I would see them carrying weapons.  That means that they had received training.  You can't bear a weapon without knowing how to use it. 
Q.	Can you give us some of the names of members of the CDR or the Impuzamugambi in Mukingo that you know and that you trained with?
A.	I don't remember all of the names very well but I do know some of them.  There was a young girl, Zefa was her name.  We nicknamed her CDR.  There was another young man called Sikoso.
Q.	Could you spell the name?
A.	Sikoso is spelt S-I-K-O-S-O, Sikoso.  Regarding Zefa, the name is spelt Z-E-F-A, Zefa.  She was nicknamed CDR. 
Q.	Do you know any other members of the CDR that participated in the attack on the Court of Appeals, whether they are from Mukingo or from Ruhengeri town? 
A.	At that time, it was explained that the Interahamwe and elements from the CDR attacked together.  If I take the two groups together, the CDR elements from Ruhengeri, there was a person called Toto, spelt T-O-T-O.  There was another one called Nshimiye, spelt N-S-H-I-M-I-Y-E.  There was another one, their leader, and his name was Pere, P-E-R-E.  And his father was Rwabayidadi, and it's spelt 
	R-W-A-B-A-Y-I-D-A-D-I.  

	As regards the Interahamwe from our region who went to Ruhengeri, those who I remember include Hakuzimana, spelt H-A-K-U-Z-I-M-A-N-A, Hakuzimana.  There was another one, Abdul Karim Gato and that's spelt G-A-T-O, Gato.  There was another one called Saidi Gakuru, G-A-K-U-R-U, Gakuru.  Gervais Musafiri, and that is spelt M-U-S-A-F-I-L-I, Musafiri -- R-I, rather, at the end, Musafiri.  

	I had also forgotten some of those CDR elements from Ruhengeri.  Oswald Ndereranzi and 
	Jean-Bosco Bijebeli.  Ndereranzi is spelt N-D-E-R-E-R-A-N-Z-I.  And Bijebeli is spelt B-I-J-E-B-E-L-I, Bijebeli.  Those are the people whose names I remember.
Q.	Mr. Witness, your response a minute ago included a reference to an announcement that had made -- that had been made about the bombing or the shelling of the Court of Appeals by the Inkotanyi.  I'm not clear on what you were saying.  Could you explain to us exactly what you mean?  Was this before the attack or after the attack?  Be a bit more precise in your reference, please. 
A.	The announcement was made after the attack.  The attack was launched at about 3 p.m., and that evening, at the seven o'clock news from Radio Rwanda, the announcement was made.
Q.	And was this an official announcement?  Tell --
A.	Yes.  It was an official communiqué broadcast over the official radio station.
Q.	And what did it state? 
A.	It said that the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi continue perpetrating violent acts.  They bombed Ruhengeri, and one of the bombs was launched at the Court of Appeals at Ruhengeri.  And people who had fled to the Court of Appeals were all killed.
Q.	Did that announcement imply or -- the ethnicity of the persons that had been killed?  Was there any reference to who was actually killed at the Court of Appeals, based on that announcement on the radio? 
A.	No.  I don't remember very well, recall if they mentioned the ethnicity of those who were killed.
Q.	But in reference to that announcement, is it your testimony that the announcement was accurate, inaccurate, what was your interpretation of the announcement when you heard it? 
A.	The content of that communiqué was indeed falsified.
Q.	How did you come to learn about the attack at the Court of Appeals, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes.  I was informed of it because I was asked to call on my Interahamwe colleagues.  I knew that they were going to the Court of Appeals.  And when they came back, they gave me a report.  They informed me that they had just killed those people.
Q.	Do you know if those Interahamwe were ordered to engage in that attack? 
A.	When Kajelijeli was standing at the Petro-Rwanda station, he was the one who asked the Interahamwe in our area to support the people from Ruhengeri.  I do not know where he obtained his orders from, but when he spoke, I was there myself.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did there come a time that you saw Joseph Nzirorera again in Mukingo commune?
A.	At the beginning of the massacres, he wasn't present, but I saw him much later, about two weeks later. 
Q.	Under what circumstances, please? 
A.	At that time, they had come to introduce Préfet Basile, who was together with other political authorities, in order to introduce the new préfet, known as Basile.
Q.	When you say "they," can you tell us who you were referring to?  I believe you said "they" came to install Basile.  Could you be a bit more explicit, please?  
A.	The préfet who was in office at the time was known as Baryanga (phonetic).  With the crash of the plane, he died.  That is why two weeks later, he was replaced by Préfet Basile and that is how they came to introduce the new préfet.  There were many political and military officials -- authorities.  We were at the Mukingo commune football pitch, at a place known as Bisesero (sic).
Q.	Would you spell that name for us, please, the place name?
A.	Gisesero is spelt G-I-S-E-S-E-R-O, Gisesero.  I beg your pardon, not Bisesero; Gisesero.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you give us the names of some of the authorities that were present?
A.	There was this new préfet, Nsabimugisha Basile, which is spelt N-S-A-B-I-M-U-G-I-S-H-A, Nsabimugisha.  There was also the minister of interior and communal development, whose name I do not know, but he was present.  There was also General Major Augustin Bizimungu.  There was also Major Bizabarimana.  There was also Joseph Nzirorera.  There was Minister Bicamumpaka.  There was Juvénal Kajelijeli.  There was Jean-Baptiste Nyabusore.  There was Casimir Bizimungu, who was minister at the time.  And many other persons of authority, whose names I do not recall.
Q.	Did any of these people take the floor?  Did any of these people address the audience? 
A.	The first to take the floor was the deputy bourgmestre, who was known as Semahane.  He was the deputy bourgmestre for Mukingo commune.  Semahane is spelt S-E-M-A-H-A-N-E, Semahane.  Another person who spoke was minister for interior and communal development.  And then there was Jérome Bicamumpaka.  Casimir Bizimungu also spoke, as well as the new préfet, who was being introduced, Basile Nsabimugisha.  And Nzirorera also spoke, Joseph Nzirorera.
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Witness, tell us what you remember about what Joseph Nzirorera said at that time.  What did he say when he addressed the audience? 
A.	I do not remember everything he said, but generally all those who spoke spoke of maintaining security in Mukingo commune; in other words, in our area.  They said that we needed to continue to search for the enemy wherever he may be hiding, because, they said, the Tutsis had died but there were survivors here and there.  They also said that anyone found hiding a Tutsi would be considered to be an Inkotanyi.  We therefore needed to continue to search for the enemy and we needed to reinforce the night patrols and look for the enemy everywhere -- anywhere he may be.  They also insisted on the fact that the MRND and the CDR and MDR-Power, as well as other parties, and the strong wings, the extremist wings, of the parties should all come together and fight against the enemy.
Q.	Now, with your reference to the enemy, Mr. Witness, can you tell us who exactly you understood that to be? 
A.	The enemy was the Tutsi who had attacked the country and who had killed Habyarimana, because we were told that it was the Inkotanyi who had killed Habyarimana and that we therefore needed to chase them wherever they may be and that we needed also to hunt down those who were hiding Tutsis and moderate Hutus, Hutus who were opposed to the MRND and who were on the side of the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	You made a reference to the MDR-Power, Mr. Witness.  Can you explain what you mean by that? 
A.	Actually, there was one political party known as the MDR, which stands for the Mouvement démocratique républicain, the republican democratic movement.  After the death of Habyarimana, persons such as Karemera split the MDR into two.  They said that they no longer accepted the ideals of their colleagues.  And that is why one part of the split was known as MDR, and the other one was known as MDR-Power.  Those who were on the MDR-Power were for the MRND, but those who were with the MDR were aligned to the Inkotanyi.
Q.	With respect to the préfet that was being appointed, do you know what his party affiliation was?
A.	Yes.  They were members of the MDR-Power.
Q.	With respect to Mr. Bicamumpaka that you mentioned in your previous response, do you know what his party affiliation was?
A.	Bicamumpaka was also a member of the MDR-Power faction, because he mentioned that to us on that same day.
Q.	What did he say in regard to the MDR-Power?
A.	He told us that the MDR-Power had committed itself to cooperate with the MRND and other parties which were aligned with the MRND, in order to fight a common battle against the M -- against the RPF, and the new préfet had been appointed, and the MDR-Power, the MRND and the CDR had committed themselves to join a joint, a common, front against the enemy.
Q.	With respect to Mr. Bicamumpaka's speech, did he say anything with regard to the policies of the interim government? 
A.	No.  He didn't say anything about that, but we knew how that government had been set up.  We knew that the prime minister came from the MDR.  We knew that Bicamumpaka was also from the MDR as well as the préfet, Basile Nsabimugisha, who came from the MDR-Power, and that they had committed themselves to collaborating with the MRND in order to present a common front to fight the enemy, within the interim government, that is.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, a few moments ago you made a distinction between the MDR and the MDR party 
-- excuse me, MDR-Power, but in your last response you characterised Bicamumpaka as a member of the MDR.  Would you clarify for me, please?  Are you aligning Bicamumpaka and the prime minister with the MDR or MDR-Power?
A.	Be it Kambanda or Bicamumpaka or Basile Nsabimugisha, they were from the MDR-Power.  I had forgotten to state that clearly.
Q.	You mentioned the presence of other ministers of government during this meeting.  Could you remind us of who those were, please? 
A.	I had spoken of the minister for interior -- for the interior and communal development, and of 
Casimir Bizimungu.
Q.	With respect to Casimir Bizimungu, what did he say? 
A.	Casimir Bizimungu, as well as that other minister, dwelt on what had been said by their colleagues, saying that it was necessary to fight the enemy and seek him out wherever he may be hiding, because these were Inkotanyis who had killed President Habyarimana and that those who were within the country needed to work together in order to flush out the enemy who had survived.
Q.	With respect to the minister of interior and communal development, did that person also make the same types of comments?  Tell us what he or -- what he said. 
A.	Yes.  He went along the lines of that what had been said by everyone.  He said that their visit was in order to introduce the new préfet and to make us aware of the need of being master of our own security so that the enemy does not infiltrate, and that we were in a full-scale war, and that is to say that he went along with what had been said by others before him.
Q.	Mr. Witness, how many people were in attendance for that meeting, if you recall, if you can estimate? 
A.	There were more than 3,000 persons.  It was a big crowd.
Q.	How was that crowd assembled?  Do you know how people were called to attend the installation? 
A.	When this kind of meeting was being prepared, the communal administration, the administration responsible for secteurs and cellules, would be responsible for calling on the people to come and attend such meetings.  And that's how the people were called to the meeting and the venue, together with the date of the meeting, and the time of the meeting, were announced.
Q.	Were any of your Interahamwe friends and colleagues present for this meeting? 
A.	They were there, in large numbers.
Q.	Okay.  How long did this meeting last? 
A.	It began at about ten, and concluded in the afternoon, at about 1500 hours.
Q.	Was there any pageantry or animation or entertainment or anything of that nature during the course of that meeting?
A.	Yes.  Obviously. 
Q.	Was there any particular role for the Interahamwe in that regard?
A.	No.  What one could see was that they were in uniform, but they didn't do anything else.
Q.	Mr. Witness, with respect to this day, the same day that the -- this meeting was held to reinstall or to appoint a new préfet, did you have any other contact with Joseph Nzirorera, aside from seeing him at this meeting? 
A.	No.  I didn't have any contact with him.  We did not discuss anything.
Q.	Did you see Mr. Nzirorera in any other location?
A.	No.  I saw him again, much later, in the Congo when we were in exile.
Q.	Was there no meeting at Joseph Nzirorera's mother's house that day as well?
A.	No.  There wasn't any.
Q.	Did any of the speakers at that meeting comment on the killings that had already taken place in Mukingo?
A.	I don't recall.
Q.	Well, when Nzirorera was speaking, your testimony is that he told you to continue to search out the enemy.  Did he say anything at that time that reflected upon the killings that had already taken place? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  First of all, I think he's mischaracterised the testimony already about what Mr. Nzirorera said; and, secondly, I think this has been -- the question has been asked and answered. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained. 

Can you please reformulate your question, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, thank you. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I believe you said -- or you can remind me of the answer to this question.  The speakers of the authorities had told you to continue the search for the enemy; isn't that your previous -- wasn't that your previous response? 
A.	Yes.  That's what I said.
Q.	So am I to understand that they were asking you to continue what you had already done?
A.	Yes.  They were saying that all the survivors needed to be pursued, and also killed.
Q.	With respect to Joseph Nzirorera, do you know if anyone from among your group had ever communicated with him, either directly or indirectly, about the killings that took place, prior to the installation of the new préfet? 
A.	No.  I don't know anything about that.
Q.	Do you know if Kajelijeli had been in contact with Joseph Nzirorera during the period between the 8th of April and the date on which this installation took place? 
A.	Kajelijeli would report to us that he was in communication, but I didn't see him communicate.
Q.	What did he tell you about his communication? 
A.	He would report to us that they spoke about all these events.  He told us that he was in -- that they were in constant touch and that they talked about past events or projects or things to be carried out in the future.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I'd like you to be a bit more specific, if you can be.  When you say "events," what are you referring to?
A.	These were killings which we had carried out, and the whole programme.  What I mean is the implementation -- or the killing of the Tutsis.
Q.	And is it your understanding that this is what was discussed prior to the meeting in -- for the installation of the new préfet? 
A.	What I'm sure about is that they would speak with one another.  He told us that they were speaking with one another, and I have no reason to doubt that statement.  I therefore believed that they indeed spoke.
Q.	After this meeting, after the installation of Basile, did the Interahamwe, your Interahamwe group, take any further actions in Mukingo? 
A.	I remember that one woman and her three children were killed on Busogo hill.  They were killed by François Dusabimana as well as Jean-Damascène Habyarimana, Gervais Musafiri and Iyamuremye.  The person who had denounced them was Kanoti.  It was in fact Kanoti's vehicle which was used to go and fetch them.  That woman was killed because she was Tutsi and because her children were also Tutsi.  She was denounced in order that her property can -- could be appropriated.  The woman had a Daihatsu vehicle which was looted.
Q.	How soon after this meeting to reinstall Basile -- or to install Basile as the préfet did this killing take place, if you can remember? 
A.	It was in May.  There was a good deal of time between the two events. 
Q.	Well, did anything happen in closer proximity to this meeting?  What actions did you take, or did your Interahamwe group take, after the meeting to install Basile? 
A.	No.  I do not remember having done anything whatsoever.
Q.	Well, let me ask you this, Mr. Witness.  You were asked during this meeting to flush out the enemy, and to find all those who survived.  Did you do anything in furtherance of those instructions?  Did you do anything else to try to flush out the enemy?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  This has been asked and answered.  He said he doesn't remember having done anything whatsoever after this meeting.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm requesting a little latitude. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You wanted to explain yourself, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm simply probing the witness, Your Honour.  In the conduct of my direct examination, I think it's appropriate to probe the witness and to ask several questions in order to elicit his testimony.  If it's abusive or if it's improper, then I can be directed to continue, but at this point, I don't think there is anything proper (sic) about asking a follow-up question to my previous questions. 

We are, after all, dealing with a situation where what I ask is being translated twice before the witness hears it and what I hear from the witness is being twice -- is being translated twice before I hear it, and in that context, I don't think it's appropriate to suggest that one question is enough to elicit an appropriate response.  There have been several times I've asked the same questions and it's been translated in different ways and it's elicited a slightly different response.  So the Court, I'm suggesting, should exercise a bit of latitude in allowing me to put several questions in pursuit of a certain line of questioning.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could briefly respond to that?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
The problem is that Mr. Webster is only doing this -- he's insisting, when he doesn't receive the answer that he wants, and this is a distortion of the search for truth.  It's just a question of remembering rehearsed testimony, and I think when the witness gives an unequivocal answer, such as he doesn't remember having done anything whatsoever after the meeting, that that answer should be allowed to stand. 

Secondly, if there is some interpretation or translation problems that the witness is not receiving the correct translation from the Prosecutor's question, that should be raised contemporaneously and corrected immediately, not used as an excuse for insisting on the same question to get the answer he wants.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's an unreasonable response.  First of all, no one here is -- no one from this side of the room is coming forward with rehearsed testimony.  Furthermore, there is no way that I can know what a witness hears in Kinyarwanda. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Please proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned earlier that during 1993, you had mounted roadblocks in Busogo secteur and that you ran those roadblocks, you supervised three roadblocks.  My question is -- to you now is:  After the speech of these officials with the appointment of Basile, did there come a time when -- that there were additional roadblocks mounted in Busogo? 
A.	Yes.  Other roadblocks were put up.  The three were set back up, but nothing happened at the roadblocks.  The roadblocks stood for another two or three days but nothing happened.  I had already told you why.  I had told you that nothing happened because, besides erecting those roadblocks, there was nothing else that was done.
Q.	Well, did any Tutsi pass by those roadblocks during those three days?
A.	No Tutsis came through.  If a Tutsi tried to pass through, he would have been killed.
Q.	You mentioned that a certain Semahane opened the proceedings that day, and you described him as the interim bourgmestre or the assistant bourgmestre, I'm not sure.  Can you tell us what happened to the person he replaced?
A.	He replaced a Hareremina, Emmanuel, spelt H-A-R-E-R-E-M-I-N-A.  At that time, Hareremina had just died.  He died on the 8th of April.  After his death, Assistant Bourgmestre Semahane replaced him.  He was followed by Juvénal Kajelijeli. 
Q.	Do you know anything about the circumstances of Hareremina's death?
A.	There were two versions of how he died.  Some said that when there were bodies, dead bodies, he died from a heart attack, from seeing them.  Others said that he was poisoned.  There were these rumours but I don't know which one is true. 
Q.	Do you know if Hareremina participated in the attacks on the morning of the 7th? 
A.	No.  I hadn't seen him since we began our activities.  I hadn't seen him up to his death. 
Q.	Do you know if there was any interaction between Hareremina and Kajelijeli on the morning of the 7th? 
A.	No.  I only saw Kajelijeli on the 7th.  I don't know if they had spoken prior to that.  We were working elsewhere.  We went to kill at the parish and in the surrounding area and I can't tell you if on that day the two men spoke.  I only saw Kajelijeli.  I don't know if, prior to that, or even after that, if they spoke.
Q.	Well, you testified previously that Kajelijeli was the bourgmestre in 1993.  Did there come a time -- or let me withdraw and rephrase the question.  Do you know why Kajelijeli stopped being the bourgmestre in 1993? 
A.	We learned that with the advent of the multiparty system, he resigned.  The other opposition parties required that he step down. 
Q.	Well, there is a distinction between the two, Witness, and I'm asking you to clarify that.  Did he resign or was he asked to step down? 
A.	He didn't resign.  He was relieved of his duties.  This was under pressure from opposition parties. 
Q.	And what was the reason given by the opposition parties for opposing him? 
A.	I don't know.  I wasn't there.  I wasn't there when the parties required that.  I didn't receive an explanation why.  All that I heard is that the opposition parties did not want him. 
Q.	Did there come a time that he became bourgmestre once again? 
A.	Yes.  He became bourgmestre again at the end of May 1994. 
Q.	Do you know what authority reappointed him at that time? 
A.	The Abatabazi government.  That government -- that government appointed the bourgmestres.  The Abatabazi government was the government in power at the time.
Q.	And when you say Abatabazi government, is this the same government that Bicamumpaka, the minister of interior, and Casimir Bizimungu belonged to when you talked about their speech at the installation of Basile? 
A.	Yes.  It's the same government, the same Abatabazi government.  That's the government that took power after Habyarimana's death, the government led by Kambanda, who was the prime minister.  And those ministers, those three ministers, were part of his cabinet.
Q.	Mr. Witness, there came a time that you left Rwanda.  Can you tell us when that was, please? 
A.	I left Rwanda on the 17th of July 1994.  I left with the others.  We were fleeing the RPF and we went to Goma in Zaire.
Q.	Is there any time after the installation of Basile that you saw Joseph Nzirorera again? 
A.	No.  I didn't see him again.
Q.	To clarify --
A.	The next time was in Goma, in the Congo.
Q.	Did you speak to him at that time?
A.	No. 
Q.	Under what circumstances did you see him? 
A.	We were in the Congo***********************************************************************************  We went to visit them.  They lived in tents.  Nzirorera arrived in a vehicle.  It was green.  He was in a military uniform.  And he was guarded by Congolese soldiers.  He spoke with his mother, and we left, left him with his mother, and went back to town. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, thinking back to the attacks on the 7th and the 8th of April and those that you described occurring on the 14th of April, do you know if there were any armed RPF soldiers in the vicinity of Busogo at that time?  Was there a battle between the RPF and the government that was taking place in Busogo?  And I'm talking about the army. 
A.	No.  There was no fight between the RPF and the government forces.  Personally, I didn't see any RPF forces in that region at that time.

	1015H
MR. WEBSTER: (Continuing)
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, when you talk about restoring security and the efforts that you and your Interahamwe colleagues made to restore security, what was your objective? 
A.	For me, restoring security meant stopping a possible Inkotanyi attack, attacking our region.  That is how my Interahamwe friends understood it as well.  We looked for the accomplices of the Inkotanyi or the Inkotanyi themselves by all means necessary and tried to stop them from penetrating our region.  Once an accomplice was found or an RPF element was found, we would eliminate them. 
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, judging by your last response, it seems to me that you are suggesting that there were no RPF soldiers in Busogo on the 7th and the 8th.  When you refer to the --
A.	No.  There were no RPF soldiers, no RPF combatants on that date. 
Q.	When you refer to searching out the Inkotanyi, who exactly are you referring to? 
A.	As I have said on several occasions, the term "Inkotanyi" included all Tutsis.  That means that there were Tutsis on the war front and Tutsis in the country who worked with them.  For me, any Tutsi, adult or child, for me that person is an Inkotanyi.  Hutus opposed to the government also were included and Hutus who supported Tutsis were also included. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you ever receive any instructions from Joseph Nzirorera to stop the killings? 
A.	No.  We never received such instructions.  We only stopped the killings when there was nothing left to kill. 
Q.	What about from the interim government?  Did you ever receive any instructions directly or indirectly from the government to stop the killings? 
A.	No.  The government never ordered us to stop the killings. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you ever been prosecuted for the crimes that you have just described, for your involvement in the crimes that you have just described? 
A.	Yes.  My judgment has not yet been handed down, but I have been classified in one category.  I am waiting for judgment in the context of the Gacaca system.  I was released because I pled guilty and confessed.  I asked for forgiveness and I was released according to the procedure in place in Rwanda.  I am currently waiting for my punishment, and I might have to do public works as part of my punishment. 
Q.	Do you recall when it is that you entered your plea of guilty? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	When was that, please? 
A.	************************************* 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have spoken to investigators from the ICTR on numerous occasions, haven't you? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you have made a number of witness statements? 
A.	Equally correctly.
Q.	Do you recall the date of the first witness statement you made to an investigator from the ICTR? 
A.	I don't remember the date but it was in 2002. 
Q.	Do you remember if it was before or after you elected to enter a plea of guilty? 
A.	I don't remember.  When I was still detained, agents from this Tribunal came to question me, so did representatives of the Rwandan Prosecutor's office.  I don't remember the exact dates when I met one or the other.  But you can verify for yourself the date when I met the various persons. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if I placed a copy of your witness statement before you, would that assist you in remembering the date of the first time that you made a statement to the ICTR? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I would offer to stipulate that if Mr. Webster read the date that is on the statement, that is the correct --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I would offer to stipulate that if Mr. Webster reads the date from the statement, that could be accepted. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Is that acceptable to the other Defence Counsel?  

I have before me a witness statement that is dated the 24th of September 2002, and I think the first line of that statement says:  "This is the first time I am being interviewed by the investigator from the ICTR," so the 24th of September 2002.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what do you stand to gain from your testimony here today?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, can you repeat your question, please?
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you stand to gain anything by testifying before the ICTR today?
A.	The only thing I stand to gain is to tell the truth.  I have to tell the truth.  Once you confess, that's what you have to do.  When you ask for forgiveness, you have to say the truth wherever it is asked of you.  So I am required to tell the truth whenever I am asked to do so.  That is what I am doing.  There are no other interests here.
Q.	Is that what you did when you made your guilty plea on ******************* as well? 
A.	On ********************, I decided to tell the truth.  Because to be frank with you, what -- the acts that I was accused of were known by everyone.  I did this in broad daylight.  Everyone knew and so I asked for forgiveness from God, from the people, from the country, because what I was accused of took place in broad daylight.  And so I decided to tell the truth and asked for forgiveness, and, indeed, I was forgiven.  
Q.	The document on which your guilty plea is recorded, is that something that you prepared or did someone prepare it for you?  
A.	I wrote it myself. 
Q.	Is that the only document on which it is recorded your involvement that you, yourself, offered that talks about your involvement in the events of 1994?  Is there anything else? 
A.	It's the only confession and plea of guilty.  Before that confession, we wrote our documents.  Before that we believed that we had to try to lie to try to get released or to get our friends released.  The documents written after this one were in solidarity camps.  We wrote everything that we thought about the events. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have -- I would like to enter a few exhibits onto the record.  For the most part, I have completed my direct examination, but I would like to go back to the CD-ROM that we referred to two days ago.  And I would like to have this witness look at a few photographs, and after we do that, I am ready to conclude my examination.  

So perhaps, we could start with Prosecution Exhibit P. 5, which is a book of photographs from Ruhengeri.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, apparently there are no objections.  You may proceed.
MR. WEBSTER:
Place P. 5 before the witness and turn to page 8548 and direct the witness's attention to the photograph which is identified on that page as KO275243. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel kindly repeat the K-number for the interpreters? 
MR. WEBSTER:
It is KO275243.  In fact, what we can do -- it is on page 8458.  If the assistant from the registry can simply stand next to the witness and direct the witness's attention to the bottom photograph.
THE WITNESS:
I recognise what I can see on this photograph.  It is the Byangabo commercial centre which is in Busogo secteur in Mukingo commune.  It is a centre which is in my area.
MR. WEBSTER:
If we could turn the page and direct our attention to page 8547, the photograph at the top.  It is KO275244.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise that photograph or recognise what is depicted in that photograph? 
A.	I can once again recognise Byangabo.  But this time around, it is seen from the road from Gisenyi.  In order to take this photograph, the photographer was probably in front of one shop.  To the top of the road, it is Baheza's place, and that also is in Byangabo but seen from a different angle.  
Q.	When you say Baheza's place, could you be a bit more explicit?  What do you mean by Baheza's place? 
A.	Baheza had two homes and a petrol station.  Above the road close to the taxi rank -- it's a taxi stop, he had one of his homes and a petrol station which belonged to him.  To the other side, you can see a white house.  That is where there was a Petro-Rwanda petrol station.  On the other side, you can see a taxi, a vehicle which is a taxi, and that is where his second home was.  Lower down to the bottom of the road, he had another house, and that is the first one he had built. 
Q.	Can we turn to page 8539, please?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, since the interpreters do not have a copy of these photographs, we are suggesting that they be projected on the overhead projector, so that we don't work so blindly.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
With respect to the photograph, Your Honour, I am simply having the witness identify them for the record.  I will move over to the overhead projector and then we can go through things detail by detail.  But right now, all of these photographs have been discussed by the witness.  I am not going to go into much detail with the identification. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, directing your attention to the bottom photograph identified as KO275261, can you tell us what is depicted in that photograph, if you recognise it? 
A.	I can see Ruhere hill which was opposite Mukingo bureau communal.  On top of that hill is where soldiers from the Mukamira camp had been assigned and they had set up their post. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, for ease of reference, wouldn't it be simpler that we have the picture shown to everyone at the same time so that we can follow more closely what is happening?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I can do that.  But my assumption was that every member of the Defence team had the booklet that had been copied to them.  I am simply having the witness go through the items.  We have discussed these photographs at length.  There are two other witnesses.  We will do so at length through additional witnesses that will testify.  If you prefer that we go through each photograph, show it, display it, have the witness comment extensively, we can do that.  But I was under the impression that we wanted to complete this direct examination this morning so we could go into cross-examination.  But I would be happy to direct the witness to do that.  

This is not the first time that the Court and the parties are seeing these photographs.  There were two additional witnesses and we spent quite a bit of time going through the material. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, please.  Mr. Weyl is on his feet. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President.  This will still bring us to the same issue, which is that, for ease of reference, in our discussions, it would be better for us to be provided before the session opens, the list of documents which will be used during the session so that we can have the same material to refer to as the Prosecutor is using on any occasion.  We would then have the same manual of documents which have been referred to during the session, and this kind of incident would not recur.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, I think that for ease of reference in our discussions, it may be better that you tell us beforehand what documents you intend to use, because we, ourselves, did not bring our copies and obviously, it is a bit disturbing.  So if in future you could at the same time have the images projected, I think this would help us save time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour, I will do so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I do presume that you no longer wish to speak. 
 MR. HOOPER:
 -- as a result my mouth -- Madam President, it is exactly the same problem.  We haven't brought our booklets.  And, as you know, we have to empty the Court every day of all the documents, and it's
-- unless we get some notice, we don't know quite what to bring.  That is the difficulty.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.  Thank you.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  We will backtrack a bit.  Mr. Witness, directing your attention to the screen, can you tell us what you see in this image? 
A.	I can see the high hill which was known as Ruhere, which was situated in front of the Mukingo bureau communal.  On that hill, one could see the positions of the detachment of soldiers from Mukamira camp.  I can also see houses.  I know this kiosk very well.  I also know the buildings that I can see below the road.  I do not know their owners but I know the buildings.
Q.	Can you remind us of where this hill was in relation to the Mukingo bureau communal? 
A.	The bureau communal is just opposite this road.  There is only this tarred road between the two.  If you are coming from Ruhengeri, and that hill would be to your left, whereas the bureau communal would be to your right. 
MR. WEBSTER:
May I have the record reflect that on the screen is a photograph KO275253, at page 8453 in Prosecution 5. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise the image that is presently on the screen? 
A.	It is the Busogo Catholic church. 
Q.	And in relation to your previous testimony about the attacks on the Busogo Catholic church, would you be able to describe for us where you were, where your other Interahamwe colleagues or friends were and where the soldiers were when the attack was launched?  Would this photograph allow you to do that, to explain that? 
A.	Yes, I can recognise the location.  But the Tutsis' hiding place is not visible.  They were hiding below this church, in the house belonging to the nuns.  But inside the church, there were also people.  We entered the church into the Fathers' house because we looted powdered milk, vehicles and so on.  So the Tutsis were hiding below this church but not far away from this church, of course. 
MR. WEBSTER:
May I have the record reflect that the image on the screen is now KO275255, from page 8542 of Prosecutor 5?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can you identify the image that is currently on the screen? 
A.	This is the nuns' house where all these people were killed.  The door that you can see here to the foreground was forced down.  We went into the inside.  We shot through these windows and we also threw grenades through the windows.  When the soldiers came, you can see here below there is a road which goes towards the back of the nuns' house.  There is also a school known as ESTB.  When we met the soldiers, they were coming from behind.  

As for ourselves, we went down to go into the home of the nuns.  That was the massacre site.  After the massacre, we looted the house where the nuns lived and that's where the fathers lived.  Below the hospital, there was a dispensary from which we looted medication.  In fact, a small baby who was born that same day, a Tutsi baby infant, was killed that same day. 
MR. WEBSTER:
May I have the record reflect that the image on the screen is now KO275254.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, with respect to this image, do you recognise -- can you describe its contents to us, please? 
A.	Yes.  I recognise this photograph.  It is the Catholic church in Busogo parish, actually. 
Q.	Is the nuns' convent or the building that you were discussing just a moment ago -- is that reflected on the image that is now on the screen? 
A.	No.  The convent is not visible in this photograph. 
MR. WEBSTER:
May I have the record reflect that on the screen is image K027529 which appears on page 8550 of Prosecution 5.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, directing your attention to the image on the screen, do you recognise what is depicted on the screen? 
A.	I can see two buildings.  The building to the right is the Mukingo bureau communal.  The building in the middle was used as a nutrition centre.  And in the second building -- the second building also housed the MRND offices. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did any other political parties have an office in the complex of buildings that included the bureau communal? 
A.	No.  Only the MRND party had an office there at the bureau communal. 
Q.	During your previous testimony, you mentioned ongoing military training at the bureau communal.  Would this photograph be of any assistance in helping you to explain where at the bureau communal such training was conducted?
A.	Yes.  The training session indeed took place.  Look to the left, there's a large field where the military training took place, and this was the place before the CCDFP building.  On the other side, there is a main road, a big road.
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to attempt to introduce an exhibit.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, Counsel.
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to attempt to introduce an additional exhibit now.  It was -- we have referred to it before.  It is simply for purposes of identification, P. 18, I believe it was, and that was the CD-ROM with a number of video clips.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, this is a matter which we mentioned on Tuesday morning and you reserved your ruling on this matter upon the request of the Prosecutor to tender extracts and exhibits and reporting material from this CD-ROM which was disclosed to us on the 29th of March, in the morning of that day.  We had indicated that for us, we had a major difficulty in having this material admitted as exhibits, because these were documents which we had not been in possession of earlier on.  
So the main problem still obtains because what we have been able to consult reveals that there was four hours of videos material, mainly in Kinyarwanda.  So we were unable to determine exactly the pertinence or relevance and the scope of this material which is being tendered as an exhibit.  For us, this is a problem because if you admit extracts as exhibits, these would be on the record and we will have absolutely no way later on to have any exhibits admitted, which will enable us to understand the exhibit.  So there is a problem here with regard to the administration of evidence -- the provision of our evidence.  And so, extracts should not be allowed.  And furthermore, almost the totality of the video material can be tendered as exhibit, but only if they are recognised as such, and that we beforehand, we have, in fact, the opportunity to become aware of the whole content of the video material, with us using the material available to us and benefiting from translation from our clients. 

So we are therefore, filing a second verbal -- oral motion.  First, being that only disclosure of the totality of material be provided.  And our second motion is that you should issue orders or instructions to the registry to ensure that incidents of this nature do not recur, and that all facilities be provided to the Defence teams so that they can benefit from the assistance of an investigator, in this particular instance, an investigator who is Kinyarwanda-speaking, throughout the whole of this material because we would be in front of a situation where -- in cases where we have last minute disclosure.  We would have only -- we would require regular teams to be able to face up to such situations.  And within the time frame given, we are unable to usefully make -- to make useful material of this information given to us.  

Kindly therefore, Madam President, issue instructions to the registry so that we can have the necessary means at our disposal, so that we can indeed ensure that we defend our case appropriately.  I can, if you so wish, file a written motion specifying the things that I would wish you to do in regard to this situation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr.  Weyl.

Mr. Prosecutor, do you want to respond to this?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I saw Mr. Robinson on his feet, that is why I sat down.  But I would be happy to respond to Mr. Weyl and then Mr. Robinson can take over.

With respect to Mr. Weyl's application --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Unless you want to respond to the two at the same time, in which case, I will give the floor to Mr. Robinson and then you will come after him.  I had not seen Mr. Robinson stand up. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think it is easy to take them one at a time.  And with respect to Mr. Weyl, I quite agree.  I think it is more appropriate to offer all six CDs in evidence, and I have no objection in doing so.  So I can move or attempt to move all six CD-ROMS into evidence.  This is the complete video footage that we have in our office; the most complete video footage that we have in our office with regard to this particular meeting.  

If it is admitted into evidence now, we don't have to watch all four or five or six hours of it.  I am really concerned with two minutes of it.  You know, I am happy to play two minutes of it to this witness and discuss those two minutes.  But as a matter of principle, I think it is appropriate to admit all six 
CD-ROMS and the Court can consult them at its leisure, and other witnesses can refer to other parts of this video footage. 

I did have a translation of the two minutes extract that most concerned me.  It is a transcription in Kinyarwanda, a translation into French and into English.  The language section was gracious enough to extend itself yesterday.  They did attempt to translate the portion of the clips that identified 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse speaking.  So we do have French translations for approximately, maybe six or seven additional minutes of the video footage.  I would play those.  

And this morning I did provide the Defence and the Trial Chamber coordinator with the text that was given to me yesterday by the language section.  So I am concerned with maybe ten minutes of materials that I would like to play for this Court.  But I think it is entirely appropriate to admit all six 
CD-ROMS into evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

We are going to ask you all, when someone has the floor, the others should remain seated.  You will stand up once the previous person has concluded his intervention.  That would suit us much better because we are kind of lost in all this.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl, do you wish to reply to the Prosecutor?
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President.  I was a bit confused.  I don't know how one can admit the admission of evidence of documents which we have not looked at the content.  I don't see how you can admit exhibits without having looked at them.  It's not -- I am saying this with a great deal of solemnity.

In France, video footage has near nil probative value.  You need to have all the stages of manipulation considered.  It is not possible that a document be tendered into evidence, whose content we have not together verified and authenticated through projection altogether and not using merely extracts thereof.  Otherwise, we cannot blindly admit documents, and I do not wish to say that inert materials which are CD-ROMS, be tendered.  We have the right to fully visualise all the material tendered as exhibits.  And the draft translation which has been given is a draft translation of the extract; it's not authenticated, and these are extracts which have not been verified, especially under circumstances which do not permit us to see which extracts this material actually refers.  I don't think it would be possible to admit this material in this form as it stands.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I agree with the need for preparation by the Defence and that's the problem that we are having created here in this particular instance.  On the other hand, I have to say that I favour the admission at some point of the entire CD-ROM because it is exculpatory evidence.  I have been asking for this over a year, and I think you should see it in its entirety.  You should see the entire speech of President Habyarimana; the entire speech of Mathieu Ngirumpatse; the entire speech of Robert Kajuga, the Tutsi who was the chief of the Interahamwe, and the entire speech of Casmir Bizimungu.  These have been described by the witness already, and when you see the entire speech, you will see the difference between what was actually said and the context in which this witness reported it.  So I think that is extremely important and I intended in my cross-examination, if it is feasible, to have those portions played and to ask the questions of this witness about the comments that were made on the actual true version of the speeches, not his interpretation of it.  

As a practical matter though, I don't know exactly how I am going to do that because I don't have any translation, having just received the tapes this week.  And so, I suggest that we delay the 
cross-examination of this witness, as well as the admission of these tapes, until such time as all of these logistical problems have been resolved.

	Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. WEBSTER:
In response to Mr. Weyl's application or his submission, really it puts us in a catch-22 situation.  We started out with me requesting a two-minute excerpt to be shown to the witness.  Mr. Weyl objected because he thought it was deforming the event to only show two minutes.  At that point I agreed and said let's admit everything.  And at that point, and in so doing, I could show the two minutes that interested me.  And that, if any other party wanted to screen the entire four or five hours for the Court or for themselves, they would be free to do so.  

Mr. Weyl then objected to showing the whole thing because we would not know what was on it, because we were not going to see all four hours at this time.  So we have to be clear on what we request and what we seek in these applications.  

I am concerned to show this Court the two-minute extract of President Habyarimana's speech that has generated quite a bit of notoriety in the history of the events of 1994.  That portion has been transcribed, and that's what I would like to move forward with.  

I have no objection to admitting all of the contents of all of the CD-ROMS that we have.  I myself have not watched every single moment of the six CD-ROMS, but they appear to be a video camera that is simply running non-stop from the beginning of the event to the end of the event.  If this witness identifies the two minutes that interests us, I see no reason not to go forward.  

If the Defence would like all CD-ROMS entered into evidence or at least identified for purposes of the record, I have no objection to that.  But it is not reasonable or practical to suggest that the 
cross-examining can be delayed at this point.  We either go forward or we move on without the clip.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would like to remind the parties that on Tuesday, it told the Defence it was possible to have a Kinyarwanda interpreter availed to watch the cassettes.  You have had several afternoons to do so.  And now, we would also like to say that the Accused understand Kinyarwanda.  

Given the objection, we will admit all the six CDs.  Apparently, they haven't been entirely viewed by the Defence nor the Prosecution.  But given the situation, we are obliged to do so since we already told the Defence on Tuesday that they could ask for assistance from an interpreter in Kinyarwanda if they so desired.  As such, the Prosecutor will be able to watch the extracts which are apparently of two to three minutes in duration.  Is that correct, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President.  Sorry.  I will only delay the proceedings for one moment.  I imagine that there are not many lawyers in the Prosecution team who are completely comfortable in Kinyarwanda.  It seems to me that it's quite likely that -- and Mr. Webster can confirm whether this is the case or not.  But at some stage during the Prosecution investigations, the entirety of these speeches has been translated into French or into English.  If that is the case, can I please request that the Prosecution provide us with the translations that they have in their possession.  I ask this because, of course, for us to translate these tapes ourselves involves substantial and unnecessary course, and it would be far simpler if the Prosecution had full translations in their possession that they provide them to us.  
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel.
MR. WEBSTER:
I think I have responded to those concerns already, at least on several occasions.  Actually, I clarified by saying that these tapes came into our possession for the first time earlier this month.  So I have only seen them myself last week sometime.  So we don't have any translation of the tapes.  We don't have transcriptions.  We have a transcription of the portion -- of a portion of Juvénal Habyarimana's speech because we had that tape from another source, and that material was disclosed to the Defence sometime ago.  

Last night, one of the Kinyarwanda interpreters from this language crew that is with us here today, translated around ten minutes of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech.  But that is all we have at this point.  We will develop transcriptions, and as we do so, we will serve them on the Defence.  

We are not undertaking to transcribe the entire contents of all six CD-ROMS, but those portions that we deem probative will be transcribed and translated.  They will be addressed by the witness.  This is not the only witness that is going to address this particular meeting.  

At this point, the only purpose of going forward is to have this witness identify the two-minute portion of Habyarimana's speech that is most important to us.  But we will get to all of the contents of the entire meeting through other witnesses, or perhaps Mr. Robinson has already stated that he wants to go into it in cross-examination.  So right now, what I would like to have happen is to have clip 11B displayed on the screen, and then we can go forward.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I just heard Mr. Webster say he received these documents in the beginning of the month.  We are in the beginning of the next month.  I also have difficulty thinking that he wasn't able to watch the said materials.  If he was, nonetheless, able to take extracts, that means that he was able to do some kind of compilation by selecting.  

I am still in difficulty believing this.  If we can recognise extracts, who can recognise the rest of it?  How can we see where the extracts are and what they are in relation to each other?  There are two minutes.  What about the two minutes before and after?  You can denature, disfigure one extract.  How can we admit and be sure that these are authenticated and leave the rest in suspense.  At whose discretion?  This situation imposed upon us is not of a nature to enable us to have a fair debate.  And usually, I don't comment on decisions, Madam President, I must tell you, but I am used to filing written motions and not making oral applications.  I have prepared a document, a very brief response to your proposal to give help to the Defence, and we very much appreciate that assistance, but it does not solve the problem.  

We have to work and respect confidentiality in our work.  Any interpreter that is put to our disposal does not have the same obligations of confidentiality.  We need to work on documents in Kinyarwanda in secret, with complete discretion and ethically.  This is imposed on us without anyone intervening.  Whatever interpreter it may be, they don't have the same guarantees of the independence that we require of them.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Diagne.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Madam President, I just wanted to request.  If what is interest of the Prosecutor is only two minutes of Habyarimana's speech, why does he feel obliged to disclose six CDs in their entirety?  

Pardon me.  I am having technical problems, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you there yet, Counsel?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Madam President, I had to change headsets.  I suggest that the Prosecutor tenders the two minutes of Habyarimana's speech.  Perhaps this will solve the problem for everyone.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I don't think so.  That's what counsel asked for and the Defence objected and said the six CDs, in their entirety, be tendered. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Madam President, what I am saying is, what is of interest to the Prosecutor?  This was in the beginning.  If he only is interested in two minutes of the speech, if he is only interested in two minutes, why did he give us six entire CDs to look at, if only two minutes are of interest? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I think counsel for the Defence have finished. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to just clarify something for Mr. Weyl, because there seems to be a misunderstanding.  I provided a written document, I think it was yesterday, where all 11 clips -- actually there were -- 15 clips were listed, and it was explicitly indicated where on the counter, from the entire six CD-ROMS, the extracts were taken.  So, each one of the Defence can go back to the six CD-ROMS that they received and identify exactly where the extracts were taken from.  So there should no deception or no confusion on that point.  Everyone can look at the entire six CD-ROMS and see exactly where each of these 15 extracts were taken.  Even though I have identified 15 extracts, I am only going to ask the Court to look at one now, and that's 11B.  

So since we seem to run into a procedural problem, my suggestion is that we mark all six CD-ROMS for identification, that we also mark the separate CD-ROM with the 15 extracts on it for identification,  that we mark this writing -- actually there are two of them now for identification.  If we identify them as P. 18, the first six CD-ROMS, we can identify them as P. 18 A-F.  We identify the CD-ROM that has the compilation of extracts as 18G.  We can identify the first memo as P. 18H, and the second one as "I", and when the witness views the extract 11B, I will move that into evidence.  Everything would have been identified.  And at a later time, after the Defence has viewed all the six CD-ROMS at their leisure, we can come back to this issue through another witness because this CD-ROM and this meeting will figure in other testimony.  Perhaps when the application is coming from the Defence during cross-examination, it will meet with less opposition, and maybe through cross-examination, 
Mr. Robinson would offer all six, because if he does so, I will have no objection.  But that may seem to solve the practical matter because everything would have been identified for record.  Everybody will be placed in the hands of the registry, but the Court will only have to decide the issue of admission of evidence with respect to the two minutes that I wanted to start with from the beginning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, besides the question of principle that we are dealing with, I can accept Mr. Webster's suggestion with reservations.  I would hope that the Chamber, if it adopts that proposal, can reserve for the Defence that during its cross-examination, it can ask for such and such an extract to be played on the CD-ROM, which are in the record, if the Defence so wishes so that the two minutes that were seen today can be put back into open session in their possible context.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I don't want to belabour this point, but I do have two practical concerns if we are going to have the  excerpts played today, which seems to be more of a reasonable compromise.  And my two concerns are that, if I am expected to cross-examine this witness anytime soon, I am giving everyone notice that I am going to play four speeches in the entirety that created this meeting.  And I don't have the facilities to have any translations prepared for those four speeches, that I am asking the Chamber to direct the language section to prepare translations as soon as possible of those four speeches.  Or, in the alternative, I am going to ask that we have a free translation during my cross-examination as the videotape is played so that we can all understand the content and then I can put questions to the witness.  So I am just looking to the future to be able to have the facilities to -- if 
Mr. Webster is allowed only to play his two minutes, I need the facilities to be able to play the portions that we think are relevant.  And I need to do it while this witness is here because I have questions to put to this witness about his characterisations of what was said.  

And also, I am concerned about the second thing.  If Mr. Webster is playing only two minutes and I have two or three hours, I hope that the Trial Chamber will extend whatever time limitations it is intending to impose so that this inequity will not be to our detriment.  

Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber retains the Prosecutor's proposition, mindful of Mr. Weyl's amendment to that proposal.  We can adopt that position asking that we -- Mr. Robinson is asking for three hours of video to be played if necessary.  We are to avoid that.  We are going to repeat what we have already said; namely, we will avail a Kinyarwanda interpreter to the parties to help them.  We remind the parties that these interpreters are bound by professional secrecy, confidentiality, and there is no problem.  These are official interpreters of the Tribunal.  If you need their assistance, you can ask for such assistance and it will be done.  We don't work in the afternoons, for example.  And I do believe that you will have the time to do what is necessary to enable us to proceed.  We thank you.  

Yes, Counsel. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I was just standing to proceed.  I was hoping that maybe -- I was hoping that we can proceed at this point.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel.  How much time do you think you need for the clip, two or three minutes?   
MR. WEBSTER:
It's around two minutes, and then I will follow up with a few questions, and then we can break for the end of the morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As regards your questions, how much time do you think you need for those?
MR. WEBSTER:
I would think around ten minutes, Your Honour.  We can break now and then I can take the question - we can play the extract and the questions after we return.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We will proceed, 15 more minutes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Thank you.  

May I have the P. 128 for identification, which is the clip 11B, be displayed on the screen? 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you recognise the image on the screen that played a few minutes ago? 
A.	Yes, I recognised that passage.
Q.	Where do you recognise that from?  Can you tell us what that image pertains to, please? 
A.	I saw President Habyarimana making his speech.  I saw other persons who were attending a rally.  I saw the Interahamwe and soldiers, as well as members of the population.  But mostly, one could see Habyarimana on the screen and as he was speaking. 
Q.	Can you explain to us what Habyarimana was saying in the extract that you saw? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. ROBINSON:
I object to the witness giving any explanation of what was said.  We have a transcript of what was said now.  So it is irrelevant what the witness thinks he said.  That is why we have a transcript.
MR. WEBSTER:
My question to the witness is what he understood.  In fact, this witness has already gone into that area.  So I am simply concluding the admission of this exhibit by referring to something that we already have on the record.  But I would like to follow up and conclude the admission of this -- my application to admit this by having the witness make a few additional comments.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach.  
MR. ROACH:
On behalf of Dr. Ngirumpatse, we object to this line of questioning.  We associate ourselves with what was said by Mr. Robinson.  However, we object more particularly because this evidence was given before we saw the clip that we just saw and we heard what the witness had to say, so it already has been explored.  But if my friend is seeking to have some kind of special interpretation of the words, well, this witness is not a linguist.  He has not been introduced as a person who is a linguist, as a professional witness, to interpret that.  And so we need not to have his opinions.  We have the transcript, as my friend Mr. Robinson said, and that suffices.  What he understands is not the question. But in any event, he has already given that evidence. 
MR. WEBSTER:
This witness -- the previous testimony on this issue was based on the witness's recollection of having attended a rally towards the end of 1992.  I asked a number of questions about what he remembered.  

Now we have the image and the text and the transcript in front of us.  So what I would like to do is to put the same questions to the witness now that we have a recording of exactly what was said, and the witness can respond to the questions that I am about to pose to him right now.  It is not a repetition.  The fact of the exhibit makes it a new question.  My previous submission is that the issue of interpretation, we have already covered that, because this witness can only testify about things as he interprets them and as he internalises them.  So it is following the same line of questioning, and I am suggesting to the Court that there is nothing improper in doing so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we would wish that you reformulate your question.  Maybe you can ask the witness whether what he told us corresponds to what he is now seeing on this screen, but transcript which has been done, we do not believe that he should provide his opinion thereon. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your previous testimony, you commented extensively on the speech that 
President Habyarimana made towards the end of 1992 in Ruhengeri.  Is this the portion of the speech that you are referring to, the portion that was just displayed to the Court and which I have identified for the record as Exhibit 11B?
A.	Yes, it is indeed part of the speech to which I had referred.  And I believe that what I said yesterday corresponds to what I have just heard.  I have nothing to add.  What I have heard goes along with what I have already said.  The only thing that I may add is that, at that point in time, we had understood that Habyarimana was supporting us. 
Q.	When you say "supporting us," can you elaborate on that?  Tell me exactly what you mean.
A.	As you were able to see for yourself, he was saying that the Interahamwe were beautiful in his view and that the national secretariat should, together with traders, find us uniforms so that we remain as handsome as we were. 
	(Pages 15 to 31 by Sithembiso Moyo)









	1145H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thinking back to your testimony from yesterday or the day before, you also commented that Habyarimana said that you should all go down or to "descend," and I don't quite recall the word in Kinyarwanda.  Perhaps you can remind us. 
A.	As you heard, he said that, "I'm going to call them.  I'm going to invite you to descend, go down with me.  I'm going to invite the Interahamwe and we shall descend."  That's what I heard. 
Q.	And simply to conclude, can you remind us of what you understand "descend" to mean, and to "go down"?
A.	As I have explained the last time -- well, he was referring to the combat.  There were parties which had youth wings and these youth wings were carrying out activities intended to support the MRND activities.  Since we were the force of the Interahamwe and that force of the MRND had to be shown, and what Habyarimana said was to put it tangibly, concretely.  I think what I needed to say was that he is the one who was responsible.  We, as the Interahamwe, did not decide any decisions.  He was the one who was to decide where we were to go down, to descend.  They were people who were responsible for these acts, and this shows once again that all the Interahamwe did was ordered by the authorities.  I think it is upon him that -- if that had been possible, to ask him where we needed to descend to. 
MR. WEBSTER:
At this point, Your Honour, I'd like to conclude my direct examination and I think we can conclude for the morning session, if it pleases the Court.  

If I may, one last point.  I'd like to move what I've identified for the record as the clip on P. 18G, and "G" contains a number of clips, but the one that we've just looked at, the one we've just viewed and the one I'm moving into evidence, is clip 11B, along with the transcription which we have identified as 11H, I believe.  Not 11H, P. 18H.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President, to be sure that there's no ambiguity, I understood that all the CDs had been admitted as evidence and that the only matter was to know amongst all that evidence which is the extract we have seen.  I understood that the whole of the CD-ROMs had been admitted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, that is indeed the case, isn't it?  Everything has been admitted into evidence, isn't it? 
MR. WEBSTER:
That was not my understanding.  I thought we had reached a compromise on that because Mr. Weyl wanted everything in, Mr. Robinson wanted everything out, and then I said, okay, well, let's mark it for identification and we'll only admit the excerpt that I'm playing, but I've absolutely no objection to admitting everything, but it seems like you've gotten right back to the same place we started off.  I have absolutely no objection to admitting everything.  

My recollection is that we had identified everything for the record but what was going to be admitted was what the witness just saw, but simply to reiterate, as far as the Prosecution is concerned, everything can be admitted into evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What we had actually said is that we would admit all the six CD-ROMs.  Very well.
MR. WEBSTER:
That's fine, Your Honour.
	(Exhibit No. P. 18 admitted) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, very well.  Well, so we were saying that the six CD-ROMs are admitted as exhibits, as Prosecution exhibits, and the reference thereto is P. 18, P one-eight, from 1 to F.  That covers the six.  Is that correct, Mr. Prosecutor, from 1 to F for the CD-ROMS.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, P. 18 A through F covers the six CD-ROMS, but then there is a seventh.  The seventh contains the clips and that is identified as "G", and then there is a transcript that is identified as "H", and then there's a further transcript and that is identified as "I".  When the registry approached my desk a moment ago, I specified which transcript was which letter, so there should be no confusion, and I'm also marking the CD-ROMS, so there should be no confusion there, and then the registry can make its own independent marking, but I think the record is clear now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  So we have taken due note of that with regard to the Prosecution exhibits. 

Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Could we ask the Prosecutor to kindly disclose to us the CD which contains only the extracts, which is Exhibit P. 18G, if I understood what has been just said correctly?
MR. WEBSTER:
We can do that at a later time.  It's not going to be a problem, but for purposes of moving ahead, everything is identified in the memo, so you can still use the six CD-ROMs to find the references in the excerpts, but we have no problem with providing copies of the excerpts. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think the registry has the number of copies necessary.  Is that the case?  Do you have what you need? 
MR. JUMA:
Yes, we do.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So this will be disclosed to the Defence subsequently.  Thank you. 

Mr. Robinson, are you ready for the cross-examination? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, my friend, Mr. Roach, is going to begin the cross-examination, but as far as I'm concerned, I have still a pending application to postpone my cross-examination until the nine statements are received, and so I would like you to rule on that because I don't think it's fair to allow me -- to require me to cross-examine this witness when we know there are so many relevant materials covering the very same events that have not been disclosed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to rebound a bit, we don't know there are nine statements to be disclosed; I've said that repeatedly.  I'm in the process of going through the materials that were delivered to me.  If there are nine statements in there, they will be served on the Defence.  I don't think we should interrupt the cross-examination of this witness to wait for that to happen.  Certainly, within the next day or so, I should be able to complete my review.  We can start the cross-examination.  

As those materials become available, I will serve them on Mr. Robinson.  I have not seen them myself.  Both parties are disadvantaged by -- at this conjuncture.  I have not had the opportunity to discuss those statements, assuming that I find them, with this witness.  I completed my direct examination.  The cross-examination should start.  These are not essential items to move forward.  We will do our best, but I don't think the Court should interrupt this trial simply waiting for materials that we don't even know -- we are still not even assured if they exist yet. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could just respond briefly.  The nine statements is not something that I've made up.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very briefly, Counsel, because we already have ruled on your motion yesterday. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I didn't understand there to be a ruling on my motion, but if there has been, I won't belabour the point except to say that the nine statements is not something I've created.  It was something filed by the Defence in another case after they went and reviewed the file of this witness in the parquet in Ruhengeri, so it's not a speculation but there's some basis to believe that there are nine statements of this witness that have not been disclosed.

Secondly, I'm supposed to receive witness statements 60 days before the start of the trial, or 30 days before the witness testifies for unredacted statements, and to expect me to cross-examine either without the statements, or within a few minutes of receiving the statements, implicates Mr. Nzirorera's rights to a fair trial and, in my view, would not allow him to have a fair trial. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you did not bring us the evidence of the existence of these nine statements.  You spoke about them, and the Prosecutor said that he was unaware of the existence of these statements and that he was nonetheless going to search amongst the documents he's received from the Rwandan authorities.  And we had stated that the Prosecutor would continue in his search, but that in no event will such search delay the proceedings.  

We are therefore now asking Mr. Roach, since it's Mr. Roach who is to begin the cross-examination of this witness, we are asking him whether he's ready to cross-examine the witness today.  But we also wish to inform you that we are going to sit tomorrow morning. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, I am prepared to start my cross-examination, but I wanted to have a definitive decision on something that was outstanding, and that is our request to strike the evidence with respect to the membership card and the signing of that membership card of the Interahamwe, and we know that you have decided that -- and you have made an order that the Prosecutor produce to us certain exhibits from the Rutaganda case, but we didn't hear a definitive decision with respect to our outstanding motion.  And if you did make such a decision, I apologise that I missed it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  When the Chamber, in fact, asked that the cards be disclosed to the Defence, this was because implicitly it was rejecting the exclusion of this part of Witness GFA's testimony.  So we are confirming that we did indeed render our decision.  We do believe that there is no need to exclude or set aside that part of the testimony. 
MR. ROACH:
I'm ready to begin, but could I ask for a brief recess so that we can deal with a few matters of urgency? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall have a 15-minute break.  Fifteen minutes.  Thank you.  The session stands adjourned. 
	(Court recessed to 1200H to 1222H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed.  
Mr. Roach, you have the floor for your cross-examination.
MR. ROACH:
Thank you.  Just before I do that, Madam President, I just want to inform you that if we are sitting until 1300 or one o'clock, I will not be able to complete my cross-examination.  That's one thing.  

The other thing is that your announcement of sitting tomorrow has caused us some difficulty because of plans that we had to be with our client to go through his speech, which is on the CD, and to go through Habyarimana's speech, also on the CD.  My client is fluent in Kinyarwanda and can help me in that regard, and I have not had an opportunity to be with him to go through those two speeches, and I should certainly like to do that before I complete my cross-examination.  

As I said before, although we had been working on this case for upwards of five years in preparation to come here before you, it did take us by surprise that the evidence, as presented by this particular witness, as it concerns our client was that he had been involved in the way -- in the manner of signing documents in 1992.  So we'd like to have an opportunity to go through those CDs, and we cannot do that before cross-examination is concluded, unless we have some time tomorrow; and on the weekend we can also work on that.  So I'm asking -- I'm moving that we not sit tomorrow, give us an opportunity to not continue with our cross-examination until we have had a proper examination of the CDs so far as my client is concerned. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Roach. 

Counsel Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, during the adjournment, all Defence counsel discussed the situation in respect of the CDs and, for our part, we are all in agreement and would prefer these six CDs and the relevant speeches on them; to be authoritatively translated into English and French so for all parties to have, and for the Court, if need be, to have.  

The alternative is for four separate teams to go about it in their own way, with pen and pencil and a doubtless struggling Kinyarwanda interpreter.  It would be better if we were all centred, and certainly far more time and cost effective, to have one interpreter going through this and providing all of us with an authoritative translation of what is now admitted into evidence, a document, essentially, which the Prosecution deems significant which is going to hinge very much, it seems, on appropriate interpretation, and we should all have access to a proper facility for that. 
It may be that the Court is in a position to assist us by requesting that we do be assisted, from whatever source, by an interpreter of a sufficient level -- and they have to be of a sufficient level for the registry.  I think they have to be what is known as self-correcting translator.  I'm afraid anything less than that won't do, as far as Defence and costs are concerned.  I can assure you of that.  So we need an appropriate interpreter appointed, and one between all of us would suffice.  And I don't know how long it would take.  It may be the actual amount of words that are involved here are not quite as great as five hours of CDs might suggest.  And hopefully, we could all perhaps, if it can be done in a timely way, be in possession of those translations by first thing Monday. 

I hope that concerted thought and request from the Defence, and it is on behalf of all of us, meets with some approval from you, Madam President.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper. 

Prosecutor, do you have any observations? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, all of the parties and the Court would benefit from having a transcription and translation into the two languages, but given my experience with the language section, Your Honour, it's burdensome.  I don't think it's a reasonable allocation of resources to have a team dedicated to translating and transcribing a CD-ROM for which only, if there's four or five hours there, I wouldn't think more than 30 minutes or so are really useful for our purposes.  

Now, I'd like to make another suggestion.  It's really the province of the registry; it's their responsibility to do the translation; I really have nothing to say on the matter.  If the Court order orders them to do a transcription and a translation, they'll have to do it.  But thinking practically for the purposes of this trial, I know Mr. Robinson is anxious to receive his witness statements in Kinyarwanda.  As soon as he gets them, he's going to be asking for translation of those things.  There are other Kinyarwanda materials that need to be translated, and I think it's a misallocation of resources to have five or six hours of a speech of a meeting transcribed when only 30 minutes of it are going to actually be used and discussed.  

So I leave it entirely within the discretion of the Court, and the Court will simply have to -- or the registry or the language section, will have to work that out with the Court.  We would gladly take a transcript, but I think it would be a misallocation of resources.  Perhaps what I could suggest is if the Defence looks at it first and identifies those portions that are relevant and that it's going to rely on in its cross-examination, and once those are identified -- because the tapes do have a counter, if they identify the portions that need to be translated, then they'd be able to make a more reasonable or practical -- I'm not suggesting that the request is unreasonable, but I don't think it's very practicable.
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, in reply, the moment, you see, that the Prosecution say, "Well, there's 30 minutes here that's worth having a proper translation for," which 30 minutes is it?  And by the time we've all resolved that and four teams have sat down with separate interpreters to choose their golden moments of these speeches, we're all going to be left with, one way or the other, a potentially biased and prejudiced viewpoint.  I mean, one's immediately put on alert when one looks at just the limited extract one has and the interpretation that is going to be put on it when shining from the page is obvious ambiguity.  Well, this is going to be the problem throughout.  

And because of the way in which the document has been produced, the CDs have been produced, the lateness of the day in which it's being done, the difficulties that confront of the Defence team because of that, the fact that at least a fifth or a quarter of it is deemed by the Prosecution to be relevant, in all those circumstances, I would say there's a very strong and persuasive argument here for the necessary resource -- and I hope it's not quite as extreme as my friend suggests -- that the necessary resource of straightforward translation be applied -- be applied to the document.  

I've got no doubt, Madam President, as we've already had hints of, this is going to be an area that's going to be visited and revisited, and for all those reasons we need an authoritative clear, whole, unbiased, non-selective translation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, very briefly, I just recall that it was only on Tuesday that you promised our clients that they would have equality of arms, and this is an opportunity to fulfil that promise.  

The Prosecutor had this tape, had enough time to make its own transcripts of those things that it wanted you to hear and to present that in court for the testimony of this witness.  We're asking for the same opportunity, to have the language section prepare a transcript of those portions we want to use, and I have myself designated in writing over the break the portions that I want transcribed, and for us to have sufficient time before commencing our cross-examination to have those transcripts in hand and to use them with the witness in the same manner that the Prosecution did.  

And I ask that you give us the day tomorrow, which was not on the calendar as a trial session, which we just learned a few minutes ago we would be in session for, to take that day to either do one of two things:  Allow us time to have this transcription done, or to begin the direct examination of the next Prosecution witness, if you insist that we use the time productively.  But to make us go forward in a way in which the Prosecutor has been -- in a way in which we're unable to do what the Prosecutor has been able to do, would violate the equality of arms that we accept that you've assured us.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you.  Because of the nature of this case and because we're assured by our friend -- at one time, anyway, he did assure us that this is a case of circumstantial evidence, the speeches by the leaders -- and admittedly this is a leadership case -- the speeches by the leaders are very important, and it is my expectation that these speeches will feature as a very important bit of evidence in this case.  And so we should be careful with respect to reproducing them and bringing them to the Court so that you can see these speeches in their full context and make some decisions with respect to what was meant by these speeches and the circumstances in which they were given.  So we do not take lightly this matter of having proper translations before you, and we would implore you to assist us in obtaining the time and means to properly get these before the Court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Madam President.  I think that as soon as the CDs were admitted into evidence, it is in the interest of everybody, including the Chamber and the Defence -- I remind you the Accused are on trial here and they must be -- benefit from the same conditions as the Prosecution.  That said, we need those materials in every -- all the three languages of the Tribunal. 

I would also add that we receive the calendar, the schedule, for the hearings.  The Defence, in function of that calendar, made its scheduling and its plans.  The Chamber said that it would avail us an interpreter.  We would have preferred at that point, if we lack a transcription -- a transcription certified in the three languages -- we be availed an interpreter so that, together with our clients, we can watch the CDs and hence be in a position to have a fair trial. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Here is the Chamber's proposal.  We propose the following:  You should all meet together with the interpreters in Kinyarwanda -- French, English and Kinyarwanda, that you all meet in a meeting room where the supplies -- necessary supplies are available.  This afternoon you can begin the exercise.  If it's not finished this afternoon, you can continue tomorrow morning and, as such, we will not sit tomorrow morning.  But as of tomorrow, you should have the translation of the six CD-ROMS, and Monday we can recommence without having to postpone any proceedings. 

Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
I want to thank you, Madam President.  This would certainly be satisfactory to us, and we will feel very comfortable when we resume on Monday. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, the only matter I'm a little unclear about is who are the interpreters that you refer to.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Our interpreters; that is to say, those who are present in this room today.
MR. HOOPER:
The official court interpreters? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is it indeed. 

Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, I am just wondering about the logistics of doing that, the securing of the room and the time, and so on.  I would like to get some direction with respect to that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is for that reason we spoke with the registry.  I hand the floor -- who is going to speak on behalf of the registry? 

Mr. Ortega will give you more detailed information.
MR. ORTEGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, I don't know what the -- sorry.  Madam President, I don't know what the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, please ask for the floor and not cut off others whilst they are trying to speak.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry. 
MR. ORTEGA:
Madam President, I can inform you that I have just been informed that we can use the meeting room located in the Serengeti wing.  We are going to take all of the necessary measures and with the interpreters.  I think, in 20 minutes, we can tell the parties when that room will be available for work.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Ortega. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I am just addressing the practicalities.  Could you also allow us to have stenographers in English and French so that we can have a transcription of that which the interpreters are going to relate? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It goes without saying, yes, Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Are we to assume that the Prosecutor is invited to this gathering as well?  Because if we're going to listen to tapes and generate a transcript, somehow it seems to me a bit unfair to do all that prep work and leave this side of the room  out of it.  We are as eager to understand everything that's on the 
CD-ROMS as the Defence.  

I've already indicated our position with respect to this material.  We have received it only three weeks ago.  The transcription that we are going to refer to or that we referred to today is something that existed in the Prosecutor's office for several months because it refers to a different tape of the same incident.  

The only thing that was generated that is new is something that someone graciously offered to do last night, which is maybe just three or four minutes of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech.  So we don't have a transcript either.  If all of these resources are going to be placed at the disposal of the Defence, it seems fair to me that this should be a proceeding that all the parties are involved with. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, this will include the Prosecution.  You can be represented for this working exercise. 

Mr. Roach, you have the floor. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Good day, Mr. Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, just a moment.  One moment, Mr. Roach. 

Do everything possible.  If the parties can agree on excerpts, this would work and it could reduce the necessary time for the transcription on translation of the CD-ROMs.  As we said, you can work on it today, tomorrow, and we will see how we progress. 

Mr. Roach, you have the floor for your cross-examination. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, may I introduce myself to you?  I'm Charles Roach and I represent 
	Dr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 

Now, Mr. Witness, by 1994, what was the level of your education?
A.	I was in the fifth year of secondary school.  I had not yet finished my secondary studies. 
Q.	I see.  And you were a student at that time?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And during the events that you have described to us, were you attending classes?
A.	Yes, it was necessary for us to go to school, but when the aircraft of the President fell, we were in the Easter holidays.
Q.	I see.  And did you return to school after the death of the President and between that time and the time that you fled?
A.	After the President's plane crashed, we were on our Easter holidays, as I have said, and then during the months of May and June, I went back to school.  I can also add that my school was not far from my home.  **********************************************************************************************
            *************************************************************************************************************.
Q.	Very well.  Now, when did you resume school after the Easter holidays?
A.	I have told you that school resumed at the end of May, beginning of June.  I don't recall very well.  Because we spent -- when we had spent a month in school, we saw many refugees were coming from Kigali and we closed the school.
Q.	I see.  So during April and May, school was closed?
A.	Yes, schools were closed. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, you told us that you had some kind of leadership position in the Interahamwe; is that correct?
A.	That is true.
Q.	And were you elected to that position?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And what was the name of your position?
A.	I wanted to inform you that if I were to tell you the post I occupied, that might reveal my identity, and therefore I'm requesting you to recast your question in another manner so that my identity is not revealed.
Q.	Yes, that's fair enough.  And if any of my other questions cause you any difficulty, you can say so.  But you were elected by other members of your group?
A.	Yes, I was elected by other Interahamwe.  So it was the group belonging to the MRND.
Q.	Yes.  And did any senior officials or authority figures have a role in your appointment?
A.	What I can say is that for ********************************************************************************* *****, from the steering committee of the party and from the Interahamwe steering committee.  They therefore requested that ******************************************. 
Q.	And who gave that direction with respect to your proposal as a leader?
A.	Since I was an Interahamwe as any other, with regard to the democracy and independence, anyone could stand as a candidate, but Kajelijeli told us that we needed to have bodies within the Interahamwe organisation, and he asked us to hold elections, and we did do so.  Everyone stood as a candidate and therefore I was one such candidate because I was an Interahamwe like anyone else.  Subsequently, a report was made on the elections and we were introduced to Joseph Nzirorera.
Q.	I see.  And when were you so elected?
A.	That was********.
Q.	In what month*******?
A.	I do not recall the month.  It was a long time ago.  I cannot remember dates.
Q.	Do you recall whether it was early in the year or later in the year?
A.	What I'm certain about is that I was elected after the Interahamwe were formed, so it was towards the*********.  It was after the Interahamwe organisation was set up.
Q.	Yes.  Now, how many persons elected you to your position?
A.	I do not remember the votes I obtained, but at any rate, all I recall is that for me to occupy that post, I was indeed elected.
Q.	And what was the total number of persons who voted, approximately?
A.	I remember that there were more than 60 Interahamwe gathered together.  I do not remember exactly the number of the participants during the election day.  You will understand that this all happened a very long time ago.
Q.	Very well.  Now, as the leader of your particular group, what were your duties?
A.	Once again, I do not know whether I can answer, but I shall try nonetheless to respond.  Normally, when you stand in for someone who is not there, you carry out their duties, but Counsel, please try not to ask me questions which may reveal my identity. 
Q.	If I ask you the duties of that position, would that reveal your identity? 
A.	I think you can find another way of putting this question to me, maybe in closed session, because such questions may lead to the revelation of my identity.  If you can organise a closed session, I'm ready and willing to answer your questions.  Thank you.
Q.	All right.  But, Witness, there were many groups like yours throughout the country; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And there were many people in other groups like yours who had leadership positions?
A.	Yes, quite so.

      1310H
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	And what, generally speaking, was their role? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think we are going into the area that the witness is concerned about.  If he answers candidly, he's going to disclose his identity.  So we can go into closed session.  The witness has made it clear that he'll answer all the questions candidly if we are in closed session.  So maybe we can do that for a portion of the cross-examination and then dispense with this issue. 
MR. ROACH:
I do not seek to go into closed session.  I was simply asking the witness about the structures. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, we also have a problem because -- if this witness were to provide indication regarding his responsibilities, his duties.  He has also said what year he was elected.  That would be adequate for anyone to determine who he is, given the information he has provided, and one can easily identify this witness. 
MR. ROACH:
Very well, then. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Now, Witness, you told us that you were a member of the MRND; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And were you a member of the MRND before you were a member of the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I see.  And did you get any particular training or instructions in your role as a leader of your subsection?
A.	Yes.  I did benefit from training, and I was given instructions, just like any other members of the Interahamwe would receive instructions.  We would receive instructions and we also received training, and yesterday I told you about the persons or individuals who gave us such instructions and such training. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, let us talk about your membership in the MRND.  Did you have a constitution or do you have some documents or by-laws that you could refer to?
A.	Yes.  Thank you.  But I think that this question should be put to Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He is the one who would know whether the MRND had a constitution which governed it.
Q.	Yes.  But I'm asking you if you had any such documents that you could refer to. 
A.	Let me repeat my answer.  To my understanding, for a political party to be able to function, that party needs to have a constitution.  So please ask Mathieu Ngirumpatse if there was a constitution and, if so, whether he can show you a copy of that constitution.  What I can simply say is that we were guided by instructions from our superiors, and in most cases they were politicians, and most of them were members of the MRND.  If they gave us uniforms, it's because they knew, and maybe there was a rule which they were following.  So please ask those political leaders, because they were the ones who gave us our orders.  Ask these gentlemen that you're representing.  They can provide you with the answer you require.
Q.	Witness, I am seeking to know what is your knowledge, and I'm asking you whether you had any written instructions, either from the MRND or the Interahamwe.  Did you have any written instructions? 
A.	To my knowledge, be it Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse or Habyarimana who founded the party, be it Ngirumpatse or particularly Nzirorera, these were people that we respected and therefore we had to respect and obey the orders they gave us.  How could we have asked for a constitution to be given to us?  We trusted him.  We could not first of all ask him to give us their written constitution.  All that we knew is that the MRND was a registered party, just like any other political party. 
Q.	So, you never received any written instructions with your membership?
A.	I've told you this over and over.  We trusted our leaders.  All I can say is that if you're given an MRND membership card, an MRND card which bears the signatures of the leaders, the seal of the party, that was evidence for us that we were members of the MRND and that we had leaders.  The other proof would be the training, the uniforms they gave us, and ...
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, you had a membership card in the MRND, as well as one in the Interahamwe; is that correct?
A.	I had two cards, the one for my membership of the MRND and the other for my membership within the Interahamwe.
Q.	Yes.  And did you have any other documentation that you were given, apart from these two cards? 
A.	No.  I didn't see any such document, but these documents which I had in my possession, which had the logo and the stamp of the party, were sufficient.  If there were indeed other documents, you would require to ask those gentlemen about that.  Furthermore, I'm not the only Interahamwe.  There were many Interahamwe.  Even Robert Kajuga, chairman of the Interahamwe, whom we referred to today, was appointed almost in the same manner.  We were all there.  We were part of the organisational chart which itself belonged to the party.
Q.	Yes.  Well, Mr. Witness, I have several more questions for you, and it will help us if you can answer my question in a concise manner and give us some short, direct answers. 
A.	Very well.  Thank you.
Q.	Yes.  Now, were***************************? 
A.	************************************************************. 
Q.	Yes.  And in that position, did you participate in any national gatherings?
A.	No.  We had a representative who attended that kind of meeting.  I never attended any such meetings.
Q.	Very well.  And your membership in the MRND, was that necessary to be a member of the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes.  It was impossible to be a member of the Interahamwe without being a member of the MRND.  The Interahamwe were, by definition, the youth wing of the MRND.
Q.	Yes.  And what was the relationship between the youth wing and the MRND? 
A.	The relationship was such as exists between a parent and his child. 
Q.	I see.  So you received instructions, like a parent would give you? 
A.	Quite so.
Q.	I see.  And did you have discretion to take any initiative in any matter?
A.	We did not take any decisions ourselves.  Simply we would forward suggestions or questions asked by our colleagues.  We would convey those to our superiors.  We would merely communicate with persons who had such responsibilities.
Q.	Were all your activities confined to political matters or did you have social and recreational or sporting activities as well?
A.	Our activities didn't have any social or recreational element to them.  Our role was to implement the decisions taken by the MRND.  Throughout all this period of time, we did not carry out any social activities, such as cultivating fields or feeding members of the population.  We did nothing of the sort.
Q.	Very well.  Now, I should like to ask you some questions about the war or the wars that you spoke about in your examination-in-chief.  To your knowledge and experience, when was the first war?  Was that in 1990? 
A.	Yes.  The Inkotanyi attacked the country in October 1990.  It was on the 1st of October. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, we are realising that you have gone into another series of questions.
MR. ROACH:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How long will that take you because it will be necessary for us to leave this room, the courtroom, to the other Chamber, which is going to meet in a few moments. 
MR. ROACH:
The wars are going to take me about 20 minutes, in my estimation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

	We shall therefore adjourn here for today.  And we kindly request that we re-adjourn on Monday morning because we are unable to sit tomorrow. 

Now, I would like -- Mr. Roach?  Are you with me?
MR. ROACH:
Yes, I'm with you, very much so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I was saying that if we can adjourn now and resume Monday, at nine o'clock, because we cannot sit tomorrow, Friday, given the Defence request, is that okay? 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Mr. Roach.  

Mr. Witness, we thank you.  Your cross-examination will continue on Monday, from nine o'clock. 

Before we adjourn, I wish to ask the interpreters, the stenographers and the technicians whether they would be ready at 1430 or 1500 hours?  How much time approximately do you need for this afternoon's exercise? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could we have a moment to consult, please, Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As -- in the meantime I'm going to provide you with this information as follows:  This courtroom is not available for us this afternoon.  The exercise will take place in Courtroom II for this afternoon, and in this very room tomorrow morning.  Now, as for tomorrow morning, maybe it will be from nine o'clock.  All I wanted to know was whether they would be ready this afternoon from 1230 -- 1430 or 1500 hours, because we need to take -- to do a certain number of things before that.  I have just received the answer.  It will be from 1500 hours.  So this afternoon from 3 p.m., the room would be -- Courtroom II, and tomorrow morning, tomorrow morning, in this room here.  No problem thus far? 

Mr. Prosecutor, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I wanted to indicate to the Court, responding to your order -- your order of this morning to produce exhibits from the Rutaganda trial, we've been able to do that, so I have Defence Exhibit number 17 and Prosecutor's Exhibit number 472.  I believe that's -- those are the two exhibits that Mr. Robinson requested.  So I've copies for the four parties and for court management and the Bench, but I put that on the record at this time, and if the parties will wait, we can distribute to them as soon as we close this session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you for this information.  So those documents will be handed over to the Defence immediately after this session. 
The session stands adjourned and we wish you a pleasant weekend.
