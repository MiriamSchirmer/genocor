P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning everyone.  Good morning, Witness.  

The proceedings are resumed.  But before we hear the testimony of the witness, let's have the appearances of the parties.  

Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearance for the Prosecutor is as before. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Defence team is made up this morning of 
Mr. Nzabonimana, myself, Vincent Courcelle-Labrousse and our two interns Élise Le Gall and 
Phillippe Larochelle 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Maybe volume should be stepped up," says the witness.  From the witness's speakers, I believe. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it okay now, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it's okay now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, good morning, once again.  And the Trial Chamber would like to remind you about the solemn declaration you made, and that you will continue your testimony bearing that declaration in mind.  

Learned Counsel, we are in open session, kindly advise the Chamber whether you want to continue in this way.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
     No, Madam President, I would want us to continue as yesterday and end in closed session. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, Registry, can we go into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 33] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 2 by Judith Kapatamoyo) 

































MR. MWANASANGULA:
We are in open session, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Could you close the curtains properly on the other side of the witness, please.  

And, Registry, kindly administer the solemn declaration to the witness. 
(Declaration made by Witness CNAJ in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, good afternoon.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before you begin your testimony, we wanted to give you some information regarding procedures in this Tribunal.  

The first thing we want you to note is that you should switch on and off your microphone depending on whether you have been called upon to speak.  When you have finished speaking, switch it off.  If you leave your microphone open, it interrupts the translation of the proceedings.

Your testimony requires translation in three languages and, therefore, while you are speaking, you have to be slow to allow interpreters to translate and the transcribers to record it for the benefit of everyone.  

You will be guided in your testimony by the Prosecution counsel and his team, who are seated on your right hand near the interpretation booth.  When they have finished examining you or asking you questions, the Defence will also ask you questions.  The Defence is seated on the opposite side of the courtroom.  

The Judges may ask you questions any time during the proceedings if they require any clarifications or if they require to pose any questions.  Speak clearly, slowly and briefly.  Don't make long narrations.  Long narrations become difficult to translate and interpret and transcribe.  Wait for questions to be posed to you by either the Prosecution counsel or the Defence counsel, depending who will be asking you questions at a given time before you make an answer.  That way we'll come quickly to the end of your testimony, if you observe the few rules which we have given you.  

Witness, we now need to know whether you have understood our directions.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood the instructions given, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours.  We have put the protected information sheet before the witness and we kindly request for a Kinyarwanda interpreter to go through the sheet with the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, could an interpreter please come down to assist the witness with the protected information sheet.  Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, there is only one president -- one interpreter in Kinyarwanda booth.  I believe the witness can read the document for himself in Kinyarwanda. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is the witness literate in Kinyarwanda or any other language?  
THE WITNESS:
I can read and write Kinyarwanda. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In which language is the protected information sheet?  Isn't it in English, Counsel?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
It's in English, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, do you understand English? 
THE WITNESS:
No. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't seem to have a choice out of this.  Could the lone interpreter come down, please. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We are done with the witness, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Interpreters.  

Prosecution, would you like us to begin in closed or open session?  

MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, we just want confirmation from the witness if he accept that the PIS represent his true particulars. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, the information provided on this sheet is correct in general, but there is a mistake concerning my occupation in 1994.  There was a mistake there, because it is my current employment which is mentioned, instead of the one I had in 1994. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, don't give details, because we are in open session and you are a protected witness.  

Maybe we go into a short closed session so that you can clarify this matter. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Obliged, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we forgot to mention that here we have open and closed sessions.  Open session may be attended by the public if they so wish.  But closed session -- for closed sessions, the public is excluded.  So when we are discussing your testimony in closed session, you should feel free to say anything about yourself, because the public would be excluded from such a session.  And when we are in open session you need to be careful, lest you disclose the information that may identify you.  

We are now going into closed session to iron out the problem regarding the information provided on your sheet -- the information sheet.

(Pages 34 to 36 by Haruna Farage) 










MR. MWANASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President, we are in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are now in open session.  Be careful. 
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, are you in a position to tell the Court what Jérôme Bicamumpaka told the people who were attending the meeting on that day in question? 
A.	I remember that Jérôme Bicamumpaka started by asking a question.  He asked participants at the meeting whether they knew the person who had killed Habyarimana, and he himself answered his own question.  He said it was the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi who had killed Habyarimana.  That is how he started his speech.  I do not know if you want me to continue giving you the highlights of his speech that I remember today or whether the response I've already given you is satisfactory. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court what you can still recall that Jérôme Bicamumpaka told the gathering on that day? 
A.	I thank you.  After that, Jérôme Bicamumpaka announced that he wanted the death of Habyarimana to be avenged, and he went on to ask another question.  He asked the participants if they all agree with his proposition and the participants answered yes.  He went on to say -- and here, I am using his own words:  "The war we are fighting is not a war that should be fought by the MDR and the CDR alone."  And he went on to say that the war had to be fought by all Hutus because they were concerned by the war.  And he asked those present whether they agreed with him and whether they were ready to fight the war.  And all participants said they agreed with him.  They confirm that they were ready to fight the war.  He went on to say that the war concerned every person who was Hutu and added that the enemy was the Inyenzi. 
Q.	And, Witness, what did you understand Inyenzi to mean? 
A.	I do not know if I've not explained that already.  But right at the start of his speech, he said Habyarimana had been killed by the Inyenzi.  And he went on to ask a question, "Do you know the Inyenzi?"  And he, himself, answered by saying that "The Inyenzi were the Tutsi as well as the Hutu who were collaborating with them." 
Q.	Witness, what was the reaction, if any, of Callixte Nzabonimana to Jérôme Bicamumpaka's speech? 
A.	They were all together and Callixte Nzabonimana himself supported the statements made by Jérôme Bicamumpaka.  Actually, all those who were in the living room supported those statements. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court what Callixte Nzabonimana told the gathering? 
A.	Callixte Nzabonimana stated that he was asking members of the various political parties not to dissociate themselves from the MRND party.  And he asked that they should not use an 
	excuse -- as excuse the fact that they belonged to other political parties.  He went on to say that the war concerned every Hutu without any exception.  And that the fact that people belonged to various political parties do not have to separate the Hutus; that they, first of all, had to consider themselves as Hutus.  He went on to say that he was ready to provide any support he would be requested to provide.  That is what I remember from the speech delivered by 
	Callixte Nzabonimana. 
Q.	Yes, you also told the Court that Colonel Aloys Simba spoke.  Can you recall what Simba told the Court -- sorry, can you recall what Simba told the gathering? 
A.	It is true that Simba also spoke and he stated that as a soldier, he was ready to support the Interahamwe in Ruhango once they went into action and that he would provide them with all the necessary material they might need, including firearms like rifles and grenades. 
(Pages 43 to 44 by Haruna Farage)



























1500H 
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	And what did Kayonde, Pierre, told the gathering when he took the floor? 
A.	Pierre Kayonde asked the inhabitants of Ruhango to avoid hiding and to be on the forefront, and to support the Interahamwes.  He added that he was not a visitor because he, himself, was a native of Ruhango, and added that he was ready to provide his support and said that he knew the people of Ruhango very well. 
Q.	And, Witness, can you tell the Court what the bourgmestre, Nathan Mugaga, told the gathering when he took the floor? 
A.	When Nathan Mugaga took the floor, he welcomed the participants at the meeting and expressed his satisfaction with the fact that amongst the participants there were authorities and dignitaries of the regime and announced that he was going to collaborate with the Interahamwe in the fight against the enemy. 
Q.	Witness, are you also able to tell the Court what the director of Electrogaz station told the gathering when he took the floor? 
A.	When he took the floor, the director of Electrogaz station stated that he would provide a field where the Interahamwe could carry out their training, and stated that he had already started that kind of activity. 
Q.	Witness, you told the Court that you did not attend this meeting up to the end.  At what stage did you leave the meeting? 
A.	When I was leaving, participants were still speaking in turn, and I believe it was the journalist who was called Dominic Makeri, who was speaking when I left.  I do not know when the meeting ended. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Makeri is number 11, Your Honours, on the spelling list. 
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	Why did you leave the meeting before it had ended, Witness? 
A.	Some persons who were with me outside started signaling me out and saying I was an Inyenzi, and I felt that my safety could be at stake, so I decided to leave the place. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell this Court how was this security situation like after the death of the president, but before this meeting at Marianne's place?
A	The security situation was not bad.  At that time, no one had been killed so far, and no threats had been recorded, except that we saw a steady stream of people coming from Kigali who told us about deaths in Kigali.  But as far as we, that is, the local population, was concerned, we had not received any threats or heard of any deaths at that time.
Q.	Are you in a position to also explain to the Court the security situation that prevailed after that meeting at Marianne's residence?
A.	After that meeting at Marianne's residence, two or three days later, we started observing massive deaths of people.  Roadblocks were set up all over and manned by Interahamwe armed with rifles and grenades and even clubs.  That is the kind of thing we started noticing after the holding of that meeting. 
Q.	Yes, you mentioned roadblocks, Witness.  What was happening at these roadblocks? 
A.	At those roadblocks, there were Interahamwe who manned them, and they asked every passer-by to produce their identity cards.  And when a passer-by was identified as a Tutsi by means of his identity card, he was killed.  The roadblock prevented people from escaping because it was an obstacle to anyone who wanted to escape.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, other than this meeting that you attended at Marianne's place, did you attend any other meeting in Ruhango? 
A.	No.  I did not attend any other meeting, except that I heard that other meetings had been held.  But I didn't attend any other meeting.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Before we continue, Your Honour, I let this answer pass, but in the two statements we have, we have absolutely no notice of either the witness attending a meeting or of hearing that any other meetings happened.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I'm sure the first part of the witness's answer satisfies the Prosecution.  I was not even soliciting to hear more meetings that he heard or learned from other people. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
In that case, everything is good.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  

Prosecution, continue.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, Madam President, if you could just give me some minutes to consult.  

Madam President, Your Honours, that is all in examination-in-chief of this witness.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Prosecution.  

Defence, any cross-examination?

MR. LAROCHELLE:  
Yes, a few questions, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Where do you want us to be, in open or closed session?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I think it would be preferable to go into closed session, as I will start with questions that may identify close friends of the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Registry, could you facilitate a closed session, please.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I will be using the prior statements of the witness, of which I made copies, if anyone in the courtroom needs.
