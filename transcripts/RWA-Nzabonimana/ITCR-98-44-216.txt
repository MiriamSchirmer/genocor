MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding; Judge Hökborg; and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 14th of December 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T. 

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  The appearances are the same?  

Yes, thank you.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Just one outstanding matter from yesterday, Your Honour, exhibits for the last witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ah. 
MR. O'SHEA:
There's one Defence exhibit, which is the sketch map which was shown to the witness, and that I believe would be D. 184.  Oh, D. 185, I'm told. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  Yes, admitted in evidence. 
 (Exhibit No. D. 185 admitted)  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
And just one exhibit for the Prosecution, the witness's statement that was disclosed.  And I believe that's P. 85, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 85 admitted, under seal)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday we had a -- a matter was raised concerning prison visits.  The registrar has made some preliminary enquiries and told me he thinks he'd be in a position to give a full report later this morning.  So we're not yet ready to respond to the matters that have been raised, but I expect that we shall do that during the course of this morning. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. HOOPER:
The next witness is Professor van Balen. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning -- well, I say "Mr. Witness" to be consistent in the way we address everybody.  And some of our witnesses have to have their identity concealed for their protection.  We thank you for coming to give testimony at our Tribunal, and the first step would be that the registrar will administer an oath for you to tell the truth during your testimony.  
(Declaration made by Henri van Balen in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  In our proceedings, as in most courts, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the counsel designated for that purpose.  Mr. Hooper, Counsel for the Accused, will start. 
HENRI VAN BALEN,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, good morning, Professor van Balen.  And can I start by asking you your full name, please.  
A.	My name is Henri van Balen.  I was born in Belgium in -- on the 16th of August 1930.  I am a doctor by profession, by training.  I am a honourary health professor in the Institute of Tropical Medicine.  

After my training in medicine, I had supplementary training in public health, first in tropical medicine -- I am sorry -- so my career has mostly been in Africa, beginning as a hospital doctor in -- in 1955 in Congo, as it was called then.  I stayed there for three years.  And after the problems, I focused on sterility.  

I had extra training in gynecology, and for that reason I was transferred to Rwanda, where there was a problem of sterility.  And I got to Rwanda in 1959, where I stayed till December 1968.  Working with WHO, I became more interested in the organisation of public health services mother -- the health of mothers.  When the University of Butare was created, I was transferred to the maternity.  And then I was director of the university hospital from 1965 to 1968.  

I returned to Belgium and underwent further training in public health, and I was appointed as a lecturer in the Institute of Tropical Medicine, which is an inter-university institute in Belgium.  I started working with Mr. Mercenier, and we started the public health unit.  I was at the institute, where I was in charge of training for -- organised in Dutch, and Mr. Mercenier was in charge of training in French.  And together we ran several research projects, especially on the organisation of public health services and the management of health systems.  I have been retired since 1995.  
Q.	Thank you very much for that summary.  And just as really a note of interest rather than relevance, when you first went to Rwanda, you were effectively appointed there as a -- as a -- a -- a consultant or medical advisor to the Mwami, the king or the royal family, there; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  I was a doctor in the hospital, but also I was transferred there especially because of a problem of sterility that the royal couple was suffering.  And I had to continue treatment that had been begun and planned by Professor Farrah (phonetic) of Belgium.  And it is on that basis that I underwent further training.  

So it is the government that sent me from Congo to Rwanda to be able to continue this treatment.  So it was for that particular aspect, and not necessarily for all others, that I was sent there. 
Q.	But given the years that you were there, you were there during the change from a colonial administration through independence with the various events that occurred during that time; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, in this case we're concerned with a -- a man called André Rwamakuba, a medical doctor by training, Dr. André Rwamakuba.  And we've heard that he attended a course held at the 
	University of Antwerp, and you've referred already to being, as it were, a -- a co-professor, director of the course, together with Professor Mercenier, who's already appeared before the Chamber and given his evidence here.  And you've explained that, in fact, whereas he took the -- the -- the French side, you took the -- the Dutch or Flemish-speaking side of the course.  That was the essential division of roles between you; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  It was a little more complicated than that; that is, I did not know whether the situation in Belgium can be imagined, but there were changes in responsibilities assumed for training.  So the -- with the Institute of Tropical Medicine, which was not the University of Anvers, but it was supposed to provide training in English, Flemish, and French so that the skills of the Flemish-speaking and English-speaking expats should not be separated.  

Generally, in Belgium you would only have training in Flemish, but that was an exception at the institute.  Within that institute there was, first, two kinds of courses.  There were courses in French and Dutch, which were given mostly to European students.  But there was also -- there were also strangers -- or, sorry, foreigners, but these were mostly French-speaking.  

In addition to that, there were research projects, both in Africa and Latin America and Asia as well, which could be given in English or French or Spanish.  And Mercenier and I were responsible for various projects.  It is clear that I was not really involved in research projects or tailored training programmes.  I was not limited to Flemish projects because there are very few tropical or developing countries where training or projects are conducted in Flemish.  

For this case, in the case in point, the tailor training that was provided to Mr. Rwamakuba was run by Mr. Mercenier because he was also in charge of the research project on the development of health regions or the health region where Mr. Rwamakuba was regional doctor at the time.  

I do not know whether that is easy to understand.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...so would it be right to say that, through the nature of the -- your functions there, your -- your contact in the instant case of Rwamakuba, with Rwamakuba himself, would have been very limited? 
A.	Yes.  It was fairly limited.  Mr. Mercenier introduced him to me, of course, because in our service we used to introduce the people who had come to receive training.  

After receiving the visit from Madam in Anvers, I checked in my diary whether I had given any precise indications as to my schedule.  And I found out that, on the 13th of October of 1993, I indicated in my diary that I was to -- to meet Mr. Rwamakuba to explain to him something about the meeting -- or, the colloquium that was to take place at the institute in December.  And this was for general practitioners.  I wanted to -- I wanted to invite him to take part in the colloquium as part of the tailor training programme, and I was in charge of this colloquium.  That is the time that I saw him formally, but on other occasions, these were chance meetings. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And when you refer there, just for the clarity of the transcript, to "Madam in Anvers," that was a reference to the lead Prosecutor in this case, Madam Dior Fall, who sits, as you can see, to your right.  And I'll come back to her visit to Anvers a little later this morning.  

So you have, through your diary, a clear indication of that, on the 13th of October '93.  But you refer also to chance meetings that would have occurred between you and Rwamakuba during his period of stay here -- or, stay in -- at Anvers.  Now, dealing with the period of stay there, I'm going to pass up, in fact, your original statement, together with its attachments.  And these have been, I think, circulated.  

Now, this is your witness statement, which we can see, or perhaps we can't see because it may not have photocopied very clearly, but it was taken on the 13th of September 2002.  And on that occasion, I, David Hooper, then and now, counsel -- lead counsel for André Rwamakuba, came to where you -- you were, you were working, I think, that day, and I brought with me, as I recall, or as I think you recall better than I, the documents that are attached to the statement.  And we had a meeting, and I think you were good enough there to sign the statement.  
And in your own writing, really to -- to state what it says -- now, as I've indicated, our photocopies probably don't clearly show what's written on the face of the statement.  Could you just read out what is handwritten on the statement after the -- the body of -- of text where -- where -- the bottom bit there.  
A.	"I, Professor H. van Balen, have read this document.  I understand its contents.  I confirm that Dr. Rwamakuba was in Belgium from September 1993 to March 1994.  I have attached the following documents, which I have referred to as van Balen A, B, C, D, and E."  
Q.	Now, let's come back to the documents that -- that follow there, and I think near -- in the case of nearly all of them, if not all of them, these were documents, is it right, that you'd extracted as a result of a request from André Rwamakuba in -- was it 1995 -- to furnish him with documents, relating to the course, that he had lost or had to abandon as a result of his leaving Rwanda after the war of 1994?  

So can you just tell us, just in your own words, please, exactly what those -- or, generally what those circumstances were that caused you to get these documents and where you found them and the purpose for which these documents were originally obtained.  And by that, is it right that it had absolutely nothing to do with any court hearing or supporting material for an alibi? 
A.	Thank you.  Yes, in 1995, must have been at around May of that year, I -- I received a letter from Dr. Rwamakuba.  I think he was in Namibia at the time, and he said that he had had to leave the country, abandoning all the documentation that he had.  And he was looking for work in Namibia, and he was asking me whether I would kindly provide him an attestation, indicating that he had undergone training in Anvers, and that I should also send him his training report that he had prepared for the Belgian Technical Cooperation Mission, which had funded his training.  

This letter was sent to me because Mr. Mercenier, who was in charge of his training at the time, was in -- had been retired as from July or August 1994.  So at that time I was the only head of that -- of this public health unit.  So we took out Mr. Rwamakuba's file, and I remember clearly that we looked at it and we looked at the report, and I indicated in document -- and we indicated that he had undergone training from -- in the times that were indicated in the document.  

I cannot say actually that he had actually gone away on the 27th of March because I was on holiday in Spain from the 20th of March 1994.  So I used this document as my basis, indicating that he had undergone training from the 27th of September to -- 1993 to the 27th of March 1994, and document D is a typical -- 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
A.	-- so this is a typical training report, a tailor training report, and such training was provided by Mercenier and I to -- and me to people who were collaborating in a project with us.  

So during the identification period, we tried to determine whether the person in -- in question required supplementary knowledge, and if this was determined to be the case, then we will try to organise something that would meet that need.  The fact that it was organised from the end of September -- well, actually, the training began at the institute from end of September or the beginning of October up till March.  

Now, it was organised because it was an opportunity for him to attend public health courses that were given in the French training course that I mentioned at the outset, and these courses were provided from the beginning of October to the end of February.  So these courses were not limited to extracurricular -- to the institute, but they involved group work on health problems and organisation of services.  This was also the opportunity to choose from other courses provided by the institute, one of other courses on computers or public health.  So -- but this was really a training course tailored to suit his needs.  

And the only thing that he mentions in this report also that he attended was the colloquium on the training of general practitioners, of which I was in charge.  And this was in December 1993.  The other documents -- 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)

So generally you've been referring there to Exhibit van Balen D, Rapport de stage, and can we just turn to that just so we have it in our own minds and are familiar with it.  We don't have an English translation of it, but I'm not going to go into it in detail.  

But we can see from the first page of the report that it states that it's held at the Institute of Medicine -- Tropical Medicine of Anvers, and it says on the front of the page, face page, "27th of September '93 to the 27th of March '94," which is, of course, precisely six months, "par Dr. André Rwamakuba," and then we've got "stage, financed by the General Administration of Cooperation and Development in Brussels."  

And it's then not many pages long, three, four pages long, and this, am I correct in saying, is a document that is produced by the individual stagiaire at the conclusion of the course, summarising his participation in the various courses that he can take or are offered to him during the time of his six-month course at Anvers?  

That -- that would be a fair summary, would it not, of what this document represents? 
A.	This certainly represents what is correct, is the plan of activities that we find in there.  You also see that the drafting of the end-of-course report was begun on the 20th of February 1994.  It hasn't been mentioned here when exactly he left Anvers so...(microphones overlapping). 
Q.	-- because you're more familiar with the report than the rest of us.  
If we look at page 1 of the actual text of the report, we have under paragraph 1.3, "Plan d'activités," and we have at the bottom there "Rédaction du rapport de stage," so stating basically he started to make his report on or from the 20th of February 19...(microphones overlapping).  
A.	(No interpretation)...yes, 20th February. 
Q.	-- 1994.  

Now, thank you for drawing our attention to that.  We can see in that paragraph, too, the various courses that he participated in in respect of the seminars that were held, all of those health-related.  And over the page we can see that he followed other courses relating to, as you've said, at 2.1, information, that is, computers, Harvard Graphics, et cetera; in 2.2, demographic exercises in particular areas; 2.3, immunology and what that comprised; at 2.4 there's reference to the ninth European course on epidemiology, tropical epidemiology, and that he participated in.  

And over the page at 2.5, there's reference to a colloquium, an international colloquium, held at Anvers from the 15th to the 17th of December 1993.  And I think you touched on that, did you not, in your evidence a moment ago?  You referred -- is that the course that you referred to, Professor? 
A.	Yes.  This is a colloquium that is not really a -- this is a colloquium that I had to organised (sic) and to which I invited people in October.  And it consisted in presenting -- making presentations and carrying out workgroup (sic) by participants in the colloquium, which usually ended with the designing of programmes that could be adapted to various countries.  So this is a colloquium that lasted three days and not a course, as such. 
Q.	And then at 2.6, we have the course, it's only just part of the programme, of public health.  Follow -- given by, as we can see at 2.6, Professor Mercenier, and it highlights -- or, Rwamakuba highlights his -- the -- the benefits or the focus of the course in respect of that.  

Looking at this document, would it be right to say that the student, in this case Rwamakuba, doesn't arrive merely to attend a series of lectures that are given but so much as to participate in a course that is modeled for his own particular requirements and needs under the direction of either you or Professor Mercenier?  Is that right?
A.	Yes.  This is customised training.  When you look at all of this, you will see that it is not something that was organised for a group.  He took part in lectures that were organised within the framework of other training courses.  But he had chosen to participate in one course or the other.  

I must also say that, for the public health course that was given by Mr. Mercenier, apart from the extracurricular courses or lectures that were given by himself or by his assistants, there were also -- there was also group work that was organised where the training must prepare -- make a presentation on counselling.  That's another problem.  And that presentation, or exposé, is usually made around the end of January or the beginning of February, in general.  This is a lecture that is customised or tailor-made and is cushed (sic) on existing courses.  But he did not follow all the course, for instance, that normally students would follow within the framework of national courses and in which Mr. Mercenier is part.  

So in tropical medicine there are clinical courses, but he didn't follow all of them.  He had to be acquainted mostly with the concept of public health, the concepts of management of public health systems, and the collection and analysis of data, statistical data, epidemiological data as well.  

So definitely he is the one who prepared this report, to answer your question.  I found this document in the file that was there in 1995.  And this file, that was preserved for a number of years.  Unfortunately, when we went to Anvers, all those files, after a number of years, are disposed of.  But I know that I found him in the files that were still existing, and he is actually the person who drafted or prepared this report at the time.  And this is why, once again. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...so having seen that, the report, and noted the dates on it, 27th of September to the 27th of March '94, you found that report.  And if we go to van Balen A, headed 
	"Prins Leopold Instituut voor Tropische Geneeskunde," underneath that there's an attestation by you dated the 22nd of May 1995, signed by you, in which you declare who you are, and certify that André Rwamakuba attended a stage, 27th of September to 27th of March, organised, et cetera.  And that's dated Anvers, the 22nd of May.  

Now, if we go to van Balen B, which you produced, this is another attestation, but not yours, is that right?  This is, as we can see, from Professor Pierre Mercenier, who has given evidence, as we know, here.  And this document reads that "The undersigned declares that André Rwamakuba did a stage at the Tropical Institute from the 27th of September to the 9th of March 1994."  

And I can say and tell you that we have a passport with that date showing an exit out of Belgium to Rwanda on the 9th of March.  So that was more particular information that he had that perhaps you didn't.  Would that be fair to say? 
A.	Certainly there's some inconsistency between this and what I have in document A.  But if this document -- well, it is true that this document was signed by Mercenier and was also in the 
	Rockwell (sic) file that I sent to Rwamakuba, at his request.  If I used the other date, it was merely because he applied -- he was going to use it to apply for a job.  And generally that is the period that was covered by the scholarship -- six-month scholarship.  

Now, in document A, to go back to it, I recall, and I also disclosed with the secretary who signed the document, and who is still a secretary in the Institute of Tropical Medicine, that is, he's -- she's a secretary of the public health unit -- 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...for a moment.  Can I take you to -- sorry.  
A.	(Microphones overlapping) 
Q.	No, it's just so we can deal with the documents.  

Can I go, then, to van Balen C.  There's a letter dated the 28th of January 1993 addressed to Coopération Belgo-Rwandaise at the -- for the Région Sanitaire, health region of Kigali -- it's addressed to them -- for the attention of Drs. Rwamakuba and Monet, who is, as we now, our next witness this morning.  And it's signed E -- I, sorry, Bogaert, or Bogaert -- 
A.	(Microphones overlapping) 
Q.	-- right.  Now, is that the secretary that you've just referred to? 
A.	Yes, that is the secretary, Isabelle Bogaert. 
Q.	And just looking at van Balen C, again, is that a document you extracted from the files back in 1995? 
A.	I can't be very positive, but I suppose that that was true because this was a part of the documents.  In any case, this refers to things that took place on the field.  So insofar as the preparation of the regional -- preparation for the regionalisation for public health systems in Kigali, Mercenier had to go there in 1993, that is, to Rwanda, in order to hold a discussion and to prepare for the project with Mr. Monet and Mr. Rwamakuba, who were the two officials responsible for the project.  

And, as you can read here, they had requested that he delay his trip.  But because of his course schedules, he couldn't change the date, so -- which is why you see the date of the 5th of April '93. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...a context from Professor Mercenier whereby it was, in fact, Dr. Monet, he told us, who had suggested that the mission be put back because of difficulties being experienced -- political and social difficulties being experienced in Rwanda and that, in fact, Dr. Rwamakuba had encouraged Professor Mercenier, in fact, to go.  

And this letter, in its summary, says that Professor Mercenier has received the letter of the 
25th of January and, unfortunately, it will be difficult to -- to delay the mission to Rwanda by a week.  The dates have been fixed, and we would like to ask you to maintain the 5th of April 1993 as the date of arrival for Professor Mercenier, et cetera, et cetera.  

Now, you, yourself, were mentioning a moment ago, before I interrupted you to take you to that document, you were mentioning Ms. Bogaert.  Was that in the same context or in a different context?  And can you help us, please? 
A.	When I talked about her a while ago, that was within the context of document A.  
Q.	And can you just remind us what that -- what you were saying about her in respect of document A, please.  
A.	This was also a document that was in the Rwamakuba file.  The only thing that I remembered personally, independently of this, is that there was a question that Mr. Rwamakuba, at the end of his practical training -- there was a question as to whether Mr. Rwamakuba would take part in an international meeting that was organised by the World Health Organization in Egypt.  I did not know the details.  

I asked Isabelle if -- that is, Isa Bogaert, if she still remembered something about it.  The only thing that she remembered independently of the documents, which she no longer had because, in the meantime, the files had been destroyed -- so when I asked her the question now, she said she could only remember that she had made bookings.  And, according to the bookings, she (sic) had to leave Brussels to go to Egypt before going back to Kigali.  But she had -- but she couldn't remember if the bookings were successful.  

But this document, which was prepared by her -- and I think we can check this at the WHS (sic) if the person there received it -- but here already you see that she knew at the time that it wasn't possible, as part of the scholarship that Mr. Rwamakuba had from the Belgium cooperation, that she couldn't do this.  Apparently the trip was finalised by others.  So in this document she makes mention of the fact that she made the bookings for the -- Rwamakuba's travel and mentioned this to the WHO personnel that had to pay for his travel.  But she didn't quite know how everything ended, but she does remember the bookings. 
Q.	Right.  Now, when did you -- first of all, if we look at van Balen E, which is a letter dated the 
	25th of February 1994 and signed by Isa Bogaert, secretary, public health at -- as we know, at Antwerp, addressed to Mr. Robert Bos, executive secretary PEEM, P-E-E-M -- what is PEEM, please?  It's got "World Health Organization."  What does P -- do you know what P-E-E-M stands for? 
A.	I'm sorry, but I -- I don't know it.  Once again, I found this document in the documents, but it must be a unit of the World Health Organization in Geneva. 
Q.	And when you say you found this document, would that be back in '95 you found the document? 
A.	Well, I can no longer recall at what time I found it.  But I suppose so.  All of this -- all of these documents were sent at the same time, and I think it's in 2002 that I signed a statement where I recognised or acknowledged the documents.  But I can no longer say if I took this out of this file later or at that time.  The logical thing would be to affirm that all the documents were taken out at the same time. 
Q.	All right.  Now, we don't need to read it all, but let's just look and see what's on the face of this document.  And it's written in English to Bos of the World Health Organization in Geneva, and it reads, "Regarding Dr. Rwamakuba's participation in the forthcoming PEEM, P-E-E-M, meeting in Aswan, Egypt, we made the following flight reservations."  17th of March, Kigali, 0820, arriving Brussels, 1720, with a flight number, 18th of March, Brussels, 1830; Cairo, arriving 1145 at night, Egypt Air; and then 28th of March, Cairo to Rome -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	28th of March, Cairo, departing 0700 to Rome; from Rome to Brussels, arriving 1335; and the 
	30th of March, Brussels, 2230, arriving Kigali, 0625.  

It goes on to say that the reservations have been made such-and-such a place.  The price of the ticket is 65,000 Belgian francs.  Since -- and then it reads, "Since Dr. Rwamakuba will leave Belgium beginning of March, we would like to have a confirmation on how to obtain his ticket as soon as possible.  Yours," et cetera, Isa Bogaert, the secretary.  

Now, you refer a moment ago in your evidence to having had a conversation with Ms. Bogaert.  Can I ask you, when did you have that conversation?  Was it back in '95 or was it more recently, or both, or what? 
A.	No.  In 1994 I had no reason to hold a conversation with her on the subject.  It was with Mercenier that she dealt with the stage contents.  But I talked with her on the day that we were visited by the Prosecutor at Anvers, because that is when Isa said that she remembered having made reservations for a flight for him.  But the only thing she could remember were the dates.  And since the file was no longer in existence and that this letter had been sent, or had been brought out of the previous file, she no longer had a copy and no longer had any precise information to give details.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	(No interpretation)...yes. 
Q.	So that was a conversation that you had with Isa the day the Prosecutor in this case came to Anvers.  And was the -- was your understanding that the Prosecutor -- the -- Isa Bogaert had told the Prosecutor this information? 
A.	It is because she told me, if I have to get into details, that we had an appointment with the -- with the trial attorney.  And I was still at home, and the appointment had to be held at the institute.  But the mission had arrived one hour before the appointment, so she telephoned me, and I came as quickly as possible.  And in the meantime, I think she had a conversation with her.  In any case, it was on that occasion that she talked to me about -- about it, after having reminded me that she was remembering having made the reservations.  But she didn't mention all these details. 
Q.	Did she tell you that she had -- this is what she told the Prosecutor? 
A.	Well, she's told me she said -- she had told the Prosecutor that she remembered having made those reservations for him. 
Q.	And at that time, is it your understanding that Rwamakuba was himself dealing with Isa Bogaert in Antwerp? 
A.	The only thing that I know is that the students, or those who were undergoing training -- well, insofar as administrative problems were concerned, it was with her that they dealt with such problems, and they ironed them out.  So naturally the -- the document would be read by Mercenier before sending them to PEM (sic).  

Well, once again, it is Mercenier who was the delegate responsible for the training, and he is the one who will deal with the matter at first instance.  

But, once again, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that these were reservations.  These were not tickets that had been ordered for.  It was a letter that was sent to the WHO to tell them that bookings had been made and that they could pay for the tickets. 
Q.	Yes, I -- you explained that this was a prospective booking, the booking could be picked up and paid for, as we -- as itemized here, but that there had been a problem because it wasn't going to be paid by Coopération Belgo, but by somebody else, perhaps the Rwandese government.  
A.	Since this was forwarded to the WHO, I would rather be of the opinion that it is the WHO that would pay for the tickets since they're telling them the price of the tickets (microphone not activated) "his ticket as soon as possible." 
Q.	Isa Bogaert, she still works, does she, at the -- from what you say, she was at least working there a month or two ago at the institute; is that right? 
A.	Yes, she still works at the institute. 
Q.	And she remembered having dealings with Rwamakuba over all this, though not the details? 
A.	Yes.  Well, she does remember that she talked with him in order to make the reservations.  But, once again, she no longer recalls the precise dates. 
Q.	Now, the next witness is Dr. Monet, Francis Monet, and my understanding is that you've known that gentleman for a long time.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I've known him for a very long time.  He was recruited as an assistant at the public health unit in 1972, '73, for a development project -- for a project for the development for the health region in Kasongo in Eastern Congo.  He remained in contact with our unit, and also while he was with the Belgium cooperation later, for projects that were being carried out in Rwanda. 
Q.	And if you don't mind me asking you this, can you help the Tribunal as to his reputation for truthfulness and honesty? 
A.	Yes.  He can -- one can say that he is very serious, both in his work and in his relationships; otherwise, we would not have maintained contact.  And from the experience that we had with him in Kasongo, I don't think if there was anything inconsistent with his honesty I would maintain contact. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Professor.  If you could just wait there a moment, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Witness, you now have to be cross-examined by the lawyers representing the Prosecutor.  So the Prosecutor will now ask some questions of you.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  As the President has just said, after the examination-in-chief led by the Defence, I am going to put some questions to you which would concern mostly details or clarifications of what you have just said.  

You said that in 1993 you were at the Tropical Research Institute in Anvers and that you -- and you confirmed that Mr. André Rwamakuba did come and undergo training there.  

When you were questioned, you talked about customised training, and you repeated the tailor-made or customised training on several occasions.  And I would like you to be clearer as to what you understand by "customised" or "tailored" training.  
A.	Tailor training would mean that Mercenier and myself organised this for our collaborators of people working in one project or the other.  And we tried to check with him what was lacking in their training, and we would look for the most efficient way of making up for this.  This is also a method that was used in Kasongo to train doctors, district doctors, for instance.  

Now, for the specific case of Rwamakuba, since Mercenier met him in 1993, I think it must have been in March 1993, he said, well, he lacks training in the management of health systems, both at the level of skills or -- as well as -- as far as knowledge is concerned.  And one other thing that was lacking was to be able to gather or collect and correctly analyse data for the management of a system.  

Now, when you say it is the programme or the training is customised, it's not like you have to be beside him every day.  The question you ask is what is most convenient.  If I said the -- this course should take place between September and the end of March, it is because this corresponded with the francophone programme and the -- generally, the last month was usually allocated for -- for exams.  But up -- but in February there were courses that had to be undertaken.  And he was also given the opportunity of being acquainted with public health concepts and with the management of systems integration of specific programmes in a public health system -- in the health system.  

During that period, and within the framework of all the courses as well, there were lectures on epidemiology.  There were lectures on population issues.  And you can see that we told him you could follow this lecture or that one and that these various lectures correspond to this thing or the other.  Plus, there was also a good library.  If you see the person that is undergoing the training, from time to time you ask him if your courses or the lectures meet your needs.  Well, we also tell them, "Well, you have to work on your own, too, because you have the library, and that this is what you need in order to complete your training." 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...Witness, from what you have just said, may I deduce that, as part of this training, André Rwamakuba had perhaps less restraint than students who were regularly -- were regular students of the institute? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...but of course.  He was required to attend the courses that were indicated in his training report, and Mercenier's courses or course was the public health course, and that included group work.  This means that it covered the beginning of October till the end of February, at least. 
Q.	Witness, you said that it was Mr. Mercenier who was in charge of this training of -- 
A.	Of that programme. 
Q.	Of that programme, and that you were not personally involved, if I understand what you say, and that you just met André Rwamakuba at some point.  When I asked you, you told me that it was just the once.  You said that this was in the corridors when he was introduced to you.  
A.	Perhaps I may have said "in the corridors," but that is why I checked my diary again.  "In the corridor" means that Mercenier said, "Well, don't you want to meet Mr. Rwamakuba, as you were in Rwanda?"  And we talked about it.  But I had a formal interview with him.  I think it must have been Mercenier who said, "Talk to Rwamakuba."  And I see in my diary "13th October, invite Rwamakuba on -- for the colloquium -- to the colloquium on general -- for general practitioners." 
Q.	So if I understand you -- I shall return to the dates of the training.  But during that training, you met André Rwamakuba once in the corridors, as it were; another time, as you remembered later, on the 23rd of October, when you asked him to come to the colloquium.  

I suppose he attended the colloquium?  Do you confirm that? 
A.	I suppose.  I was in charge of the organisation, but -- so I did not go to see whether he was actually there. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)  
A.	I cannot confirm I saw him.  I gave him precise instructions at that time.  I cannot confirm that.  I saw him once in the corridor, but -- by chance.  We used to meet by chance from time to time, but the -- the one time I mentioned was the first time. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	That Mercenier said we should meet. 
Q.	So I shall have you confirm, once more, that you cannot formally say whether he was present at the colloquium that was organised from the 15th to the 17th of December 1993.  
A.	Well, it was a large group.  If he had been there, I wouldn't be able to tell you.  I had no particular reason to go and determine whether he was there or not.  But if you will allow me, I will say that -- that all the training provided -- or, sought to meet needs expressed by these people. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  It's very important to us.  

Witness, I am now going to come to the various documents that you sent, and you did say that you sent the documents after you received a letter, or you sent that document after you received the letter from Rwamakuba in 1995, I believe.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Well, I shall come to the first document, which is van Balen A.  This is an attestation that you issued.  In this attestation you, as it were, attest that André Rwamakuba underwent training from the 
	27th of September 1993 to the 27th of March 1994.  You have told us that these dates were indicated based solely on the training report of Mr. Rwamakuba. 

Mr. Witness, does this mean that in that case also you cannot say categorically that during that period, 27 September 1993 to 29th March 1994, André Rwamakuba actually attended these courses? 
A.	Certainly not.  I couldn't follow him up.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	I was not in charge of that. 
Q.	All right.  
A.	I did the report because Mercenier is retired.  
Q.	So you are not basing your report on concrete facts but only on dates that appear on a report; is that right? 
A.	Yes, this is his training report.  I'd like to repeat this once more:  I did this only because he was looking for work in Namibia and he needed an attestation to show that he had received further training at the institute. 
Q.	Your answer is very clear.  I shall now move on to document van Balen B. 

In this document, which was prepared by Professor Mercenier, you, yourself, were able to observe the difference between the dates on this attestation and the dates that you, yourself, had indicated on yours.  Since Mr. Mercenier was actually in charge of André Rwamakuba's training course, we might set more store than -- on these dates than on those that you indicate; is that right? 
A.	These are the dates that were indicated in the unit, so I shall not dwell on document C because these -- it refers to events that occurred in 1993, and I have no reason to dwell on it.  
Q.	I shall now come to the training report itself.  You said, Witness, that André Rwamakuba was being supervised by Professor Mercenier and that you did not supervise his training.  So he was not at all under your supervision? 
A.	No. 
Q.	When you read the document after the face page, the very next page shows on paragraph 2, it is mentioned that -- as follows:  First, under the supervision of Professor H. van Balen and Professor Mercenier of the Research and Training Unit for Public Health of the 
	Tropical Medicine Institute of Anvers, and so on and so forth.  

You see that there is a little problem there, isn't there? 
A.	Well, I don't know if it is a small problem.  I've told you the problem.  There were two service heads in the unit, van Balen and Mercenier, and the letterhead of the institute indicates this.  So, together with Mercenier, I was running the unit.  But I was not 100 per cent responsible for his training.  The only thing that I helped him with was the colloquium. 
Q.	So you confirm that you were not his supervisor, do you? 
A.	No, it was Mercenier who was in charge. 
Q.	I shall look at this training report -- report further, and I think that if we look at all the dates indicated in this report, unless I am mistaken, you realise that the courses that André Rwamakuba took and to which he refers in this training report and on the 11th of February 1994 (sic).  
A.	I don't know where you can see the 11th of February. 
Q.	After the face page, this is the second page, where you see "planned activity," in French, you will see various dates on the document.  But it is under 1.3, "Planned Activity," and the third asterisk under that you see "11/10/1993," "11 February 1994" as well.  And you will see that this is the dates that he uses to show that he attended courses.  
A.	Of course, when courses ended, he had to go to the library to read things, I suppose because he started his training --
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	-- he ended his training on the 20th of February, but -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	-- I think that the end of formal courses, official courses, was on the 11th of February 1994.  But this does not mean that he did not have further contact with Mercenier for analysis of other things.  
Q.	We agree, because Mr. Mercenier indicated that the last contact ended on the -- was on the 
	21st of February 1994. 
A.	Yes, I agree. 
Q.	Witness, I shall now come to the document van Balen E. 

These are reservations that were made by the secretary of the institute, as you told us.  You confirmed to us, actually, that this was information that she was giving for the WHO, and it was up to the WHO to actually make the reservation.  
A.	No, actually, to order the ticket.  
Q.	Yes, order the ticket.  And I think you're right, in that when you refer to the passport of 
	André Rwamakuba, which was disclosed to us, you realise that Rwamakuba, as indicated on the passport, left Brussels on the 9th of March, that he got to Kigali on the 10th, that he left again on the 17th of March for Egypt, and he only transited through Brussels, and I think he left on the 29th to return to Rwanda.  Sorry, the 27th.  

I have a little problem here, because the dates that appear on the training report, indicating that it was from the 27th of September 1993 to the 27th of March 1994, raises a small problem.  Because from the 9th of March, André Rwamakuba was not in Belgium.  Will you agree with me? 
A.	Yes.  Well, the only information I had at my disposal was the training report.  And he had a six-month scholarship, and I didn't really worry about the exact dates.  I just would wish to issue him a document which he would require to look for work.  So it is clear, therefore, with this document that he was no longer in Anvers.  But, as I said -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	-- I myself went on holiday on the 20 -- 20th of March. 
Q.	That is important -- that's an important clarification.  

You also told us that during that training course you, yourself, were not there.  You have been categorical about not being his supervisor, so I shouldn't dwell on that.  You also said that, in this kind of training, the supervisor was not with the student 24 hours a day.  Does this mean that when you were not in contact with him you were not able to monitor what he was doing? 
A.	That is obvious.  We had no reason to monitor them.  They were adults who had been invited to undergo training.  We had no reason to -- to verify where they were on a daily basis.  
Q.	You are an important witness, I believe, because I know -- I think you know why you were asked to come here.  It is because you have to say that, during the entire time when André Rwamakuba was in Belgium, you can attest to what he did and this would clear him of responsibility.  But what I understand that you are saying is that, apart from the times when you saw him, you cannot say with any certainty what it is that he did.  
A.	Yes.  I can only say that he received a scholarship from the Belgian cooperation mission, which involved a return trip, Kigali -- Kigali-Brussels return trip on one occasion.  He had to rent a room, so I do not think that he must -- he could have had much funds at his disposal to do pretty much as he wished.  
Q.	Another point, if you were asked -- you were asked to say something about what you thought of André Rwamakuba, and you said in a few words that you knew him, you thought that he was a serious person.  When you were in Rwanda, did you know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	No.  I was in Rwanda in -- from April 1959 to December 1968. 
Q.	Did you know him well when you were Belgium? 
A.	No, I did not know him well.  I met him.  He made a good impression on me, but that's all.  I cannot assess his personality. 
Q.	That is my last question:  This brief knowledge you had of André Rwamakuba, do you think it would allow you to assess this person? 
A.	No, no. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  You now have the person who -- Mr. Hooper now has the opportunity to ask you a few further questions. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
RE-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	It was suggested you knew why you were brought here.  It's never been your case that you can help this Chamber as to where André Rwamakuba was on every day of the period that he was in -- or, the period during which he was in Belgium.  That's never been your position; is that right? 
A.	I really don't understand the question. 
Q.	Well, you see, a moment ago the Prosecution were suggesting you were here because you came here to tell the Chamber where André Rwamakuba was every day, between September and March.  But I think I'm correct in saying that's never, ever been your position; is that right? 
A.	Oh, that's clear.  I really cannot say where he was all the time. 
Q.	And indeed we have your statement (microphones overlapping).
A.	I did not have the intention of doing that either.  
Q.	In fact, we have your statement with what you were in a position to give evidence about, which was producing documents.  And that was it.  

I can't explain, I'm afraid, Professor van Balen, why you've had to be brought here at great expense all the way from Belgium.  But I do thank you for your attendance, and I do thank you for your giving evidence in this case.  

And perhaps there's just one other matter that my colleague suggested you might be able to assist us with, and it's this.  He, unlike me, is an academic.  And can you help me as to this:  In a -- on a university course, such as the one that André Rwamakuba attended, we can see there are courses you attend, i.e., lectures and seminars, discussion groups, whatever it may be.  But what proportion of the actual work that a student does in those six months would they comprise?  And to what extent would a student be expected -- what proportion of his time would he be doing working on his own, as a mature student, and attending libraries, researching, reading?  Can you give us just a general idea of the kind of balance between the two? 
A.	I'll give you a general idea.  For the public health course, I must say that, apart from the training with Mercenier, there was a lot of group work.  Those who attended the course were divided into groups of five or six people to address a particular problem and see how it could be solved in a particular context, taking account of the resources that could be mobilised.  To that end, they had to go to the library, read some -- read up, and then come back to work into groups.  For epidemiology, it was the same thing.  So a serious student would have half his time devoted to personal work and half of -- the other half devoted to lectures and group work, on the whole, I'd say.  
Q.	And your understanding is the Prosecution met and talked with Isa Bogaert, the secretary; is that -- is that my -- a clear understanding that I have? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  I have no other questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry.  Professor van Balen -- well, there's a mutual request here between Dr. Rwamakuba and Professor van Balen for permission to meet, we hope, in circumstances a little more generous than have been experienced by other witnesses.  But that's a matter to be resolved later this morning.  But they'd like to meet, if that can be arranged. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, permission is granted.  

Mr. Witness, we thank you very much for coming to give testimony before our Tribunal.  It's now concluded, and you are free to go.  Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
In terms of this witness's exhibits, can I produce the statement, together with van Balen A, B, C, D, and E, as D. 186, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D. 186 admitted)  
MR. HOOPER:
And I see the time, but I've got just a matter to raise very briefly, and it's this:  I seek clarification of the Prosecution's position in respect of the secretary, Isa Bogaert.  I'd like the Prosecution to confirm or deny that there was a conversation with her; that in that conversation she told them that she'd had dealings with André Rwamakuba when he was in Belgium; and that she had, in fact, made tentative booking arrangements.  Because we are going to take that up in Belgium, so I'd like a careful reply.  

And the -- the matter came to my ears only through discussing events with this witness, and I'm very concerned if, in fact, what I've heard is correct and is not a matter that I'm content with dealing with the Prosecutor directly.  I want to do it through the Chamber.  
THE WITNESS:
Finished?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, Professor van Balen, yes.  That's -- 
(Witness excused)
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I really do not understand the concerns expressed by Mr. Hooper because, before we went for -- to Belgium, we received all the documents and information regarding the people that we were supposed to contact.  When we learned that there was a secretary at the Institute of Medical Research, we contacted the secretary to find out when we -- it would be convenient to come and see the professors and all of the people who were serving as alibi witnesses.  

And it is based on what the secretary said that we prepared our mission.  It is the secretary herself who arranged our meeting with Professor van Balen, who were accompanied by judicial police officers.  We arrived a little while before Professor van Balen was there, and she received us very well.  We just asked her for how long she had been a secretary there, whether she knew André Rwamakuba.  She answered, and she said that she even made a reservation for him at one point.  

And Professor van Balen arrived at that point, and in her presence we began to talk with the professor.  So I really do not see what Mr. Hooper finds odd in this situation.  
MR. HOOPER:
We've never spoken to Isa Bogaert, nor have we ever submitted a statement made by her to the Prosecution.  And yet here is a circumstance where the Prosecutor has spoken to a wholly independent person.  That person has confirmed Rwamakuba's presence in Belgium during the period of alibi, and gone further than that and confirmed discussions in respect of the Egypt conference.  

None of those matters were disclosed to the Defence.  As far as I can see, they never would have been.  I find that extraordinary.  And if the Prosecution can't see that they have a basic duty of fairness, which they've, I'm afraid, demonstrated again and again, they don't seem to see, then it's very difficult to explain what the proper conduct should be.  For the Prosecutor to go, effectively, to find, to talk to, and to have confirmed such exculpatory material and not to disclose it, in any way, to the Chamber is beyond -- well, is, in my submission, a fundamental breach of their position.  

We may consider a motion for sanctions.  In fact, we are considering a motion for sanctions.  

MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we are waiting for that motion, and we shall respond to it.  I just wish to point out that I shall request that the same equity be applied in the case of Mr. Hooper.  Because we didn't work on just any document.  We worked on the document van Balen E, which was disclosed to us by the Defence and which includes all reservations which were the subject of our discussion.  

So I still say that I do not see why there is a problem.  We are -- we were preparing a cross-examination.  We went to that place, and we used the documents that were disclosed to us well before by the Defence, including the problem of reservations.  We have discussed this at length.  They included the name and signature of the person in question.  So, Mr. President, I should be very eager to find out what arguments Mr. Hooper intends to develop in his motion, and I can assure you that we have no problem with responding to such a motion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think it's necessary for us to make any ruling at this stage, and so we take the morning recess.  
(Court recessed at 1036H)

(Court resumed at 1108H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming to give testimony before our Tribunal.   As a preliminary step, the registrar will administer an oath to tell the truth.  
(Declaration made by Francis Monet in French)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, you will give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose, commencing with the lawyer representing the Accused in this matter. 

Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
FRANCIS MONET,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Your full name please, sir? 
A.	My name is Monet, Francis Camille Paul Germain. 
Q.	I think you have before you there a curriculum vitae, which is being distributed, comprising two pages.   And we can there see your date of birth, that you're of nationality Belgian, married with two children; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	We can see your address in Belgium at -- is that Thier or Thier Saint Léonard? 
A.	Yes, Thier Saint Léonard. 
Q.	The curriculum vitae sets out in a little detail your expertise and qualifications and your work.  And we can see that you are by training a medical doctor; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You are a graduate as a doctor of medicine from the University of Liège, and you have subsequently specialised in tropical medicine as a hygienist and, in particular, specialised in medicine and medical systems for developing countries; is that right? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	The second page of the CV, working backwards, shows us that from December 1973 to November 1980 and beyond you were working in Zaire at Kasongo.  After that you worked six years teaching at the University of Rwanda at Butare in your specialist subjects; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Of particular relevance to this trial, of course, is that from January 1990 to April of 1994 you were the project chief on behalf of -- would that be Belgian -- Belgian assistance? 
A.	Yes.  I was working for Belgian Technical Cooporation. 
Q.	I will come back to that in a moment.  

Subsequently, after, as we will hear, having been forced to flee Rwanda, from '97 to - indeed, up to the current time you have been working in Burkina Faso on behalf of the World Health Organization; is that right? 
A.	In Burkina Faso I started by working in the Belgian embassy for a Belgian cooperation.  And then since June 2000 I worked with the WHO right until the 30th of November 2005.   So I just left the WHO a few days ago and returned to Belgium on the 2nd of December 2005.  

Right now I will be reabsorbed into the Belgian public service.  So for now I am 59 years of age and, in principle, I should be able to work up to the age of 65 in the Belgian administration, either in the ministry of health or in the ministry (unintelligible) cooperation.  At least that is what is suspected.  For now, I am on holiday. 
Q.	Thank you very much for giving some part of that holiday up to travel all the way from Belgium to here.  Now, can we come back then to your work between January 1990 and April of 1994.   And can you just briefly describe what it was -- we can see some part of it indicated in your CV, but what it was that your functions involved, in particular '93 and '94 in Rwanda. 
A.	At the time I was working in the support project by the Belgian cooperations.  I was working in Kigali.  I was working with the director, the medical officer who was in charge of Kigali.   In 1994 there were four different chief medical officers, so it was general support to develop a health district in the Kigali health district region.  So I had to supervise nurses in the health centres.  I had to train and provide refresher courses to the nurses, and in 1993 there was also a scientific support by the Institute of Tropical Medicine.  

It is within that framework that Professor Mercenier came in April 1993 to Rwanda for 15 days, and he was present at the time of the events as well in Kigali.  So the idea was for him to support us in all our work in the health region, to provide lectures to nurses, and there was also strategies for guidance in diagnostic treatment which we were trying to develop.  

At the same time we also coordinated all our emergency operations because there were several refugee camps in the Kigali health region.  There were displaced persons coming from the northern part of the country.  There was a major camp in Nyacyonga, near Kigali, and another camp in Rutongo.  There was another camp in Bugesera.  These included people that had came from Burundi.  So there were many activities in the health region.  

At the same time, we also had to maintain the health system to ensure that it operated well.  We did so by providing support to industrial work, especially insofar as refugee camps were concerned. 
Q.	You mentioned the camps and you mentioned one near Nyacyonga.  Generally in your experience, what kind of level of facilities, health facilities and sanitary and other facilities, were to be found in these camps for displaced people at that time? 
A.	Let's say that the camps were assigned to humanitarian organisations.  In Bugesera there was médecins du monde, and there was also the médecins sans frontiéres in a camp near Kigali.  So they brought all the necessary equipment, but there was also coordination work that was necessary to be done.  These organisations didn't have to absorb all the nurses in the area, so we tried to look for the means, and we also tried to make sure that the camp dispensaries operated well, as well as other dispensaries.  So there were many meetings held with the humanitarian organisations that were managing the health systems in camps, but there was also supervisory work carried out by those organisations.  

So at that time, I think that was in 1992, '93, there were epidemics of dysentery, and we had to go and look at what was going on, and also tried to collaborate in identifying germs.  There was lots of work for us to do.  

We must say that there were also very many meetings held with all the organisations that were working in the camps.  The meetings generally took place in the UNICEF office in Kigali.   But there was also WHO that participated, and every day the médecines sans frontiéres, médecins du monde, and the Red Cross that were involved in camps.  Part of the work was also done in the health region with the humanitarian organisations in the camps for displaced persons. 
Q.	Thank you.  We have some idea of, obviously, the city of Kigali and the entire surrounding area which we know is called Kigali-rural.  In that area, all that area was covered by a regional health secteur that was directed by a man called André Rwamakuba.  Did you have occasion to meet André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I worked for him from the time he was appointed -- from the time he was appoint -- from the time of his appointment, I think it was in 1992 that he was appointed director of the health region, but before then he was a doctor in the Kigali health centre for a number of months, but I can't recall the exact number.  
But I knew him especially when he became director of the Kigali health region, so we worked on a daily basis together.  So I knew him.  

Obviously, subsequently he left for a good number of months; that was in September when he went to Belgium and came back on the 10th of March 1994.  And in the meantime another doctor was appointed to act in his stead, and he acted as the director of the Kigali health region.  

So prior to the 23rd of September, I worked with him for about a year, and then we saw (sic) again for two weeks, because when he returned on the 10th of March, he stayed there only for -- he stayed in Kigali only for one week and went back on the 17th of March and came back on the 29th of March.  So for two weeks we were virtually together before the events; that is, between September  and 6 April 1994 he was -- he was present only for a period of two weeks in Rwanda.   And it was within the framework of the collaboration of the Institute of Medicine that he travelled to Belgium to undergo studies under the sponsorship of Coopération Belg.
Q.	I think as you now know, we have had the advantage of the evidence of both Professor Mercenier and Professor van Balen from the Institute of Tropical Medicine, and I will come back to that area in a little more detail in a moment.  

In respect of working with André Rwamakuba on a daily basis, were you able to form an opinion of him as to the kind of man he was, and if so, can you share that with the Chamber, please?  
A.	Yes.  I always found that he was a very honest person, a very rigorous person in his work, and he was very hard working.  So we formed a very good team together.  He was really a good person. 

We never had any problem, and what did strike me is the fact that he was angry one day.   I don't know exactly why.  I think it was in 1993.  He had come back from the ministry and they had tried to change the candidates that had been proposed for scholarships, and they wanted to replace Tutsi by Hutu, and he wasn't very happy with what was being done because the list had been changed.  

And I think he behaved in the same way with everybody in the health region.  If somebody made a mistake, he would call the person and tongue-lash him.  He didn't display any authoritism, no nepotism.  It was on the basis of the work that was done that he dealt with people.  So he didn't show any difference in the treatment of people.  To him, only work mattered, and we generally talked mostly about work. 

I can also say that -- if I had a contact with a Belgian doctor colleague, because -- or, rather, I met a Belgian doctor when I was going to Burkina Faso.  I talked to this doctor and told him that I was coming here and he also was the head of the emergency unit in Kigali centre, that is, Dr. Julian Michel.  And he told me that he had very good relations with Rwamakuba while he was working with him, and that he was an extremely honest person, and that he was very diligent at his work and generally he was a very worthy person.  But this is a digression.

Well, that is the opinion of another doctor who once worked with Rwamakuba.   But I must say that outside work, I went once to his home, and this was before he went to Belgium.  So we went and ate lunch at his place.   But outside work, we didn't see that much of each other. 
Q.	Are you in a position to help us at all as to his politics or involvement with politics, or any political aspect of his life? 
A.	From the political perspective, we never talked politics at the health region.  I must say that recently I was told that he was a member of the MDR.  I had even forgotten about it because we didn't talk about that.  That was not a concern to us.  Our concern was the fact that, despite the difficult situation that had been prevailing for many years, we had to maintain the quality of health services in the health region.  

We also wanted to develop the health district of Rutongo.  That was also a concern for us.  We also wanted that health care in camps should be adequate; for instance, when there was a breakout of an epidemic in the camp, there was much work to be done.   So generally we never -- we seldom talked about politics.  I even forgot that he was a member of a political party, because this wasn't an important matter in our relations. 
Q.	You have spoken of an example of his being angered by discovering that Tutsi applicants adversaries were being disadvantaged.  Did you ever witness him express or demonstrate any prejudice towards the Tutsi ethnic group in any way? 
A.	No.   Actually, he never showed any difference in treatment.  To him, everybody was on the same footing.  Everybody had to do his work, and the person who didn't do his work as he should was reproached, in the same way as I would reproach anybody.   And he encouraged everybody in the same way as well.  I never saw in him any discrimination whatsoever. 
Q.	Now, one aspect in your evidence, which the Chamber is perhaps particularly concerned and interested, is your knowledge of André Rwamakuba's presence in Belgium in '93 to '94.  And I would like to come to that, and then after that deal with your knowledge of André Rwamakuba's movements from the time of his return to Rwanda from Belgium, his then trip to Egypt, and then finally what happened in the days, both before and shortly after the 6th of April when Habyarimana was killed.  So dealing with those essentially three areas, can I come to the first one, and that is, André Rwamakuba's trip or studies in Belgium.  First of all, during that period, am I right in saying that you remained in Rwanda, or not? 
A.	I was present in Rwanda between the months of September and April.  I never left Rwanda during that period. 
Q.	Do you have diaries that cover '93 -- the relevant portion of '93 and '94 that we are concerned with? 
A.	I have the diaries here. 
MR. HOOPER:
Those diaries, of course, are available for inspection.  They have been photocopied and those photocopies have been distributed.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And so with reference to your diaries, and looking at the original diary entry, can you take us first of all, please, to what you know of André Rwamakuba's going to Belgium.  

Now, we have heard about the course it's on.  I think we have probably got a pretty good idea of what that was.  So I perhaps don't need to trouble you so much in respect of that.  But really, the coming and going of André Rwamakuba during this time to your knowledge, can you help us as to when he left Rwanda to go to Belgium to commence his studies with Professor Mercenier and the school of tropical medicine? 
A.	I remember that I went to the airport to see him off.  He came at the very last minute.  I was a little upset because he wasn't coming in time.  He'd had a party at home and he had not had -- he'd had trouble finishing packing his luggage and he arrived on time.  

He left on the 23rd of September.  It was 6:30 or 7 o'clock in the morning, and I was at the airport.  So, of course, I was, as I say in my diary, at the airport.  For his return I was also at the airport.  It was the 10th of March in the morning.  I was at the airport.  I welcomed him when he arrived. 

After that, he told me that he had to go back again and he returned -- and he went away -- 
Q.	We'll just come back to that.  Let's just take that chunk of time then.  So the 23rd you see him off, 23rd of September, and 10th of March he comes back.  
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And we have his passport and you're welcome to look at that too, sir, if you wish, but it confirms your position.  But can you tell me this:  In between times, to your knowledge, did André Rwamakuba return to Rwanda, and if he had done so, would you have known about it, et cetera? 
A.	To my knowledge, he did not return to Rwanda.  It was practically impossible for him to return to Rwanda without my knowing about it, because everyone knew everyone else.  If he had returned, first of all, he would have contacted me, or I would have been told.  I know he left on the 23rd of September; I was at the airport, and he returned on the 10th of March.  In the meantime, he did not come to Rwanda. 

I'm practically sure that he never returned to Rwanda in the interval, otherwise I would have learned of it. 
Q.	Now, after his return on the 10th of March, did you see André Rwamakuba, apart from meeting him that morning at the airport? 
A.	Yes, I saw him.  We saw each other every day.  We worked together.  But in addition, on the 11th of March, we went to Rutongo together to the hospital.  There was a delegation of Belgian MPs which was visiting the hospital, and he was the director of the health region, so together we went to Rutongo. 

So on the other days I used to see him in the health region, of course. 
Q.	Now, can you deal, please, with his next trip from the country and what you know about that; when he left and when he came back, please? 
A.	I noted in my diary that he left on the 17th of March and he returned on the 29th. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)... looking at your printout here.  Can I just step back, I'm sorry, step back to going to Belgium.  We have part of your diary photocopied.  I'm showing the 23rd of September, and am I right in saying that that indicates his flight departure, and it's marked at the top of that page "6:30, aéro Rwamakuba".  Is that the reference there to the September departure? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  So I went to the airport for Rwamakuba's departure, and that is what I indicated in my diary.  After that, I returned to the health region, and after that you have a crisis committee meeting for the management of displaced persons, or camps for displaced persons and refugees.  So this was a meeting with various humanitarian agencies. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)... wish to mark it if we want to, but that's the only reference on that page extracted from your diary, 23rd of September '93.  The next page showing the 9th of March - 10th of March, I should say.  Again, is there a reference there, a contemporaneous entry by you for that date of the 10th of March '94 indicating the arrival of Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes.  So I went to the airport to await for Rwamakuba's arrival.  Then I went to the health centre on the -- I went to the Rutare health centre, which is on the way to Ruhengeri.  I went to supervise it.  I went there after I came from the airport. 
Q.	The next day you can remember the visit to Rutongo.  There is a reference to Rutongo on the 11th.  

Over the next page, page 3 extracted from your now 1994 diary, and again, on the 17th, a photocopy reflecting again your contemporaneous entry for the 17th of March, and Rwamakuba referred to when he left for Egypt.  Do you know why he was going to Egypt? 
A.	I no longer remember why he went to Egypt, but in my first statement I thought I remembered that he was going to Egypt.  But I didn't take it down.  I think he was going to a meeting, but I do not know exactly what sort of meeting.  Obviously it was a meeting about public health, but I must admit that I don't really remember what the meeting was about.  

So I indicated departure because he was leaving.  He returned after a few days, but there was the burial of the husband of the woman who had been working at the health region, but he was not there because he was away, of course.  So I indicated that this was the husband of one of the ladies who worked with us. 
Q.	Again, referring to another contemporaneous entry, this time for the 29th of March 1994, which, again, we have a photocopy, does that indicate the return of Rwamakuba from Egypt? 
A.	Yes.  This is the return from Egypt.  So I went to Genda health centre in Bugesera in the morning, and when I returned, I saw Rwamakuba at the health region in Kigali, and that is when I saw him.  This was in the evening.  So I don't know at what time he arrived, but that is when I did meet him. 
Q.	For the succeeding eight days, can you indicate as far as possible, with reference, of course, to your diary, what meetings or opportunity of meetings you had with André Rwamakuba over the subsequent days?  Let's go, first of all, to the 30th of March, the day after his return from Egypt.  Do you know if you saw him on that day? 
A.	On the 30th and the 31st, we had a meeting of all the head nurses of the health centres.  And since we had moved to new buildings, since the health region had moved to these new buildings, we had a meeting room that could take everyone in the health region offices, whereas before, when we organised meetings, we had to hold them elsewhere.  We had to rent elsewhere because the former buildings could not take 45 people.  So we had the meeting on the 30th and the 31st in the offices of the health region itself, and it is he who chaired that meeting of these head nurses during those two days. 

The meeting ended on the 31st and, after that, we had a meeting to prepare the visit of Professor Mercenier amongst ourselves because we had to prepare this visit, address problems, and see what we needed to organise.  So on the 30th and 31st I worked with André Rwamakuba and I did, indeed, see him. 
Q.	And now we move into April, Friday the 1st of April.  
A.	The 1st of April, on Friday, I really do not remember, but actually we had the death of the wife of a Belgian doctor colleague.  So according to my diary, I went and visited, and in the afternoon I went for the burial.  So I do not remember much about that day, apart from the fact that this lady was ill, that this lady had been ill, and I learned in the morning that she had died. 

I would say that it was not a smooth working day for me.  He was a Belgian doctor who was working in the ministry, and I think that his wife died on the 31st in the evening.  So this is a day that I do not remember much about in terms of the work I did, so I really cannot say much about it. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)... the Saturday and the Sunday, the 2nd and the 3rd; were you in Kigali at that time, or not? 
A.	It was Easter weekend.  So we went to Kigufi, which is near Gisenyi.  I think it's 200 kilometres or so from Kigali.  Kigufi was managed -- was a hostel run by reverend sisters.  I went with my wife and two children for the Easter weekend -- this is on the shores of Lake Kivu -- and we stayed there during the Easter weekend. 

I returned on the 4th to go and fetch Professor Mercenier from the airport.  So from Kigufi I dropped off my wife at the house, and I went directly to the airport to wait for the Sabena flight on which Professor Mercenier was arriving. 
Q.	Can you recall if André Rwamakuba was at the airport or not? 
A.	I do not remember his presence there, but it is probable that he was there, but I do not actually remember his being there.  I was with my children.  He may have been there as well, but I don't remember. 
Q.	Tuesday the 5th of April; can you help us as to that day? 
A.	For the 5th of April we began with a meeting with Rwamakuba and Professor Mercenier in the morning, and in the afternoon we went together, the three of us, to see the director general of public health in the ministry. 
Q.	The 6th of April, which is, of course, the day that the plane gets shot down at night, that evening; can you help us as to that date? 
A.	Very early we went to the health region office with Mercenier, and then, together with Rwamakuba, we went to the WHO to see the WHO representative, Dr. Mambu, and then we stopped by the Belgian embassy to see Mr. Schrijver, who was the head of the cooperation section.  He was also the head of the medical secteur, but we stopped -- after that we went to the Muhima health centre, but we had to return in the afternoon.  And then we also went to the Cukiro health centre.  

We did all these trips together.  He was the director.  He was the pilot of the project.  He was also the head of the Belgian project because, since 1992, it was no longer a Belgian who was in charge of the project.  It was run by Rwandans.  I was called co-management delegate, as you will see on my CV.  So he was head of the Belgian project, but this was in addition to his being director of the health region.  

So in the afternoon we went to Muhima health centre.  I do not believe he was also there at that time because we had already established the contacts we needed in the morning.  So Mercenier and I, I believe, went to the health centre to talk with the doctors and so on and so forth, and after that we went to the health region and we talked with André Rwamakuba again on that occasion, and we drew up the programme for the following day. 

We left relatively early, because I think there was still a curfew, so we would leave at about 5:30.  I might stay -- I used to stay a little later, but I was advised not to do so because it was a little remote and the situation wasn't very clear, and we were told to leave the buildings before nightfall. 

We also see that in my diary that there was a theft in the pharmacy on the 9th of March.   Medicine had been stolen in the pharmacy of the health region.  So, actually, we wished to leave the buildings, which were a bit remote, before nightfall. 
Q.	I haven't referred back to your diary, but we see entries which assist you in providing the evidence you are giving.  The night of the 6th of April found you where?  
A.	On the 9th of April I was at home.  The 6th -- so, on the 6th of April in the evening, I had invited Professor Mercenier and his wife to my home.   And when we were having dessert, so when we were dining, we heard an explosion, but it sounded fairly distant.   And 15 minutes later (unintelligible) called us.  She was the wife of the French co-pilot of the -- she was the wife of the French co-pilot of the president's aircraft, and she told us that her husband had died.  

So at this point we turned on the radio and they were still talking about the Arusha meeting.  They had not said that there was a crash on the radio, and so I accompanied Professor Mercenier and his wife to the local hotel, which was not far from my home, which was at the end of the street.  Then I came back home and I took the wife of the co-pilot, who had gone.  Actually, the wife of the co-pilot had gone to meet the wife of the pilot, who lived a little further off.   So I took my wife to meet the two women who had lost their husbands.  She stayed there and I returned home, and I thought that it might be dangerous.  

So at about 10:30 that evening I went to fetch them again, and when I left that house at around 11 p.m., we began to hear the first gunshots, and I hurried back home.  And at that time we were told it was a total curfew; we couldn't go out of our houses, so we were trapped there. 
Q.	I think this dramatic turn of events led to you being, eventually in stages, removed from Rwanda with your family and taken eventually to Belgium, arriving there on the 13th of April; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  Actually, we were ordered to leave.  The head doctor, or Dr. Ruppol, was in Belgium at the time and he called me and said that it would perhaps be well if the doctors stayed back to handle any medical emergencies.   But we had the order from the Belgian minister that we should evacuate.  It was obligatory.   Because in 1990, during the first unrest, we had a choice.  My wife had gone away for a month, my family went away for a month, and I stayed back in Kigali.  That was in October 1990.  But this time we were all to leave, and we did not have a choice.  It was a matter of obligation. 
Q.	Just for the stenographers, the name was Ruppol, R-U-Y-P-U-L? 
A.	Dr. Ruppol is R-U-P-P-O-L. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  So the night of the 6th you get your wife home, that's you, your family and your two children there, and over the next several days did you have any contact with André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes.  I had contact with André Rwamakuba and many other people, because we were lucky in that the telephone worked all through, and so I had contact.  I had phone calls from several Rwandan doctors.  And I called him, I believe, twice before he was appointed minister.  So he was at home; I called his home.  We did not have cellphones at the time, so I called his home on two occasions, and on both occasion he was at home.  And when I heard that he had been appointed minister, I called him just the once.  But I do not know whether this was on the 8th or on the 9th. 
Q.	We know the government was named on the 8th and sworn in on the 9th.  But on one of those days you called André Rwamakuba, and what was the purpose of your call; can you recall? 
A.	No.  I really don't know.  I called him because we used to work together.  The situation was disastrous, and we used to listen to Radio France.  We had TV, we had TV 5, which is a French station, and we could see everything that was going on in Rwanda.  

In addition, I had been called on the 8th because, since the curfew had been imposed, between the two various houses, we had made paths, so that we wouldn't go into the street, in order to visit our neighbours.  

I had been called that some children had been wounded in a house, and I had to go and treat them.  So the children had escaped from another house which was nearby.  The parents had been killed.  I think soldiers had come in and killed people, and we treated the children and they were taken by the International Red Cross Committee which was the only organisation that was able to move about in town, and the ICRC took them to hospital.  

So there were gunshots.  Belgian soldiers killed two Rwandan gendarmes a few hundred metres from our home, and there were gunshots all the time. 

And I think on the 8th, also, we had a phone call.  There were heads in charge of security area, so there was someone in charge of the Belgian area, and we got a phone call that they were going to search the houses of the street to find Tutsis.   But we had our Tutsi cook, who we hid in the house, but in the end they didn't come around.  So it was a very tense situation.  So we used to call around everywhere.  

The director general of health also called me to tell me that he was still -- he was hiding under his bed, and they had come to kill him.   And I called Belgian soldiers to go and rescue him, and the Belgian soldiers told me that they themselves were trapped in their homes and that they couldn't move, and that they were a few houses away from there, but there was no way they could intervene.  

Actually, the telephone was used quite frequently for obtaining news and finding out what was going on, and so on and so forth.  So I did call André Rwamakuba at that time.  

Actually, I had mixed feelings because I wondered whether he could do something, but I really didn't believe that he could, because, well, you know.  So I called and I told him that I was not going to congratulate him for being a minister and that the massacres must be stopped.  That's it.  So it was not really the newly appointed ministers who could have done -- who could have said something.  At least, that is how I felt. 

I also thought that it was since I had lived in Rwanda for a long time, for more than ten years, and I knew that if a person was appointed minister, he couldn't say no.  So he was more or less obliged to take up the position.  So that is what I thought at the time. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  Can you just wait there a moment, please? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper. 

Mr. Witness, you will now have to answer questions put to you by the Prosecutor.  He will now have the opportunity to cross-examine you.  

Mr. Prosecutor?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Dr. Monet, a moment ago you told us that when you contacted Rwamakuba on his becoming a minister, you said that you did not want to congratulate him on becoming a minister.  Do you remember saying that a moment ago? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And also you told us that you told him that the massacres must stop; is that right? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	When you were speaking with Rwamakuba, as a newly appointed minister, you felt, is this right, that he was someone who should be accountable for what was taking place; is that right? 
A.	No.  Actually, I thought that he had been forced to accept the position of minister, and he was in a rather tenuous situation, I believe. 

But I felt that if he was in a position to say anything, probably he could influence the events.  But I have doubts because the real power, in my opinion, was not in the hands of the government; it was in the hands of the military chiefs; it was in the hands of the heads of the militia.  The real power wasn't in the hands of the minister. 
Q.	All right.  We will come back to that in a few minutes.  Can I go back to the beginning of your helpful testimony.  You've told us that your diary records Rwamakuba being absent between the 23rd of September 1993 and the 10th of March of 1994; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, sir.  Yes. 
Q.	Rwamakuba was somebody you were working for; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  We worked together, and this was within the framework of Belgian projects who were coup managers, which means that we were responsible for the assistance that Belgium was providing under those projects, and in other projects, because there were major -- there was a major Belgian project in the Kigali hospital centre.  So they were kind of coup managers. 
Q.	Can you help us with why you would mark picking Rwamakuba up from an airport in your diary?  What would be the reason for marking that in your little note, which you have helpfully provided us with, and keep a record of having met him at the airport? 
A.	What I jotted down in my diary was my movements.  I went to the airport, and I went to the airport to welcome Rwamakuba.  When I went to the airport to welcome Mercenier also, I wrote it down.  It was part of my timetable, as it were.  So that is it.  I used to jot down what I was doing and with whom.  So I went to the airport to welcome him, or to receive him. 
Q.	That's helpful, thank you.  Can you go to the 29th of March where you've marked, whilst you were at one of the health centres, you encountered Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Why have you made a note of his name there?  It's not part of your movements; it's simply somebody you met.  
A.	I went to the Uganda health centre.  Actually, if I recall well, I was very happy that he had returned for the meeting of the next day, because it was a meeting with all stakeholders in the health centre, and it was my wish that he should be present and that he should be the one presiding over the meeting.  

Now, when I look at my diary now, I went and worked with the WHO for five years in Burkina Faso.  So when a representative wasn't there, the WHO representative wasn't there, I was acting on his behalf.  I worked for more than ten years with WHO.   So when the WHO rep -- representative came, I also wrote it down that he was there, because that kind of released me.  Because besides my work, I had the work, for instance, of Burkina Faso.  I had to do the work of the representative and of which was rather burdensome.  

So I noted it down because he had come back.  Actually, I went back to the diary of the time, but I was happy that he was present for this seminar of stakeholders, because it should be the director of the health region himself -- it was good that he should be the one presiding over the meeting, rather than somebody who was working with technical assistance from abroad. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, leaving your diaries aside for the moment, how long did you work with Rwamakuba prior to his going to Belgium on the 23rd of September of 1993? 
A.	Actually, I don't know exactly when he was appointed the director of the health region.  I believe it was in 1992 ending, but I'm not very certain.  What I know is that already in April 1993 he was there.  

We had a visit by Professor Mercenier, and he was there, so we worked together.  He had already been there for several months, because when Mercenier came, I believe there were four directors of the health regions.  At the time there was first Dr. Gianna (phonetic); I think there was someone who was called Kazima (phonetic), Nyodisingira (phonetic), and then Rwamakuba. 
So as for him, I think he began in 1992 ending.  But let's say when you work with somebody all the time, you quickly make an assessment of him.  After a few months, and even after a few days, you see the person with whom you are dealing with by the way the person works. 
Q.	I was only asking how long you'd worked with him before September of 1993.  It seems that you had been working with him from the end of 1992; is that right? 
A.	I worked with him when he was appointed director of the health region.  But I don't quite know the precise date of his appointment.  I believe it was in 1992 ending. 
MR. HOOPER:
I can give the date, or at least the month.  It was April '92, if that helps.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Hooper has helpfully reminded the Court that he was appointed in April '92, so would it be right that you and he were working together on a daily basis between April 1992 and September 1993? 
A.	Yes.  We worked together.  As soon as he was appointed the regional director, we worked together. 
Q.	You told us earlier that you never discussed politics; is that right? 
A.	No, I never discussed politics with him, no.  In any case, I don't recall having discussed politics with him. 
Q.	Were you familiar with the existence of a party called the MDR? 
A.	Yes.  The various parties were known.  When multiparty politics were ushered in, we did get to know the various parties.  But I must say that I had forgotten that he was a member of the MDR, but I was only reminded of this recently, but I had completely forgotten about that. 

Since this really didn't matter in our relations, in our day-to-day relations, we never talked politics. 
Q.	Is it right that you were unaware of Rwamakuba's level of authority within the MDR prior to his going to Belgium on the 23rd of September 1993? 
A.	No.  I was not aware of his level within the MDR, absolutely not.  I did not know that he had a role to play within the MDR.  Well, if he had a role to play, I don't know. 
Q.	His appointment as a minister came as a surprise, did it not? 
A.	Yes.  It surprised me. 
Q.	It would be right, would it not, that his appointment as a minister would have surprised you as to the level to which he was involved in politics; that's fair, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	To some extent, he had kept the level to which he was involved in politics secret from you; that would be fair, wouldn't it? 
A.	That I don't know.  Let's say this is a subject that we did not broach.  I saw that he was at work all the time.  He was always at work.  I never heard him say that he was going to attend a project meeting or something of the sort.  Nobody had told me that he had attended a meeting or not.  So I have no idea.  I did not know if it can be said that he kept it a secret.  

Prior to that, well before that, I knew certain doctors, Rwandan doctors, who had been appointed ministers just, you know, by chance.  For instance, when I was in Butare there was a professor who was appointed minister.  He said he wasn't expecting that.  He was appointed, you know, without his having knowledge of the possible appointment. 

I don't know -- I think, as in many countries, there are key figures in governments and then there are others who are somewhat appointed by chance.  I wouldn't say by chance.   I'm not talking about that period.   I'm talking about things that happened in general.  We have seen people who were appointed ministers almost without their having played any major role in politics, at least to my knowledge in Rwanda.   And I'm talking about the period prior to that one.  

I was surprised that he was appointed; probably it is also a surprise to him.  I really don't know anything about it.  In any case, I know others who were surprised that they were appointed ministers in Rwanda before the period in question. 
Q.	You told us in that long answer a moment ago that you were never aware of any times that Rwamakuba attended any political meetings in the time that you knew him; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  I was never privy to that.  I was never aware of his participation in such meetings. 
Q.	And, in fact, you don't know anything of the circumstances under which he became appointed a minister, do you? 
A.	No.  Not at all. 
Q.	He was, is this right, a director of the Kigali regional health -- I'm thinking of the right word -- he was responsible for health questions within the Kigali region; would that be right? 
A.	Yes, he was doctor and director of the Kigali health region, and was therefore responsible for the supervision over the entire health services of the entire health region.  That included both the town, as well as Kigali-rural, which went from Bugesera to the northern city of Rutongo and Ruhengeri. 
Q.	In that capacity, were you aware that he was issued with a second and official passport? 
A.	No.  I have no idea.  Insofar as the passport is concerned, I don't know.  Passports were given to people to enable them to travel generally, but I don't know how passports were dealt with in Rwanda. 
Q.	When he went to Belgium, a person was appointed to replace him in his absence with whom you then worked; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When he was in Belgium, he was no longer responsible and acting on Kigali-rural health issues; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No.  There was an interim director who carried out duties in his absence. 
Q.	There was no reason for him to liaise with you when he was in Belgium; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No, there was no reason. 
Q.	You didn't hear from him when he was in Belgium; is that right? 
A.	I don't recall having had news of him.  At the time we didn't have the Internet services.  I think not.  I didn't have news of him.  I would say that I had some telephone conversations with Professor Mercenier at that time, but that was mostly before his return, that is, before he came on mission to Rwanda.  And I believe probably -- I think that Professor Mercenier talked to me about him.  And there was a telephone conversation, and that conversation was with Mercenier, and not with Rwamakuba. 
Q.	You had no communication with Rwamakuba whilst he was in Belgium as to what he was doing; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No, there was no communication with him. 
Q.	Were you aware that there are documents which show he was purchasing medical equipment to ship back to Rwanda in late 1993, early 1994? 
A.	No, I was not aware of that. 
Q.	Were you aware that he purchased a car in order to ship it back to Rwanda in late '93, '94, early '94? 
A.	No, I was not aware.  What I can say is only that it was quite usual.  He was not the first Rwandan to be going to Belgium for further training.  So there were some of them that usually came back with cars, with television sets.  And even when I was in Butare, many of those whom I saw go to Belgium came back with some equipment.  

This also holds for Burkina Faso today.  I have seen many people who have gone to Belgium and who have taken advantage of the situation to buy a car in Belgium and that they brought home.  So this is something that is quite usual, but I wasn't aware that Rwamakuba had bought a car in Belgium. 
Q.	So the answer is no, you weren't aware; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No, I was not aware. 
Q.	Were you aware that he was in possession of sizable sums of cash with which to make purchases, to ship matters back to Rwanda? 
A.	No. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can you specify the sum?  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't have to. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Were you aware of his source of income whilst he was in Belgium? 
A.	He has a scholarship from Belgian cooperation, from ICD.  That is the administration of the development cooperation.  I believe that Rwandans in general kept their salaries as well while they were on further training.  And I also think that for certain training courses they kept their salaries paid by the administration at home. 
Q.	That's what you think.  Were you aware of his sources of income? 
A.	No.  I was not aware of his sources of income.  I know that he had a scholarship from the Belgian cooperation.  I don't know anything else. 
Q.	You do not know if he returned to Rwanda between September and March '93, early '94; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	I believe that if he had returned, I would have known.  So I know that he didn't come back because, one way or the other, he would have contacted me.  And even if he didn't contact me, I mean, everything was known in Rwanda.  He couldn't have returned to Rwanda without my knowing.  It would have been difficult for him to come back to Rwanda and I wouldn't know. 
Q.	You say that everything was known in Rwanda.  You did not know the extent of Rwamakuba's involvement in politics.  That was not known to you; you agree with that, yes? 
A.	Yes, I agree.  I didn't know.  I wasn't aware of his involvement. 
Q.	Rwamakuba was doing things that you were unaware of in Rwanda; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	I'd say that I knew what he was doing insofar as work was concerned.  I knew how his behaviour was at work.  Well, for the rest, I didn't know. 
Q.	Rwamakuba would only have contacted you on matters of work; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No.  We also could talk about families and, as I have told you, we went to his home once.  Let's say that for everything else, we talked about the health of children, their education, et cetera.  We did normally talk about work, but I don't recall having talked politics with him. 
Q.	You went to his home once in the time that you knew him; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	That was, is this correct, I may have misunderstood you, after his return from Belgium, or was it before? 
A.	That was before. 
Q.	In the time that you were in his home, he never discussed the private interests he had with politics; is that right? 
A.	No.  That didn't strike me. 
Q.	You had no telephone conversations with him, you told us, while he was in Belgium, yes? 
A.	No.  I don't remember in any case. 
Q.	There was a replacement for him whilst he was working in Belgium; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You do not know whether he would have had to contact you if he came back to Rwanda during the period September to March; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	I haven't quite understood your question. 
Q.	You don't know whether Rwamakuba would have felt he had to contact you if he came back to Rwanda between September '93 and March '94; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No.  If he had returned, he certainly would have contacted me.  I believe that if he had come back, he would have got in touch with me.  There was no reason for him not to get in touch with me.  He would have told me that he was there, if he had returned. 
Q.	If he was dealing with politics, which he never discussed with you, how is it that you think he would want to talk to you about why he's back in the country? 
A.	I don't know.  I'm convinced he would have contacted me because, in any case, I would have been told that he had come back, if he had come back.  It is virtually certain that you cannot just return like that from Belgium without anybody having to see you or without us being aware. 

I don't think there was any reason for him not to get in touch with me.  In my opinion, if he hadn't contacted me, or he hadn't wanted to contact me, he would have been certain that others would have told me, and I would have been aware that he was there. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm about to move on to another subject.  I see the time.  Is this a convenient moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just as a matter of indication, how much longer do you anticipate?  
MR. MORLEY:
Half an hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We can take the recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1230H) 
(Pages 22 to 39 by Jennifer Spring)
















(Court resumed at 1420H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now recommence our afternoon session.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Good afternoon, doctor.  You told us that on the 4th of April of 1994 that you were with Professor Mercenier, but you can't remember now whether Rwamakuba was with you.  That's right, is it? 
A.	Yes, Prosecutor.  I can't remember whether he was us -- with us at the airport.  In fact, it was the evening.  The plane came in at 6 p.m., I think. 
Q.	On the 5th of April of 1994, I think your diary shows that you had a variety of meetings; yah?  
A.	Yes, in the morning we had discussions with Professor Mercenier and in the afternoon we went to see the director-general for health. 
Q.	Your diary entry for the 5th of April does not reflect the presence of Rwamakuba; do you agree? 
A.	Yes, the diary doesn't mention it but I would remember very well, because he was leading the delegation.  We went to see the director-general of health, and I would say that he was team delegation leader. 
Q.	When you say you would say he was delegation leader, is that something you remember or is that something that you think was probably what happened? 
A.	No, it's what happened.  I remember very well he was with us at the director-general of health's office and the next day again.  We went together also to the Belgian embassy and Muhima health centre where we couldn't stay because the doctors weren't free, so we returned to Muhima in the afternoon and then Kacyiru health centre with him.  That I remember very well; he was with us. 
Q.	I was asking about the 5th of April, and you've moved on to the 6th of April.  If we can concentrate on the 5th of April for the moment.  
A.	Fine.  Sorry.  That's okay. 
Q.	In relation to your diary entry, can you help us with which of the entries refers to the ministry of health meeting? 
A.	Between 4 o'clock and 5:30.  It's Mercenier, Kanyamupira.  Kanyamupira was the name of the doctor who was director-general for health.  So we went to see him in his capacity as director-general for health, concerned, of course, with the project and the work we were planning to do. 
Q.	The earlier entry marked at 7:30, what's that about? 
A.	Yes, 7:30, that's when I went to Kigali regional health headquarters, and then 9 to 11 with Professor Mercenier and Rwamakuba and I.  That was from 9 to 11. 
Q.	And then the entry after that, again that's the regional health centre, is it, the one that is marked at 1430; is that right? 
A.	14 to 16 hours Mercenier, Kanyamupira, and then RSK, regional sanitaire de Kigali, Kigali health region.  I think that we must have taken Mercenier back to the hotel then and we returned to the regional sanitaire, regional public health office. 
Q.	You've written the name Mercenier twice and you've also written the name of the public health ministry official that you spoke with.  You haven't written the name Rwamakuba.  Why have you not written the name Rwamakuba? 
A.	Because we were together.  It was especially for him that the mission was taking place; he was director of the project.  He was the regional director.  I did not need to write his name down because he was there.  He was it. 
Q.	You wrote his name down on the 29th of March.  If you have a look at the 29th of March.  
A.	Yes, 29th of March.  I went to Ngenda regional health centre in Bugesera, and passing by the regional public health office, I saw Rwamakuba, who had returned on that day from Egypt -- had arrived from Egypt on that day.  That's why I put "returned".  

Rwamakuba, I was very happy to see him because, as I said, we had an important meeting the next day, with all the head nurses, all the heads of the health centres and all the other doctors who participated.  It was important therefore that he should be present. 
Q.	Having written his name down on the 29th of March, what is the point of writing his name down on the 29th of March if you don't need to write down that he's there if he's with you, on the 5th of April?  What is the distinction between writing his name on the 29th of March and not writing his name on the 5th of April?  
A.	The 29th of March was the day he returned.  It was the first time I saw him since he'd gone to Egypt, so I think I wrote down because it was logical.  I was seeing him again; he'd returned.  And thereafter I'd see him regularly, every day.  And on the 5th of April, in any case, I am sure he was there with us.  I remember very well that he was there, both in our meeting with the director-general and at the morning's meeting.  

There would be no sense in having a meeting between Mercenier and me alone.  It wasn't -- so I wrote his name on the 29th because that was the day of his return, and I hadn't seen him since his departure on the 17th of March, which is why I wrote his name down on the 29th.  
MR. MORLEY:
Forgive me, Your Honour, I'm just seeking clarification on something.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And would it be right that your business with Rwamakuba, as you recall it and reflecting on your diary, would have come to an end on the 5th of April by something like 5:30 in the afternoon? 
A.	Yes.  We left the regional public health office at 7 -- half past 5, before the night, because of the public safety, security situation.  We were told not to stay there after nightfall. 
Q.	And you were not in the company of Rwamakuba after you'd parted company from work around 5:30 in the afternoon of the 5th of April; would that be fair? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that.  I went back home to my home, where I was staying, and he went back to his home.  Everybody went home.  There was about 15 staff members in all in that building and everybody left to go home. 
Q.	Have you ever heard of a person called Muhire? 
A.	No, I don't remember having heard that name. 
Q.	There is a suggestion in the Prosecution evidence that on either the 4th or the 5th of April Rwamakuba attended MDR meetings at the home of a man called Muhire.  The timing is indistinct.  You would not be in a position to say that at no stage on either of those two days could Rwamakuba have attended a meeting of a political nature in somebody's home?  That would be fair, wouldn't it? 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just interrupt at this stage?  And it is an interruption, because if this is -- and I welcome it, because it is a marked change, the Prosecution actually putting their case.  The meeting takes place in Ndatemwa, which is in northern Gikomero commune, and it takes place at about 3 o'clock, and we have clear evidence of its timing according to those witnesses.  So we can be rather more precise in putting the case.  We're talking about 3 o'clock or so, 3, 4 o'clock, on either the 4th or the 5th, that it's alleged that André Rwamakuba was holding a political meeting in northern Gikomero. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Dr. Monet, you've been able to hear Mr. Hooper's helpful contribution.  You're not in a position to say, because you can't remember, what Rwamakuba was doing on the 4th of April; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No, no, on the 4th of April I was between Kigufi and Kigali, so I have no idea, but the 5th, we were together at the director-general of health's office -- at the office of the director-general of health. 
Q.	We'll move on.  Thank you.  There were a lot of bodies on the streets of Kigali in the aftermath of the death of the president.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	Well, yes, we were aware.  We could hear the firing, for a start.  We had information over the phone from the other Belgians and Rwandans.  We could see for ourselves on the TV everything that was happening.  We had TV-5, canal France international, CFI, so we could see it on the TV. 

We could see what was happening but I personally, I did not exit my house before the Monday morning on the 11th, when the Belgian army trucks took us to the lycée français.  At that point, at that moment I did not see any corpses between my building and the French school.  It was in the evening, when they took us from the French school to the Hôtel Meridien, or Meridien hotel, and the next day on our way to the airport, then we did see corpses by the side of the road.  But, in any case, we could follow on the TV what was happening and we had information from the Belgian troops who were in -- staying in houses, three houses away from me.  We could hear a lot of firing, and we heard that they'd shot down two Rwandan gendarmes in our road.  So, you see.  
Q.	Bodies present a health hazard if they lie about; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  Yes. 
Q.	The numbers of bodies that you were able to hear about and see on the television was a significant number and one which would present a significant health hazard.  You would agree with that, yes? 
A.	Yes, obviously. 
Q.	The person responsible for the health questions in Kigali at this particular period of time was Rwamakuba.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You left the Kigali area to fly away, I think on the 11th of April; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, we left on the 12th.  We flew off on the 12th.  We left Hôtel Meridien on the morning of the 12th and we took the plane at about 10 p.m. from Kigali airport. 
Q.	It was plain to you that quite a number of bodies had been removed when you left on the 11th of April from the Hôtel Meridien.  That would be right, wouldn't it, in contrast to what you'd seen on the television and heard about? 
A.	Well, in fact, we saw corpses but we didn't see dozens.  There were corpses, one or two corpses in certain places.  I didn't count them, of course, but I can't say whether corpses had been removed or not.  It's possible that some corpses had been removed. 
Q.	Who do you think would have been responsible for ordering the removal of bodies in order to preserve health within the Kigali area? 
A.	Well, there was public health service at the ministry of health, which could act, apart from the public health region because we were in the capital.  So there's the director-general for public health, and then Kigali préfecture had also a public health service that could ensure the removal of corpses. 
Q.	Do you think that Rwamakuba would have been involved in a decision of that nature, given his official position before the 9th of April? 
A.	Well, yes, I should think he could act thus, intervene in that fashion, yes.  But you'd need trucks, you'd need staff, you'd need people at the public health service.  At the regional health office, we didn't have any trucks; we only had four-by-four vehicles and cars. 
Q.	When you spoke to Rwamakuba on the telephone before you left on the 11th of April, you wanted to know what he could do to stop the massacres.  You've told us that.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, I hoped that he could do something, but I didn't expect too much because, in my opinion, he did not have much power. 
Q.	What did Rwamakuba discuss with you about the health hazard being presented by the piling bodies in Kigali? 
A.	I don't remember having discussed that problem with him.  In fact, we were -- before he was appointed as minister, we were completely blocked off.  When I went out to try and transport the wounded, but as regarding the corpses -- it was especially the injured and wounded that concerned us.  When I tried to contact my colleagues, because there were quite a few Belgian doctors at Kigali hospital, it was to treat the wounded, but Dr. Poncin (phonetic), the Belgian surgeon with whom I spoke over the telephone, told me we had nothing left to operate with, nothing sterile was left, and that he'd stopped because he didn't have any equipment.  And he told me, moreover, that they came to kill people in their beds at Kigali central hospital, because I was asking him whether I couldn't go to help him.  

So, as regards the corpses, well, I don't think it was our main concern at that time.  Everybody was blocked off.  It was a general curfew.  You couldn't exit your house.  There was firing everywhere, shooting all over the shop, all over the place.  We were in a very difficult situation.  We were trapped, I would say, completely blocked off. 
Q.	Now, doctor, I simply asked you what you discussed about the piling bodies with Rwamakuba and it seems, listening to your answer, that your answer is, "It wasn't discussed."  Is that right? 
A.	No, I don't remember having discussed it. 
Q.	Given the scale of events in Kigali as you now know it to have been, does it not strike you as odd that the regional health director did not discuss with you, a work colleague, the dangers of so many bodies piling up in Kigali? 
A.	My main concern was, first of all, to try and get the killing to stop.  We knew what we thought -- they were going through town, house by house, and killing everyone.  On the 8th we heard they were cleaning up our street, scouring it for Tutsis to kill.  So the problem of corpses was not really our main concern.  At that time we hid our cook.  Well, you see, we did not discuss the problem of corpses at that time. 
Q.	You did discuss massacres.  That's one of the things you wanted Rwamakuba to help to stop.  That's right, is it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I'll ask again:  Did it not strike you as odd that the piling bodies was not something that as the regional health director discussing with a work colleague, the dangers of that, did it not strike you as odd it didn't arise in conversation at all? 
A.	No, it didn't really surprise me because at a certain point we were seeing cannon shots against buildings and we were under a more direct threat of killings than of an epidemic that may break out because of bodies here and there.  We had a more direct threat, especially for part of the population.  

Let's say the problem of corpses would have been settled after the situation has returned to normal.  Already we had difficulties conveying wounded persons, so the transportation of corpses at that particular time was not my main concern. 
Q.	Why did you ask Rwamakuba if he could do something to stop the massacres?  What was your thinking process?  What influence did you believe he could bring to bear on what was taking place, please? 
A.	I told him that the massacres had to be stopped.  He said, "Yes".  It was obvious, I would say.  I don't know what he could be able to do to achieve that result, but that is something that I felt because he had just been appointed minister.  I thought I should talk to him about that.  Well, our conversation was not long, but I wanted to pass on a priority message to him, I would say. 
Q.	You thought he was now a man of influence; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No.  As I said, I doubted that he had any real authority, but to the extent that he could have some small authority or a word to say, I think that is the message.  In fact, I think everything had begun before he was appointed.  Let us say that I feel that as a new minister who had just been appointed, I don't think he had much powers, but that is a message I felt I ought to have passed on to him.  But as I said earlier, I had no illusions as to the power that he could have exercised then under the circumstances. 
Q.	Do you remember making a statement on the 26th of October to the gentleman who sits to the right of me?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you remember signing it? 
A.	Yes, I signed a statement. 
Q.	Do you remember how in French it reads, "I would tell him to stop the massacre and he would tell me yes"?  
A.	Well, I heard it in French. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can we have a copy of that, please?  Can it be disclosed, as it should have been?  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just have a moment, please?  

Will Your Honour allow me a further moment, please?  

I'm grateful for Mr. Hooper's interruption.  With the assistance of Mr. Issa -- perhaps Mr. Fry.  Mr. Hooper might want a moment to look over the document.  It's only two pages.  

I think Mr. Hooper's had an opportunity to look at that.  The only sentence I'm interested in, for Mr. Hooper's assistance, the second page, reading down from the top, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, lines.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	There is a line, doctor, which reads -- and it's in relation to the telephone call about the massacres, and I'll read it in French:  "When I will tell him to stop the massacre, he will tell me yes."  Or, "He would tell me yes."  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just enquire of the translations booth -- it's probably my fault for my poor pronunciation in French -- but is it the case that the translation should be in the conditional rather than in the future tense?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, for the second part especially, "Il me dirait", oui, "He would tell me."  It depends how the verb in the first sentence ends.  That is "dirait", does it end with a T or an I -- with an S or an I?  
(Microphones overlapping). 

"Dirait", then it's all conditional.  "I would therefore tell him to stop the massacre and he would tell me yes."  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Looking at the handwriting, it seems to me it's an S, not an R, so I'm going to read the line again so we get it right.  "When I told him to stop the massacre he answered yes.  He told me yes."  My fault, Doctor, poor French pronunciation, can't read the writing.  But, on the face of it, the line seems to read that you were telling Rwamakuba to use his influence to stop the massacres and he was telling you that he would do so.  Now, is that a fair understanding of what you may have been recorded of thinking on the 26th of October 2005, when you gave that note? 
A.	On the 26th October, the trial attorney, Mr. Diene (phonetic) asked me what I'd told Rwamakuba when I had him on the phone after he was appointed minister.  And I said the following -- well, I said that the massacres had to be stopped, that the massacres must be stopped.  Well, that is what was written, but on the phone, I told him the massacres should be stopped and he did acquiesce; he accepted, he promised to stop the massacres.  Well, that's the message I wanted to pass on to him.  I said the massacres must be stopped, and he said, "Yes".  He did not promise me that he was going to stop the massacres.  He said "yes" to what I was telling him, that is, the massacres must be stopped.  And he said, "Yes".  
Q.	What did he do to try to stop the massacres? 
A.	Well, obviously, I don't know what he did because that was the 9th already, and after that I had no more contact with him so I cannot say.  That was my last phone contact with Rwamakuba.  I don't know what he was able to do or what he did. 
Q.	You were unimpressed that he had become a minister in this government; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Let's say that I was rather surprised.  I was taken aback.  Since he was minister, I thought that at least I should be able to tell him certain things and I told him, but our conversation didn't last for a long time.  I'm referring to our telephone conversation.  We didn't speak for long. 
Q.	Earlier, you were saying that you had not wished to congratulate him on becoming a minister.  Do you remember saying that?  
A.	No.  I merely stated the contrary.  I said I wasn't congratulating him for having become minister.  Normally, when a person is appointed minister, you congratulate him, but under the circumstances -- under those circumstances, I would say those who -- given the people who had appointed him, I said I wasn't going to congratulate him for having been appointed minister. 
Q.	I'm sorry, I don't understand that at all.  There's a work colleague of yours who's become a minister in a national government.  Did you pass on words of congratulation or not? 
A.	Not at all.  On the contrary. 
Q.	You weren't impressed that he'd become a member of this government.  That's right, isn't it?  It disturbed you, didn't it? 
A.	Well, not at all.  I had many colleagues who were appointed ministers, but under those circumstances I wasn't impressed at all.  I was, first of all, surprised, and let's say I felt that probably he could be able to do something, but I didn't quite believe that he could, because he didn't have much power, I believed. 
Q.	Did you see the genocide coming at all?  
A.	No.  One could not imagine the possibility of the massacre.  Well, in any case, I couldn't imagine that we could get to the situation of genocide. 
Q.	Did you follow the developments politically in Rwanda in 1993 at all? 
A.	Yes, we were following the situation in 1993 and '94, and really things were getting complicated.  There was a transitional government.  We almost frequently reached agreement, but then it would be disrupted.  There were certain key figures who were murdered and this caused problems, so the situation was really very difficult to follow.  And this had been going on since October 1990.  And we kept hoping that the agreements were going to be conclusive and that we were really going to restore peace in the country but, ultimately, there were always incidents that kept bringing back into question what had been agreed on.  So I must say that it was really difficult to keep track of the situation, given the various, you know, new events that kept coming up.  

After our return to Belgium after April, we continued to monitor what was happening, especially regarding the massacres and the genocide, and I wasn't understanding that military action wasn't taken to stop the genocide.  So there was the need and the duty to intervene, but this didn't happen, especially as genocide was going on and seen on TV, live, for months. 
Q.	What was the Hutu-Power movement, do you know? 
A.	I believe those were Hutu extremists, but I don't know if that term was used already in 1994.  Obviously, after what happened we read books; we heard many people talk about Rwanda.  But I don't believe that the term Hutu-Power was already being used in 1994.  In any case, I don't remember.  Let's say that there were parties or many parties had split into two factions.  There was one hardliner faction and another faction in each party, but I don't know if the word Hutu-Power or the term Hutu-Power was already being used at the time. 
Q.	Name some principal figures in the Hutu-Power movement from any of the political parties.  
A.	I can't recall the names of the leaders of those political parties. 
Q.	Do you agree there was a genocide in Rwanda in the months of April, May, June, a little bit of July of 1994, yah? 
A.	Yes, I agree that there was genocide.  That is certain. 
Q.	Do you agree that there was a government in place in Rwanda during those months? 
A.	Yes, there was a government in place at that time.  I believe it was called the Gitarama government when it moved to Gitarama. 
Q.	You agree that Dr. Rwamakuba was a member of the government, yah? 
A.	Yes, he had been appointed into that government. 
Q.	Do you know of any examples of the government trying to stop the genocide? 
A.	No, but ultimately I think that virtually I don't remember having known any activities of that government or followed the activities of that government.  From my recollection, it's as if that government didn't exist.  I really don't know, but the government did not seem to -- well, people were talking of soldiers and militiamen, but I think people talked less of the government.  Less was said of the government. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are not necessarily finished as yet because Mr. Hooper has an opportunity to ask you a few further questions if he wishes to exercise it.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes.  There's one part of the Prosecution case that wasn't put to you, and allow me to put it to you and get your comments.  It's suggested to you by the Prosecution, as I understand their case, that between September and March -- September '93 and March of 1994 -- André Rwamakuba, I understand you to accept he was in Belgium, but I'm not clear about that, but André Rwamakuba was flitting backwards and forwards from Belgium regularly, five or six times, holding meetings in Gikomero commune and exhorting, according to the Prosecution witnesses, the local population to exterminate the Tutsis.  

Now, leaving aside -- because you've told us already about Rwamakuba's non-ethnic disposition as far as you could tell -- what is your comment, if you have one, in respect of this allegation and charge against him that he was holding regular meetings during the months of September to March, '93 to '94, up in Gikomero?  
A.	I will say that as far as I'm concerned, it wouldn't have been possible between September and March.  I'm convinced that if he had returned to Rwanda, I would have been made to be aware.  So as far as I'm concerned, it's impossible that he returned to Rwanda without my knowing so.  That is my conviction.  It's impossible.  It would have been impossible for him to come to Rwanda and that I didn't know.  

He had a scholarship from the Belgian government, so I wasn't the only person.  There were many people who knew him, and if he had returned, that would have come to the hearing of the Belgian embassy and of everyone else, so personally I am convinced that he never returned to Rwanda between September and March. 
Q.	And I suppose if he had returned and he'd been seen out on a Saturday night in Kigali-town and he hadn't told you, or someone else had said, "Oh, I heard that Rwamakuba up in Gikomero at a meeting, saying, 'Exterminate the Tutsis'", if that sort of thing had come to your ears, I suspect it would have been a great surprise, would it not, as his co-partner, working for Belgian cooperation? 
A.	Absolutely.  I am convinced that he did not come back.  
Q.	I wasn't, for what it's worth in my own mind, quite understanding the questions in respect of bodies in Kigali and their relevance to this case, but I understand it's the Prosecution case in another Chamber that in fact the bodies were cleared up and under the orders of the préfet of Kigali, on about the 10th.  I don't know if you have any comment on that.  
A.	Let's say that I still saw some corpses after the 10th.  There weren't many corpses.  I saw one or two corpses on the road in several places, so obviously not all the corpses had been cleared out. 
Q.	You refer to your diaries which are there, and I'm going to invite the Judges, if they wish, to look at the diaries before you leave court, should the Judges wish.  They have photocopies, but perhaps a glance at the originals would not be -- would be possible, if the Judges want to see that, because you're not -- I'm not asking you to exhibit the original diaries, which are your own property, but apart from your diaries, do you also have a planner for 1994?  And I'm not sure if you referred to that.  We have a photocopy of it.  And I if I understand, there's a relevant entry in respect of April 1994 and if there is, can you just indicate what it was, please? 
MR. MORLEY:
No doubt, this is helpful, but can we see what it is that's coming?  We don't have this. 
MR. HOOPER:
It's a photocopy -- all the photocopies were distributed. 
MR. MORLEY:
I don't have a photocopy of the planner.  I'm not complaining; I just want to see what the document is. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'll invite -- can we do it in this way?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Dr. Monet, do you have the original planner there and can you indicate what are, for our purposes, the relevant entry in it, if there is one?  I thought these had been distributed.  

All right, say it again.  I'm looking at -- I've got a photocopy of the planner which I thought had been distributed.  It hasn't; my oversight.  And we can do that, if it's of relevance.  Is it of relevance, your planner?  It's -- 
A.	I don't quite understand. 
Q.	Well -- 
A.	Oh, the planner, the diary planner. 
Q.	That's it.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And is there a date on there that's relevant to your evidence?  I'm just asking, is this a relevant document?  Is it something that you refer to or not? 
A.	I understand that this is a small diary planner which actually only keeps track of certain entries in my diary, and it is possible there are certain things that are in here that are not mentioned in the diary; that is, in the big diary. 
MR. MORLEY:
Can I help my learned friend?  The diary is plainly real evidence, contemporaneous document.  If my learned friend wishes to take the witness to the item that he's interested in and get his comment, I don't have any objection. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, in fact, I'm inviting the witness to say, is this a document of relevance to your story or not, or can we forget about it, before you go back to Belgium.  
MR. MORLEY:
It may be he doesn't understand the question, and in a spirit of cooperation, I'm saying to my learned friend he can lead him to where he wants him to look.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is there anything in your planner that you want to direct our attention to or not?  I'm not suggesting there is, Mr. Witness; I'm just inviting you to deal with your document.  

I don't know if that got translated or not.  Let me ask another question on a very different subject.  

Finally, Dr. Monet, André Rwamakuba's position, you described was head of all medical services and health services -- medical and health services in Kigali and Kigali-rural, and you -- can you just approximately, if you can, indicate the extent of the area, the geographical area that his responsibilities extended to?  You mentioned one place.  To the north, for example, how far did it extend to the north?  
A.	It corresponded to the Kigali préfecture before it was split into Kigali-town and Kigali-rural.  I think it was the north.  It extended right up to the road, to Tare on the road to Ruhengeri, Rutongo, a bit to the north -- to the northeast, and the entire Bugasera, which means that it extended right to the border with Burundi.  But, above all, he had supervisory and coordination work of health centres.  

It is obvious that in hospitals there were directors of hospitals and there were heads of each service, but what he was responsible for was to convey directives, instructions and information from the central region to the periphery, as well as coordinate work with the various epidemiological units in the various health centres.  For example, he did not personally head the Rutongo hospital.  There was a hospital director, and at the level of health centres, there were confirmed nurses that were appointed the heads of the centres, and all he did was to supervise, and he had an entire team with him in the regional health office.  So the area covered an area that went right up to the border with Burundi in Bugesera, and in order to trace the limits, one would needs to take a map of the préfecture of Kigali at the time.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  I have no other questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Witness, for giving your testimony here.  You are now concluded and you are free to leave.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much, Dr. Donnet, and you can take those original documents with you.  And we have the diary entries, photocopied entries which are, I think the only exhibit, and those are five pages and that will be Exhibit D. 187, being extracts of Dr.  Monet's diaries for 1993 and 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D.187 admitted) 
(Witness excused)
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  I see the time.  Will that be an appropriate time to rise so I can have a few words with -- oh, may I also ask that Dr. Monet be given permission to visit André Rwamakuba?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the promised smile, is it going to be realised? 
MR. HOOPER:
It's disappeared, I'm afraid.  Well, I say it's disappeared.  It's half past -- if we start at quarter to four, we have an hour and three quarters, and I should, I hope, by then have concluded the evidence-in-chief of the next witness, who's Witness 1/1.  Certainly, I hope to finish her evidence by this afternoon, subject to any promises, and I hope not more false promises, from the Prosecution about their length of questioning.  It's a reasonable expectation for her evidence to be concluded in the course of tomorrow morning, and she is followed by Witness 3/A, and I would have thought her evidence can be concluded tomorrow, and then no further witnesses to call this session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  We will take the recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1524H)
(Pages 40 to 51 by Karen Holm) 


(Court resumed at 1558H) 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, a little earlier my learned friend Mr. Hooper complained loudly of false promises by the Prosecution.  He was, of course, entirely right.  I said I would take 30 minutes, and I took I think 42.  My apologies.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  We thank you for coming to give evidence.

The first thing that will happen is that the registrar will give you an oath to tell the truth.  
(Declaration made by Witness 1/1 in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, the procedure of our Court is that you give your evidence by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers who are designated for that purpose.  Mr. Hooper, the lawyer for André Rwamakuba, will be the first person to question you.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I would ask for closed session, and I would ask for it to be in closed session until further notice.  I'm uncertain of the time, but having discussed the position with this witness who is concerned about identification -- I won't say more than that at present -- it's very difficult, given the nature of the witness, to deal with the sensitive matters, because they permeate really the entire text of her evidence.  I hope that doesn't cause --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will start.  As usual, we prefer the public to hear the testimony of the witness, and we will monitor it as you go along.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will go into closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 53 to 66] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
