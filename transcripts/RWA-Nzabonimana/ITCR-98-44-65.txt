EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, good morning.
A.	Bonjour.
Q.	Do you recall your testimony yesterday where you said you were not a member of the MRND since the multiparty system was introduced in 1991; do you recall that?
A.	I recall that.  I gave that in my testimony yesterday.
Q.	Now, did you attend MRND meetings between 1991 and 1994 in Ruhengeri?
A.	Never.
Q.	Was there a meeting in November of 1992, November 15 of 1992, in which you attended in Ruhengeri?
A.	Yes, I attended that meeting.
Q.	What was that meeting all about?
MR. PRESIDENT:
What date, Counsel?  Sorry.
MR. HINDS:
November 15, 1992.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on, Counsel.
THE WITNESS:
That meeting was in that receiving the president of the republic, this is why we were invited there, but there were members of the MRND party present.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, who was the president at that time?
A.	The president, then, was Juvénal Habyarimana.
Q.	And in what capacity were you invited to attend that meeting?
A.	I was invited as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, just as all other bourgmestres were invited there.
Q.	Do you know whether or not ministers within the government were invited to that meeting?
A.	I could not check whether our government ministers were present, but what I know is that Ruhengeri préfecture officials had been invited.  Some ministers I knew were present.  I did know some of the ministers.  It was during the multiparty, there were new ministers whom I didn't know.
Q.	Do you know whether Joseph Nzirorera was present at that meeting?
A.	Thank you.  Joseph Nzirorera was not present at that meeting.  What I recall was that he was on a mission abroad.
Q.	Do you know who addressed the meeting?
A.	Yes, the person who addressed the meeting was the chairman of MRND in Ruhengeri.  I know him well.
Q.	And what is his name?
A.	His name was Casimir Bizimungu.
Q.	Did anyone else address the meeting?
A.	There was the master of ceremonies in charge of the protocol, a member of parliament called Munyaruyenzi, Telesphore.
Q.	Did you personally address the meeting?
MS. OJEMENI:
May we have the spelling of the name?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
THE INTERPRETER:
Munyaruyenzi, I spell it. M-U-N-Y-A-R-U-Y-E-N-Z-I, Telesphore.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell it again, please?
THE INTERPRETER:
M-U-N-Y-A-R-U-Y-E-N-Z-I.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on.
MR. HINDS:
May I?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, go on.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did you personally address that meeting?
A.	I did not address the meeting.  It was not possible for me to address the meeting.
Q.	Did you introduce anyone at the meeting?
A.	It was not possible.  I did not introduce anyone.
Q.	Do you know whether or not the proceedings of that meeting were recorded and broadcasted?
A.	Thank you.  There were many journalists present.  There were many cameramen with their cameras.  It appeared on television and it would not be possible to tell lies about what happened.  It actually was broadcast on television.
Q.	Were there dancers at that particular meeting?
A.	It is understandable that whenever the president was received there were many people who received him, there had to be dancers and there were dancers that --

MR. HINDS:
Are we synchronised in the translation booth?
THE INTERPRETER:
Beg your pardon.  The French booth would like the question repeated.
MR. HINDS:
The question that I asked, for which there was an answer, was, were there dancers?
THE WITNESS:
I replied.  I said that there were dances receiving him.  There were dancers.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Were they traditional dancers?
A.	Some had cultural dancers.  Nearly every dancer was a traditional dancer, there was no European type of dance.
Q.	Did the dancers wear any particular costumes?
A.	They were dressed in various clothes, some were dressed in MRND costumes, other people were in ordinary clothes.  For instance, some people were dressed in cultural dance troupes uniform and others were in ordinary clothes.
Q.	When you said some of the dancers were in MRND costumes, could you describe that for the Trial Chamber?
A.	I can, yes.
Q.	Could you, please?
A.	These were materials made of bitenge, trousers and shirts made of bitenge material, and there were women in this type of textile, some were in skirts, I don't know how to call it, but these were dresses, it was just that kind of dressing.
Q.	And what were the colours, do you recall?
A.	The colours were green, there was red, there was yellow, there was white, there was also black, nearly five colours, and there were letters of MRND in abbreviation like that, that's how it was.
Q.	Did the president of the republic take the floor and address that meeting?
A.	He addressed the meeting among the last speakers, after the people received him, had addressed the meeting, he also addressed the meeting.
Q.	During his address did you hear the term "Interahamwe" at that meeting?
A.	He used the word "Interahamwe".
Q.	Was that the first time you heard that term used in public?
A.	You know, the word "Interahamwe", this was the first time that we heard it.  The name was not yet known in Ruhengeri region.
Q.	What does that term mean to you?
A.	I don't know whether you (sic) would be more expert than the linguistic experts but in my view what you (sic) wanted to say was what I can coin in French "solidarity", during elections he meant to say that during elections people should be united, more united, so that they can win elections during that time.  What was meant was that he would have solidarity with these people in order to win elections when elections come.  The meaning is "solidarity".
Q.	Now, when the president used the term in November 15 of 1992, in what context did he use it when you heard it?
A.	In this context he used the term in the context of elections.  He wanted to tell the people that, if they're united, he would win the elections, the forthcoming elections.  He said this in the context of elections, asking the people to be more united so that there can be fairness during elections.
Q.	Now, during the time that you were bourgmestre, up to 1993, were you aware of any structure of Interahamwe at the préfectural level in Ruhengeri?
A.	Until 1993 those matters connected with Interahamwe were not known, but there was some talk of it in Kigali préfecture.
Q.	Now, what did you learn, with respect to Kigali, of this talk about Interahamwe, in terms of who were the founders and leaders of the Interahamwe?  What did you learn?
A.	I wish to explain here that what I'm saying now is up to 1993, because afterwards I was not able to follow political party matters.  I heard some talk of Interahamwe around Kigali préfecture.  This was when there was talk or so of MDR youth wings.  There was that group of youth wingers in Kigali for MDR party.  But there was another group of youth wingers for MRND and this is how it was explained.  It was a cement to try and mobilise for more MRND membership.  This is how it was being talked about.
Q.	Did you learn who was the founder and leader of the Interahamwe out of Kigali, his name?
A.	I knew his name.
Q.	And what was his name?
A.	On the radio they said his name was Robert Kajuga.
Q.	What was his ethnicity?
A.	Robert Kajuga was a Tutsi from Kigali.  He was born in Kigali préfecture.  They said he was brought in by Anastase Gasana, who is now the RPF Ambassador for Rwanda in New York.  They say it was this Anastase Gasana who had recruited him to start this government of Interahamwe in order to mobilise for MRND and this Gasana was a member of MRND before he joined the MDR party.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, drawing your attention --
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, could we have the spelling once more from my learned friend?
THE INTERPRETER:
I spell Kajuga, Robert Kajuga, Kajuga, K-A-J-U-G-A, Kajuga.  I spell Gasana, G-A-S-A-N-A, Gasana.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, were you aware of an Interahamwe organisation in existence in the commune of Mukingo while you were bourgmestre?
A.	I don't know where such information could have come from.  In my view, I was not aware of such an organisation.  It did not exist in Mukingo commune during the time of my tenure.
Q.	After you left office did you ever learn whether or not there was any group that called itself Interahamwe in Mukingo commune?
A.	I heard about that, yes, I heard about that.
Q.	How did you learn about such a group after you left office?
A.	I learnt that there was a plan to found Interahamwe organisations to mobilise for membership of MRND.  But this is something I heard casually.  I wasn't really concerned.  I heard it like anybody else said.  I wasn't really concerned, but this was public and it was even announced on radios concerning Interahamwe, yes.  But in Mukingo even you could hear some talk about this, when going about your own business.
Q.	Did you, at any time, learn whether or not there were any individual or individuals who were identified as being part of such an organisation in Mukingo commune?
A.	I don't know why you would call it an organisation.  You find that these were young people who appeared in near communal offices.  I don't think it was an organisation.  It was not yet really formed; it was started by a few people.  It started with a few members.  That's how I heard about it, but I didn't follow it really closely.  I heard of this casually while I was passing by.
Q.	Now, did you know anyone who was identified with this group in Mukingo commune, by name?
A.	I deny this.  I never knew of anyone who was identified as Interahamwe.  I never knew a single person, except occasionally you heard that such-and-such was Interahamwe, but I wasn't really concerned.  I wasn't interested.
Q.	Did you, at any time, see anyone who either identified themselves or who were pointed out to you as Interahamwe wearing any distinctive colours?
A.	No, I saw some youths and I knew a few names, that's so, and people would say, "Those youth belong to Interahamwe."  They were -- but I did not really mind much about their identity.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your question is not -- is it answered?  I think you asked about distinct colours.
MR. HINDS:
Colours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that was the question.  Can you put it back to the Witness?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Do you --
A.	I never saw that.
Q.	During your term of office did you, at any time, see, when you were bourgmestre between '88 and '93, did you see any training of youth in Mukingo commune, military training?
A.	Well, I was still a bourgmestre.  This I never saw this, it never happened.  If that would have happened, I would have noticed it.  It never happened.
Q.	Between the time that you left office in 1993 and the time that you took office again, in June of 1994, did you see any training of youth, military training in any way in the commune?
A.	I would like to inform you that when I left my office as a bourgmestre I really disappeared from public eye.  I was busy with my business, but among the things I saw I can testify that there was no one training, having military training in Mukingo and I never saw it.  I never heard of it.
Q.	Do you know someone by the name of Karorero?
A.	Karorero.
THE INTERPRETER:
Spelling K-A-R-O-R-E-R-O, Karorero.
MR. HINDS:
What is the answer to the question?
THE INTERPRETER:
He knows him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We had not got that one.  Can we have the spelling again?
THE INTERPRETER:
K-A-R-O-R-E-R-O.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, could you tell us who is Karorero?
A.	Karorero was a military man, a member of the Rwandan Armed Forces, his rank was adjutant.  I don't know if I should continue identifying him.
Q.	In what capacity did you know him?
A.	I knew him when I was still a bourgmestre.  When he was going to the battlefield he used to pass through Ruhengeri because at the time many people were coming to liberate Ruhengeri, coming from Kamera.  I knew him.  He came from Nkuri (phonetic) commune and later on, when he was demobilised from the army, I came to know him when he was demobilised under -- he was beginning to go into business.  He was going into retirement, in short.
Q.	Do you know whether he was involved in any type of training of youths anywhere in Mukingo commune between 1993 and 1994?
A.	I said that I did not follow these matters.  I can say that when someone goes into retirement I don't know whether he would be allowed to do it but this did not happen, but I had not followed it. 
THE INTERPRETER:
The interpreter would like to correct the title, the grade of this man was warrant officer.
MR. HINDS:
The interpreter would like to do what?
THE INTERPRETER:
The interpreter would like to rectify that the actual rank of this man was warrant officer, not adjutant.
MR. HINDS:
I'd like the witness to be shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 7, pictures 10 and 11.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I'd like you to look at photograph number 10 and could you tell us what that photograph depicts?
A.	I can see that this is the Mukingo communal office.
Q.	And does it look as it did in 1994 when you reassumed the position of bourgmestre, as you recall?
A.	As I recall, there is a big difference now.  You can see that there is no cleanliness.  You would think the office is not functioning.  If you look at the appearance, it's really a pity.  There's no cleanliness.  When I was working there it looked like an official office.  There is terrible degradation of these premises.
Q.	Are there any changes in the structure of the building or is the building essentially the same that it was in 1994?
A.	On the structure there is nothing that has been changed.  What is lacking is maintenance.
Q.	Now, could you look at Exhibit 11; and what does that show?
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not Exhibit 11, photograph 11.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	I'm sorry, still the same exhibit, 7, photograph 11.
A.	This photo, number 11, I can see -- it pains me to say this.  There is no maintenance,  It's all bushy.  The place is abandoned.  The photo shows the Mukingo communal office.  It shows the training centre for development.  I can see some vehicles.  I can see the public water tap that the people from around the commune used to come and fetch water from.
Q.	Now, do the grounds, aside from lack of maintenance, as you have indicated, do the grounds and structure depict, essentially, what existed in 1994?
A.	There has been no change on the structure, apart from the maintenance that is lacking, as I said.
Q.	Did you, between 1993 and 1994, see any type of military training in front of this facility?
MR. PRESIDENT:
When?
MR. HINDS:
1993 and 1994.
THE WITNESS:
Although I did not go there, I never heard about it nor saw it happening.  I never knew about or saw military training taking place there.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, I'd like you to look at the document and see if you recognise it.
MR. HINDS:
Show it to the Prosecutor.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I've shown you a document.  Do you recognise it?
A.	This document shows what is called in construction or the plan, the land plan of Mukingo commune as shown on those photos and, as far as I know, this office -- this document shows how the setup of the communal office of Mukingo.
Q.	Who prepared that document?
A.	I am the one who prepared this document, basing myself on the statements that -- some of the statements that I had got access to.  In short, in answer, it's me who prepared this document.
Q.	And when did you prepare it?
A.	I prepared this when I was working in my cellule after -- my cell, sorry, my jail cell, after getting statements from the Prosecutor's Office.
Q.	And was that here in Arusha?
A.	I meant after getting statements from the Prosecutor's Office in my jail cell so that means that I was here in Arusha.
MR. HINDS:
Could we have that floor plan projected on the screen, Registry?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, we have an objection to using this document for this, because we had requested, under Rule 67(c), for inspection of all the documents that the Defence will be using in examining the accused and this document was not disclosed to us.  We're not even allowed to inspect any of the documents, rather, we were notified of two documents that they were going to be using and this was not one of them.  But even at that, in the light of 67(c) we were not -- I mean the Defence did not disclose the document to us.
MR. HINDS:
May I, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honours, we have just received this document.  Mr. Kajelijeli apparently drafted this document and we received it this morning and so, therefore, we have just proceeded, after reviewing the document, to offer it.  So we did not have the document prior to today but I can ask Mr. Kajelijeli when he, in fact, produced the document.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, this particular document is not even a document -- I mean a photocopy of a document and on the face of which it is not stated who -- there's no certification as to who prepared this document, apart from the fact that the burden on my learned friend, in -- pursuant to Rule 67(C), that he did not discharge the burden, the document itself is a photocopy and not an original.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, that does not prohibit or exclude the admissibility of the document.  The witness has identified the document.  He identified the document as a document that he prepared.  He said the circumstances under which he prepared it, he recognises it, and that is not a basis for objecting to the document.

Mr. Kajelijeli, there is no question before you.  There is no question before you, Mr. Kajelijeli.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where could the original be?
MR. HINDS:
I could ask Mr. Kajelijeli about the original.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, do you have the original?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Answer counsel's question.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, do not make any statements unless there is a question that I put to you.  The question we are asking you is; do you have the original?
A.	I do have the original document.
Q.	Okay, can I see the original?
A.	I do not have it.  I left it in my cell, I didn't bring it with me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber rules as follows:  First, we would like to underscore that disclosure, as it applies toward the parties, is an essential element in the administration of justice.  That should be borne in mind by all the parties.  We are nearing the end of this trial, but I think it is extremely important to emphasise that aspect.  We are seeking for justice to be done. 

Secondly, we see no reason why the document, if the accused person is the person who prepared it -- I hope at the end he will be able to sign it -- why it should not be used or even produced if they so wish and other issues will be ventilated by cross-examination, if maybe there be such a cross-examination, and the Trial Chamber will be following the evidence as, indeed, it is bound to do by all the evidence adduced here, but, also, the evidence on this document, as well, as it is ventilated before the Trial Chamber.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  Please proceed.  Go on, Counsel.
MR. HINDS.
We'd like Mr. Kajelijeli to go to the overhead projector and to describe the floor plan for the Trial Chamber.
THE WITNESS:
Have I been given the permission to do so?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, starting from your left, can you use a pointer and describe --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you magnify it Abraham, is it possible?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 

This photo is showing the floor plan of Mukingo commune office, and yesterday, when you asked me, I told you I'm one of the people who took part in its construction and even I was one of the people who took part in the inauguration ceremony.  

As you can see here, this is the main front path.  This is the main door, the main entry door, which leads to all offices, all -- this is the census office for commune Mukingo.  This is the agricultural specialist, and here this --

MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  Do the writings, Counsel, do the writings in this room, so to say, indicate what the witness is saying, for example this is an agricultural specialist, whatever?  They are written in French.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, can you tell us what -- each of the rooms you are describing, can you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
They want you to use that one.
MR. HINDS:
What's the matter with this one?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry?
MR. HINDS:
I'm asking the translators, what's the matter with this?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe --
MR. HINDS:
The problem with me over there and the map over here, it's not convenient.  What's the problem?  Can you hear me?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I'm sure my learned friend can shift the --
MR. HINDS:
Counsel, I'm conducting this.  I know how to proceed.
MS. OJEMENI:
I know you are, but I'm saying that is acceptable.
MR. HINDS:
Counsel, please, thank you.  Can everyone hear me?  No?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, can you help counsel to have his screen moved, okay, closer to the microphone?
MR. HINDS:
All right, can everyone hear me now?  Okay.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, could you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, the screen.
MR. HINDS:
What's the problem?  I'm all right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Everybody wants to help you, don't take --
MR. HINDS:
No, no, I just don't see why the problem at this point.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, we would like you to focus on the floor plan and you see where you have writings in each of the areas, could you describe what those writings say, in terms of an explanation of the functions of those particular areas?  Do you understand me?
A.	Yes, I understand you.
Q.	Thank you.
A.	I'm going to start again.  This is the main door, the main door that gives access to all offices inside the building.  This is the census office, Mukingo communal census office.  This is the agricultural officer's office.  There is a door here and this door adjoins the main corridor.  And then, here we have the accountants office.  And this is the safe room, the safe room for the accountant.  And this is the commune secretariat.  Here we have the door that leads to the bourgmestre's office, then just beyond here we have the stockroom, the storeroom.  Then, when you go back to the main corridor, again you can have exits to the tax office.  Then here you have a second door that has -- that is number 8, and this office is for the social welfare officer.  And then from this door you go to door number 12 that leads to the person in charge of education in the commune.  Then, from the office you go outside here, then this door, the first door here outside is the jail house, the communal jail house.  Then the second door from the jail, this is the office of the person in charge of communal police.  And all these offices are separated by wall bricks that go up to the ceiling.  This is the floor plan and I am the one who prepared this document.  If there is any doubt I can prepare this document even right now, here, so it shouldn't really make us waste time.  I am the one who made this document and I am ready and capable to reproduce it again.  That's it.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, the handwriting in each of the areas, do those handwritings describe the function of the rooms as you have just testified?  We need to know what the writings mean.  Do the writings mean exactly what you have said?
A.	The handwriting in each of these rooms explains what was being done in each of these rooms, each of these offices.  What I don't know is whatever change might have taken place after our departure.
Q.	We're asking, concerning your testimony this morning, when you were describing the functions of the rooms, the Court wants to know whether or not what you have described is reflected in what you wrote down in each of the rooms or spaces?
A.	That is how it is and it's the truth, they correspond.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope he understands your question, but if he understands correctly then that's exactly what you wanted to know because when we come back if there may be a need to come back to this case we would like to know whether exactly this is what the words written in each of the rooms say; what he has described in his evidence.
MR. HINDS:
I've gone over it with him about four times, Your Honour, and he insists.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can move on.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Kajelijeli?
A.	When I was showing you the office, something I didn't show you on number 6, this is the meeting place.  This is not an office.  This is a room for conducting -- for holding meetings.  This is a conference room.  There is a road that leads to the census office and there's another door from that meeting room that leads to the agricultural officers office.  Then, from the conference room you have access into the main corridor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which room is that?
MR. HINDS:
It's number 6, room number 6.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, can you show the Tribunal the office that you occupied between 1988 and 1993 and then, again, in June of 1994?  Where was your office located?
A.	The office I was using bears number 1.  This is the office and it bears number 1.  And behind it there is number 12, which was the storeroom, communal office storeroom.  So that's the office I occupied in my term of office as bourgmestre.
Q.	Now, during 1993, when -- withdrawn.  Between 1988 and 1993, when you were bourgmestre, who occupied office number ten.  
Just give us a pseudonym.
A.	If that's the case, this is the person was in charge of the police, the communal office police.  Could you repeat the question, please?
Q.	I asked who occupied that office and you can use a pseudonym.
A.	In the office number 10 was used by the communal police officer, the officer in charge of communal police, brigadier.  I could mention his name because he has died.  I don't know if it would change anything, if it would have any adverse effects, but he passed away.
Q.	Okay, who was that person?
A.	His name it was Ndekezi.  I spell Ndekezi, N-D-E-K-E-Z-I.
Q.	And how long did he -- what was the time period that he occupied that office?
A.	He occupied that office up to January 1993.
Q.	And were there any other persons who occupied that office?
A.	Before him there was one person who occupied the office.
Q.	And what was his name?
A.	His name was Mbangutse.  I spell the name Mbangutse, M-B-A-N-G-U-T-S-E.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	And who occupied office number 11, was that the storage or was that an office?
A.	Office number 11 was the jail, the communal jail.  This is the place.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, did you know someone by the name of *****? 
THE INTERPRETER:
Could you repeat the name, please?
MR. HINDS:
The pseudonym is ******.
THE WITNESS:
He -- at the time he was a police officer.  He was just a police officer up to the time I left the office.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did he occupy any office, to the best of your knowledge, in the commune?
A.	During my time of office as bourgmestre he never had an office.
Q.	Okay, you can take a seat. Now, Mr. Kajelijeli do you know a place called Isimbi?
A.	Thank you.  I know the place.
Q.	And where is it located?
A.	That place is at Byangabo at the trading centre, at the Byangabo trading centre.
Q.	And do you know when it was built?
A.	It was built before I was born but I know that it also undertook or underwent some change, some transformation, but I do not know when it was built.  It was before I was born.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, do you know who the original owners were?
A.	Yes, I remember them.  When I was a child I knew some of them, they have names that I remember.  I cannot forget.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we'd like to offer the floorplan as Defence Exhibit 56.  Mr. Kajelijeli, could you sign the document and date it?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, any objection?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  We object on the basis of 67(c).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes and we made a ruling on that.  

So let the document be admitted as Defence Exhibit Number 56 after it has been signed by the Accused and dated. 
	(Defence Exhibit No. 56 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we are talking about Isimbi and you addressed the issue of the original owners whom he said he knew.
MR. HINDS:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Who were the original owners?
A.	The owners of Nyirisimbi, but at that time it didn't bear that name, Isimbi -- I would like to inform the Court of this -- it was owned by a Muslim by the name of Asumani, the son of Nyirabahizi.  I spell Asumani, A-S-U-M-A-N-I, Asumani, Nyirabahizi, N-Y-I-R-A-B-A-H-I-Z-I, Nyirabahizi.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did there come a time when that building was sold and, if sold, to whom?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, he didn't testify to that fact that he knew it was sold.  My learned friend is examining and is leading.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can you take it through?  He said he knew the original owner and he named one Asumani.
MR. HINDS:
	I'll rephrase the question.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did he continue to be the owner of that building and, if not, what happened?
A.	Thank you.  Asumani, son of Nyirabahizi, later on sold the building to another Muslim called Hazizi, who lived in Ruhengeri, and that Muslim person is the one who transformed the building and kind of re-constructed it anew and then, after having transformed it, he also, in time, sold it.  I spell Hazizi, 
H-A-Z-I-Z.
Q.	Do you know who Hazizi sold it to?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	And who was it?
A.	Who sold it to Hagumineza, Hagumineza.  I spell Hagumineza H-A-G-U-M-I-N-E-Z-A, Hagumineza.
Q.	Do you know what was the occupation of Hagumineza?
A.	Hagumineza was secretary -- I don't know how to call it exactly, he was secretary to the managing director, André Katabarwa, who at one time was minister for public works and who was also ambassador to, I think, Italy for a period.  He was the managing director of Electrogaz and Hagumineza was one who would give -- would allow people to talk to -- was the secretary to the managing director of Electrogaz and his name was Katabarwa, André.  I spell Katabarwa, K-A-T-A-B-A-R-W-A and he was Tutsi.
Q.	What, if anything, did Joseph Nzirorera have -- withdrawn.  

What, if any relationship, did Joseph Nzirorera have to the ownership of Isimbi?
A.	There was no relationship between Joseph Nzirorera and Isimbi but he was related to Hagumineza.
Q.	And what was that relationship?
A.	He was the brother-in-law to Nzirorera.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, do you know what were the activities that were conducted out of the Isimbi house from its inception or the first time that you knew of it to when you left Rwanda?
A.	I do not know the activities that were carried out inside but those who were passing by could see what was taking place outside the building, not just I alone.
Q.	What do you know to be the activities that you saw from passing by and being in the area?
A.	Let me explain, first of all, there's a project that had rented a big room there.  There were two projects that, in turn, occupied that big room.  I believe one was called Hidrobat, I spell -- then there is another project that was suppose to disseminate -- to provide services in this area.  And I spelled Hidrobat, H-I-D-R-O-B-A-T.  I think it's an abbreviation.
Q.	Do you know during what time period that activity was conducted at Isimbi house?
A.	I had not completed my answer.  

I was saying that the second room was being used as a place for selling water, soda and milk, soft drinks and milk.  As far as that question is concerned the Hidrobat company was providing piping services, piping water in the area, and they started in 1988.  This company started its operations in 1988 and I believe it stopped in 1989.  Then this office was taken up by another company that was also disseminating water services in the volcano area of Ruhengeri-Gisenyi and it started from 1989 and 1990 up to 1991 and I remember after the time I stopped -- I was moved from my office this company was still operating there and I remember the Frenchman who was running the company.  If you need him you can invite him to come and testify as to this.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, after you left office did you know what other activities, if any, were conducted at Isimbi house?
A.	As far as the building is concerned, if I could move back a bit it had some adjacent houses that were being used as residences for St. Joseph teachers.  I believe that these were teachers.  As far as for other activities you are talking of, I do not know.  But I know that some of them were members of MRND and some of them even had their MRND flags, so if you passed there sometimes in the morning you would see these flags up but sometimes these flags were not up so it would depend if they were there or not.
Q.	Now, who were these -- did you know the people who were renting or living in the other rooms in Isimbi house?
A.	I remember some of the names of the people who were residing there.  For instance I remember some of their first names, but I do not remember some of their family names.  As you can see, about ten years have passed by, so, I do not recall all their names.  But I remember some of them, but especially I remember the white man's name and even the names of some of the teachers who resided there, I remember their names.  If you wish, I could give you their names, if it wouldn't affect their security.  And I do not know if they are protected, their security is protected, so I do not know if I should mention their names here.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you can mention the names of any of those individuals, if you recall who they were.
A.	It was Gideon, who was a teacher at the Joseph and he was a member of MRND.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name?
THE INTERPRETER:
Gideon, yes, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
I do not recall his family name.  I think at one time I remember, I recall.  The other is Elie Naragerageje.  I spell Naragerageje, N-A-R-A-G-E-R-A-G-E-J-E, Elie Naragerageje.  So those are the people who are renting those premises.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, did you have a building in Byangabo?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	And what was the function of that building?
A.	I was renting that house.  Those who occupied it sometimes sold drinks, sometimes they would roast meat, which is popularly known as brochette.
Q.	Did you ever live in that building in Byangabo?
A.	You could be more exact, if I lived there, but if it is living there, actually, I didn't live there.  I didn't inhabit it.
Q.	Was that building a residential or a commercial building?
A.	It was a commercial house.  It was not meant for residential purposes.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, I'd like you to turn to Prosecutor's Exhibit P7, and I'd like you to look at photograph 24.  Do you recognise that photograph?
A.	I recognise the photograph well.
	(Pages 1 to 18 by R. Lear)




















1030H
Q.	And what is depicted in that photograph?
A.	It shows the Busogo commercial centre which is known as Jangabo (sic).
Q.	And look at photograph 23.  What does that depict?
A.	It shows my former residential house, as you mentioned earlier.
Q.	Um, does -- is there any structure that is existing now that is the commercial building that you owned in Byangabo?  Can you see it?
A.	You can see another house in what used to be my plot.  That's where my house was.  After my house was destroyed, the material was used to erect the new building.  Because those people who come (sic) from there they say that the house is already complete; it's no longer under construction.  That used to be my residence.
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honours.  He said "those people who came from there".
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, this is -- the witness is testifying with respect to where his structure was and, certainly, under Rule 89(C) it is probative.  It does not go to any significant issue in controversy in this case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The other problem -- they want to know where this building is.
MR. HINDS:
I haven't finished, Your Honour; because I'm going to explore it more specifically.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It's a residential building.
MR. HINDS:
Well --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what we heard from his evidence.
MR. HINDS:
I'm going to -- all of these things I need to clear up and I'm not finished with the witness at this point.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the witness is talking about two buildings at the same time, and I'm referring to the second building that he said was built -- his material was used in building.  He's talking about two buildings.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take note of that.
MR. HINDS:
May I proceed, Your Honour?

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, in -- where your commercial building was situated, is there any structure that is on that site, within that picture; and, if not, what is shown on the site where your building was located?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, Counsel.  Hold that question.
MR. HINDS:
Sure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe, Counsel, to appreciate the difficulties we have and to put the things in context, when photograph 23 was shown to the witness, he said -- the answer of the witness was that "this shows my former residence".
MR. HINDS:
Yes, but the question that preceded it, I asked the witness whether or not he had a building there.  Then I asked him what was the use of that building.  He said commercial.  Then I asked him did he ever reside there, and he said no.  Now, I don't know if it's just he is using words loosely or not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  Just to follow up; we would like to know.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, there is no question before you.  Listen to the question that I put to you and answer that question.  Do you understand that?
A.	I don't know who is putting words into my mouth, but I'm explaining what I hear.  I would like to understand the translator.  Whether in English or in French, let him say what I said.  I said it was not my own house, but it was commercial; but it was not a residential premise.  This was a house in my own plot, but it was not my residence; it was built for commercial purposes.  So, I think the translator made a mistake.  I didn't say that I lived there.  I said it was my house.  It means that I own it, but it doesn't mean that I live there.  I don't want anybody to interpret it in the manner -- in the manner that helps him.  But it is illogical to interpret it in that way.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you go on, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
Yes, Your Honour.  I think that the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, that's an explanation.  It is an answer that you can explain.  The interpreter may have said what he thought was being said.

MR. HINDS:
I don't know whether the term "house" means residence, or whatever it is, but we have --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you go on, Counsel?  You can take that into account and see whatever you want to establish from the witness.
MR. HINDS:
I think the witness has clarified that.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, the question that I am asking you --
MR. HINDS:
May I?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, the question I'm now asking you is whether or not there is any structure on the site that your previous commercial building was situated on; and, if not, in the picture, what is shown on the site where that building was located?
A.	I did not understand the question well.  Could you please repeat?
Q.	Can you see --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe before you go on, Counsel, to help us to understand, when you look at photograph No. 23, as we see it --
MR. HINDS:
Right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Are you addressing the area or some of the structures appearing in that photo?
MR. HINDS:
Well, I want the witness to describe where his building was located, more specifically, by using --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- whatever he sees in the picture.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, so let him do that.
MR. HINDS:
Maybe I was being too convoluted in my question, so let me try again.

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Can you describe to the Chamber, using picture 23, where your building was located?
A.	Thank you.  You can see that area where there are clothes drying.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you have it described, please?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
(Not translated)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
You can see this area where there are drying clothes, the first person and then three people close to the house under construction, the first person dressed in a wrapper and some two people, I suppose.  My house started where you can see a small house which is thatched with tiles, and from there, back to the foreground, to this first person in the corner.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Corner of the left-hand side of the picture.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Or on the left-hand side, please.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, can you, using a pointer, show where your previous house started and where it ended, just so that we are clear?  And leave the marker on the photograph so we see.  Indicate from what point to what point: where did it start and where did it end.
A.	You can see where this first person is standing up, to this last person in front, on the right-hand side.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you describe that for the record, Learned Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, in the bottom left-hand corner of the photograph, there is someone with their back to the camera, and then proceeding up to the next person to right, again with that person in green trousers and a dark coloured jacket.  That is the person that Mr. Kajelijeli says shows the end of where his house --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was.
MR. HINDS:
-- or his building was located, which encompasses the area on the grass that contains the clothing that seems to be drying, or washed that is out to dry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That's all right, Counsel for the Prosecution?
MS. OJEMINI:
No objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So let the record so reflect.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Kajelijeli, you can take a seat.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, where was your building located in relation to Isimbi house; how far was it from Isimbi house?
A.	Thank you.  Isimbi was situated in front of my house.
Q.	And can you estimate the distance?
A.	I would say it was about 20 metres.  It wasn't faraway.
Q.	And did you know whether or not the Conseiller Ndisetse had any -- owned any structures at Byangabo, any buildings?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, my learned friend should bear in mind that he is examining this witness and he should not ask leading questions.  This witness has not testified to anybody owning a house, apart from his testifying on this house, and he has not testified so far on this Ndisetse or on a house around the neighbourhood.  My learned friend should put the proper question to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, avoid leading questions.  We are dealing with important issues, and I think they should be raised in the appropriate manner.
MR. HINDS:
Let me rephrase, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, do you know whether or not the Conseiller Ndisetse --
A.	(Not translated)
Q.	No, no; I'll rephrase it.  Do you know where Conseiller Ndisetse lived?
A.	I know the place.
Q.	Where did he live?
A.	It was below the road, at about 30 to 40 metres from my house.
Q.	Do you know whether or not he owned any other structures at Byangabo?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, even that is leading.  The witness has not testified to which house he is referring to.  He said "his house".
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, that is not a leading question.
MS. OJEMINI:
He had made no mention of Byangabo yet in his response.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we are addressing -- well, "I know where he lived.  He lived below the road at about 30, 40 metres from my house".
MR. HINDS:
Where would that be? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe --
MR. HINDS:
In terms of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe.  Of course, we don't know.  In fairness, you can -- we are --
MR. HINDS:
Let me ask the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, it needs to be established.
MR. HINDS:
Um.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, wait.  We are not engaged in some debate here with the witness, eh?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Listen very carefully: you cannot volunteer answers.  Just listen to the questions and only answer those.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In fairness, Counsel, going by his testimony, we now know that this was the third property he owned, you know, if you start from Nkuli, Mukingo.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, where -- when you said "30 metres" -- that there was a residence of Ndisetse, a conseiller, 30 metres from your place, where -- where was that located?
A.	I would like to point out there is a problem with translation because the Kinyarwanda words are being brought back.  So I don't know what will happen, because when I say "a place where Ndisetse's house -- houses were", it doesn't mean that he lived there.  That -- when I say that this house belonged to me, it doesn't mean I was residing there.  I'm saying that, in French, there is a difference between a residential quarters and another building that a person owns.  We have to be rigid about such differences, about residential quarters and houses owned by another -- a person without residing there.  We have to clear -- to be clear about that.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, this is a problem because I know neither Kinyarwanda nor French and I am just taking the English as I am hearing it.  But I think Mr. Kajelijeli is absolutely correct: we have to be precise on the interpretation because it has all kinds of connotations.  As the Court has observed, "house" does not mean residential.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I don't think that would be the case.
MR. HINDS:
No, that is what the witness is saying.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But that might be an explanation because it might flow from the answer.  It might be the kind of words that are given.  If there is further explanation -- maybe in your question you should bear that in mind so that at least you make the distinctions.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I speak with a level of precision.  I asked whether or not he knew of any buildings.  I didn't use "residence", and I'm being very careful with my questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The answer given by the witness with regard to the Conseiller Ndisetse, was, "I know where Ndisetsi lived.  He lived below the road and at about 30 to 40 metres from my house".
MR. HINDS:
Well, he is saying, and that's what I -- because I don't -- I am not -- I don't know Kinyarwanda and I don't know French.  He is now saying that he did not say "residence", and that's the only point I'm making.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The translation that came through in the English to the last question was not "residence"; "my house".
MS. OJEMENI:
I just wanted to assist the Court in this matter.  The question put to the witness was: Do you know where Ndisetse lived?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
So it is in response to that.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, that was the question that I asked.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now where we are, we would like the clarification just to see which location.
MR. HINDS:
That is correct.  I asked him, "Do you know where Ndisetse lived?", and he said, yes; 30 to 40 metres.  And then the next question was, "Where was that located?"
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and that's where we are.
MR. HINDS:
That's where we are.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, do you understand the question that was put to you?
A.	I said we have to understand, to agree about the translations that are being forward -- put forward.  We have to agree on the terminologies being used to denote residential housing and commercial housing.
Q.	Let me start the question over to you, Mr. Kajelijeli; slowly.  Okay?  Do you know what secteur and what cellule that Ndisetse resided in, where he -- the house that he resided in?
A.	Yes, I know the secteur and the cellule in which he was living.  Yes, I know them.
Q.	Can you give that, the secteur and the cellule, to the Trial Chamber?
A.	He was in Busogo secteur and Mugogo cellule.  I'll spell Busogo, B-U-S-O-G-O; Mugogo, M-U-G-O-G-O.
Q.	Now, how far was his -- where he was living from your building in Byangabo?
A.	From the building I owned in Byangabo, I would say it was about one kilometre.
Q.	What, if any, other buildings did Ndisetse own, that you know of?
A.	Yes.  He owned some other buildings.
Q.	And where were those other buildings located in relation to where your house was located at Byangabo?
A.	Those buildings were at about 20 to 30 metres from the house I owned in Byangabo.
Q.	Was it on the same side of the street as Isimbi?
A.	Those houses were in front of the Isimbi building, just opposite, beyond the road -- on the main road towards Ruhengeri, to the right.
Q.	Did you know Nzirorera mother's house?
A.	Yes, I knew the house.  I knew where the house was.
Q.	Where was that house located, in which cellule?
A.	It was in Mugogo cellule, in cellule -- secteur Busogo.
Q.	How far was that house from where you owned your building?
A.	It was about 60 to a hundred metres from the building I owned.
Q.	Have you ever been inside that house?
A.	Yes, I did go to that house.
Q.	Under what circumstances have you been to Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	It was under different circumstances, but what I remember, the first time that's when she got baptised.
Q.	How old is she?
A.	She has died but, as I said yesterday, back home, the church came to our place in 1964 for people to be baptised.  They were baptised when they were quite elderly, even by age of 80.
Q.	What were the other occasions that you visited Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	It was at that time when Nzirorera's younger brother died in the year 1989.
Q.	And what was his name?
A.	His name was Mutima, Apollinaire.  I'll spell Mutima: M-U-T-I-M-A.
Q.	Did you visit that house under any other circumstances between 1988 and 1994?
A.	Yes, indeed, I did visit the house.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought he said 1989.  Wasn't that the date?
MR. HINDS:
I'm asking whether -- between '88 and '94 whether he visited that house on any other occasion, that is, other than his testimony about '89.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, do you remember the question I put to you?
A.	Yes, I remember the question.
Q.	Could you share your answer with the Tribunal?
A.	You asked me if I ever went to that house.  Then I said it was on the occasion when Nzirorera's younger brother died, whose name was Apollinaire Mutima, and you are continuing to ask me more questions.
Q.	Yes.  The question that is now pending, Mr. Kajelijeli, is whether you attended or visited Nzirorera's mother's house at any other occasions between 1988 and 1994.
A.	I did not visit her, but there are other circumstances why I went to her house.  But, if you wish, I could explain why I went to that house.  It was at a time when his brother's wife had died.  At that time we met there in large numbers and that was after the burial of that woman.
Q.	And you said it was his brother's wife.  Whose brother's wife?
A.	I -- I talked about his late brother.  I was talking about the wife to one of his brothers who was still alive.  The wife of Nzirorera's brother, whose known as Ntamakemwa -- there are two different brothers.  One lost a wife and his name is Ntamakemwa.  I'll spell Ntamakemwa: N-T-A-M-A-K-E-M-W-A, Ntamakemwa.
Q.	What year was this?
A.	If I'm not wrong, it was in 1992.
Q.	Where there any other occasions where you went to Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	Yes, indeed I did.
Q.	And can you tell us the circumstances and the year?
A.	It was in 1993.  That is when I went there, the reasons being it was after the burial of his brother whose name was that Ntamakemwa.
Q.	Could we have the spelling?
A.	Yes, the spelling of Ntamakemwa: N-T-A-M-A-K-E-M-W-A, Ntamakemwa.
Q.	So, is it that both Ntamakemwa and his wife had died?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Were there any other occasions between 1988 and 1994 when you --
MR. HINDS:
This is my last question, Your Honour, before the break.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Is there any other occasion between 1988 and 1994 when you visited -- when you went to Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	I did not pay her a visit, but I went there for -- because her grandchild had died.  The child had been shot dead.
Q.	Um, did you ever hold any meetings, um, ah, with anyone at her house?
A.	We never did hold meetings.  I heard such stories.  That never happened.  The last time we went there was at the burial of that grandchild -- when the grandchild had been shot by a certain lieutenant, Mburuburengero, because it was alleged that he found him in the car.  But there was no other occasion I went there.  I was working as a private man, so I didn't visit that place for any other reason.
Q.	What is the -- what was the date that you went there in connection with the shooting of Nzirorera's, um, nephew?
A.	I don't remember the date.  It was somewhere between '93 and '94.  I did not -- I don't remember the date.  I don't recall the date by heart.  I'll spell the name Mburuburengero, M-B-U-R-U-B-U-R-E-N-G-E-R-O, Mburuburengero, mentioned earlier.  He was a lieutenant.

A.	(Not interpreted)
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera at his mother's house at the time that --
MR. HINDS:
I'm hearing Kinyarwanda, so I'm not sure what is happening.  Let me try and start over again.

Q.	How well do you know him?
A.	I said that I know him, but I didn't say I know him well.
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera a friend of yours?
A.	He was a neighbour like others.
Q.	How long have you known him?
A.	Since our youth.
Q.	Do you know what, um, schools he attended, primary and secondary school?
A.	We attended the same school.  He was ahead of me at Busogo 1.

A.	Under the one-party system, he was a member of the préfectural committee.  He also became vice-president of the préfectural committee.  That's what I know about his positions until the time we fled the country.
Q.	So, is it your testimony that up to the time you fled the country in 1994 that he was on the préfectural committee of the MRND; is that correct?
A.	It is correct.
Q.	And what préfet would that be -- what préfecture would that be?

Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal which of your wives lived in which residence?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Asked and answered, Your Honour.  It was ventilated yesterday.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, unless you want to establish context.  I think we did -- when he was talking about -- he did touch on this aspect yesterday.
MR. HINDS:
I think that that was on the tape, that was on the cassette; he mentioned that.  But this is --
MS. OJEMENI:
That is what he dwelt on at length, even when we were talking about where he lived when was bourgmestre in 1994, at length.
MR. HINDS: 
That has not -- that has not -- in fact, I did not really go into that.  I asked him about his wives, when he was married to them, and so on and so forth, but I did not get into it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you -- can you locate it anywhere.  I have that kind of feeling.  But if not, since it is an introductory matter, we may have to, in order to save time, we can go through that process.
MR. HINDS:
Look, I will withdraw the question and then we can move on.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no; we just want to make sure (inaudible).

MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I am saying that I did not come --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You can run through it fast.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.  Thank you.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal which of your wives lived in which of your two residences?
A.	One was in Nkuli commune and the other one in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Who lived in Mukingo and who lived in Nkuli?
A.	The one living in Nkuli was Laurence Mukandekezi; in Mukingo, it was Sophie Mukanganizi.
Q.	Prior to April of 1994, where were you living?
A.	(Not interpreted).
Q.	You have testified, Mr. Kajelijeli, that in April 1994 you were in Nkuli, at your residence in Nkuli.  I am asking you, prior to April of 1994, where were you residing?
A.	I was in Nkuli; I was at Gisenyi whenever required.
Q.	Now -- why were you in Nkuli -- why were you residing in Nkuli on April 6 of 1994?
A.	Thank you.  I was often in Nkuli because of security concerns.  It was mainly for reasons of security.
Q.	Can you explain that to the Tribunal?  What were the security concerns?
A.	Since the war started, especially in Ruhengeri préfecture, there were lots of fights, there were lots of battles, and some leaders were killed, and others were mentioned in the radio.  There were lists that were announced on the radio, lists of people to be killed.  I was also mentioned on the radio, and I could not -- could not trust measures for my security, which made me go to a place where my security was better.  And that's the reason why I chose to be in Nkuli commune since Radio Muhabura had put me on the list of people to be -- to be -- of people to be exterminated.  

In addition to that, during the attack of 1993, which caused the occupation of part of Mukingo commune, in Rwinzovu, in Mukingo commune, this was very close to attacks from RPF, and I could not appear there very often.  It was because of these reasons. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, do you recall what you did during the day of April 6 of 1994?
A.	I remember, yes.
Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal what you did on that day?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you please tell the Tribunal what you did during the day of April 6 of 1994?
A.	That day, I left my home at 9:00 a.m.  I went to Mukamira, where I was supervising the construction of my young brother's house.  I spent the day there.  I came home at 5:30 p.m.  I was very tired, and I didn't leave my home once I got there.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, when you say "Mukamira", what cellule and what secteur is that in?
A.	The secteur was Mukamira and the cellule was also called Mukamira.
Q.	And this construction, was that -- withdrawn.  

Where you were constructing this house, your brother's house, how far was that from the Mukamira camp, military camp?
A.	From that place, you go back one kilometre and half to the military camp.  You -- there was a distance of one kilometre and half to the Mukamira military camp.
Q.	Now, what was the name of your brother whose house you were constructing?
A.	His name was Ngiruwonsanga.  Shall I spell it?  
Q.	Yes.
A.	Spelling, Ngiruwonsanga, N-G-I-R-U-W-O-N-S-A-N-G-A, Ngiruwonsanga.
Q.	Did you -- withdrawn. 

Can you tell the Tribunal how you got from your home in Nkuli to Mukamira location?
A.	Thank you.  I left my home, my residence -- I left my residence by car.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal, or describe to the Tribunal, the type of car that you used to get from your home to the location?
A.	I used the school vehicle, school vehicle belonging to Saint Joseph school.
Q.	Could you describe that vehicle: the make, the colour and if there were any markings on it? 
A.	That vehicle had "STB" inscribed on both sides.  It was a red vehicle.  There were white strips on the side.  It was a Toyota Hilux.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, when you returned to your residence, did you use that same vehicle to return to your residence in Nkuli?
A.	Yes, that's what happened.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal where did you park your vehicle when you returned?
A.	I parked the vehicle at my home's compound, in the compound, if you want.
Q.	Can you describe that -- the compound to your home?
A.	It was a large compound.  You could park there two or three vehicles.  You could also, you know, from the road or from home, you could see you -- you had a good panoramic view looking at the road, have a good view of Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road.  It was a big compound with two big houses.  You could give -- it was easy to direct someone to reach that home. 
Q.	Was the compound fenced or gated?
A.	Yes, there was fencing.
Q.	Was there a gate?
A.	Yes, there was a gate.  There was a gate in three parts.  There were three components to the gate.
Q.	Could you describe that?
A.	The middle side was always open.  The other two parts were always closed.  It was only at night when the other parts were closed.
Q.	Now, did you go out that evening after you arrived at home?
A.	It couldn't be possible, because of the insecurity.  In addition, there were orders for a curfew; people were not supposed to go out after 6 p.m., so it was not possible.  Personally, I had more reasons of security concerns.  But it was -- there was an order against it.
Q.	Now, what was the time of the curfew, from what hour to what hour?  When was the curfew in effect?
A.	According to the instructions, according to the orders, everyone was supposed to be in his or her home by 6 p.m., and so the curfew was from 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Q.	And, could you tell the Tribunal when was that curfew initiated?
A.	The curfew was initiated -- the curfew was initiated, if I remember well, from 1993, when RPF attacked in Ruhengeri and in which attack many people were killed because there was infiltration.  The préfecture was being infiltrated by RPF, so it was decided that a curfew be initiated so that the authorities may know people who may come in as spies and who may cause insecurity in the area.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, could you tell the Tribunal who was in your residence in Nkuli that evening of April 6, 1994?
A.	There was my family and three other people who were with us. 
Q.	Well, when you say "your family", can you tell us who within your family who were with you and also the names of the other people who were in your residence the evening of April the 6th?
A.	I do not know.  I will try to.  My family was made up of six children, myself and my wife, so we were eight.  And then the other people who were not members of family but who lived with us -- there was a girl, my in-law's daughter, whose -- Mahorekeye, Marie Claire.  I spell Moricheya, M-A-H-O-R -- I repeat -- I repeat the name: M-A-H-O-R-A-K-E-Y-E, Mahorekeye.  And there was also a house worker called Hakizimana, Pierre.  I spell Hakizimana, H-A-K-I-Z-I-M-A-N-A.  There was also a boy called Macumo, Simone, who had recently arrived.  This Macumo, Simone, was a Tutsi from Lyinyo, and those were people who were in my home.  I spell Macumo -- we were eleven all in all.  I spell Macumo, M-A-C-U-M-O.  I spell Lyinyo, L-Y-I-N-Y-O. 
Q.	Now, how old was Macumo?
A.	I remember he said he was 15 years old.
Q.	And what were the circumstances under which Macumo came to live with you?
A.	He came; he had fled.
Q.	When was this?
A.	He had been with us for one week, just before six.
Q.	Did you know him before he came to live with you?
A.	No, except that I knew the region, the area where he came from.
Q.	And what region was this?
A.	He came from a place called Lyinyo, this is towards near Nyamutera commune.  I spell Nyamutera,

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Repeat.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
L-Y-I-N-Y-O, Lyinyo.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, after you got home that evening, what, if anything, did you do while you were at home?
A.	I was so tired, I did not anything; I just conversed with my wife and children.  We watched a videotape, and then after that I got so tired, I went to sleep.
Q.	Around what time did you retire for the evening?
A.	Normally -- I normally retired around 10:30, but that day I retired around at 9:00 p.m.  I retired at 9:00 p.m.
Q.	Now, did there a come a time when you learnt of the death of the president?
A.	Yes, I got to learn about the president's death.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal what were the circumstances that caused you to learn of the president's death?
A.	The circumstances under which I learned of the president's death is that at 4:00 a.m., I woke and then I heard classical music.  Classical music normally causes fear, because I remember that even the time -- the day Kayibanda was removed from power, so I felt though something had happened, although it hadn't been announced.  So classical music continued up to 5:00 a.m. and then around 5:00 a.m. they started talking about the president's death, in Swahili, but I didn't hear this.  Then at 6:00 a.m., that is when it is publicly and openly announced that the president of the republic, with his Burundian counterpart, by I mean, Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira and Burundian ministers and the armed chiefs of staff, the chief of staff of the Rwandan army and people who were together in the presidential plane had been -- the plane had been shot down as it approached the landing of Grégoire Kayibanda International Airport.
Q.	Now, when you heard this announcement, what were you doing at the time that you heard this announcement?
A.	When I heard this announcement I was still in bed, but awake.
Q.	What, if anything, did you do after you heard the announcement?
A.	At home with my wife, we were astounded.  We were almost we had been struck dead, because we felt everything was over for us, learning that the president of the republic had died, hearing, learning that the president of Burundi had been killed, and another Burundian president, Melchior Ndadaye, had been killed in 1993.  So all these -- their deaths -- in brief, you asked me what I felt.  I also -- it was like I also died, because I felt my body didn't belong to me anymore.  And more to that, they said that he had been by RPF.  And, in addition, I had I felt that the fighting was going to be resumed and the war was about to resume.  And in addition to that, every time such sad events or such events took place, people would be persecuted.  So all those feelings, all these thoughts paralysed me and I didn't know what to do, except that I felt -- I lay down on my stomach and told my wife, "We are finished".  And I said, "We are about to die", because I felt that the war was about to resume and I felt that both the Hutu and the Tutsi were very unfortunate; this was no good and no good was going to happen, especially because most of them were my friends.  And so I kept on thinking about what was going to happen next, and this put me in a very -- in a sad predicament.  I was -- what I am telling is what I was telling my wife that morning, because that's what I was seeing in front of me.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, were there any instructions given to the populous at large on the radio, as you were hearing the news?
A.	As this -- it was being announced, as the president -- the killings of the two presidents and their entourages was being announced in the radio, the Minister of Defence announced that people should stay in their homes.  So we continued in this sad state.  The whole morning, after the announcement, we could not do otherwise.  We continued following the news about the death of the presidents on the radio.  That's what happened.
Q.	Now, did there come a time when you got out of bed?
A.	I did not have the energy to do so, but I tried to get out of the bed.  Between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m. I had got out of bed. 
Q.	And could you tell the Tribunal what, if anything, occurred, or you did, after getting out of bed?
A.	There was nothing I could do apart from that I received a telephone call from someone, asking me if I had heard about -- if I had heard about the presidents' death.  I told him that I had heard of the president's death, as well as that of his colleagues and entourage, and that our time was up.  And this was a telephone conversation -- I was answering him on the phone -- and he was requesting me, asking me to tell him what he should do, how he should conduct himself if I've heard about that death.  That's all.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal, using the pseudonym of the individual, who called you?
A.	Yes, I can.
Q.	And what is the pseudonym of that person who called you the morning of April the 7th?
A.	It is JK312.
Q.	Now, had you known JK312 before, and under what circumstances?
A.	I knew him before.  I knew him before, and I knew since 1988, and even in '92 I knew him,  During those periods, that time I have said, I've talked about, he was studying at ISAE Busogo university.  He also worked in Ruhengeri, and later on, he became -- he managed ************* in Nkuli, in Nyakimana, Nkuli-Nyikimana, and part of the project activities were in Mukingo commune in secteur Busogo, in Mugogo.  So that is how I came to know him.  I also met him on other occasions, and under other circumstances, like in problems he encountered.  Like in 1992, he had problems when I was bourgemestre and I was involved in solving his problems.  So I knew him even before.
Q.	Now, what, if anything, did JK312 say to you that morning, on the phone?
A.	He asked me if I had learnt of the death of the president of the republic as well as the death of the president of Burundi.  I told him that I knew, I had learned of this, and he told me that he was very worried, very preoccupied, by the death of these people because he didn't know, he was worried about what was going to happen to him, especially because it had been announced that no one should get out of their homes.  So he, in brief, told me he had security concerns for his person, and in brief that's what he told me.
Q.	And what was your response to him, if any?
A.	I responded to him because he was actually very worried, traumatised, and he told me that he had gendarmes who had been ensuring his security in his home because of security concerns.  And then I told him that since you had those gendarmes with you, there have been instructions that no one should get out of their homes.  And I said I could not get out of my home either and that this had also created problems for us.  I told him he should not leave his home, especially because he was not liked already because of his ethnic group.  So I told him he should try to calm down and that if I get to know any news, depending upon what the radio says or by any other means, I will inform him.  I told him I would inform him, but I told him he should not leave his home for security reasons.
Q.	Now, did you receive any visitors that morning while you were at home?
A.	After he had telephoned me, there is a sister of mine, from my aunt, from my stepmother's side, who lived in Nkuli, who came to my home.  She -- when she came, she hadn't known that the president had been killed.  She was a villager and she had not listened to the radio.  And then she came and she found us with the other people I told you about who were in my home already.
Q.	Now what was her name?
A.	The name was Angelina Ntawigomwa.  I spell Ntawigomwa, N-T-A-W-I-G-O-M-W-A.
Q.	And, Mr. Kajelijeli, do you know why your sister came to see that morning?
A.	My sister had a problem.  Her child, called Mugabo, who was attending school at Saint Joseph -- I spell Mugabo, M-U-G-A-B-O.
Q.	And what was the nature of the problem that she was having?
A.	She had a problem related to school fees.  She was requesting me to inform -- to ask the director, the school headmaster, to allow them to pay school fees in two instalments.
Q.	Did she remain at your home in Nkuli the rest of the day?
A.	No.  Later on, she went back after learning that we were also sad because of the death of the president.  We were so weak.  It was like we were really sick; we had been affected very much.  We couldn't discuss much, so she could see that and she left and went back to her home.
Q.	What, if anything, did you do after she left?
A.	Before -- actually before she left -- you will excuse me.  Before she left, JK312 came to my home, and this was -- I was not expecting this, and he was really traumatised; he was terrified.  And as soon as he knocked on the door, I got up.  He told me the problems he had, his pre-occupations.  I spent - I spent a lot of time with him, up to about 8:30, discussing the pre-occupations as to  -- our pre-occupations as to what might follow the death of the two presidents and their entourages.  After JK312 left, that's when she also left, because he arrived before I could -- we could discuss with my sister.  So that's when she left.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, where did you meet JK312?  Was it inside your house or outside of your house?
A.	He entered into the house, and because I didn't like, like I told you, I didn't want -- I had a man called Macumo who had been with us for one week, I didn't want to meet with them together.  So we went out and discussed -- we had our small meeting outside the house.
Q.	When you say "out", what would that be?
A.	This is in the compound of my home, but inside the fence.
Q.	If you were outside, do you know whether or not your gate was open or closed?
A.	It was open, because that is where he went through; that is where he passed in order to come in.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, how were you dressed at the time that you were meeting with these individuals; that is, your sister and now JK312?
A.	I was not yet dressed, fully dressed; I was still wearing slippers and pyjamas, and because it had been announced that no one should leave their homes, and we were sad, so I was still dressed in -- I was not yet ready; I was not fully clothed, I was in that attire.
Q.	Now, can you tell the Tribunal on the occasion that you were meeting with JK312, in your compound, what was his pre-occupation and what did you say to him?
A.	He came to tell me that the situation was very serious, that near his home people were making a lot of noise, and he was requesting to come and stay in my home.  I asked him the people he was with.  He told me he was with gendarmes and his child, and his two children and a house girl, and said -- he was saying that those should come.  I told him that if that is the case, this can create problems for me because we are eleven people in the home already, and you might come -- five of you, may come and there might be problems -- problems would be created, and then the gendarmes who were ensuring your security, so it cannot be left unknown, it will be known, and the gendarmes will come with you and because of this -- I was living near the commune and the bourgmestre would know. I advised him to quickly go back, hiding, and lock up his home and instruct the gendarmes guarding him that no one should try to look for him, and that if I get the means, if I may give -- I pass on his situation to anyone else, and if I have the responsibilities, I will inform him as to what will have followed.  He understood me, but he was terrified and he was not happy with what I had told him, especially because when, as we were standing by the road -- you will excuse me, I think I went too far.  But that's what we discussed.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, can the witness slow down a bit?  It is too fast for people who are taking notes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can you slow down when you answer questions so that those -- for two things -- for two reasons:  One, to allow translation to come in, to come through easily; and, ,secondly those who want to take notes, can do so.
THE WITNESS:
You will excuse me, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You just slow down.  Just bear that in mind.
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you very much, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, after you spoke to JK312, what, if anything, did you do with respect to the concerns he raised with you?
A.	As we were discussing, we could see people by the roadsides, coming and going.  Most of them were heading towards Gisenyi, and there were others who could be seen running towards Ruhengeri.  So we agreed -- we agreed that he should go, but secretly, and live in his home, and if I get something concrete, I would inform him.  I told him that I was also concerned about his security, although I had also my own person security concerns, especially because of the death of the president and the many other people who had been killed.  So he left.  After he left, I discussed with my sister who had remained behind.   

After escorting my sister, I rang my brother-in-law who was a military person in Ruhengeri.  I told him about our problem, and he also told him that they were also mourning the death of the president and that they were expecting RPF to attack.  And I told him that I have a friend who was in serious problems and that if they do not assist him, he will face serious problems.  So I requested him to look for the person in charge of the gendarmes who had gone to ensure security for that person so that he may inform them what problems he has and then he should tell me what had come of this.  And I told him that I did not know what was going to happen by the end of the day, and that he should tell me.  Then between 2:30 and or  2:50 -- I mean 8:30 or 8:50 -- I was not looking at the watch, but after 10 or 15 minutes, he informed me that he had talked to the person in charge of the gendarmes and that he had accepted that the issue of gendarmes guarding JK312 is known to him and that people will go to replace those who had been guarding him overnight.  I'm talking about after the 7th, that on the 8th they might have to go and evacuate him if the insecurity remains as it is.  That is what I was able to discuss with my brother-in-law.  That was in the morning before 9:00 a.m.
Q.	And, how did you have this discussion with your brother-in-law?
A.	I rang him, because I knew his -- I knew the telephone number at the military camp.
Q.	And where was that camp located?
A.	That military camp was -- this was called Mubona, in Ruhengeri, and this was in Ruhengeri camp. Mubona, I spell Mubona, M-U-B-O-N-A, Mubona camp.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, you testified that you saw people on the road at the time that you were having this discussion with JK312 in your compound.  Could you describe to the Trial Chamber the elevations between your compound and the road in terms of the relative heights of the road to your compound?
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour. The witness has not said anything about elevations.
MR. HINDS:
That is correct, and I am asking him that, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
I think my learned friend can simply ask the witness to describe, you know, the road in terms of events, if there is any, because he has even not talked about the road.  He talked about seeing people going towards Gisenyi and some people going towards Ruhengeri, but he never mentioned a road.
MR. HINDS: 
What is the basis of the objection, Your Honour?
MS. OJEMENI:
Leading.
MR. HINDS:
That clearly is not a leading question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, he asked generally about the elevation.
MR. HINDS:
What is leading about it, Counsel?  It is not a leading question.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Will you proceed, please.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, he mentioned heights I suppose.  He talked about elevation and he said heights.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you can proceed.
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, could you describe to the Trial Chamber the relative elevations between your house and the road?
A.	Before I continue, what the Prosecutor has just said is, I said that some people were heading towards Ruhengeri and others towards Gisenyi. I did not exactly say where those people were going.  So the Prosecutor did not say exactly what I said.  What she said I said is not true.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you answer the counsel's question? You are not answering the Prosecutor.  There will be time for that.
MR. HINDS:
Mr. Kajelijeli, just listen to my questions and answer those questions.  Ignore the Prosecutor for this moment.  But listen to me.  Right.  Just answer my questions so we can move forwards.  Do you remember the question?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, he doesn't have to ignore the question the Prosecutor --  He does not answer the Prosecutor.
MR. HINDS:
Well, whatever, I don't want him to be involved in any argument with the Prosecutor.  So I don't want him to pay any attention to what she is saying according to me.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, in other words, the Court does not want -- use proper words, ignore is not a good word.
MR. HINDS:
Well, I don't want him to address the Prosecutor.  I don't want him to in fact be involved in any side discussion with the Prosecutor. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's right.
MR. HINDS:
Pay attention to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's right, yes.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, do you remember the question, Mr. Kajelijeli?
A.	I am in an impasse, if I am saying words and then these words are deformed when I am testifying in my own case, it is a very big question, a big concern to me. 
Q.	Do you remember the question I put to you?
A.	Yes, I remember the question.
Q.	Could you answer it?
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  My home where I lived, were JK312, where I was with JK312 and from where I could see people heading towards Gisenyi or towards Ruhengeri, that place is elevated, it is high so that the person from the road can see my home clearly, and if I am standing, he -- someone from the road can see people standing in my home just like I could see the people from the road, I could see them, but I could not know their names, but I could see what they had, what they were holding in their hands.  So according to the question you asked me that place was elevated, it was like a mount, a hill and I was at the foot or in a valley or at the foot of the hill or in the valley. From my home I could also see the Commune Nkuli office very well.   I could see people going there.  And I believe that those who have visited the area would agree with this.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, you testified that you saw people on the road when JK312 was at your compound.  Can you tell the Tribunal what if anything, you saw these people doing at that time in the morning?
A.	Thank you.  The first people, the first big group of people I saw were refugees, that is what I could call it, because according to what it appeared to be refugees, from what they were carrying. They were carrying sheeting which they normally call refugee tents.  Others were holding local mats, traditional mats. Others were carrying small bags, others were carrying pieces, firewood and with their children and mothers.  I could see them moving and in the other opposite direction, I could see a young man running.  They were also heading towards Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road.  So I didn't dwell so much on there because this is a man JK312, I wanted him to leave before there are many people around.  So I entered my home and tried to prepare myself to get myself ready. I took breakfast, I took tea, but for us we actually take porridge. So I took porridge and after getting myself ready, between 8:45 and like I said, I told you.  I talked to my brother-in-law.  After we had talked -- after I had talked with him, it was around nine and the time I was ready and so I was in my home up to 9.00 a.m.
Q.	Now, with respect to the people you saw on the road, you said you saw one group who appeared to be refugees, travelling.  In which direction were they travelling on the Gisenyi to Ruhengeri road, which direction?
A.	They were heading -- they were coming from Ruhengeri direction and going towards Gisenyi direction.
Q.	And then you said you saw another group of people who were running.  In which direction were they running?
A.	They were running towards Ruhengeri, towards Ruhengeri, this was still on the tarmac road. 
Q.	And could you describe those young people in terms of what they may have been carrying?
A.	I could not see them clearly, but the ones I saw clearly had clubs, they had sticks, things like that.
Q.	During -- at that time that you saw these people on the road, did you hear any gunfire or any explosions coming from any direction at that time?
A.	What you have just described, I heard these after 9 a.m., because around nine, I saw the Nkuli bourgmestre coming to the communal office from Mukingo commune.  He came from Mukingo commune, I disobeyed the instructions that was -- were given on the radio.  I felt I had -- I could not stay at home without gathering information especially because bourgmestres normally have access to more information other than the information, that we normal people get from the radio. So I left my home around 9, five past nine, and I found the bourgmestre on the way, and I greeted him.  Then I stayed a little longer at the commune.  There are some people who found me there.  So I left the bourgmestre and then he went into his office.  From his office, he went away straight. and then it is afterwards that I heard gunshots and noises.  So I heard the gunshots and explosions when I was at the Nkuli commune between 9:00, I arrived at the commune about 5-10 past nine. If after that I heard the gunshots and explosions. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think this would be an appropriate place to stop.  I could have had one or two more questions, but it would --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's okay. Very well.  Yes, we will stop here and resume our work at half past two in the afternoon.  

Until then these proceedings stand adjourned.  
(Court recessed at 1304H)

(Court resumed at 1437H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Learned counsel, can you continue your examination-in-chief?
MR. HINDS:
Thank you. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, before the break, you indicated that you had left your home and gone to the commune office.  Can you tell the Tribunal what was the distance between your home in Nkuli and the commune office? 
A.	Thank you.  The distance between my house and Nkuli commune is between 150 and 200 metres. 
Q.	Now --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Between? 
THE WITNESS:
Between 150 and 200 metres.  I did not count.  It's anywhere between 100, 150 and 200 metres.  It could be about 150 metres' distance. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, when you got to the commune office, did you meet the bourgmestre?
A.	Yes, I indeed met him. 
Q.	Where did you meet him?  Was it inside or outside of the commune office? 
A.	It was outside in the compound of the communal office. 
Q.	Were there other individuals who were outside of the commune office when you met with the bourgmestre? 
A.	Yes, there were people there. 
Q.	Do you know the names of those individuals who were gathered outside of the office? 
A.	Some of them were policemen; others were traders who had come there while I was with the bourgmestre.
Q.	Can you give us the names, if you recall, of those individuals who were there when you met the bourgmestre outside of the commune office? 
A.	I could mention two among the policemen, those I can remember.  The first one is Sebagabo.  I spell Sebagabo, Sebagabo.  (No interpretation).  

Among the traders that came around, there was Mihigo, Amiel, as well as Kabonanye, Daniel, and Ntagahira.  Those are the people I can remember, whose names I can remember.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell out the names please, these names, please, interpreter?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	What was the name of the bourgmestre? 
A.	The name was Gatsimbanye (phonetic), Dominic. 
Q.	And did you have any conversation with the bourgmestre at that time, that morning? 
A.	Yes, we talked. 
Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal what you talked about with the bourgmestre that morning? 
A.	Thank you.  That morning I was very much perturbed about the security of my family in Mukingo following the announcement of the death of the president of the republic and that of the president of Burundi, and I wanted to know the -- about the security of Mukingo commune, because the bourgmestre came from that Mukingo commune.  He told me that when he was there last, that the time he left the commune, that by that time there was not yet any trouble that could be noticed; it was still quite calm.  That's what he told me.  

After learning what I wanted to know, I left him, and he went back to his office and afterwards I went away and kept talking with the traders that were gathered around there, because they themselves were perturbed by what they had heard over the radio.  That's all. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, while you were at the commune office at that time, did you hear gunshots or any explosions coming from any direction, at that time of the morning? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that has been asked and answered.  Before we went to the lunch break:  "I heard the gunshots and explosions at about ten minutes past nine while at the Nkuli office".
MR. HINDS:
I want to know which direction --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, direction.
MR. HINDS:
-- did he hear; where it was coming from.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you testified concerning gunshots that you -- and explosions that you heard.  Could you tell the Tribunal, if you could, what direction, or where did you hear those gunshots or explosions coming from -- what direction? 
A.	Between 10:00 and 11:00 I heard reports of guns from Mukamira direction, and the noise of gunshots, but I wasn't alone.  We also heard gunshots from the direction of Kinyababa in the Rwankeri mission at about a kilometre and a half from Nkuli commune, the distance as the crow flies. 
Q.	Now, where is the Rwankeri mission?  Is that -- what commune is that in?
A.	Rwankeri mission is in Nkuli commune, secteur Gitwa, cellule Gitwa and Kinyababa, cellule Kinyababa. 
Q.	Aside from gunshots, did you hear any explosions, and if you did, could you tell the Tribunal what directions those explosions were coming from? 
A.	What I heard in terms of explosions, it was on the side of Mukingo, according to what we used to hear them, those were the sounds of big guns.  It was in Mukingo part, towards Kinigi area. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, how long did you stay within -- at the commune office that morning? 
A.	Between 10:00 and 11:00 I had left the commune and I had gone back to my house. 
Q.	Now, before leaving the commune office, did you have any conversations with the people you call traders who were there? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I talked with traders. 
Q.	And what was the sum and substance of your discussions with them?  What were you talking about? 
A.	The traders had come to see the bourgmestre, but the bourgmestre didn't receive them because he immediately left.  So I stayed behind and I was talking with them about the president's death and the death of the chief of staff, especially as those were his relatives. 
Q.	Did anyone else -- did you talk to anyone else other than the traders who were there that morning? 
A.	There was the president of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church who came from Rwankeri mission.  I talked with him.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal what was the sum and substance of your discussions with the president of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church? 
A.	The President of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church came looking for help, but unfortunately the bourgmestre had just left, had driven away.  Among what he talked together, he said that the mission was besieged and he had come on foot, although he had two vehicles, because he -- he was seeking help from the bourgmestre and that the mission was being besieged. 
Q.	Did he give any more details than just telling you that the mission was besieged?  Did he indicate besieged by whom? 
A.	He said that there were some youths, some hooligans, that had come from all over the place, and he mentioned some that he knew, because he himself is from that area.  So he knew some of them, and we even, ourselves, found that those were hooligans that were known locally.  On finding the bourgmestre away, he went back to the mission.  I don't know whether he saw him afterwards because I didn't meet him afterwards. 
Q.	Now, did you get any details concerning him, saying that the mission was besieged?  Was it the church itself or were there other details that he gave? 
A.	It was not the church.  It was, rather, his neighbours who were being besieged.  They were the pastors, and he also said that they wanted the keys of the mission's vehicles, and that those people who besieged the mission were actually local people, those who came from Rukoma.  He mentioned one name that I knew very well.  He also mentioned people who came from Kinyababa.  He mentioned their names, and the groups that they belonged to, he mentioned that. 
Q.	What groups did he mention that these people belonged to -- that is, the people who were being besieged and the people who were besieging them? 
A.	Those who were besieging the neighbours had come from Rukoma.  They were led by a certain Tegera, who was a former police -- communal police.  Others were led by a certain Gahungu, and he came from Kinyababa.  And he also mentioned a certain Habiyambere, who was leading a group, those groups, the ones that besieged the mission, and apparently they were those that were actually shooting, but the shooting didn't last for a long time according to the period I heard the report of guns.  It was between 10:00 and 11:00 in the morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we have the names spelt out, please?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
They were Tegera, T-E-G-E-R-A; Gahungu, G-A-H-U-N-G-U; Habiyambere, H-A-B-I-Y-A-M-B-E-R-E, Habiyambere; and Kinyababa, K-I-N-Y-A-B-A-B-A; and Rukoma, R-U-K-O-M-A, Rukoma.

THE WITNESS:
His name was Phénéas Karekezi. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I spell the name, K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I, Karekezi, Phénéas. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, what was your state of mind?  How did you feel at the time that you got the report from the president of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, and when you were hearing these explosions and gunshots at that time? 
A.	I was very highly perturbed, especially as my security was not assured in addition to the death of President Habyarimana and his counterparts.  And, besides, I had a family in Mukingo commune and I knew that whenever there is war, there were attacks by the RPF that there were innocent people that would lose their lives.  

I actually was very perturbed.  There are, for example, some of my Tutsi friends that were in Mukingo commune and at that mission I had a few Tutsi friends and Tutsi -- Hutu people who got married to Tutsi women.  I was highly perturbed by that situation.  I had a lot of problems, especially as I was totally powerless.  I was really -- I was literally sick, up to today. 
Q.	Did you consider getting in your vehicle and trying to seek help or assistance at that moment? 
A.	It was not easy for me given the situation of the moment, I mean, on the 7th.  I chose to go home and suffer there.  I'm even the one that told my wife that the president-pastor had just told me that the mission had been attacked, invaded.  I understood that the situation was very critical.  I didn't think that it was wise to take a vehicle on that day, because I myself felt that death was approaching, for me.  I didn't even have any strength at all. 
Q.	Now, why did you feel, Mr. Kajelijeli, at that time, that death was approaching you? 
A.	I felt it was possible for me to die because I had been under permanent threat.  I was being persecuted, and on hearing that the presidents of both Rwanda and Burundi, they had perished together with the chief of staff, I felt that the war was imminent and that many innocent people were going to lose their lives, especially after a short time you would hear the -- explosions of guns and bombs continuously.  So I told my family that we were in the last days, as it is mentioned in the bible. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, at -- withdrawn. 

You've testified that at some time you left the commune office grounds and went back to your house; is that correct? 
A.	At around 11:00 that morning, I was already back home. 
Q.	Now, what did you do when you got home that morning? 
A.	I talked with my wife about what I had heard on the commune and what I had talked with the Mukingo commune bourgmestre and that he didn't know about the security situation in Mukingo, and that everything was calm when he left.  But after knowing what was happening around the Seventh-Day Adventist church, I told my wife that we are facing a great danger.  

After talking with my wife, I listened to the news, up to 12:00, 12:30.  Afterwards I went and stood in front of my home and I was looking left and right, because I was careful not to be invaded because I knew that the Tutsi were threatened after the death of the president, especially on hearing what was happening around the Seventh-Day Adventist church in Rwankeri.  This made me stay close to my home, in front of my house, watching out. 
Q.	Now, as a result of the information you obtained in connection with JK312, what, if anything, did you do? 
A.	I did not do anything else, other than -- but even the phones in my house were broken down.  I wanted to tell him that my brother-in-law would come and take him away, not later than the 8th, in the morning.  I sent my son to go and tell him to pack what he can, and leave what he can't, because if there's no change on the 8th, in the morning, he would be taken away. 
Q.	Now, what was the name of your son whom you sent with that message? 
A.	My son's name is Ingabire.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I-N-G-A-B-I-R-E, Ingabire. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, what, if anything, did you do later on that afternoon of the 7th? 
A.	On the 7th, in the afternoon, I kept close to my home, behind my home, behind the compound, if you like.  I was watching left and right.  There were passers-by; there were people who looked afflicted, especially those who are related to those who had perished.  I was talking with some of those people. 
Q.	Now, did you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know whether you can clarify  "those who had perished"?  Who does the witness have in mind? 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, could you describe the people whom you said you were talking to in the afternoon?  Whom did you speak with? 
A.	The first person I talked with was a lady known as an Agnes Manenda, who was my neighbour.  She was a nurse at the health -- the Busogo health centre where she worked with the nuns.  I talked with her.  There is also a pastor I talked with.  His name was Zacharie Rutebuka.  He comes from Nkuli, Gihinga and secteur Rukoma.  I also talked with him.  There is also a certain Gacumbitsi, Daniel.  I talked with him.  Those are the few people I can recall -- whose names I can recall to have talked with that afternoon. 
Q.	Now, can you --
MR. KIYEYEU:
I'm sorry, My Lord, again the names, because otherwise we'll have problems with the stenotypists. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can you spell them out, please, interpreter?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The second name is Manenda, M-A-N-E-N-D-A.  The other name is Rutebuka, R-U-T-E-B-U-K-A.  And the last name is G-A-C-U-M-B-I-T-S-I, Gacumbitsi.

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, you said you spoke to people who were either relatives or had some association with people who had perished, and the Tribunal would like to know what people you were talking about who had perished. 
A.	The names of those people that had perished, the first was the President of the Republic, Habyarimana, Juvénal.  The second one was the President of Burundi, Ntaryamira, Cyprien.  The third was the chief of staff Nsabimana, Déogratias.  And the ambassador Renzaho, Juvénal, who is also a relative of mine; that is why I was seriously affected, although, of course, I was affected by the death of the others, but I was related to him.  There were also other ministers from Burundi whose names I cannot recall.  Even the principal private secretary of the president of the republic, Sagatwa, Elie, together with other people whose names I do not remember. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, did any of your neighbours --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell out the names, particularly those which are being mentioned for the first time, interpreter?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The first name is Ntaryamira, N-T-A-R-Y-A-M-I-R-A; Nsabimana, N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A; Renzaho, R-E-N-Z-A-H-O; and Sagatwa, S-A-G-A-T-W-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel, please go on? 
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, other than yourself, can you tell the Tribunal whether any of your neighbours or the people you spoke to that afternoon were associated or had any relations to the people who had perished on the plane? 
A.	Thank you.  There were such people.  I could mention a certain Kabonane.  I could also mention a certain Gacumbitsi.  And there is also one Nshuye, Esrone (phonetic).  Those are the few I can recall.  

The other neighbours of mine, they were crying because they believed that about 80 metres, 50 metres, 100 metres away from my house there was such a big problem in the commune because they heard people crying, because it's understandable because they had a close relationship, especially with the chief of staff.
MR. HINDS:
Could we have the spelling of those names, if they have not been previously spelt out?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The spelling of the names are Kabonane, K-A-B-O-N-A-N-E; the second one Gacumbitsi, G-A-C-U-M-B-I-T-S-I; Nshuye, N-S-H-U-Y-E, Nshuye. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	That afternoon, did you learn -- did you learn from any of your neighbours about any events that had taken place in Nkuli that day? 
A.	There is one office messenger of the Nkuli court whose name is Karekezi, Phénéas.  He's the one who passed by my house where I was standing in the afternoon, and told me that the Tutsis of Kinyababa had been molested and they had been attacked and killed.  And some other people, whose names I don't remember, actually came to tell me, especially as I told you that between 10:00 and 11:00 we heard gunshots; that person confirmed that.  I also mentioned the pastor known as Rutebuka.  He said that the attacks that came from Rukoma -- that the attacks came from Rukoma.  I came to learn about it from the mouth of Karekezi, Phénéas.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Karekezi, K-A-R-A-K-E-Z-I, Phénéas. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did you learn any information --
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I spell the name Rutebuka, R-U-T-E-B-U-K-A, Zacayu. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Who (sic) is Rukoma?  What cellule and what secteur is he from? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who is that? 
MR. HINDS:
Rukoma.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought it was a place.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Oh.  Where is Rukoma?  What secteur and what commune? 
A.	Rukoma is a secteur in Nkuli commune, near secteur Gitwa, at the border with secteur Kinyababa -- at the border with secteur Kinyababa. 
Q.	Did you -- did you obtain any information from Agnes in connection with any incidents that occurred in Mukingo commune that afternoon? 
A.	When Agnes passed before my house, she was crying and she was telling me that the Tutsi families that had taken refuge at the nuns' convent had been found there and been killed, and that the nuns' houses had been looted, and that she left that -- when she left, the nuns had fled to the priests' houses. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, during that day, during that afternoon, did you obtain any news about events in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, I heard some news from Kigali. 
Q.	And what was the source of the news that you heard about the events in Kigali? 
A.	Between 3:00 and 4:00 o'clock I went to listen to the news -- I went back to listen to the news, and I heard that the situation was very bad in Kigali, and I heard that the prime minister Uwilingiyimana, Agathe, had just been killed and that the prosecutor-general had also been killed.  They also mentioned a certain Nsamrambaro, Frédéric, who was the minister of agricultural and animal husbandry, had been killed, and that the RPF soldiers that were camping in the national -- the national assembly building, that they had left it and they had attacked an area known as Cachy (phonetic) in Kigali.  But, in the meantime, they would go back to the death of the president and the circumstances surrounding his death.  When I heard that such is the situation, I kept on telling my wife that, if possible, we should pack -- we should pack up because, according to the news I was gathering around, the whole country was on fire. 
Q.	Now, what, if anything, did you do for the rest of that day of the 7th, in the evening? 
A.	I did nothing else besides that I was very much thinking about my family that was in Mukingo commune, and I could hear big guns being fired from the direction of Kinigi and Mukingo.  I talked with my wife about the -- how I could go and take away my family that was staying in Mukingo.  That's what I thought about throughout the night, and we decided that I should go and bring them around on the 8th, the following day, and she should also prepare herself, how -- on how she could house them and where they could stay in my house there. 
Q.	Did you at any time leave your residence in Nkuli that night of the 7th? 
A.	I told you it was impossible because of the security situation and the orders that had been given concerning the curfew.  Besides what I have said, the war had started in earnest and it was impossible for me to move out of my house.  I didn't do -- I didn't move from my house. 
Q.	Aside from the radio and your neighbours, did you have any other source of information about what was happening either locally or in Kigali? 
A.	I followed the radio broadcasts because nobody could leave Kigali and talk about the other events.  What I heard was what happened that day, is what I relied on, and nobody could reach my house at night because there were those instructions not to move, and especially as the war had started.  Nobody could move and nobody could reach my house that night. 
Q.	What was the situation with your phone?  Did you have a phone, a functioning phone at your house? 
A.	I had a phone, but it had broken down around -- between 10:00 and 11:00.  It was no longer functioning. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time when you retired for the evening on the 7th? 
A.	I said that between 3:00 and ten past three, I went back to my house and I didn't leave it, and I went on listening to the news, and every piece of news that came out was bad.  So there was nothing that could encourage me to recover from my state of mind. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I draw your attention to April 8th, and can you tell the Tribunal what time you woke up on that particular day? 
A.	Thank you.  I woke up at 12 -- 10 past 12 in the morning.  I woke up after listening to the news at 10 past 6 in the morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  Did I hear -- 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Ten past six in the morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ten past twelve.
MR. HINDS:
That's what I heard.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it's ten past six.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Ten past six in the morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, how did you spend the night, the night of the 7th? 
A.	I can say in French that I had nightmares, considering how we spent the night, it was impossible to get any sleep.  We thought we might not survive.  There were very heavy gunshots.  We heard -- we felt that the battles were very near.  We were in a kind of mourning.  We were in a kind of mourning, it was a terrible tragedy.  We had some relatives among the victims.  I told you about one ambassador who was a member of our family.  I have told you about the chief of staff.  The chief's brothers were neighbours and close associates.  In fact, those relatives -- those neighbours, we should have gone to see them, to help them following that tragedy.  But because there was a curfew, it was not possible to go and visit them, and all of us were really crestfallen.  We really spent a bad night.  One felt lifeless and there was no hope -- there was no hope.  It was a terrible hour for us. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, what did you do on the morning of the 8th, if anything, when you got up? 
A.	In the morning on the 8th I was at home.  I agreed with my wife that she should prepare shelter for my family in Mukingo to come and stay in, especially that I had to go and collect my parents, my wife and children.  This is -- we spent the morning making preparations for this.  Between 11:00 and 12:00 noon we were also still worried about the security on the way.  I feared to take my vehicle.  I felt I should first get some latest information on security. 
Q.	Now, what was the conditions in your surrounding commune that you were able to discern just from listening and looking around that morning?  Can you share with the Tribunal whether things had changed from the evening of the 7th? 
A.	There was a lot of change. 
(Pages46 to 55 by Geraldine O'Loughlin)

	1530H
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Can you describe what those changes were? 
A.	It had changed in a terrible way.  I spoke about the massacres carried out on the 7th.  There were killings at the Rwankeri parish at Kinyababa in Nkuli commune, I didn't know about the other areas.  There were also reports of killings of the batutsi in Mukingo, Tutsis who had taken -- sought safety in the convent.  Many of these were friends and they were in living -- thanks to me.  That day on the 8th it was a horrible day in Ruhengeri préfecture, because that is when it was learnt that the préfet had been assassinated by the RPF.  I knew the préfet very well, he had been my leader until 1993.  I was a good acquaintance of his family.  I thought after that date things would get terrible and the radio also announced that a certain colonel called Hakizimana, a brother of Bishop Ruzindana who had been assassinated in Kibaye, it was announced that this colonel had been killed with his wife, the wife being a Tutsi, and it was reported that the  RPF had killed this couple, and that colonel used to visit me with his Tutsi wife, we were very familiar.  On the radio, it was announced about many other victims including the president of the Court of First Instance in Kigali, the Judge was called 
Judge Hakizimana, Johane.  I knew him personally.  His wife had been a teacher in Busogo when I was a bourgmestre.  There were many other victims, many from Ruhengeri, and these were reported killed.  People who could move -- people who had money, many of these people -- I learnt afterwards that many people started running away.  Some of the people had run to the embassies in Kigali.  In other words, the RPF had started a real war in Kigali.  Of course, this continued, that morning there were further reports that in Ruhengeri the RPF had organised attacks, gunshots or heavy fire could be heard.  My plan to go and look for my family in Mukingo -- I started wavering about this plan because I was scared.  What I could hear on that date, that is in short, what the situation was that morning. 
Q.	Now, could we have the spelling of the names?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I beg your pardon.  Hakizimana, H-A-K-I-Z-I-M-A-N-A.  Ruzindana, R-U-Z-I-N-D-A-N-A.  Hatajekimana, H-A-T-A-J-E-K-I-M-A-N-A.  The interpreters apologises:  It is 
	H-A-T-E-G-E-K-I-M-A-N-A. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did there come a time when you left your house in Nkuli that morning, the first time you left your house? 
A.	I couldn't go anywhere.  I took advice, I went to see the bourgmestre of Nkuli, asking him how the roads were and he informed me that many people had been killed in Mukingo.  He even repeated to me the information about the massacres and people in charge of security could not do anything about it, even the securities officials risked to be killed, and even police officers -- at the police, there was shortage of police at the commune offices.  The bourgmestre told me that I could go on my journey, but I should be very serious and should take care all the way, this was about five past twelve or around five to twelve, ten past twelve.  I came back home and prepared my journey. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, when the bourgmestre revealed to you the information concerning the killings that had taken place in Mukingo, as you said, did he also share with you information concerning killings that had taken place in his commune, Nkuli? 
A.	I can tell you that he was also under shock because of those killings.  When he heard that the préfet had been killed, he kind of surrendered.  He told me -- he did say not anything about Nkuli, because he had not had enough time to follow up this news, but he was repeating to me news that had already been communicated to me, I had been told by a nurse who had been treating people at the health centre of Busogo. 
Q.	Now, when he shared this information with you, did you ask him any questions concerning what steps he or any other of the authorities had taken to protect the citizens who were killed? 
A.	I asked him -- according to my usual contact, I asked him wasn't there any way of getting some help.  He answered that morning of 8th, after the death of the préfet, the whole of Ruhengeri was out of its mind, so to say.  There wasn't enough police force to go round and the battles between the forces would not allow the army to bring some help, because the RPF was busy fighting anybody.  It was each for himself or herself, and, according to the situation, there wasn't even enough time to discuss.  You could see how worried he was.  Every leader was seriously affected by these problems, especially after learning that the president had been assassinated and the préfet of Ruhengeri had been killed, you know, it was delicate.  To ask him many questions would have provoked some suspicion to him. 
Q.	Now, what was going through your mind when he was describing all those events, as the bourgmestre, that had taken place?  What was going through your mind? 
A.	I personally -- I told you how I felt on the 7th.  On the 8th, following the news of the death of the préfet, I could not see any hope after the bourgmestre told me that in Mukingo commune Tutsis had been exterminated.  I have told you that I had many friends among Tutsis.  In the past I had been very useful to them.  Every time there had been attacks, I had done everything possible as a bourgmestre or I would seek help, but this time the leadership could not assist and I felt this was a tragedy, my tragedy as well.  I felt I was affected by these deaths; I am still affected.  I can see some of the Tutsis who were relatives, some were in-laws; some have survived, of course, but they also lost many members of their families.  I felt this was a tragedy for me, considering especially the different relations I had with them. 
Q.	Now, what, if anything, did you do after you heard this news from the bourgmestre of Nkuli? 
A.	I thought -- I took the decision to kind of take a high risk.  I took the risk of going to collect my family, despite the intensity of explosions, according to what the bourgmestre had told me.  I took my vehicle to Mukingo.  I was afraid of going to Rwinzovu where my family was staying, instead I went to the Mukingo commune to talk with the bourgmestre of Mukingo and assess the situation about security on the way.  I believed the bourgmestre would know what was the security situation.  I therefore left Nkuli between 12:30 and went to Mukingo commune, if I remember well, I arrived at 12:45.  I was lucky to find the bourgmestre there; I found the bourgmestre there.
Q.	Now, what was the name of the bourgmestre?
A.	His name was Harerimana, Emmanuel. 
Q.	Was he the bourgmestre who replaced you after you left office in February of 1993? 
A.	That was after Ndisetse and Semahane, who had acted in that capacity.  He is the one who was a substantive bourgmestre to replace me. 
Q.	Did you have any discussions with him when you got to the Mukingo commune office? 
A.	He gave me fresh news, that after the death of the two presidents and their entourage, he gave me new information about the death of the préfet and the death of Colonel Bosiyane Ndabaze, whose names I cannot recall, and he told me that he had been to the burial of people exterminated by attacks in Mukingo, at Rwankeri, at the parish and at the convent. 
Q.	What was the name of the préfet of Ruhengeri whom you said you learnt had been killed? 
A.	His name was Silvester Bariyanga, spelling, B-A-R-I-Y-A-N-G-A. 
Q.	Did you ask -- did you make any enquiries to the bourgmestre concerning what security measures were taken to try to protect the population from these massacres? 
A.	Considering how he was, I had to tread carefully; he was under shock because of the death of the president and the death of the préfet of Ruhengeri, but he informed me that there was something very, very astonishing.  There were lots of people who came like a bee swam, who were mixed with the youth wing from Byangabo, the youths were coming from the communes that were occupied by the RPF; they were from the displaced persons.  If you see, that part of Mukingo had been a scene of fighting and that is where all the displaced persons had passed and even the police, the communal police could not do anything, and he said it was too much for him, and he could do nothing about the attacks. 
Q.	Did you express any of your concerns, that you have testified to this Tribunal, to him that afternoon? 
A.	You have already mentioned it.  We talked, one cannot really feel the pain of someone's friend, but I told him that this was the central blame, it was no one's problem during the fight.  I felt that with the bullets, the fire of RPF that was attacking Mukingo, I said this was a tragedy to see that people were attacking others and the officials could do nothing about it.  I told him that this was very tragic, very sad, considering the state he was in, I couldn't stay longer.  I asked him whether there was any news from Rwinzovu, and he told me that the last information he had got from soldiers who were returning from the front line, the Rwanda forces were still in Shingiro.  I explained to him that I was trying to go and collect my family and it was delicate.  I didn't want it to be said that I am taking away people, and he said people would consider this very bad, but he told me I can go and visit that family, but taking them from their home during the day, the people will feel hopeless; they will follow and run away from that area and it will look like the RPF will have captured Mukingo commune.  Since I was scared myself, I decided to go home and we left each other that way. 
Q.	Now, in short, did the bourgmestre discourage you from your plans? 
A.	Yes, he discouraged me and on second thought, I found that this would have caused the flight of all citizens, especially that there were a lot of gunshots in the Mukingo area.  I went to Rwinzovu having changed my mind, and when I reached Rwinzovu, I expressed my opinion to the family. 
Q.	Now, what path did you take from Nkuli to the commune office, that afternoon?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which commune office?
MR. HINDS:
Well, he went from Nkuli.  He is now talking about when he went to this commune office in Mukingo. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know whether I forgot to mention it, but I said I took the vehicle, my usual vehicle.  I went by car. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	And could you describe the route you took leaving from your home to the commune office? 
A.	I left home at Nkuli taking the road to Ruhengeri.  I continued the road to Mukingo communal office. 
Q.	Now, did you have to pass Byangabo? 
A.	That is where I passed. 
Q.	What was the situation there in Byangabo; were the shops open at that time on the 8th?
A.	Not a single shop was open. 
Q.	Concerning the atmosphere in that place, were there people at Byangabo at that time? 
A.	There at Byangabo there were groups, there were many displaced persons who were carrying some firewood from the destroyed houses, others were carrying clubs, I saw them.  That is why I couldn't even stop there, there was high tension, and a person who was not a resident of that place risked to be mistreated.  There were many people, some were coming from looting; I continued on my way to Mukingo, but at Byangabo, there were, indeed, many people. 
Q.	Did you see any roadblocks in Byangabo on your way from Nkuli to Mukingo? 
A.	There was no roadblock, instead I found a roadblock at the office of Mukingo commune.  It used to be there, but it had been strengthened. 
Q.	And who was manning that roadblock at the commune office? 
A.	There were soldiers, but it was soldiers but there were lot of civilian stand-bys who were standing by.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I would like the witness to be shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 7.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
And turn to photograph 25. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, are you looking at photograph 25? 
A.	Yes, I am looking at it. 
Q.	What does photograph 25 depict?
A.	I can see the tarmac road; I can see houses; I can see vehicles loaded with goods towards -- in that direction of Gisenyi.  I see some people standing by. 
Q.	And where is this located? 
A.	This is at Byangabo, it is at Byangabo centre. 
Q.	Did you take that route that afternoon of the 8th?
A.	Yes, that is it, indeed. 
Q.	I would like you to look at photographs 61 -- 60 and 61?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
I can see these photos, yes. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	First, directing your attention to photograph 60, do you see that hill there? 
A.	Behind the electric pole, I can see a hill.  Yes, I see it. 
Q.	And what is the name of that hill? 
A.	That hill, if it is the one, is Ruhere hill. 
Q.	Can we have the spelling?
A.	Ruhere, R-U-H-E-H-E. 
Q.	Now, turning to photograph 61, can you -- the hill that is there, can you identify that hill? 
A.	I have said it, that hill is called Ruhehe. 
Q.	Now, where is that hill in relation to the commune office? 
A.	That hill is facing Mukingo commune offices.  It is facing the communal office at Mukingo, just above the road. 
Q.	And where was the roadblock that you said you saw in connection with that particular hill? 
A.	I believe, I see something like a vehicle, where the vehicle is standing, I believe that is where the roadblock was. 
Q.	That is on photograph No. 60? 
A.	No, I am looking at photograph No. 61. 
Q.	There is one if you really look closely. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, there is one.
MR. HINDS:
Let us try to do this a little more clearly. 

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, would you please turn to photograph 60.
A.	Thank you.  I can see it clearly now, yes. 
Q.	Can you describe where you saw the roadblock in relation to the hill seen on photograph 60? 
A.	The roadblock was in front of the vehicle, if I am not mistaken.  Behind the vehicle, there is a small road that goes to the office.  The roadblock was in front of that vehicle. 
Q.	Now, when you say in front of, do you mean in the direction in which the vehicle is facing? 
A.	Yes, that is what I mean. 
Q.	Now, do you know whether or not there were any type of activities taking place at the top of Ruhehe hill? 
A.	On top of that hill, there had been a military position and this time that position had been reinforced, and that is what I know about the hill. 
Q.	Now, what route did you take going to your house in Rwinzovu after you left the commune office? 
A.	I got back to this road from the office of the commune, I went as if taking the Gisenyi direction, but further on upon reaching Izayi (phonetic), then that is branching off to Rwinzovu and it can continue to Nyaberehe, it can go to -- after Rwinzovu, you can go to Shingiro, it can go up to Kinigi commune.
Q.	And did you take that particular route?
A.	Yes, that was the road I took as I was going home to Rwinzovu.
Q.	Did you -- on the way to Rwinzovu, did you see any other roadblocks? 
A.	On that day, there were no roadblocks on that route.  I only saw one roadblock. 
Q.	Now, I would like you to -- I would like to show you Defendant's Exhibit 37, and I would like that displayed on the screen.  

Mr. Kajelijeli, could you go over to the overhead projector, please?  Can we shift that so that we can see the commune office, the Mukingo commune office, move it to your left.  Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, can you locate the commune office on that sketch?  Can you point to it? 
A.	On this sketch I see where it is marked SM and I think -- CM, and I think that is where Mukingo commune was. 
Q.	Now can you locate the ISAE institute on that sketch? 
A.	I think that it is here where I am pointing. 
Q.	Can you just trace your path that you took that afternoon, leaving the commune office and going to your house in Rwinzovu? 
A.	I came from here, from the communal office, I passed through this road, I continued this way.  I continued here.
Q.	And was that the direction in which you went to Rwinzovu? 
A.	Yes, this is the route I took to Rwinzovu.

MR. HINDS:
I think that this is a convenient place, Your Honour, to stop because then, unless you want me to continue, I will proceed to show him some photographs of his house in Rwinzovu, once he gets there. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will stop here and take a break for 15 minutes.  We will resume our work at twenty five past four.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned. 
	(Court recessed at 1608H)
(Pages 56 to 62 by Sithembiso Moyo)






























(Court resumed at 1630H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Learned Counsel Professor Hinds, please proceed.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, did there come a time when you went to your home in Rwinzovu?
A.	Yes, I arrived at my home at Rwinzovu.
Q.	And that was on the 8th of February -- withdrawn.  And that was on the 8th of April 1994.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	Now, what, what time -- do you have any idea of what time of day you arrived at Rwinzovu?
A.	It was around 2 p.m., towards 2 p.m. 
Q.	Did you -- can you tell the Trial Chamber what you did when you arrived at your home in Rwinzovu?
A.	Before I went to my home in Rwinzovu, I had this culture of greeting my parents.  So I first went to visit my -- to greet my father and my mother, and these were some of my family members that I was supposed to take back with me but my father was quite ill therein.  I told him that according to the nature of the war it would be better to take him with me and he refused.  He said that if necessary he would die in his home.  And along with him, my mother also refused; they refused to come with me.  So I told them I was very worried about their situation.  So after a little discussion with them I went to my home.  

When I arrived in my home, I arrived -- from my parents' home I went to my home.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli I would like to show you Prosecution's Exhibit 7, and I'd like you to look at photographs 43, 44 and 45 and could you tell the Tribunal whether or not you recognise these photographs. 
A.	Thank you.  These three photos you've mentioned I know them.  When I look at them I feel so sad.
Q.	And what are these -- what do these photographs depict?
A.	I see my home that has been destroyed.  That's what I can see in the photos.
Q.	And looking at photograph 44, when you said that you got to your home, where did your parents live in relation to the home that is depicted here?  How far did they live from the home that is depicted in 43, 44 and 45 photographs?
A.	In order to tell you -- to know where my parents lived we could use photo number 45, that's where I can show you clearly where my parents lived.
MR. HINDS:
Okay, can we just display photographs 43, 44 and 45 on the screen so that the witness can show where his parents lived?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, could you please put photograph number 45 which is part of Exhibit P7 on the screen?
MR. KIYEYEU:
We are going to do so, My Lord.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, could you show us where your --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, Counsel.  Sorry, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Yeah. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Looking at photograph 45, can you share -- can you share with the Chamber where in relation to that -- the building did your parents live?  Point to it.
A.	You can see this is the home compound.  This is a tree called Umurumu and beyond this tree, beyond this tree here this is where my parents lived. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Where the witness is pointing here.
THE WITNESS:
From this point about 20 metres.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a moment.  Can you, can you -- yes, can you start all over again, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
	This is what I could call the fence.  From here you reach this tree, a phicas (phonetic) tree.  It is beyond this tree that my parents used to live.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	And what is the distance that your parents lived from the fence or from the tree?
A.	Thank you.  From that tree it is 20 metres away that my parents lived.
MR. HINDS:
The tree, Your Honour, is located at the left, the extreme left border of the photograph.  It is a tree that extends --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Photograph number 45?
MR. HINDS:
Yes, photograph number 45, Prosecutor's Exhibit 7.  The tree extends to the top of the photograph.  The tree also is to the left of the fence bordering the compound.  The witness indicates that to the left of that tree, some 20 metres, is -- would be the location of where his parents resided.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, is that a fair presentation?

MS. OJEMENI:
	No, objection.  Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So let the record so reflect.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, how long did you spend with -- speaking to your parents?
A.	I did not exceed 15 minutes talking to my parents.
Q.	And did there come a time when you -- or did you visit any other relatives other than your parents when you arrived in Rwinzovu?
A.	Apart from my parents, I visited my home.  But in my parents home there are some children, my elder brother's children who were in the home, children who helped them fetch water and fetch firewood.  So from there I went to my home that you can see, that had been destroyed in the photo.
Q.	Now, can you show the Tribunal how you entered your home as shown in photograph 45?
A.	Thank you.  You can see the gate with the three paths.  This is the gate with the three paths.  The middle path was open.  I entered because I had left the vehicle by the road.  Opposite my home there is a road, so I went -- then I went to this part.  As you can see, you can see the door deep inside, then from there you go behind the compound.  I found my wife waiting for me at this point, and he (sic) welcomed me in the home -- in the house and then he (sic) closed the door -- she closed the door.  After welcoming me, then after getting into the sitting room, she told me she had special visitors.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I would like you to, while you are standing there, for you to -- while you are standing there for you to, if you can, describe the house and the rooms that were in that house and where their locations were when the house was not destroyed, prior to it being destroyed.
A.	In order for me to show you where the rooms used to be, because you cannot see inside the house very well.  But I could say the house had four rooms.  Of the four rooms we had our main master bedroom then we had a visitor's room, then there was a children's bedroom and there was another room for children because we had children -- boys and girls.  And then somewhere we had a storeroom, and the sitting room was alone, was on its own.
Q.	And where was the kitchen?
A.	Thank you.  If you continue to this point you can see a door to the left.  There is a house where we carried some husbandry activities, then behind there is a kitchen.  On other photos this kitchen is visible.  That's where the kitchen is.
Q.	While you are there, Mr. Kajelijeli, I'd like you to --
MR. HINDS:
Perhaps the registry can help us in -- maybe photograph 44 may be a better photograph for you to show some of those locations.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  You can see the kitchen in this photo here.  This was where the kitchen was.  Going though the small gate I showed, you enter here.  Behind you can see in our -- these are clay tiles, clay tiles.  That's what we call them in my region.  So that is the kitchen.
BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
Q.	All right.  You could take a seat, Mr. Kajelijeli.
A.	Thank you.
Q.	Now, did there come a time when you spoke to your wife?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Microphone, microphone.
THE WITNESS:
We had a talk.  When she heard the voice -- the sound of the vehicle, she came to wait for me in front of the sitting room and she realised that I had gone to see my parents first.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	And what if anything did she say to you?
A.	I was surprised to see that she pulled me -- she like kind of pulled me into the sitting room and then closed the door.  I asked her if everything was well.  We had just got a new baby.  I thought there were problems, and she looked afraid, frightened, and she told me she had visitors who were not very usual and we had not discussed all the -- about all the events I knew about.  So she told me who these unusual visitors were.  She told me the names and I realised I knew these people by name and I went -- she took me to go and greet them.  As I was greeting them, I was still afraid and beside I was terrified and sad because of what I told you had happened.  So --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do not forget to slow down.  You are slowing down sometimes, sometimes you tend to be carried away.  We note that when the translation is coming through --
THE WITNESS:
You will excuse me, Your Honour, I am not doing this intentionally.  I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no, I'm just reminding. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please go on, counsel.
MR. HINDS:
We have a signal going.  I have to wait until that light goes off then I know that we are in sync.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, did there come a time when you met the people who were in your house, that is, other than your family?
A.	Yes, I met them and I was very sad.
Q.	Now, who were these people?  Could you identify them for the Tribunal?
A.	Those people were four, two women, one man and one child.
Q.	Did you know what their ethnicity was?
A.	I knew them before and that's what surprised me.
Q.	Do you recall their pseudonyms?
A.	As far as their pseudonyms are concerned --
Q.	If you don't recall then --
A.	I remember them.  I remember them.  I remember the names, please.
Q.	Okay.  I don't want you to mention the names of the people, but if you have to identify them you can use the pseudonyms.  Now, with respect to the two individuals could you describe these -- you said there were four people, who were they?
A.	Only two have pseudonyms as you said.  I will --RH21 (sic) as well as L -- RHU26.  That is the second.
Q.	Now with respect of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the registry is drawing our attention to the fact that in the mentioning of the pseudonym, in the French translation, it came out as RH21, and with regard to the second person, it was RHU26.  The "U" -- but I'm told in French it was correctly stated RHU21.  Is that correct?  

I'm told -- well, it is in English which came through as RH21 and RHU 26, so there was a "U" forgotten -- left out in the English translation with regard to the first person.  I'm told it was correctly stated in French.  Can you ask the witness to repeat, perhaps?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, could you identify the two individuals by their pseudonyms?
A.	Thank you.  In French it is RHU21, RHU21.  The second name is RHU26, RHU26.  Merci.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, could you tell the Tribunal what -- withdrawn.  Could you describe RHU21 for the Tribunal, the sex of the person, and what that person -- whether that person was alone or not?
A.	Thank you very much.  This individual, RHU21, is male, he was a man and he was with his wife whose name I must not mention either.
Q.	And RHU26?
A.	This individual is a lady who was with her child.
Q.	What was the ethnicity of these four people, if you knew?
A.	They were Tutsi who had survived.  That's what I could -- that's how I can describe it.  It was a Tutsi man and Tutsi women who had survived, in order for there not to be confusion.
Q.	Now, what if anything, did they say to you, and you said to them at that time?
A.	The first person who told me about their situation, their problem, their concerns was my wife.  Later on I had a talk with them, then they said even if we may put you at risk, we have no other way -- other place where we could hide for our security because of the situation.
Q.	And, Mr. Kajelijeli, what if anything, did you say to those Tutsi families who were there in your house?
A.	I told them that a tragic situation had befallen us, that the president of the republic had died as they had heard themselves, but they had not yet learnt that even the Burundian president and their delegate -- delegations had also died along with our president.  And I told them that the war had started and the situation was critical outside, and that they had to be -- tried to be firm and patient and try to conduct themselves properly, because they would have enough food in my home.  I had enough food and if they need water to bathe they should not go outside, they can bathe inside at night.  So I told them that we were sharing this predicament and that I would not let them down.  I told them that instead of letting them down, I would rather die along with them, and that -- I told them that it would not be very easy for me to come and see them many times in order not to arouse suspicion from outside people.  So I bade them farewell, and then I went to talk with my wife, and I gave her instructions as to how she should conduct herself, telling her how the situation is.  And I also told her the information I had gathered about the war on the radio, especially because for them they were not listening to the radio a lot because they didn't want children to come and listen to the radio and know about this situation.  So I gave my wife instructions as to how they should behave and conduct themselves.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, did -- now, Mr.  Kajelijeli, did you at any time discuss any evacuation plans with your wife?
A.	My wife, in my sitting room -- in our sitting room before she showed me the visitors, that's the discussion we had had in the sitting room.  Before she showed me the visitors and the baby, I told her that I had come to take them with me because of the war, and that I was preoccupied and that in a short time this war could become serious in Mukingo, and then she said that, "You can see these people who have come -- who have taken refuge in our home, and the killings of Tutsis had started the day before".  That was my wife talking.  So she said, "I do not know what -- how you can go about it ,and if we left and the people come to learn that these people had taken refuge here, since you are persecuted -- you've been persecuted all this time, they will say that you've been hiding Tutsis and they might follow us wherever we may go".  So I -- she said she believed I have to do - "You have to do what you can do very carefully taking into account the consequences.  So I told her I just wanted to inform her the purpose for my visit, and so that if we don't have any other problems we would go -  I would go with you.  So we agreed that we abandon this evacuation plan, and after that she went to take me to see the visitors.  So we had already discussed about the evacuation plan and we had decided that we should abandon this plan.
Q.	Now, did there come a time when you left your home at Rwinzovu that day?
A.	Yes, I left my home in Rwinzovu after giving her instructions because I told her that they should lock all doors and we had a water tap.  We had a water supply in our home especially because early women would come and -- who used to come and fetch water, so I told her that our children should fetch for the elderly women so that these people may not learn anything about the people who were taking refuge in our home.  So after agreeing on this and after agreeing on how we'll be communicating, I went back to my home in Nkuli the same day.
Q.	Now, how long did these Tutsis who sought refuge in your home in Rwinzovu stay there?  Do you know?
A.	I remember -- I cannot give you specification but I remember that in the month of May the warfront was mainly in Kigali and Gitarama.  So they, the man that I mentioned, RHU21, he decided later on to leave, to leave at night, just to leave at night, and we knew about it and my wife had informed me about it.  I told her that since the gunfire -- the battle, the gunshots had decreased, we had agreed that he could see how he can leave at night around midnight.  So he left with my knowledge and I even knew his relatives in Zaire.  So, the woman, the woman stayed behind and she stayed there for a while.  After I became the bourgmestre she didn't have any more problems because I was in charge of security, as I said.  She went back to her home and we continued following closely the security.
Q.	Now, did there come a time when you arrived at your home in Nkuli?
A.	Going back to my home in Nkuli I tried not to do so because there are people -- some of my employees who used to work for -- be it in agriculture, activities of cutting forests, many of them were coming from this area, so if I had any urgent need I could send them.  So it was not necessary for me to go back there for reasons that I have already stated.
Q.	Well, I'm not sure that your answer was very clear.  The question I asked you was, did there come a time when you went back to your home in Nkuli?
A.	I went back to my home after I became the bourgmestre.
Q.	No.  Listen, very carefully, Mr.  Kajelijeli.  Take a drink of water.
A.	Okay.
Q.	Now, on the 8th when you left Rwinzovu, did you go back to your home in Nkuli?
A.	Thank you, very much.  I had not got your question.  I told you that I left my home in Rwinzovu in Mukingo commune and went straight to Nkuli commune to my other home.
Q.	What time did you get to Nkuli?
A.	I did not consult my watch a lot, but I know that by 3 p.m. I had got back home.
Q.	Do you recall whether or not you travelled in the same route going back to Nkuli, that you took when you travelled earlier that day from your home in Nkuli to Rwinzovu?
A.	Yes, I took the same route, the route that passes in front of Zaen (phonetic), through Byangabo and straight to Nkuli, the same route that I had taken in the morning to Rwinzovu.
Q.	Now, after you got home, did you have any discussion with anyone at your home in Nkuli, and if so, who?
A.	My wife -- it was my wife.
Q.	Did you leave your home in Nkuli after you got back home that afternoon?
A.	Excuse me.  I was quite sick.  That day I was very sad, I was very tired, so I did not go anywhere else the whole -- that whole evening I didn't go out.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, did you know someone by the name of Rachel?
A.	Thank you.  I knew Rachel from my childhood up to those years -- up to the years to 1992, I knew her.
Q.	Who was Rachel?
A.	Rachel was a lady.  If I'm not mistaken, her family name was Mukanturo, and she was Tutsi, who lived near Byangabo at about 50 metres or 80 metres from my building that I showed you that was situated in Byangabo, that's where she lived.
Q.	On April --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell out the second name, please? 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, Your Honour.  M-U-K-A-N-T-U-R-O, Mukanturo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, Counsel. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Yes, on April 8th 1994, do you know whether or not Rachel was residing in her house in Byangabo?
A.	That is not true.  She did not live in her house in Byangabo, she was no longer living there.
Q.	How do you know this?
A.	I know this very well because she was Tutsi.  She was a Tutsi, and I could say she was a friend.  In 1992 she was sick, if I'm not mistaken, and then she came to Mukingo commune office, and told me she was going for -- to Kigali for medical treatment, especially because RPF was collecting taxes at that time.  She asked me for authorisation travel papers.  I'm the one who signed her travel documents and from the time I signed and gave her these travel documents to travel to Kigali for treatment she never came back, and it was her brother-in-law (sic) who had married her daughter called Jean, they are the ones who used to give me news about Rachel.  And if you agree, if you accept, when she left she rented her house to a trader, I think a refugee from Butaro or Kidaho.  So at that time that you mentioned, 1994, Rachel had not come back yet.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
	I will spell those names of places: Butaro, B-U-T-A-R-O; Kidaho, K-I-D-A-H-O.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, what, if anything, you did, after you returned home from Rwinzovu on the 8th?
A.	You will excuse me -- if you will excuse me, I would like to add something concerning Rachel.
Q.	Yes, please. 
A.	What I would like to add is that her house, the refugee who had been renting it was chased, and this house was destroyed on the 7th of April 1994.  And those who destroyed it on the 7th -- this case for destroying this house on the 7th, are being followed in the judicial process in Rwanda.  And I would like to -- I'm saying this because there are people who say that they were using -- operating in this house on the 8th of April '94, and this time around I have proof.  Thank you.
Q.	What is this proof that you have that the house was destroyed on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	At one time some people who pleaded guilty and accused others, I'm talking of people like those in Mutobo area, and they said that those who were accused had destroyed the house, and these, I think were among the 31 persons being pursued -- prosecuted in Rwandan courts.  That's the way I have tested this is true, and those who can see these case files can verify this because this was announced over the radio.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I'll spell Mutobo, M-U-T-O-B-O.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr.  Kajelijeli, after you arrived at home in Nkuli, what, if anything, did you do later on that day?  That is on the 8th.
A.	You will excuse me.  That date, the 8th of April, there had been so many events and these were all tragic events that had taken place in Kinyarwanda.  Whatever was said over the radio and the news that we were gathering, I went there because people had been killed -- had died in Rwanda, so I did not do anything.  I slept the whole night without sleeping, and I was wondering what would happen on the following days.  I was wondering how we were going to flee and we were discussing this with my wife, and my wife was quite sickly and so we could not discuss this a lot.  We just spent the night without being to sleep -- without being able to sleep.  We couldn't fall asleep.
Q.	Now --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can the witness be brief if he wants.  Go on.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, could you --
MR. HINDS:
Your light is on, do you want --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, sorry.  Go on.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, could you inform the Court, what, if anything, you did on the 9th?
A.	On the 9th tragic events befell us.  At 6:00 in the morning on the 9th of April '94, I heard over the radio that the Mukingo commune bourgmestre had died.  So, the state we were in worsened.  We became sad and I decided that I should go and try to learn more about his death.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli -- yeah, Mr.  Kajelijeli, did you learn on the radio the circumstances surrounding the death of the bourgmestre?
A.	No.  I -- there were no comments about this.  They just announced.  I think it is the office of the préfecture Ruhengeri that announced that with sadness -- it announced with sadness that the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune Habyarimana, Emmanuel had died.  So we did not know under what circumstances he had died.
Q.	Now, what was the security situation in your commune in Nkuli, the morning of the 9th?
A.	Thank you.  The security situation in that area, there wasn't -- there was no gunshots being heard in the area.  There was no gunshots being heard in the area apart from the explosions that we could hear from Kimigi area towards Mukingo commune.  That's what I observed and that's what other people were saying.  They say -- it was being said that there were heavy fights in Kigombe and Kimigi, so in Nkuli there wasn't -- it was as if the violence had taken its full course.
Q.	What, if anything, did you do in connection with finding out about the death of the bourgmestre?
A.	I decided to go and learn more about the death of the bourgmestre around 9 a.m. on the 9th of April 1994.
Q.	And where did you go in order to learn -- yeah, where did you go in order to learn more information about the bourgmestre's death?
A.	I went to the Mukingo commune office because that's where he lived.
Q.	How far did he live from the commune office itself?
A.	The distance, there are about 200 metres between -- from his residence to the Mukingo commune office.
Q.	And did you learn of, at that time of any -- withdrawn.  Did you obtain any information concerning his death and burial services?
A.	I found that the authorities and friends had organised how the priest would conduct the burial ceremony, how they would read mass at his burial ceremony.  All this had been organised by the time I got there.
Q.	And what time did you arrive at the commune office?
A.	I did not take care to watch -- to consult my watch, but I remember it was between -- around 9:00, 10 a.m.
Q.	Now, did you, at some point in time, go to the residence of the bourgmestre?
A.	That is where the mass was read, the mass ceremony to bury him.  So I was there in his residence.
Q.	And where was he buried?
A.	After the mass ceremony and after preparing the tomb, he was buried in his home.
Q.	Are there cemeteries in Rwanda?
A.	In Rwanda there were cemeteries up to 1980 and then some people took the decision -- after these public cemeteries were fully used up, the government did not buy -- provide more plots to use as cemeteries, so people decided to start using their home plots to bury their dead.
Q.	So was it customary at that time for people to be buried on their properties?
A.	At that time, yes, it was customary to do so.
Q.	How long did the burial service last for the bourgmestre?
A.	That ceremony took a long time because somewhere in the middle of the burial, RPF bombed -- launched some -- bombed some areas around the commune, and we were afraid.  We took flight and ran away before completing the burial ceremony.  And so we left, then after this had calmed down we came back and resumed the burial ceremony.  And the ceremony was completed fully around 
4:30 p.m. and then the people we -- the people we were with decided that we get some refreshments, we get some local drinks, like sorghum beer.  We even got Primus beer, that's a modern beer, and then we went into the home of the late and we stayed there for a while.  So around -- some of us decided to leave around 5 p.m.
Q.	Now, what time did you arrive home on the 9th?
A.	On the 9th I arrived in my home at 5:30 p.m.
Q.	And did you leave your home after that time on the 9th?
A.	It was already late in the evening and I told you that there was insecurity and also additionally, there was the curfew in force and I was very tired.  And it's not usually for me to get home and then leave.  So I did not leave my home again.
Q.	Now, what did you -- what, if anything, did you do that evening?
A.	I told the people I had left home what had happened and the tragic events that had taken place.  I told you that my wife was sick, and we kept company with the children and continued following the news, and also watched a video tape with all the sadness.  And at 9 p.m., I went to bed.  I left the children still seated watching a videotape.  That's what happened the whole -- that's how the events took place the whole of that day.
Q.	Now, what was the situation in the community on the 10th of April, what did you do?
A.	On the 10th I would say that we had unusual tragic events, and that very early morning, that day, we learnt or got news -- we got wind of sad news saying that my brother -- my wife's uncle, Laurent's uncle had been killed along with the family, so this really made us feel sick.  We couldn't go anywhere.  It was his eldest son who was working at Nkuli commune who came to inform us.  And because the situation was so critical and people came to visit us, including the one I told you called Agnes, and we prayed.  I did not do anything else.  My wife requested me to take her to the hospital for treatment, but I didn't feel like driving that day so I let her -- excuse me -- I let her go on foot because this is sad news we had learnt in the morning.  In my culture we call it a bad omen.  So I let her go by herself to the hospital.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, could you tell the Tribunal who was -- withdrawn.  Could you tell the Tribunal the circumstances under which your wife's relative was killed?
A.	I haven't understood your question properly.
Q.	Could you tell the Tribunal the circumstances under which Laurent's uncle and his family were killed?  Do you know -- or, did you know?
A.	Yes, I got to know under what circumstances they were killed.  We learnt that he was killed in these killings that took place in Rwanda.  We learnt of this on the 10th.  There were circumstances in which -- we did not learn immediately about the circumstances in which he was killed, but we learnt that later on -- later on we learnt that he was killed just like other Tutsis were killed.  People came to fetch him from their home with their children.  His wife was Tutsi, and they were living in Rugerero, Rubavu commune, and they were taken to a place called commune Rouge.  I do not know people who followed the killings in this area how they call this place.  They were killed and then after they were killed they were put in a tomb and covered with soil.  That's what we learnt about the circumstances of their death.  So my wife's uncle had also sisters-in-law who were Tutsi and who were killed in the same manner.  This is the wife of Gisanabagabo, whom I told you at one time.  All these were killed and we were related very -- quite closely, apart from people who may view it otherwise, but we really lost many members of our family.  For us in Rwanda especially, and the region where I come from, the region where I come from, you could not have identified a Hutu from a Tutsi, all were brothers and sisters. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I'll spell the name of the places:  Rugerero, R-U-G-E-R-E-R-O, Rugerero; Rubavu, R-U-B-A-V-U; Gisanabagabo, G-I-S-A-N-A-B-A-G-A-B-O.
BY MR. HINDS:
Mr. Kajelijeli, I'd like you when I am asking you questions to be as brief as possible and look at me, so that if I want you to continue I will ask you to, but we are attempting to complete your testimony as soon as possible.
MS. OJEMENI: 
	Your Honour, I think we object on this side of the Bench.  He cannot look at him and -- I mean, to get signs to stop or --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the witness is testifying.  I think he can just look at the Bench or anybody else but I think it's important what counsel has said that the witness should try to be as brief as possible in his explanation.  That would save time.
MR. HINDS: 
	Your Honour, I'm only trying to facilitate, but if the Prosecutor is objecting, I will just let him talk.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll see that he is brief.
MR. HINDS: 
	Yes, I'm trying to direct the witness so that we can get out of here in some reasonable time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All right, we'll stop here for today.  

If we may, Counsel, can you give us some time frame, at least just for the sake of planning.
MR. HINDS:
Sure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, you had indicated two days, we are on our second day today.
MR. HINDS:
My plan was to complete this witness today.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
It now appears that I'm not able to fulfil that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that -- we see that.
MR. HINDS:
I -- my fall back position is to complete him in an hour and a half.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. HINDS: 
	Maybe two.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.  Tomorrow?
MR. HINDS: 
	Yes, tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.

All right, we'll adjourn these proceedings until tomorrow morning at 9:00.  So, we just say that you have just made a solemn declaration and you continue with that understanding.  

So until tomorrow at 9:00 in the morning, this proceeding stands adjourned. 
	(Court adjourned at 1734H)
