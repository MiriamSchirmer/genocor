         1        Yes, Interpreter, could you please tell Witness MLCF, 

         2        that the Trial Chamber reminds him of the solemn 

         3        declaration he made on Thursday and that he will 

         4        continue with his evidence today on that same solemn 

         5        declaration.  

         6        

         7        Yes, and, secondly, could you also remind the witness 

         8        that we are still in open session and that he should 

         9        continue to be -- yes, I am informed by the registry 

        10        that we were in closed session when we ended by 

        11        Thursday.  Counsel, do you wish to remain in closed 

        12        session?


        13   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, Your Honour because the areas I will be 

        14        dealing with now might reveal his identity.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right.  Then we will go into closed 

        16        session again to enable counsel to continue raising 

        17        questions which could have a bearing on the identity of 

        18        the witness who is a protected witness.  

        19        

        20        Could you inform the witness accordingly, Interpreter?

         4                        RE-EXAMINATION 

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness, how long were you at the Busogo Parish when the 

         7        attack was taking place?

         8   A.   The attack took place at the convent, and I remained 

         9        there until at the end of the attack.  And I did say 

        10        that it lasted for at least 45 minutes.

        11   Q.   During the 45 minutes that you were there, were you able 

        12        to see Juvenal Kajelijeli at any time?

        13   A.   No, I didn't see him.

        14   Q.   Did you see his vehicle there at any time over those 45 

        15        minutes?

        16   A.   No, I did not see his vehicle.

        17   Q.   If Juvénal Kajelijeli was among the attackers is it 

        18        possible that he could have been there and you did not 

        19        see him?

        20   A.   If Kajelijeli were among the attackers, I would have 

        21        seen him because the shooting started when I was there, 

        22        and at the end of attack the attackers came out and I 

        23        was able to see all of them there.

        24   Q.   And of the people you identified, what are their names?

        25   A.   Among the attackers I was able to recognise three people 

        26        whose names I knew.  There was a soldier called Rachel.  

        27        There was one Bagabo, B-A-G-A-B-O and finally Noel.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: That may be my last question.  Let me check 

        29        with Mr. Kajelijeli. 

        30        That ends the re-examination, Your Honour.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, thank you, Counsel.  Judge Ramaroson has 

         2        some questions to put to the witness.


         3   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Witness, the acronym ESTB, what does it  

         4        mean in full? 

         5   THE WITNESS: ESTB means, Ecole de secondaire de Busogo, 

         6        Busogo Secondary Technical School.

         7   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Why was Kajelijeli driving a vehicle with 

         8        the acronym ESTB?  

         9   THE WITNESS: This school was established by an association 

        10        and Kajelijeli was the accountant, the treasurer of the 

        11        association.

        12   JUDGE RAMAROSON: What was the name of that association?

        13   THE WITNESS: I do not recall the name of the association.

        14   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Did this vehicle not belong to the principal 

        15        or the headmaster of ESTB?

        16   THE WITNESS: No.

        17   JUDGE RAMAROSON: So which vehicle, was the principal of the 

        18        ESTB using?

        19   THE WITNESS: He used another vehicle which was a Toyota Hilux 

        20        just like this one.

        21   JUDGE RAMAROSON: So how many vehicles did the ESTB have with 

        22        the acronym ESTB written on it?

        23   THE WITNESS: As I was able to observe it, the vehicle used by 

        24        Kajelijeli was used by the association, but the 

        25        principal of the school used another vehicle.

        26   JUDGE RAMAROSON: No, you didn't answer my question well.  I 

        27        am asking you, how many vehicles were there that 

        28        belonged to the school with the acronym ESTB written on 

        29        it?  Was it only the one that Kajelijeli was using?

        30   THE WITNESS: We have been referring to two vehicles.

          KAJELIJELI



         1   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Yes, but my question is, how many vehicles 

         2        were there that had ESTB written on it?  Was it only the 

         3        one that Kajelijeli was using?

         4   THE WITNESS: There was another vehicle which the principal 

         5        was using which belonged to the ESTB and did that 

         6        vehicle had the acronym ESTB written on its door, I do 

         7        not clear recall.

         8   JUDGE RAMAROSON: You did say that, "I saw all the attackers 

         9        when they came out and you even added that I was able  

        10        to see all of them".  What was their ethnic group?

        11   THE WITNESS: Back home in Rwanda it is not easy to 

        12        distinguish ethnic groups because to date their is no 

        13        typical profile of this or that ethnic group.  But what 

        14        I realised was that the majority of these attackers were 

        15        Hutus. 

        16   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Because you said earlier in answer to a 

        17        question put by the Prosecutor that "I cannot give 

        18        clarification on the ethnic groups of the attackers.

        19   THE WITNESS: The Prosecutor put a question to me on the 

        20        spectators since they were many I was not able to 

        21        distinguish their ethnic groups.

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: In conclusion from your testimony, there was 

        23        a group of persons killing another group of persons who 

        24        where within the convent and there was a group of 

        25        spectators, but we really do not know what it was, what 

        26        their motives were, who those people were.  You have no 

        27        clarification on that?

        28   THE WITNESS: You will understand that is the situation that 

        29        occurred suddenly that morning.  It is not a situation 

        30        which we had been living previously.  It is therefore

         2   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And my last my question is: Why is it that 

         3        they did not kill you yourself?

         4   THE WITNESS: I have no explanation for that, but I know that 

         5        the attackers were attacking those who were within the 

         6        convent, they were not attacking the spectators.

         7   JUDGE RAMAROSON: I'm done.  Thank you.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Judge Maqutu has a question to ask. 

         9   JUDGE MAQUTU: Thank you, Mr. President. 

        10        *********************************

        11        *******************************

        12        *****isn't it?  Or that is, of the (By order of the 

        13        Court, the name was extracted)?

        14   THE WITNESS: That is correct.

        15   JUDGE MAQUTU: And whether the vehicle he travelled in had 

        16        ESTB or not, was something that never occurred to you to 

        17        see?

        18   THE WITNESS: I remember the vehicle that the (By order of the 

        19        Court, the name was extracted)******************, it 

        20        was a Hilux pick-up, white in colour, but I have no 

        21        recollection as to whether (By order of the Court, the 

        22        name was extracted) was written on it.

        23   JUDGE MAQUTU: Now, as we were listening to you, there is one 

        24        question which kept on troubling me in my mind is: Why 

        25        did you wait there and see the convent destroyed and 

        26        people inside endangered?

        27   THE WITNESS: I remained there because there were other 

        28        people, onlookers who came to see what was happening.  

        29        So, I remained there even if there were people in 

        30        danger.  Besides, I wanted to see the end of the

         1        incident.  And I told you that there was nothing we 

         2        could do.  We could not prevent the attackers from 

         3        attacking the people because there was total confusion.

         4   JUDGE MAQUTU: Yes.  What were you waiting for; that is, what 

         5        were you waiting for?

         6   THE WITNESS: Since that place was close to my residence, I 

         7        could not go back home and remain -- and have my clear 

         8        conscience, since people were attacking other people 

         9        within the neighbourhood.

        10   JUDGE MAQUTU: Yes, there you are, a man of conscience, a man 

        11        conscious that his conscience should be clear.  You wait 

        12        until the end and***********.  You just 

        13        peep through the window and go home.  This is the 

        14        evidence you gave before this Chamber, through one 

        15        window and you go home.

        16   THE WITNESS: That is true ***************************

        17        **********, but I told you that I was traumatised and 

        18        sad to see bodies of persons who had been killed.  And I 

        19        also said that at that stage everybody had been killed.  

        20        And that is why I did not go further to see if there 

        21        were other persons. 

        22   JUDGE MAQUTU: That's not what you've said.  You were asked 

        23        this question, whether there were injured people in 

        24        there, and you've said, "I don't know; I just peeped 

        25        through the window and saw bodies".  Now, for you now to 

        26        come and tell us that everybody had been killed, is a 

        27        new thing; don't you think?

        28   THE WITNESS: I said earlier on that I did not see wounded 

        29        persons.  I was traumatised, and when I saw -- when I 

        30        looked through the window, I saw dead bodies on the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        ground.  But since I was in a state of shock and 

         2        sadness, and since no-one was crying out, I concluded 

         3        that everybody inside had been killed.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Judge Maqutu.

         5   

         6        But, as a follow-up question, after you had peeped 

         7        through the window and you had seen the dead bodies, 

         8        according to your evidence, and that you have been -- 

         9        you have been around during the entire event, according 

        10        to your evidence, and the attackers had left, didn't you 

        11        see, ************************************************, 

        12        there was a need to get into the courtyard or internal 

        13        part of the convent to see whether there was anybody who 

        14        was alive, injured and needed help?  And you had 

        15        previously, according to your evidence, been there at 

        16        that area, why didn't you do that?

        17   THE WITNESS: Regarding this question, I would say that I am 

        18        not used to giving assistance in a situation of war.  

        19        It's probably out of emotion that I did not look for 

        20        people in distress, and since these people were not 

        21        crying out, I concluded that these people were probably 

        22        all dead.  And that is why I did not go into the 

        23        courtyard to see if there were wounded persons.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you.  

        25        

        26        All right.  Interpreter, could you tell Witness ML-- 

        27        yes, could you, please, tell Witness MLCF, this marks 

        28        the end of his testimony, we thank him.  We shall have 

        29        time at a later stage to consider and review his 

        30        evidence, together with all the evidence that is going

         4        

         5        We'll have a short session lasting possibly a minute or 

         6        a minute and a half, a closed session to sort out a few 

         7        things, and then we shall move on to the next witness.

         9        If members of the public can give us about a minute or 

        10        two, and then we'll come back to open session.  Just 

        11        about a minute or two, certainly, not more than three.

        11        (Declaration made by Witness RHU21 in Kinyarwanda)

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Witness RHU21, you have just made a 

        13        solemn declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to 

        14        how your evidence would be taken here, we'll explain a 

        15        few essential elements to you before you begin your 

        16        testimony.  

        17        

        18        You will be led in your evidence-in-chief by the Defence 

        19        who are seated and -- as a matter of fact one of them is 

        20        standing, on this side of the courtroom.  Yes, 

        21        thereafter, questions will be put to you in 

        22        cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on 

        23        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

        24        of you may also put questions to you to clarify your 

        25        evidence as you testify, if they will have such 

        26        questions to ask you.  If a question put to you is not 

        27        clear, or you do not understand it, please say so, and 

        28        such a question shall be repeated or explained.

         5                      testified as follows:

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Good morning, Witness RHU21, how do you feel this 

         9        morning?

        10   A.   I'm all right.

        11   Q.   Witness, we are in open session and we'll remain in open 

        12        session for a while, so I want you to think very 

        13        carefully before you give any answers, which may reveal 

        14        your identity.  Do you understand that?

        15   A.   Very well.

        16   Q.   Witness, I'm going to show you a document and the 

        17        translator will assist you in translating what's on that 

        18        document.  If everything is correct, I would like you to 

        19        make your mark on it.  Do you understand that?


        20   A.   Unfortunately, I cannot read.

        21   Q.   Witness, can you write?

        22   A.   No.

        23   Q.   Can you make your mark for a signature?

        24   A.   Yes, I can make a mark by way of signature on documents.

        25   Q.   Okay, Witness, if when the document -- the contents of 

        26        the document is read to you, if there are no changes and 

        27        if you agree with it, then you make your mark on the 

        28        document and return it to me.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: What does he say?  Oh, we are waiting.

         1   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         2   Q.   Witness, do you know how to write the date, today's 

         3        date?

         4   A.   No.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: With indulgence of the Court, perhaps, the 

         6        registry can put the date, today's date, the witness has 

         7        put his mark as a signature on the document.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: And what does he say about the contents?

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness was asked previously that if the 

        10        contents of the document were correct, he was supposed 

        11        to put his mark on it.  Since he put his mark on it, the 

        12        contents are correct.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, let him follow it up by a question and 

        14        let him confirm that and then we move forward with that 

        15        other doc -- other aspects about the, putting on, the 

        16        date on.

        17   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        18   Q.   Witness, you were asked to review the document, and if 

        19        the contents of the document were correct you were asked 

        20        to put your signature on it.  Did you understand those 

        21        instructions?

        22   A.   Yes, regarding the -- I understood the issue regarding 

        23        the signature.

        24   Q.   Were the information contained on the document accurate?

        25   A.   Yes, the information on the document reflect the 

        26        reality.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: With the indulgence of the Court, we would 

        28        request that the date be put on there by the registry as 

        29        of today's date, and we move the document as 

        30        Defendant's Exhibit 41, and asked that it be sealed,

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the date can be put and please show the 

         3        mark put to the -- on the document to the Prosecution as 

         4        well.  Yes, can you, please, show it to the Prosecution? 

         5        

         6        Any objection?

         7   MS. OJEMENI: No objection, Your Honour.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: No objection.  So, let the document containing 

         9        the personal particulars of this witness, Witness RHU21, 

        10        be admitted as Defence Exhibit No. 41; forty-one, and 

        11        the said document shall be kept under seal, as it 

        12        contains the particulars of this witness, who is a

        15   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lord.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, how are we proceeding?

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, I think -- I think we'll take a break so 

        18        that there is no interruption.  We'll take a break for 

        19        15 minutes and come back at twenty past eleven, so that 

        20        we can continue the testimony of this witness without 

        21        any interruption until the time we take the lunch break.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.  Thank you, Your Honour.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        24        (Court recessed from 1105H to 1125H)

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  We continue 

        26        with the evidence of Witness RHU21 in 

        27        examination-in-chief.

         1   Q.   And can you tell the Trial Chamber what you know about 

         2        the positions Kajelijeli occupied?

         3   A.   Kajelijeli was a carpenter.  Later on, he worked as an 

         4        accountant, and eventually he was appointed bourgmestre.

         5   Q.   Did you know him when he was bourgmestre, when he served 

         6        as bourgmestre?

         7   A.   Yes, I knew him while he was bourgmestre.

         8   Q.   Would you be able to identify Juvénal Kajelijeli if you 

         9        saw him in the courtroom?

        10   A.   Yes, I would.

        11   Q.   Witness, we would like you to look around the courtroom 

        12        and see whether or not you can recognise Juvénal 

        13        Kajelijeli if he is in the courtroom, indicate where he 

        14        is sitting, what row, and what he is wearing.  You can 

        15        stand up if you need to accomplish this task.

        16   A.   I have already seen him.  He is sitting in the last row, 

        17        he is wearing black clothing.  I think he is wearing 


        18        either a T-shirt, a green pull-over, or T-shirt, and he 

        19        is also wearing spectacles.

        20   Q.   Witness, you should stand up and describe Kajelijeli's 

        21        clothing and in particular we would like you to look 

        22        carefully in terms of what row he is sitting in, and 

        23        whether he is sitting next to anyone?

        24   A.   He is sitting in the third row.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Starting from which row, perhaps?

        26   THE WITNESS: I can see him sitting in the third row.  He is 

        27        wearing a black shirt.  Next to him, there is someone 

        28        who is wearing a shirt with epaulets on the shoulder.

         2   Q.   Is he wearing a tie?

         3   A.   Yes, he is wearing a tie.

         4   Q.   What colour shirt is he wearing?

         5   A.   I would say his shirt is green.  Yes, it is green.  I 

         6        can see also that the shirt is blue.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Indicating Mr. Kajelijeli, Your Honour.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, he has certainly -- he has certainly 

        10        identified the Accused, Kajelijeli, except I don't know 

        11        where he counts his rows, where he starts from in 

        12        counting his rows.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think the witness has problems counting, 

        14        but I will try to work with this.

        15   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        16   Q.   Witness, can you tell -- rather than using numbers, can 

        17        you tell where Mr. Kajelijeli is sitting in relation to 

        18        where I am standing?

        19   A.   Kajelijeli is sitting behind the person who is asking me 

        20        questions.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Indicating Kajelijeli, Your Honour.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the witness has identified the Accused 

        23        Kajelijeli in the courtroom.  Let the record so reflect.  

        24        

        25        Yes, Counsel.

         1   Q.   And where were you at the time that you heard the news?

         2   A.   I was at home in my house.

         3   Q.   And what, if anything, did you do; withdrawn.  How did 

         4        you learn the news of the death of the president?

         5   A.   I heard the inhabitants say that the president's plane 

         6        had been shot down.

         7   Q.   Who were these inhabitants that you heard discussing 

         8        this matter?

         9   A.   They were the inhabitants.

        10   Q.   And when you heard this information, what, if anything, 

        11        did you do?

        12   A.   I was immediately afraid and I fled.

        13   Q.   Why were you afraid?

        14   A.   I became afraid, because it was said that it was the 

        15        Tutsis, together with their accomplices who had shot 

        16        down the plane carrying the president.

        17   Q.   And, Witness, what did you do, as a result of your fear?

        18   A.   I fled.

        19   Q.   And where did you go?

        20   A.   I went to seek refuge at Kajelijeli's house.

        21   Q.   Now, Witness, why did you select Kajelijeli's house to 

        22        seek refuge?

        23   A.   I chose to go and seek refuge at Kajelijeli's house 

        24        because, even prior to that, Kajelijeli had saved me 

        25        before when I was arrested.

        26   Q.   Could you tell the Trial Chamber the circumstances under 

        27        which your life was saved by Kajelijeli?

        28   A.   I was arrested and detained in a police cell at the 

        29        commune office, and when Kajelijeli found me there, the 

        30        following morning, he had me released.

         1   Q.   Now, why were you arrested?

         2   A.   I don't know why I was arrested.  I saw the cellule 

         3        official and inhabitants come to arrest me and take me 

         4        to the office of the commune.

         5   Q.   Were you there alone?  Were you the only one arrested?

        11   Q.   Do you recall what year that was when you were arrested?

        12   A.   I don't remember the year very well, but I know that it 

        13        was when people, including one Rizinde were released.  I 

        14        think it was in January or February of that year.  

        15        Rizinde is spelt R-I-Z-I-N-D-E.

        16   Q.   Do you know whether or not there were any events that 

        17        occurred in Rwanda which were around the same time of 

        18        your arrest?  Were there any attacks that took place?

        19   A.   It was at the beginning of the war.

        20   Q.   Now, could you tell the Tribunal the names of the 

        21        individuals who were arrested and whom you saw in jail 

        22        with you at that time?

         5        led you to believe that Kajelijeli saved your life?

         6   A.   What did you say, Counsel?

         7   Q.   Why did you say that Kajelijeli saved your life at that 

         8        time?

         9   A.   I'm saying this because it's thanks to him that I am 

        10        still alive.  He is the one who saved my life.

        11   Q.   Witness, could you tell the Trial Chamber, what, if 

        12        anything, that Kajelijeli did when he saw you in jail at

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Witness, what was the ethnicity of the other people who

         7   A.   These people were also released at the same time as I 

         8        was.  Kajelijeli released all of us. 

         9   Q.   Do you know if those individuals are alive today, if any 

        10        of them? 

        11   A.   Two of these people are still alive.

        14   Q.   You mentioned another name, Rizinde.  Who was Rizinde?

        15   A.   Rizinde was in prison, but I don't know who he was.  I 

        16        simply heard people say that he was in jail. 

        17   Q.   Now, Witness, when you took refuge at Kajelijeli's, were 

        18        you alone or were you with others?

        20   Q.   And at that time, was it your first wife?  

        21   A.   Yes, it was my first wife. 

        22   Q.   And, Witness, could you tell the Tribunal what you did 

        23        when you got to the vicinity of Kajelijeli's home? 

        24   A.   When I got near Kajelijeli's house, I hid in the area 

        25        because I could still see people moving about on the 

        26        road.  I waited until 2:00 in the morning and then I 

        27        went to knock at the door. 

        28   Q.   Witness, I would like to show you what has been marked 

        29        as Prosecution Exhibit 7, and I would like to show you

         9   A.   I am myopic, short-sighted, so I can see clearly, but on 

        10        the photograph I can see a gate. 

        11   Q.   Witness, I would like to offer you my glasses.  Let's 

        12        see if this helps you in any way.  

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Give the witness the spectacles, please.

        14        I am not sure if it is going to help him at all.  It 

        15        doesn't help me much but...

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Do you share the same malady, Counsel?

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't know what I share.  I know I wear 

        18        these glasses.  I don't know if I am myopic, 

        19        short-sighted, long-sighted.  Let see if it helps him.

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Does the picture look any better with those on?

        22   A.   No, I can see only the gate. 

        23   Q.   Okay.  Witness, does that photograph remind you of any 

        24        object? 

        25   A.   Yes, I think this photograph reminds me of something. 

        26   Q.   What does it remind you of? 

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Tell him to speak directed to the microphone 

        28        so that at least those who understand Kinyarwanda can 

        29        follow his evidence in that language as well. 

        30   THE WITNESS: Very well.  I see a photograph and on that

         1        photograph, I can see a door.  That is the door I 

         2        knocked on.

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Now,  Witness, when you knocked on the door, could you 

         5        tell the Tribunal what happened? 

         6   A.   After I knocked at the door, Sophie asked me, "Who are 

         7        you?"

         8   Q.   And who was Sophie? 

         9   A.   Sophie is Juvénal Kajelijeli's wife. 

        10   Q.   Had you seen her before that day, that is when you 

        11        knocked at the door? 

        12   A.   Yes, I knew her before. 

        13   Q.   Now, what, if anything, did you say to Sophie when she 

        14        responded to your knock? 

        15   A.   She came to open the door for me. 

        16   Q.   Now, what, if anything, did you do after she opened the 

        17        door? 

        18   A.   She asked to know what was happening and why I came to 

        19        knock at that door at that time. 

        20   Q.   And what did you tell her? 

        21   A.   I told her that I was afraid that I had heard that 

        22        President Habyarimana's plane had been shot down, and 

        23        since I was afraid, I came to seek refuge with them. 

        24   Q.   And what did Sophie tell you at that time, if anything? 

        25   A.   She showed me a room where I stayed. 

        26   Q.   And was there anybody else in that room besides you on 

        27        that evening? 

        28   A.   Nobody. 

        29   Q.   When you came to Sophie's house, were you alone or were 

        30        you with your wife?

         1   A.   I was with my wife. 

         2   Q.   Now, where did your wife stay whilst in Sophie's house? 

         3   A.   We were in the same room. 

         4   Q.   Now, Witness, did you at any time that day see anybody 

         5        else in the house besides Sophie? 

         6   A.   There was another person who found me in that house and 

         7        spent the night there.  This was the only person I saw. 

         8   Q.   And could you describe this person who found you there, 

         9        and can you tell the Court when that person came? 

        10   A.   This woman who found me there, by the time she came, I 

        11        had spent one night and she had a child strapped on her 

        12        back. 

        13   Q.   Do you know what her ethnicity was? 

        14   A.   She was Tutsi. 

        15   Q.   When you arrived, did you see Kajelijeli? 

        16   A.   No, he was not there.

        17   Q.   While you were at his home, did you see him at any time? 

        18   A.   I saw him after I had spent two nights in that house. 

        19   Q.   And can you tell the Trial Chamber under what 

        20        circumstances did you see him? 

        21   A.   At the time I saw him, he had come to take his children 

        22        away. 

        23   Q.   How do you know that he had come to take his children 

        24        away? 

        25   A.   I knew -- I got to know when Sophie was talking to 

        26        Mr. Kajelijeli.  She was saying that if he had come to 

        27        take the children away, that the persons who had sought 

        28        refuge in their house were going to be scared. 

        29   Q.   Did Kajelijeli evacuate his family that day? 

        30   A.   No.

         1   Q.   Did you personally see Kajelijeli that day? 

         2   A.   Yes, I personally saw him that day.  And when Sophie was 

         3        telling him that if he evacuated the children, the 

         4        person who had sought refuge would be afraid.  

         5        Kajelijeli told me to be courageous, and I remained firm 

         6        in the situation in which I found myself. 

         7   Q.   Now, when Kajelijeli spoke to you, were you alone or 

         8        were you with others, and if you were, can you tell the 

         9        Trial Chamber who you were with at that time? 

        10   A.   At that time I was with my wife and this other woman who 

        11        found us in that house. 

        12   Q.   Now, did Kajelijeli stay there all day?  If not, what 

        13        did he do? 

        14   A.   No.  The last time I saw him was when he was speaking to 

        15        me. 

        16   Q.   Do you know where Kajelijeli was staying? 

        17   A.   I knew that he had another home in Nkuli.

        18   Q.   Now, how long did you and your wife stay at Kajelijeli's 

        19        house seeking refuge?

        20   A.   We stayed there for one and half months.

        21   Q.   And, at the time that you were there, was there anyone 

        22        else besides you and your wife seeking refuge and 

        23        staying at Kajelijeli's? 

        24   A.   No, there was no other person apart from this woman who 

        25        found us there and who had her child with her. 

        26   Q.   During the day, where were you and your wife and this 

        27        other woman?  Where did you stay? 

        28   A.   During the day we remained in that room. 

        29   Q.   And what were your living arrangements at night, if any? 

        30   A.   We spent the night in that room, apart from the fact

         1        that that woman, (By order of the Court this name has 

         2        been extracted and filed under seal) was taken by Sophie 

         3        to another room, and she spent the night in the same 

         4        room as Sophie.

         5   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: I am sorry.  I didn't get the last 

         6        sentence.  (By order of the Court this name has been 

         7        extracted and filed under seal)  The last sentence was 

         8        that he doesn't know whether they spent the night in the 

         9        same bed, but it was in the same room.

        10   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        11   Q.   Now, Witness, when did you leave Kajelijeli's residence? 

        12   A.   When I left the house, it was around 7, 8 p.m. because I 

        13        needed to hide, and people had already gone home. 

        14   Q.   Now, why did you decide to leave Kajelijeli's house at 

        15        that time? 

        16   A.   I took that decision because I realised that I could not 

        17        leave my wife hiding in the house.  So, I decided to go 

        18        to Congo.

        19   Q.   Witness, when you made that decision, were you alone 

        20        when you left Kajelijeli's? 

        21   A.   I was with my wife. 

        22   Q.   And whom did you leave, if anyone, at home, with Sophie? 

        23   A.   We left the person called (By order of the Court this 

        24        name has been extracted and filed under seal).

        25   Q.   Witness, why did you go to Congo? 

        26   A.   I thought that I could not live constantly in hiding in 

        27        a house, and I thought that at one time or the other, 

        28        they were going to find me out in Kajelijeli's house.  

        29        And if that happened, it was going to create problems 

        30        for Kajelijeli because he could be considered as an

         1        accomplice. 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think that -- well, I will 

         3        ask one other question, and then I'd like to go into 

         4        closed session just to wrap things up. 

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness, why did you as a Tutsi come here to testify in 

         7        Kajelijeli's case? 

         8   A.   I came to testify for Kajelijeli in this trial because 

         9        he saved my life and also he saved several lives.  

        10        Besides, I do not know of any crime in which he 

        11        participated. 

        12   Q.   Witness, did you lose any of your family who were Tutsis 

        13        in April of 1994? 

        14   A.   Yes. 

        15   Q.   And where did you lose members of your family, in what 

        16        communes? 

        17   A.   Some members of my family were in Kinigi, in the Kinigi 

        18        commune; some were in Nkuli. 

        19   Q.   And what part of Nkuli? 

        20   A.   These people were in the area, the border area of Nkuli 

        21        and Mukingo.

        22   Q.   Do you believe Juvénal Kajelijeli was involved in any of 

        23        the killings of your family?

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Believe?

        25   MS. OJEMENI: Objection, Your Honours. 

        26   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        27   Q.   Do you have any reason to believe that Juvénal 

        28        Kajelijeli was involved in the killings of any of your 

        29        family? 

        30   A.   He is not involved in the killings of these people.  No,

         1        he is not involved in the killings of these persons.  

         2        They were killed during the war, so they died as a 

         3        result of the war.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I'd like to go into closed 

         5        session just to wrap some things up. 

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Right.  We will go into closed session to 

         7        enable counsel to raise questions which could have a 

         8        bearing on the identity of the witness.

         3   Q.   Witness, I would like to show you a document, and I want 

         4        you to confirm if the signature appearing at the bottom 

         5        of that document is yours.

         6   MS. OJEMENI: Can I get a copy from the Defence?

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Do you want the original?

         8   MS. OJEMENI:  The statement, yes.

         9   BY MS. OJEMENI: 

        10   Q.   Witness, could you confirm if the signature at the 

        11        bottom of the last page of this document is yours, the 

        12        statement of this witness to the Defence dated 22nd 

        13        September 2001? 

        14   A.   Yes, I recognise my signature. 

        15   Q.   Did you date that document yourself?  The date that 

        16        appears at the last page under your signature, September 

        17        22nd, 2001, did you date it yourself? 

        18   A.   No, I cannot write a date like this.  The date is mine 

        19        but I did not write it. 

        20   Q.   What do you mean by the fact that the date is yours but 

        21        you did not write it?  Do you remember the date you gave 

        22        that statement to the Defence?  Is there a problem?

        23   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: I hear the interpretation.  I 

        24        was listening to part of the English, and I didn't hear 

        25        what was coming from the French booth.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Any problem?

        27   MS. OJEMENI: Would you want me to repeat the statement?

         1        statement -- if you recall the date that you made this 

         2        statement to the Defence of Kajelijeli.

         3   A.   I did say that the signature is mine, but I did not 

         4        write the date under the signature. 

         5   Q.   Witness, can you remember when you gave the statement to 

         6        the Defence?  Was it this year or last year? 

         7   A.   I made the statement last year. 

         8   Q.   Witness, you signed this statement after it was read 

         9        over to you and you confirm that the content is correct, 

        10        isn't it? 

        11   A.   Yes.

        12   MS. OJEMENI: Can the witness turn to the first page of the 

        13        statement.  

        14   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        15   Q.   I draw your attention to the first page of the 

        16        statement.  I draw your attention to -- starting from 

        17        the top of the first page of this document, the 6th 

        18        line, and I read as follows: "I have a wife and one 

        19        child who was born in May 6th, 2000.  I married my first 

        20        wife and we lived together 28 years.  We had no 

        21        children, and she died two years ago at Murorera 

        22        hospital in Uganda".  

        23        

        24        Witness, in answer to a question put to you by the 

        25        Defence regarding how long you were married to your 

        26        wife, you said you could not remember.  Do you recall 

        27        giving such evidence? 

        28   A.   Yes, that is what I said, but that was three years since 

        29        she died.  I mentioned two years then, so this year has 

        30        to be added, that makes it three.

         1   Q.   Do you then remember how many years you lived with your 

         2        wife -- your first wife? 

         3   A.   Yes, I gave an estimate regarding the number of years, 

         4        but I could not recall clearly.  

         5   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, I presume this is the convenient 

         6        time to take the break. 

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.  Okay.

         8   MS. OJEMENI:  May I also remind the Court that I might not 

         9        take long with this witness.   So, if the Defence can 

        10        organise themselves with the next witness.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Thank you, Learned Counsel.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: The next witness is here, Your Honour.  It 

        13        is ZLA. 

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: ZLA, all right.  Yes, we will take a break and 

        15        resume our work at half past two.  Until then these 

        16        proceedings stand adjourned.  

        17        (Court recessed from 1300H to 1430H)

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are resumed.  We continue with 

        19        the cross-examination of the witness.  Learned Counsel, 

        20        Ms. Ojemeni for the Prosecution, please go ahead. 

        21   MS. OJEMENI:  Thank you, Your Honour. 

        22   MS. OJEMENI: 

        23   Q.   Witness, you told this Court that you know Kajelijeli 

        24        very well, didn't you? 

        25   A.   Yes, I know him. 

        26   Q.   You knew Kajelijeli when he was bourgmestre of Mukingo 

        27        between 1988 and 1993, didn't you? 

        28   A.   Yes.

        29   Q.   Did you frequent Mukingo commune office during this 

        30        period when Kajelijeli was bourgmestre, that is 1988 to

         2   A.   Yes.

         3   Q.   Do you know who the assistant bourgmestre was when 

         4        Kajelijeli was bourgmestre in 1988 to 1993? 

         5   A.   No, I am not aware of that, during that period of time. 

         6   Q.   Do you know Semahane? 

         7   A.   No.

         8   Q.   Did you know Kajelijeli was removed in the office as 

         9        bourgmestre in 1993? 

        10   A.   No.  In 1993, there was another bourgmestre. 

        11   Q.   Who was the bourgmestre in 1993? 

        12   A.   I do not know his name, but I know the name of his 

        13        father. 

        14   Q.   What is the name of his father? 

        15   A.   His father was known as Bacuna spelt, B-A-C-U-N-A.

        16   Q.   In April 1994, who was the bourgmestre of Mukingo 

        17        commune? 

        18   A.   It was Bacuna's son. 

        19   Q.   Did you know that Kajelijeli became bourgmestre in 1994? 

        20   A.   No. 

        21   Q.   Witness, I draw your attention to your statement to the 

        22        Defence of Kajelijeli dated 22nd September 2001 that I 


        23        showed you earlier. 

        24   A.   Yes, I have seen this statement, but nowhere in that 

        25        statement did I state that Kajelijeli was bourgmestre in 

        26        1994.

        27   Q.   Witness, we are going on to a new topic.  We are 

        28        finished with the bourgmestre.  I draw your attention to 

        29        the first three lines on page 3, the last page where 

        30        your signature appears.  And I read your statement: "I

         1        have decided to testify in Kajelijeli case because he 

         2        saved my life and also my wife's life".  Is this your 

         3        evidence? 

         4   A.   Yes, that is right. 

         5   Q.   And you have told the Court that Kajelijeli saved your 

         6        life twice, isn't it? 

         7   A.   Yes, that is right. 

         8   Q.   Firstly, when you were detained in a cell in the 

         9        communal office in 1990, Kajelijeli released you, isn't 

        10        it? 

        11   A.   Yes, I agree. 

        12   Q.   Which communal office is this?  Is it Mukingo communal 

        13        office? 

        14   A.   Yes, it was indeed the bureau communal of Mukingo.

        15   Q.   You told the Court that you were arrested by cellule 

        16        officials, your cellule officials, didn't you? 

        17   A.   Yes. 

        18   Q.   Were these officials the conseiller, responsable, or who 

        19        in particular? 

        20   A.   No, he was an official of the cellule, responsable du 

        21        cellule. 

        22   Q.   Were there any officials of the communal office during 

        23        your arrest? 

        24   A.   No, there was no official from the bureau communal, and 

        25        when I was arrested, I was transferred from the bureau 

        26        communal which I reached at 7th p.m. 

        27   Q.   Witness, you referred to one Rizinde that was released 

        28        at the time you were released in 1990, and you said you 

        29        did not know him.  Is that your evidence? 

        30   A.   No, I was not in prison together with him.  What I said

          KAJELIJELI                                      10 DECEMBER 2002



         1        was that I was released in the time when Rizinde was 

         2        also released. 

         3   Q.   Where was Rizinde jailed then? 

         4   A.   At the Ruhengeri prison. 

         5   Q.   In the cell that you were detained, were there only the 

         6        five people referred to earlier in your evidence, or 

         7        there were other people from other cellules and 

         8        secteurs? 

         9   A.   No, it was only the Tutsis who were imprisoned.  They 

        10        were five and I made the sixth person. 

        11   Q.   Now,  Witness, you told the Court that the second time 

        12        Kajelijeli saved your life was in April 1994, when you 

        13        and your wife took refuge in his house, isn't it? 

        14   A.   Yes, that is correct. 

        15   Q.   Witness, when did you arrive at Kajelijeli home -- what 

        16        time?  About what time of the day or night did you 

        17        arrive at Kajelijeli home in April 1994? 

        18   A.   I left my home because of fear and I sought refuge, but 

        19        I first of all spent some time in a bush and I reached 

        20        Kajelijeli house at 2:00 in the morning. 

        21   Q.   At 2:00 in the morning of 6th of April or 7th of April 

        22        or 8th of April?  When exactly in April? 

        23   A.   The 6th of April at 2:00 in the morning. 

        24   Q.   Are you referring to 2:00 a.m. of 7th of April -- the 

        25        morning of 7th April after the death of the President 

        26        Habyarimana or before his death? 

        27   A.   Yes, I am referring to the morning of the 7th.  I 

        28        arrived on the 7th. 

        29   Q.   When you left your home, were the Tutsis being killed 

        30        already?

          KAJELIJELI                                      10 DECEMBER 2002



         1   A.   No, I left my house because of panic, because it was 

         2        being said that the president's plane -- President 

         3        Habyarimana's plane had been shot down by Tutsis, but at 

         4        that time, Tutsis were not yet being killed. 

         5   Q.   Who were the people saying that it was Tutsis who shot 

         6        the president's plane?  Who were the people? 

         7   A.   These were the inhabitants. 

         8   Q.   When you say the inhabitants, are you referring to 

         9        Tutsis themselves or Hutus or who? 

        10   A.   I would say that this was said by Hutus who wanted to 

        11        kill Tutsis. 

        12   Q.   While you were in the bush that night, did you see other 

        13        Tutsis taking refuge in the bush? 

        14   A.   No.  I didn't see any other Tutsis. 

        15   Q.   Now,  Witness, while you were in Kajelijeli house -- 

        16   MS. OJEMENI: Excuse me, Your Honour.

        17   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        18   Q.   While you were in the room assigned to you by Sophie 

        19        while you were in Kajelijeli home, could you overhear 

        20        voices within the house or outside the compound? 

        21   A.   No.

        22   Q.   At what point -- where did you overhear Sophie telling 

        23        Kajelijeli what you have told the Court that she said to 

        24        him when he arrived two nights later, after your arrival 

        25        at Kajelijeli home?  Where were you when you overheard 

        26        what she said? 

        27   A.   I was in the room and I heard Sophie speaking to 

        28        Kajelijeli, who had come to take away his children. 

        29   Q.   I asked you a while ago if you could overhear voices 

        30        within the house or within the compound, and you said

         1        no.  Are you changing what you told the Court earlier? 

         2   A.   It was in the house that I heard Kajelijeli speaking to 

         3        Sophie.  It wasn't in the compound. 

         4   Q.   If somebody came to the house within the one and half 

         5        years that you were in -- 

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Years, one and half years?

         7   BY MS. OJEMENI:

         8   Q.   Sorry -- one and half months that you were in Kajelijeli 

         9        home in 1994, and the person is talking within the 

        10        house, would you hear that person? 

        11   A.   Within the house, yes, but in the compound, no. 

        12   Q.   Did you hear any other voices other than Sophie's in the 

        13        morning of 7th April 1994, while you were in the room? 

        14   A.   Yes, during that morning of the 7th April, I was able to 

        15        hear another voice, that was the voice of the woman who 

        16        joined us there.

        17   Q.   Did you hear any other voice other than the woman's 

        18        voice? 

        19   A.   Yes, when Kajelijeli entered the house. 

        20   Q.   You told the Court that Kajelijeli came to the house two 

        21        nights after your arrival at his home in April 1994, 

        22        didn't you?

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  This is not the 

        24        testimony, it is a mischaracterisation.  The witness 

        25        said Kajelijeli came after two nights.  

        26   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, that is what I said.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Two nights after is not the same as after 

        28        two nights, Counsel.  

        29   MS. OJEMENI: Two nights after his arrival.  

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, what did you say?

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: It is not the same.  The witness said 

         2        Kajelijeli came after two nights.  He didn't come two 

         3        nights after.  To me, there is a difference.  He didn't 

         4        come at night.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.

         6   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, my question was simply that you 

         7        said Kajelijeli arrived two nights after your arrival? 

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  The witness can answer that. 

         9   MS. OJEMENI: It is the same as what the witness said.  

        10   THE WITNESS: Yes, it was two nights.

        11   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        12   Q.   Between the night you arrived and the night he arrived, 

        13        that is two days -- two nights after you arrived at 

        14        Kajelijeli house, did you observe any other visitor or 

        15        hear any other visitor's voice apart from the woman 

        16        you've told the Court? 

        17   A.   No. 

        18   Q.   For the one and half months you were in Kajelijeli house 

        19        in April 1994 to end of July 1994, Tutsis were being 

        20        killed, weren't they? 

        21   A.   Yes, the Tutsis were dying, but this was during the war. 

        22   Q.   How did you know from the room where you were that 

        23        Tutsis were being killed? 

        24   A.   I didn't know that Tutsis were being killed, but when it 

        25        was said that the president's plane had been shot down 

        26        by Tutsis, that I believed that Tutsis must be killed. 

        27   Q.   While you were in that room, you heard gunshot explosion 

        28        or strange noises, didn't you? 

        29   A.   Yes, I could hear explosions, but I wasn't able to 

        30        identify from where the explosions were coming from.

         1        But, generally speaking, the explosions had been ongoing 

         2        for some time. 

         3   Q.   Witness, you felt safe in Kajelijeli house, didn't you, 

         4        in April 1994 while you were seeking refuge there?

         5   A.   Yes. 

         6   Q.   Why did you feel safe in his house?  Why didn't you go 

         7        to any other prominent Hutu's home? 

         8   A.   I did so because he was the one who saved my life even 

         9        earlier than that.

         1        1500H

         2   Q.   Kajelijeli was a prominent person in Mukingo commune in 

         3        1994, wasn't he?

         4   A.   He was influential because the people listened to him, 

         5        but he was no longer bourgmestre.

         6   Q.   He was well-respected and the attackers didn't have to 

         7        come to his house, isn't that true?

         8   A.   I don't know anything about that, but I know that 

         9        Kajelijeli didn't do anything wrong to the people. 

        10   Q.   Witness, you went to Kajelijeli's house because he was 

        11        well-respected and the attackers could not have come to 

        12        the house to attack you; isn't it?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  The witness has 

        14        answered the question as to why he went to Kajelijeli's 

        15        house, and he has rejected the proposition being put by 

        16        the Prosecution.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: I think he (sic) is entitled to pursue that 

        18        element, is she so wishes, whether she --

        19   MS. OJEMENI: There is no lady at the Bar, Your Honour.

        20   THE WITNESS: Are you asking me that question?  The reason is 

        21        that when Kajelijeli was bourgmestre, he was able to 

        22        ensure everyone's security, and he didn't do any wrong 

        23        to anyone.

        24   Q.   And in April 1994, he was no longer the bourgmestre; was 

        25        he?

        26   A.   Yes, he was no longer the bourgmestre.

        27   Q.   And you felt safe in his house because attackers did not  

        28        come to his house to attack you; isn't that not?

        29   A.   No, that is not it.  The reason is that he had saved my 

        30        life earlier, and that was the reason why I went to his

         1        home.

         2   Q.   You certainly owe your life to Juvénal Kajelijeli, don't 

         3        you?

         4   A.   Yes, that's true.

         5   Q.   You have been told to come here to come here to assist 

         6        him in his case; haven't you?

         7   A.   And I am not the only one, he saved many lives.

         8   Q.   You do -- you are really obliged to assist him in his 

         9        case; don't you?


        10   A.   Yes.

        11   MS. OJEMENI: That is all from my cross-examination, 

        12        Your Honour.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, thank you, Learned Counsel.  

        14        Any re-examination, Counsel, Learned Counsel, Professor 

        15        Hinds?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour.

        17                        RE-EXAMINATION 

        18   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        19   Q.   Witness, why did you feel that Kajelijeli was at risk if 

        20        you continued to stay at his home?

        21   A.   It is because at that time when Hutus realised that 

        22        someone had hidden Tutsis, they would call that person 

        23        an accomplice and kill him.

        24   Q.   Did you believe that if you stayed at Kajelijeli's house 

        25        that he would be accused of being an accomplice?

        26   A.   Yes, and that he was going to be killed, and that I was 

        27        going to be killed too.

        28   Q.   Witness, do you know who freed Lizinde from the 

        29        Ruhengeri jail?

        30   A.   No, I don't know.

         1   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: We are having problems with the name 

         2        from counsel.  What is it that the counsel wants to 

         3        refer to, please?

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Lizinde, L-I-Z-I-N-D-E, Lizinde.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         6   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, is it the same that we were given 

         7        before?

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Isn't it the same name?

         9   MS. OJEMENI: Because the spelling we were given before is 

        10        R-I-N-D-E.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, R-I-Z-I-N-D-I, that is the spelling we 

        12        have. 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: This could the same.  Anyway the witness can 

        14        verify, and he can answer that question and have the 

        15        actual spelling sorted out, but I have been -- I might 

        16        not be correct,  I have been using L-I-Z-I-N-D-E.  But 

        17        these are names, sometimes.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think from what I have gotten now in the 

        19        last year or so, the R L, many times are spelt with and 

        20        L and R.  We can ask the witness.

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        22   Q.   Witness, what was the name of the person who you said 

        23        was freed from the Ruhengeri jail at the time that you 

        24        were freed from the communal jail in Mukingo?

        25   A.   It was Lizinde.  I meant to say that he was released 

        26        from the Ruhengeri prison.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you tell the spell again of that name, 


        28        Interpreter.

        29   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: It is a matter of usage, 

        30        Mr. President.  At the time in Rwanda, the L was used 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        68



          KAJELIJELI                                      10 DECEMBER 2002



         1        followed by an "I", but later on, there was a change 

         2        because in the Kinyarwanda language, there is not R and 

         3        L.  One case is either Lizinde or Lizinde, L or R.  Ls 

         4        and Rs do not exist in the language.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: What exists?  I have a lot of names.

         6   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Yes, the letter R is used instead of 

         7        the L because there has been a change, but in old time 

         8        writing, the L was the letter used. 

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: So how do we resolve that?  Can you spell out 

        10        what -- after that explanation?

        11   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Yes, indeed the rule says that names 

        12        with an "L" followed by an "I" one keeps the "L", but 

        13        for people who are unaware of this rule, they would 

        14        normally say RI.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: So can you spell out the name at least?

        16   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: It would be, L-I-Z-I-N-D-E, Lizinde.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: I was just saying to Judge Maqutu in some  

        18        languages R doesn't exist as well.  That is another 

        19        area.  Could you go on, Counsel?

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        22   Q.   Witness, are you -- were you aware whether Lizinde was 

        23        freed from jail during a war or an attack?  Are aware of 

        24        the circumstances?

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: I think he gave an answer that he doesn't no 


        26        know.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: He doesn't know who released, he doesn't 

        28        know who but he may know the circumstances surrounding.  

        29        Is there any objection?

        30   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, there is an objection.  And the witness has

         1        also said that he doesn't know the -- Lizinde, that is 

         2        his evidence.  He doesn't Lizinde.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Do I need to respond.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  This was his evidence. 

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness -- Your Honour, the name Lizinde 

         6        is not--

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: No.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness said that he was released at 

         9        the -- Lizinde was released from the Ruhengeri jail.  I 

        10        am just trying to find out from the witness whether he 

        11        knew the circumstances under which Lizinde was released. 

        12        He doesn't know who released him.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: But does -- does it arise from the 

        14        cross-examination that part of the question, Counsel?

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, she was asking about Lizinde.  And she 

        16        asked about who freed him and where he was and so on and 

        17        he indicated that he was from the Ruhengeri jail.  Okay, 

        18        I am not going any further anyway.  It's not a major 

        19        issue.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Go on, Counsel. 

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        22   Q.   Witness, during the month and half that you were at 

        23        Kajelijeli's house, were you aware at that time that 

        24        there were any killings that were going on around you?

        25   A.   No, I wouldn't know because I was inside the house.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Let's just know with Mr. Kajelijeli if he 

        27        has anymore questions.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

        29   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        30   Q.   Witness, if you were discovered at Kajelijeli's house,

         1        what do you think would have happened to you?

         2   A.   I would have been killed and he himself Kajelijeli he 

         3        would have been killed.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: No further questions.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Judge Ramaroson 

         6        has some questions for the witness.

         7   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you, Mr. President.

         8        

         9        Witness, you did say that you did not know why you were 

        10        arrested and that Kajelijeli released you from prison 

        11        subsequently, will it not be to the fact that you were 

        12        an accomplice of the Inkontanyi?

        13   THE WITNESS:  When I was arrested the first time, I did not 

        14        know why I had been arrested.

        15   JUDGE RAMAROSON: What was the age of Sophie, Kajelijeli's 

        16        wife?  What was the age of her youngest child?

        17   THE WITNESS: I don't know how to gauge age in terms of age, 

        18        but I can say that he was a little child.

        19   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Did you know if she had just had a child 

        20        during that month of April?

        21   THE WITNESS: Yes, she had a baby.

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you. 

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Judge.  

        24        

        25        Okay.  All right.  Yes, our attention is being drawn by 


        26        the registrar, do you intend to produce any statements 

        27        in this matter? 

        28   MS. OJEMENI: Thank you, Your Honour, that is why I read the 

        29        relevant portions.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay in that case, are you ready or will you

         1        read it later?

         2   MS. OJEMENI: No, I am not tendering any statements, that is 

         3        why I have read the relevant statements.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay in that case, this marks the end of --   

         5        tell Witness RU21, this marks the end of his testimony 

         6        and we thank him.  We shall have time to a later stage 

         7        to review and consider his evidence together with all 

         8        the other evidence that is going to be adduced in the 

         9        course o this trial.  But once again, we thank him.

        10   THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  And he my leave once the curtains have been 

        12        withdrawn.


        13   THE WITNESS:  Thank you. Many I come here tomorrow?

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: No, no. He is free and he is released and, of 

        15        course, that depends on the arrangements that the 

        16        witness protection unit may have.  This marks the end 

        17        and arrangements will be made for him to leave for home.  

        18        He need not come here again tomorrow.  I hope the 

        19        statement, whatever, he wishes to say does not contain 

        20        any information about himself that could reveal his 

        21        identity.

        22   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Yes, it contains information.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Of himself? 

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I am not sure the witness is 

        25        expressing some concerns and if he is, I am sure we 

        26        probably need to ventilate this in some closed session 

        27        because I am not sure what he is requesting and why.  I 

        28        mean he is making some requests and there must be some 

        29        reason I do not know why.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: If you think it has some information that

         1        might reveal his identity, Interpreter, then we will go 

         2        into closed session to hear what he has to, what he has 

         3        said for a short while and members of the public, and, 

         4        can perhaps bear with this situation for a short time.  

         5        It will be for a very short duration and then we shall 

         6        come back to open session.  We regret.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Your next witness, Learned Counsel, Professor 

         2        Hinds, I think you had indicated was --

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: ZLA.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you. 

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: And the witness is in the box.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: I think we are back to open session for the 

         7        time being until, of course, counsel will indicate if we 

         8        have to go to closed session.  Can you make her make the 

         9        solemn declaration. 

        10        (Declaration made in Kinyarwanda).

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Witness ZLA, you have just made a solemn 

        12        declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to how 

        13        your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few 

        14        elements to you before begin your testimony.  You will 

        15        be led in your evidence-in-chief by the Defence who are 

        16        seated, one of them standing on this side of the 

        17        courtroom.   Thereafter, questions will be put you in 

        18        cross-examination by the Prosection who are seated on 

        19        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

        20        of you may also ask questions, put questions to you as  

        21        you testify if they will have such questions to ask you.  

        22        If a question put to you is not clear or you do not 

        23        understand, please says so and such question shall be 

        24        repeated or explained.  Yes, these are the few essential 

        25        elements we wanted to bring to your attention.  

        26        

        27        Yes, Professor Hinds, please?

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         2            testified as follows:

         3            EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness ZLA, how do you feel this afternoon?

         6   A.   I am fine.  I don't have any problem.

         7   Q.   Witness ZLA, we will show you a document and like you 

         8        to -- with the aid of your interpreter to go over the 

         9        contents of this document.  This document contains 

        10        personal information concerning you.  If that 

        11        information is correct, we would like you to sign the 

        12        document and date it and return it to me.  Do you 

        13        understand that?

        14   A.   The information contained in this document reflects the 

        15        truth. 

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we like this document marked as 

        17        Defendant's Exhibit 42.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objection, Learned Counsel, for the 

        19        Prosecution?

        20   MS. OJEMENI: We would like to see the additional information.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: And after counsel for the Prosecution has 

        22        had opportunity to read it, we will tender it as a 

        23        defendant exhibit and ask that it be sealed since it 

        24        contains the particulars of the witness.

        25   MS. OJEMENI: No objection, Your Honour.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT:So, let the document containing the personal 

        27        particulars of Witness ZLA be admitted as Defence 

        28        Exhibit No. 42, and the said document shall be kept 

        29        under seal as it contains the personal particulars of 

        30        this witness who is a protected witness.

         1   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My lord.

         2             (Exhibit No. 42 was admitted)

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness, we are in open session and you should be 

         6        careful about answering questions so that you do not 

         7        reveal your identify.  If you have any reservations 

         8        about an answer that you may want to make which you 

         9        think may reveal your identity, you should so indicate.  

        10        We will continue advise you on how to proceed.  Do you 

        11        understand?

        12   A.   Yes.

        13   Q.   Witness, what is your ethnicity?

        14   A.   I am Tutsi.

        15   Q.   And how old are you ma'am?

        16   A.   I am ****.

        17   Q.   Did you attend primary school, without telling us the 

        18        name of the primary school?

        19   A.   Yes, I had primary education.

        20   Q.   And did you attend secondary school, ma'am?

        21   A.   I did not have secondary education.

        22   Q.   Did you have any education beyond secondary education?

        23   A.   After my primary education I had a three-training in 

        24        crafts.

        25   Q.   And what type of crafts training did you receive?

        26   A.   I took a training in the decoration of table mats and 

        27        small baskets.

        28   Q.   And when you had completed that training, did you work 

        29        in that field as you call it crafts?

        30   A.   No, after my vocation training, I did not practise in

         1        the field in which I trained.

         2   Q.   What did you do after you completed -- after you had  

         3        completed the three years of schooling in craftsmanship?

         4   A.   I would have like to request that the microphone be put 


         5        off before I gave my answer.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, tell the Witness ZLA that if it is not 

         7        mentioning her name or the name of the person who is  

         8        linked to her identity of the place that is linked to 

         9        her identity, she can safely -- if she understands the 

        10        question, she can answer that question.

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Witness, are you fearful that what you are saying may 

        13        reveal your identity?

        14   A.   It is possible that my identity will be revealed if I 

        15        answer this question in open session.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: What was the question, Counsel?

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: The question was; what did see do after she 

        18        completed the three years of craftsmanship schooling?  I 

        19        don't think it will reveal, but I am not sure what she 

        20        is going to say.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: What she said is that she did not practise the 

        22        training, you know, she undertook and she did something 

        23        else.

        24   THE WITNESS: If you think I can give my answer without any  

        25        problem, then I am ready to do so.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: If she can answer that question without 

        27        additions or whatever, straight answer.

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   Witness, do not -- give your answer and I will be asking 

        30        the questions, and if I think there would be a problem I

         9   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, a particular name was mentioned, 

        10        but it was not spelt where she attended training, ****

        11        ********

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, in fact, it was the same issue that 

        13        Judge Ramaroson wanted to find out.  There were two 

        14        names mentioned there "and I took ** ****** 

        15        ********".  I think there was another name 

        16        mentioned there.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: You mean Bugesera?

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  No, Bugesera was previous.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: In answer to the question after Bugesera.

        21   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honours, to help the Court, he referred to 

        22        a particular that ***** was known in another -- I 

        23        mean, under another name.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Do you recall, Interpreter?

        26        which is ************

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Around the time when she mentioned the ***

        28        ***.

         6        form of anything?

         7   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: I believe, this is an acronym, 

         8        but maybe the witness should be able to explain, but I 

         9        believe it's an acronym.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Right.  You can follow it up, Counsel, that 

        11        one.

        12   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        13   Q.   Witness, do you know what **** *****

        16   Q.   Witness, when you were completed -- when you had 

        17        completed ******  , where were you 

        18        assigned, if any place?

        19   A.   I worked in ********************* 

        20        ********.  Counsel, can you repeat 

        21        the question?

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Before that, can we get the answer?

        23   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: From what I heard from the 

        24        witness, she said that she **************

        26        ************  But witness is asking Defence Counsel to

         4   Q.   And after that *****, where, if any place, were you 

         5        assigned?

         6   MS. OJEMENI: Objection, Your Honour.  I really do not know 

         7        the relevance of all these questions concerning this 

         8        witness's training and what she did thereafter.  The 

         9        summary which we have of the testimony of this witness 

        10        is very straightforward, and there is nothing like 

        11        anything ************************************* 

        12        *******.  And I think my Learned Friend's line of 

        13        questioning is beyond the scope of what he has so 

        14        indicated, that this witness would be testifying in the 

        15        summary he has provided to us.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this is -- I have taken 

        17        20 minutes dealing with the background of this witness.  

        18        I'm taking her up to 1990, and at that point we'll get 

        19        into the next line of questioning dealing with 

        20        Kajelijeli, but there is an activity that she engaged 

        21        in, and there is a question about -- at some point ***

        22        *****, got married and then we deal with 

        23        Kajelijeli.  Two more questions.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the background should be -- normally 

        25        should be very short so that, you know, to demonstrate 

        26        the linkage that is supposed to be demonstrated before 

        27        the Trial Chamber, before coming to the real issues that 

        28        concern the witness.  But you can follow it up and have 

        29        it completed as quickly as possible.  But you will 

        30        notice, even with that background, I don't know, whether

         1        the sequence came out clearly because previously she has 

         2        talked about her roommate and then ***** 

         3        ****, and then there was her ****** again at 

         4        Bugesera, and then from there, we moved on ****.  

         5        So I don't know what you --

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: We'll sum it up in two questions.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: And then move on.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Right.

         9   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        10   Q.   Witness, how long did you spend **************?  How 

        11        many years?

        12   A.   I spent ***********.

        13   Q.   And can you tell the Trial Chamber ******* 

        14        *************?

        15   A.   ************.

        16   Q.   And why ******?

        17   A.   ************************** 

        18        ************************** 

        19        **************************.

        20   Q.   And after you got married, where did you move to?  Do 

        21        not tell us the cellule or secteur, just the commune.

        22   A.   I went to live in the Mukingo commune, in Ruhengeri 

        23        préfecture.

        24   Q.   What year was that, Witness?

        25   A.   It was during the same year, 1990.

        26   Q.   Do you know who was the bourgmestre in Mukingo at that 

        27        time?

        28   A.   Yes, I know the person who was the bourgmestre of 

        29        Mukingo.

        30   Q.   And who was that?

         1   A.   It was Juvénal Kajelijeli.

         2   Q.   When did you first make acquaintance or get to know 

         3        Juvénal Kajelijeli?

         4   A.   It was during that year, 1990, that I got to know 

         5        Kajelijeli.

         6   Q.   And how long did you remain in Mukingo?

         7   A.   I lived in the Mukingo commune from 1990 to 1993.

         8   Q.   And after --

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Should I stop?

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  I think we'll stop here and take a break 


        11        for 15 minutes.  We are at a stage where the witness is 

        12        saying she remained in Mukingo from 1990 to 1993.  We 

        13        will take it from there, Counsel. 

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Then we'll take a break for 15 minutes 

        16        and resume our work at twenty past four. 

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        19        (Court recessed from 1605H to 1623H)

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  

        21        

        22        Counsel, before you resume your examination-in-chief, we 

        23        wanted to indicate that -- to you, the parties, that we 

        24        should organise our work in such a way, or you work in 

        25        such a way that at least everything is done by Thursday 

        26        evening for this session.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think that we'll be finished 

        28        possibly tomorrow evening.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay, we just want to make sure that it's 

        30        done; there are some other things that need to be done.

         1        So, if we can  -- we can still go on, if it is somewhere 

         2        to be done --

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: No, but I'm giving the Court direct 

         4        indication that we probably will end earlier than 

         5        Thursday.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right.  That is one.  

         7        

         8        Two, and secondly, we have seen from the listed 

         9        witnesses from the Defence, some of them are listed as 

        10        experts.  We were asking the registry whether there has 

        11        been any filing done, or any action taken in terms of 

        12        94bis.  We just want to be sure that we bring to the 

        13        attention of the parties concerned, about those 

        14        provisions as well, as we move towards that -- those 

        15        witnesses perhaps early in the year.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, we are familiar with the Rules, 

        17        Your Honour.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Okay.  All right, then, in that case -- 

        19        so those are the indications we wanted to bring to your 

        20        attention.

        21   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, as a follow-up to your observation, 

        22        the only problem we have is that up till now we do not 

        23        receive the transcripts of RGN, and I was not in Court 

        24        the day his witness -- I mean, his testimony was taken.  

        25        So, I need to get the transcript before I tender his 

        26        statement. 

        27   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay. All right.  If there are problems, then 

        28        it can be arranged, as long as it can be processed, you 

        29        know, when it is ready.  The only problem is that these 

        30        things have to be kept in focus.  It is very easy to,

         1        maybe to forget some of these documents which are 

         2        numerous as we go along.

         3   MS. OJEMENI: Very well, Your Honour.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  All right.  


         5        

         6        Counsel, you can go on, Professor Hinds.  We had stopped 

         7        at a stage where the witness said she remained in 

         8        Mukingo from 1990 to 1993.  Please go on.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Correct, Your Honour.

        10   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        11   Q.   Witness, can you tell the Trial Chamber where you went 

        12        after you left Mukingo in 1993?

        13   A.   I went to live in Kigali.

        14   Q.   And how long did you live in Kigali?

        15   A.   I lived in Kigali from that year until May 1994.  I 

        16        should say that before the end of 1993 I went to visit 

        17        persons living in Mukingo commune.

        18   Q.   And did you -- withdrawn.  Could you tell the 

        19        Trial Chamber when you left Kigali after you resided 

        20        there in 1993?  Did there come a time when you left 

        21        Kigali?

        22   A.   Towards the end of 1993, I went back to Ruhengeri.

        23   Q.   Did you move from Kigali to Ruhengeri in 1994?

        24   A.   No, I did not move house.  I was leaving Kigali in order 

        25        to go and visit them.  I'm referring to the family of my 

        26        brother -- my father-in-law, so it was a matter of 

        27        visit.

        28   Q.   Now, Witness, during 1990, did you, in fact, have any 

        29        occasion to meet with Juvénal Kajelijeli?

        30   A.   Yes, I met him.

          KAJELIJELI                                      10 DECEMBER 2002



         1   Q.   What were the circumstances under which you met 

         2        Kajelijeli?

         3   A.   I saw him in that year, 1990, after my wedding.  I had 

         4        gone to the bureau communal, because I was supposed to 

         5        change my identity documents.  A change was necessary 

         6        and the documents needed to reflect the change that had 

         7        occurred in my status.  I was now a citizen of Ruhengeri 

         8        region, and I no longer was a resident of Butare region.  

         9        I saw him again during 1990, that was after the RPF 

        10        Inkotanyi attacked.  That time around, Kajelijeli was 

        11        holding security meetings in the various secteurs.  And 

        12        that's when I saw him again.

        13   Q.   What do you mean by Kajelijeli holding security meetings 

        14        in various secteur?  What specifically was he doing?

        15   A.   Following the attack launched by the RPF Inkotanyi 

        16        throughout Rwanda, a poor atmosphere settled within the 

        17        population, and Kajelijeli held meetings in order to 

        18        explain to the people that they needed to remain calm 

        19        and disciplined, and that they should not attack one 

        20        another.  Also that no-one should be attacked 

        21        unjustifiably.  This was following the RPF attack.  

        22        No-one should be attacked on ethnic ground or any other 

        23        grounds whatsoever.  He also indicated during these 

        24        meetings that whosoever would carry out such activities 

        25        would be punished.

        26   Q.   Witness, did you personally attend any of these 

        27        meetings?

        28   A.   Yes, I attended one such meeting, because those meetings 

        29        were intended for everyone.

        30   Q.   Witness, if you saw Juvénal Kajelijeli in the courtroom,

         1        1640H

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Witness, we would like you to look around the courtroom 


         4        and see if you can identify -- if you see anyone who you 

         5        can identify as Juvénal Kajelijeli.  We would like you 

         6        to indicate where the person is sitting, what he is 

         7        wearing and who might be sitting next to him.  You can 

         8        stand up if that would better facilitate this 

         9        identification.

        10   A.   He is there. 

        11   Q.   Witness, can you indicate if you see Mr. Kajelijeli, 

        12        where he is sitting, who might be sitting next to him, 

        13        what he is wearing, if he is wearing spectacles or not, 

        14        the colour of his jacket, the colour of his shirt, so 

        15        that we are clear in the record that you have identified 

        16        the Defendant, Mr. Kajelijeli. 

        17   A.   He is wearing a black jacket, a blue shirt.  I can see 

        18        that the tie is mostly blue in colour, but there are 

        19        also some dotted colours on blue background, and he is 

        20        also wearing spectacles.  He is sitting behind the two 

        21        men and next to him someone else is sitting there.  That 

        22        person is wearing a uniform.  He is probably a police 

        23        officer.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Indicating Mr. Kajelijeli, Your Honours. 

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the witness has identified the Accused in 

        26        the courtroom.  Let the record so reflect.

        27   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        28   Q.   Now, Witness, why did you as a Tutsi come to Arusha to 

        29        testify in Mr. Kajelijeli's case? 

        30   A.   First of all, I came to testify in order to tell the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        90



          KAJELIJELI                                      10 DECEMBER 2002



         1        truth, to speak the truth about the events which took 

         2        place.  Secondly, I came here to testify on behalf of 

         3        the Accused Kajelijeli because, since 1990, when the RPF 

         4        attacked Rwanda, Kajelijeli has not ceased to protect 

         5        Tutsis who were threatened and he has spared no effort 

         6        in trying to correct the unhealthy atmosphere which 

         7        raged among the people.  

         8        

         9        Furthermore, in 1991, he protected an old Tutsi woman 

        10        who was known as Nyirakavuke.  I will spell Nyirakavuke.  

        11        I was saying that he had protected an old woman known as 

        12        Nyirakavuke and that at that point in time, all the 

        13        Hutus were attacking Nyirakavuke's home.  These Hutus 

        14        came from Kitabura secteur; the secteur is Kitabura.  

        15        Kitabura is spelt, K-I-T-A-B-U-R-A.  There were other 

        16        attackers who came from the Mukingo side.  At that time, 

        17        Kajelijeli came together with the policemen.  The 

        18        attackers were apprehended and they were imprisoned.  

        19        Kajelijeli called on the gendarmes to come and protect 

        20        that family.  

        21        

        22        As for the property which was damaged or destroyed, 

        23        reparations were requested from the attackers.  

        24        Nyirakavuke is spelt, N-Y-I-R-A-K-A-V-U-K-E.  Once 

        25        again, at the beginning of 1993, the RPF launched an 

        26        attack against the Ruhengeri region and killed many Hutu 

        27        officials.  Once again, the people became angry and 

        28        wanted to attack Tutsis, and here again, Kajelijeli came 

        29        in order to protect the Tutsis, and he collected Tutsis 

        30        at the agricultural and animal husbandry institute at 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        Busogo and he brought the gendarmes to protect these 

         2        Tutsis.  As far as I am concerned, neighbours wanted to 

         3        attack me and I went to seek refuge at the bureau 

         4        communal.  I shared this with Kajelijeli, and he also 

         5        asked me to go and join the Tutsis where they were in 

         6        Busogo, so that my security and safety could be ensured. 

         7   Q.   Now, Witness, did you accept the offer provided to you 

         8        by Juvénal Kajelijeli at that time? 

         9   A.   No, I didn't accept the offer he made; to the contrary, 

        10        I asked him to help me so that I could be able to go 

        11        back to Kigali, so that I could go and join relatives 

        12        who were living there. 

        13   Q.   Did you know anyone who was under the protection of 

        14        Kajelijeli at the ISAE at that time? 

        15   A.   The security and safety of all these Tutsis was ensured 

        16        because Kajelijeli had called upon the gendarmes so that 

        17        they could come to protect these Tutsis. 

        18   Q.   Now, Witness, what specifically did Kajelijeli do, if 

        19        anything, with respect to your security situation at 

        20        that time? 

        21   A.   In fact, I said that he had asked me to join the other 

        22        Tutsis and I refused and asked him to help me, so that I 

        23        could go back to Kigali and join relatives who were 

        24        living there.  He gave me a policeman who accompanied 

        25        me, who helped me hitchhike in the company of my two 

        26        children and other Tutsis whose names I do not know.  I 

        27        managed to get to Kigali.  These are the circumstances 

        28        under which I was saved at that time. 

        29   Q.   Witness, did there come a time when you went into exile? 

        30   A.   At a given point in time, I left and went to Zaire.

         1   Q.   And where did you go in Zaire? 

         2   A.   First of all, I lived in a camp known as Kibumba and 

         3        then I went to live in another camp known as Gatare.  

         4        Kibumba is spelt, K-I-B-U-M-B-A.  Gatare is spelt, 

         5        G-A-T-A-R-E. 

         6   Q.   How long did you stay in Congo? 

         7   A.   I stayed in Congo for two years. 

         8   Q.   And, could you tell the Tribunal what you did after you 

         9        left Congo? 

        10   A.   When I came back from exile, I went back to Ruhengeri 

        11        and I was a seamstress in Ruhengeri. 

        12   Q.   Witness, when you left Rwanda to go --

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: She was what? 

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: She was a seamstress. 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: What is that?

        16   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        17   Q.   Witness, what is a seamstress?  Could you describe that 

        18        for the Trial Chamber? 

        19   A.   A dressmaker's job is to make clothes using cloth 

        20        following a certain cut, or even to sew torn clothes or 

        21        mending. 

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel. 

        23   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        24   Q.   Witness, on your way to Congo, did you travel alone or 

        25        were you accompanied by anyone? 

        26   A.   When I went into exile to the Congo, I wasn't alone.  I 

        27        was with members of my family.  I was also with other 

        28        Tutsis, in particular, Mrs************************and 

        29        Mrs**************.  We all fled and we were all under 

        30        Kajelijeli's protection.  Let me spell ***********,

         2        ********************************************. 

         3   Q.   Witness, why did you return to Rwanda? 

         4   A.   I came back from exile thinking that I was coming back 

         5        to Rwanda and that I was going to join my Tutsi kinsmen. 

         6   Q.   Now, when you returned to Rwanda in 1996, what was the 

         7        atmosphere or climate that you met -- that you found, 

         8        rather? 

         9   A.   At that time, the situation was good. 

        10   Q.   And what did you do, if anything, after you came back 

        11        from Rwanda?

        12   A.   When I returned from exile, I went to Ruhengeri and I 

        13        worked as a dressmaker.  I then went to Kigali to see 

        14        how to recover our properties, that is our house, and at 

        15        that time I was living in Kigali. 

        16   Q.   And could you tell the Trial Chamber, what, if any, 


        17        experiences you had in Kigali? 

        18   A.   Meanwhile, around 1999, there was a lady, *** 

        19        who came to see me at home.  She asked me to come with 

        20        her to her house.  When I got to her house, I saw other 

        21        women who told me that they worked for the Avega 

        22        association. 

        23   Q.   Now, did you at that time know what the Avega 

        24        association did?  What was the work of the Avega 

        25        association?

        26   A.   I am unable to give satisfactory explanations on the 

        27        Avega association, since I am not a member of that 

        28        association, and I have never been a member.  However, 

        29        it is said that it is an association of women who were 

        30        fighting for women who were widows, fighting for the

         1        interest of widows and needy women. 

         2   Q.   Now, how many individuals identified themselves as 

         3        representatives of this organisation to you?

         4   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Witness would like to mention 

         5        the name of the lady who was her neighbour, but she is 

         6        asking that the microphone be put off first.

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Witness, do not mention the name of your neighbour.  We 

         9        will do that later on in closed session, but don't 

        10        mention the name of your neighbour.

        11   A.   Those who introduced themselves to me as Avega 

        12        representatives were the two women that I found in my 

        13        ******************8. 

        14   Q.   Did you know their names or could you describe these two 

        15        individuals to the Trial Chamber? 

        16   A.   I don't know their names, but one of the women was of 

        17        fair complexion and average height; the other one had 

        18        long hair. 

        19   Q.   Now, what, if anything, did these women say to you at 

        20        that time representing the Avega organisation? 

        21   A.   These two women together with my neighbour asked me to 

        22        make false allegations against Kajelijeli, by saying 

        23        that he raped me in 1994. 

        24   Q.   Witness, were you raped by anyone in 1994 or at any 

        25        time? 

        26   A.   Nobody. 

        27   Q.   Now, what, if anything, did you say to those individuals 

        28        when they made that proposal to you then? 

        29   A.   I told them that I could not make false allegations 

        30        against Kajelijeli, since I went to Ruhengeri at the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        time that the killings had stopped. 

         2   Q.   Now, what did you do after you refused those proposals?  

         3        What if anything did you do? 

         4   A.   They asked me to do what they were requesting me to do 

         5        and that, in return, they were going to ensure that I 

         6        get my house back and I be put on the list of survivors, 

         7        together with all the assistance that goes with it. 

         8   Q.   Did they tell you what type of assistance you would be 

         9        entitled to if you were put on the list of survivors? 

        10   A.   No, they did not explain to me that, the kind of 

        11        assistance that was going to be given to me. 

        12   Q.   Did you inform them of any decision that you had taken 

        13        at that time? 

        14   A.   They came back to see me and still made the proposal.  I 

        15        told them I needed to think.  So, after that I went to 

        16        see my father, where I spent two weeks. 

        17   Q.   After spending time with your relatives, what, if 

        18        anything, did you do? 

        19   A.   I came back to Kigali to claim my property.  I went to 

        20        see the conseiller.  The conseiller asked me what I was 

        21        coming to do there, being an Interahamwe. 

        22   Q.   Had you had any contact with that conseiller previously 

        23        to him making that statement to you? 

        24   A.   Yes, I contacted him earlier when I was claiming my 

        25        properties, and he never referred to me as an 

        26        Interahamwe before that day. 

        27   Q.   What was your reaction in being called an Interahamwe?

        28   A.   Since this word Interahamwe had serious connotation, I 

        29        became afraid. 

        30   Q.   What was the connotation of you being a Tutsi and called

         1        an Interahamwe? 

         2   A.   I, myself, was surprised to be referred to as an 

         3        Interahamwe, whereas it is said that the Interahamwe 

         4        were Hutus who had committed massacres.

         5   Q.   What did you do, if anything, after you were being 

         6        accused of being an Interahamwe? 

         7   A.   I did everything possible to leave the country at the 

         8        beginning of 2000. 

         9   Q.   And, did you, in fact, leave the country then? 

        10   A.   Yes, at the beginning of the year 2000 I left the 

        11        country to go back into exile.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think that I would like to go 

        13        into closed session for the next few minutes to clear up 

        14        some matters, but before doing so, let me just check 

        15        with Mr. Kajelijeli whether he needs any questions asked 

        16        in open session.  

        17        

        18        Yes, Your Honour, we request to go into closed session 

        19        just for me to ask some questions. 

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we will go into closed session to enable 

        21        counsel to raise questions with the witness, even those 

        22        which could have a bearing on her identity.
