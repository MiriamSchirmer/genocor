EMMANUEL HABYARIMANA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	Let me briefly remind you of the rules of our game.  Remember to pause after my questions before you answer, and speak slowly enough for the interpretation and the court stenographers.  And then spell names.  

Yesterday we started examining your career, and I think that began when you left the senior military academy of Kigali, the École supérieure militaire de Kigali.  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Now, tell us what your activities were when you left the academy, and with the dates, if you can recall the dates.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, before I go back to my career, allow me first of all to express my sincere and cordial gratitude to you, and through you to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which decided to call me here and afford me the opportunity to make my modest contribution in the Tribunal's quest for the facts that will enable it to get to the truth, and thereby render justice in the matter of the Rwandan tragedy.  And, through that, the tragedy in the larger Great Lakes region.  

That having been said, Mr. President, I would like to come back to my career.  

And as counsel was saying -- Counsel Weyl was saying, my career started when I graduated from the École supérieure militaire.  On the 27th July 1977 I was appointed to the military police in Kigali.  I served there for a year.  The then-commander of the military police -- he is still commander today -- was Colonel Bagosora.  I spent a year there.  And in August 1978 I was appointed as a lecturer at the senior officers' academy in Butare -- in -- in Butare, yes.  Butare is Bravo-Uniform-Tango-Alpha- Romeo-Echo.  I spent about two years there.  

And in 1980 I was appointed company commander at the commandos battalion of Ruhengeri.  Ruhengeri:  Romeo-Uniform-Hotel-Echo-November-Golf-Echo-Romeo-India.  I spent about three years there before being transferred to the Bugesera training centre.  The training centre, that is where we train recruits and new soldiers for the armed forces.  In those days it was for the army and the gendarmerie.  My function was officer S1/S4.  That means the officer in charge of personnel management and logistic management.  

Three years on I was appointed for the same functions to the Ruhengeri commandos battalion.  A year later I was appointed officer S2/S3 at the Kibungo commandos battalion.  Officer S2/S3 is the officer in charge of state environmental studies and intelligence and planning.  Kibungo is K-I-B-U-N-G-O.  At Kibungo -- I was in Kibungo from '86 to '88, before being appointed for the same functions at the paracommando battalion of Kanombe.  Kanombe is Kilo-Alpha-November-Oscar-Mike-Bravo-Echo.  

After two years there, I was then appointed a lecturer at the École supérieure militaire de Kigali.  And this was in 1990.  
Q.	Witness, were you in that position in October 1990, or in October 1990 had you been posted to other assignments?  
A.	Yes, that is what I had just said, in October 1990 I had been appointed a lecturer and leader of the course of commanders at the École supérieure militaire of Kigali.  I don't know if that specifically answers your question. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you have any recollection of what happened on 1st October 1990?  
A.	Indeed, I was going to continue.  

The war started on 1st October 1990.  At that time, as I was saying, I was at the ESM.  And, with the war, administrative functions came to an end.  The RPF had attacked, launched its attack from the northern region -- the northern province.  But those days they were referred to as préfectures.  At Gitumba (sic); that's where they attacked from.  And around the 3rd of October I was requested to go to the war front.  Just as the other officers, we started the war -- we fought the war.  And, as far as I was concerned, I fought until the 27th October 1990.  At that point the RPF had been repulsed beyond the borders into Uganda.  

And in Kigali I was summoned to the staff headquarters, and there I went for my salary, just as all the other soldiers.  And when I came out of the accounts office, unfortunately for me, I was presented with an arrest warrant.  And that surprised me because I thought when I was called to the staff headquarters I was going to be -- they were going to thank me for my contribution to the war efforts.  To my surprise, they were -- they presented me with an arrest warrant on which it is written, "Intelligence with the enemy".  And that arrest warrant was signed by the prosecutor of the republic in Kigali at that time.  If I recall correctly it was Nsanzuwera, François-Xavier.  The arrest warrant was presented by the commander of the military police who, at the time -- he was a commander at the time, his rank.  And his name was Emmanuel Neretse.  

I was taken to prison.  They undressed me and took my money, which I never saw again.  I spent a year in prison.  And during that period in prison there were interrogations and cross-interrogations.  The -- the officer from the office of the prosecutor who came to interrogate me -- I'm saying all this because it may shed light on my presentation of the facts, if Mr. President will allow me.  

So, the officer from the office of the prosecutor of the republic came.  And I asked him why I was arrested, and he said, "Intelligence with the enemy."  And I asked him who the enemy was.  And he specified that it was the RPF.  Indeed, when the attack took place on the 1st October, the name "RPF" was really not known in Rwanda.  We thought these were people who were coming -- these were incursions by people who were referred to, in those days, as the Inyenzi.  But this -- this time it was a political-military organisation referred to as RPF.  

I told him that I did not even know the RPF.  He told me this was an organisation of Rwandan refugees.  And I told him that, "If this is an organisation of Rwandan refugees, why are you arresting me for intelligence with the enemy?"  Because the then-criminal code provided specifically that intelligence with the enemy will be somebody collaborating with foreign forces.  And, at the time, RPF was not a foreign state.  

After several discussions he showed me intelligence reports that were drafted, on the one hand, by the ministry of defence and, more specifically, by the director of intelligence who, at the time, if my memory serves me right, was Commander Karangwa, François; others that were written by the staff headquarters of the army; the intelligence service, and signed by Commander Nzuwonemeye, François-Xavier; and others that came from the gendarmerie.  And, if my memory serves me right, I believe it was signed by Nsanzimfura.  Those reports that I met Kigeba (sic) in Bugesera around the 6th of October 1990, were -- subsequently, it was determined that Rigeba (sic) was already dead.  The report said I was on the field because I had a contact with the RPF.  Instead of saying that this was out of courage, this was the report I was presented with.  And the officer from the office of the prosecutor found that the arguments were groundless and rejected them.  

Later on, other accusations were brought:  Insubordination to a superior, who, at the time, was Major Musonera.  There, to tell you the truth, I got scared.  And I said to -- I thought he would be put under pressure and probably would admit that.  But the major was courageous, he rejected the accusations, and rather said that, "No, this officer was courageous and correct."  So the war council -- the war council in Rwanda is a military tribunal.  It's one of the chambers of the military tribunal which adjudicates on military cases, particularly during the war.  So I was released and I went home.  I spent three -- five months unemployed.  
Q.	Witness -- Mr. Witness, I would like you to observe a small pause, and during that time would you kindly spell out some of the proper nouns that you have mentioned but which you did not spell out.  Nzuwonemeye, I believe, was one of them.  
A.	Nzuwonemeye:  N-Z-U -- I think is it Whiskey or Victor?  Which one is it now?  W, yes.
Q.	Maybe to facilitate matters you could be provided a piece of paper.  
A.	Well, Nzu -- well, I know the name.  W, yes.  Nzuwonemeye.  N-Z-U-W-O-N-E-Mike-E-Y-E.  
Q.	There was another name, Nsanzimfura?  
A.	Nsanzimfura is N-S-N-Z-I-F-U-R-A (sic).  
Q.	Did you also say -- did you also mention Nsanzuwera?  
A.	N-S-A-N-Z-W-E-R-A (sic).  
Q.	Rwigema.  
A.	R-W-I-G-E-M-A. 
Q.	And Musonera.  
A.	M-U-S-O-N-E-R-A.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

So you were released on the 17th of July 1991, which you mentioned, under the circumstances that you referred to.  Now, from the 17th of July 1991, what was your situation?  
A.	Mr. President of the Court, as I had just mentioned, from the 17th of July 1991 I was unemployed for about four months. 

Towards the end of November 1991 I was transferred, as a soldier, to the ministry of youth and sports, as director of sports.  And this was the same fate that befell other comrades who experienced similar situations and were posted to various ministries.  So, from the end of November 1991 I was sent to the ministry of sports where I served till the end of December 1993.  

In early January 1994 I was reabsorbed into the army after much pressure had been exerted by political parties, including the RPF, and international organisations which cried out for justice to be done.  I was reabsorbed into the army, and over a three-month period some administrative procedures were undertaken, and thereafter I was appointed S2 officer.  And this is what I referred to earlier on, S2 in the northern sector of Rwanda.  The northern sector included the former -- parts of the former Byumba préfecture.  So this was to the north-east of the country, from Gabiro through Nyagatare to Kagitumba.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, before we discuss that particular situation, I would like us to briefly revisit the conditions in which you were reabsorbed and posted to the ministry of youth and sports, and then later your reintegration to the armed forces.  

In your testimony, you mentioned that you enjoyed some support from various areas.  Now, did you belong to any of these groups which claimed that you had been subjected to some measure of injustice, and were clamouring for justice on your behalf?  Could you please clarify that point.  
A.	Yes, thank you.  Mr. President, this is a rather complex issue, a complex question, because the arrests that occurred towards the end of October -- October 1990, after the invasion of the RPF, stirred a significant number of problems.  

First of all, to my mind, some people took advantage of that situation to settle some scores, personal scores, maybe.  Others acted by ignorance, and others still in bad faith.  

But, in any event, and as I have always said, I was surprised and I am still surprised at what happened, namely, that someone was arrested pursuant to a warrant signed by a prosecutor who did not even meet the person who was the subject of the warrant.  That, initially, was my problem:  How can you sign a warrant, how can you issue a blank cheque for officers to be arrested during wartimes?  This is an issue which I am continuing to ponder, I am continuing to conduct research into, to try and understand.  But I have not yet found a satisfactory answer as to why these things happened, because they are beyond understanding.  

In any event, we were arrested -- I was arrested along with other comrades, Commander Kambanda, who was my classmate who, unfortunately, died -- was murdered in 1994 during the genocide in Rwanda.  He was a Tutsi.  He was a classmate, a personal friend, a brother indeed.  And then you have Nzabakunze (phonetic) as well, and several other soldiers of the army or of the gendarmerie.  And even civilians, business persons, all those people were arrested and fortunately, subsequently, a good number of them were released, following probably pressure from the RPF which had begun to negotiate.  

So, under such pressure, one of the important things that happened at the time is that the advent of multiparty politics and opposition parties had come.  And so with that opening up of the -- the political arena in Rwanda, the political parties were beginning to express themselves, human rights organisations, and the international organisation as well, was beginning to decipher the situation in the country and denouncing cases of injustice.  So it was sheer luck that those things happened at the same time, to our benefit, that is, political parties were emerging.  

And I want to say that this even happened within the MRND, which was undergoing some transformations at that time.  Many people from the MRND whom I knew also denounced the injustice that we were experiencing.  And all of those parties and movements helped to restore us to our rightful positions.  I don't know if I have properly answered your question.  
Q.	Yes, you have.  But I just wanted to ask you whether you do remember, from that time, any specific incident or occurrence which may have made you feel one way or the other towards the system in place whom you blame for this measure of injustice.  
A.	Well, I -- I really do not blame the -- the system, as such.  But injustice was committed, and I -- one simply feels a sense of revolt when faced with that type of injustice.  The -- that kind of feeling may have some -- some consequences on one's behaviour.  But, fortunately, it was subsequently established that what was actually happening was an effort to try to decipher the situation in order to contribute to making Rwanda a stable country.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were a soldier at the time, and it was not possible for you to be a member of a -- any political party with the introduction of the multiparty politics in your country.  Would I be mistaken if I said that you were not a staunch supporter of the MRND because of your experiences?  
A.	I think you would be -- be mistaken.  I have never been a staunch supporter of any political party whatsoever.  I have always been a soldier irrespective of my experiences.  And, by the way, it is that career that I remained in up until the time of my exile -- although, from time to time, I held some political and administrative offices here and there.  But, in any event, through all that I was always a soldier.  

Now, whether there was any aversion towards the MRND or any admiration for the MRND or any other political party, let me say that I did not perceive parties as such.  I saw simply groups of people acting, and I tried to understand how and why they were acting or behaving in any particular way.  And, as I have already testified, even within the MRND there were people who stood for justice, who were against injustice.  Many of them.  Particularly given that the MRND was undergoing some transformation with the advent of the multiparty politics.  

So, as an administrator, I had to assess situations before acting.  And I was to note that the -- some members of the MRND may have done this or done that.  Yeah, in terms of aversion, yes, there was some bitterness, and one needed to keep a level head and conduct a number of investigations before moving forward.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I thank you.  

We are now in early 1994, at which time you have been reabsorbed into the army and now hold your military duties, as such.  Could you now move forward from there and tell us more about your experience which you had already broached earlier on.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor once more.  

What I was saying, therefore, is that I was reabsorbed into the military corps at the end of March 1994, and I was appointed officer S2/S4 of the Mutara operational sector.  And I was saying that the Mutara sector was to the south -- rather, to the north-east of Rwanda, and included major places like Gabiro -- spelled G-A-B-I-R-O for Gabiro.  And another centre, Nyagatare -- Nyagatare is spelled N-Y-A-G-A-T-A-R-E, Nyagatare.  Kagitumba, K-A-G-I-T-U-M-B-A, Kagitumba.  So that was the area of Rwanda which made up the Mutara sector.  Mutara is spelled M-U-T-A-R-A.  So when I arrived Gabiro, the sector commander dispatched me to Nyagatare, which is on the border with Uganda, close to the Muvumba river which separates Rwanda from Uganda.  Muvumba is spelled M-U-V-U-M-B-A, Muvumba.  I arrived in Muvumba in early April.  

Unfortunately, on the 6th of April or thereabouts, the aircraft aboard which was the president of Rwanda and the president of Burundi, as well as other dignitaries -- and for Rwandans I can mention major -- or, lieutenant colonel -- the one who was the director of cabinet of the president, that is Sagatwa; and the chief of staff, the chief of general staff of the armed forces, the valiant officer, that is Déogratias Nsabimana; the commander of the Presidential Guard whose name I no longer recall, was also aboard that aircraft.  And several others, including ministers from Burundi and a French crew.  

That plane was brought down, and I found out about it the day after through UNAMIR soldiers who were at Nyagatare.  You see, at the time I did not have any transmission gear.  So when I learned of it, I thought it was a bad joke -- or, a joke in bad taste, given that we were expecting the Arusha Accords to be implemented.  So I believed in the Arusha Accords.  And there was hope -- we were hoping that something good would happen for Rwanda.  

Unfortunately that plane was brought down, and the two presidents died, and the other dignitaries, particularly from Rwanda, the chief of general staff, the director of cabinet for the presidency, the commander of the Presidential Guard, all of that left a huge vacuum.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, before the 6th of April, and in the days when you were at the battle front at the borders, did you notice any changes in the military situation or configuration, or was there still an ongoing euphoria about the Arusha Accords?  
A.	Well, thank you, Mr. President.  I can talk about what I observed at that time because prior to that time I was not there and I did not know.  

When I arrived in Nyagatare and I went to inspect the front, the various positions at the battle front mentioned several movements by the RPF, unusual movements where -- I was notified of unusual movements.  They were said to be unusual, because I wasn't there before and I don't know what the situation was.  And since I was given that information, I forwarded that information to my superiors.  What is true is that there was unusual movement of the RPF forces, and which, in military terminology, could be referred to as some measures of preparedness.  
Q.	Did you submit a report on -- on the situation which you observed at the time?  
A.	Yes, of course.  Any soldier at the battle front who is in -- within those positions always submits reports.  And even if there is nothing to -- to report on, that also is -- needs to be reported.  And given that I was in charge of the tactical matters, it was my duty to observe, to act, and to report accordingly.  

It was difficult to act at that time because it was a very subtle and delicate and complex situation.  And I mentioned this to the UNAMIR officers who also were there and who also noticed those movements.  And probably they also submitted reports to their hierarchy, to their superiors, and they also reported to my own hierarchy.  And the general thrust was that, "Although you may observe these types of movements, please be calm, these are delicate times, particularly in view of the implementation of the Arusha Accords which will enable everything to fall back into position."  This was the position of the UNAMIR contacts.  
Q.	But what happened was that on the 6th of April 1994 the president's plane was brought down.  So, what happened after that 6th of April?  Now, did -- or, can you tell us what you noticed in the hours following the attack on the plane?  
A.	Well, Mr. President, I cannot say that the attack of the 6th of April was information -- or, an answer that was provided to me by my superiors in response to my observations.  The reply, or answer I got from them, to my reports, was, "Wait for the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  Maybe things will fall back into place."  And, as I was saying earlier on, it was in the morning of the 7th that I found out that the plane had been brought down, the president's plane had been brought down.  

My sector commander, lieutenant colonel of blessed memory -- learned counsel of blessed memory, he told me to come back to Gabiro for a meeting so we could map out the way forward.  So I went back to Gabiro.  I left the troops on full alert, returned to Gabiro, but he had been called up to a meeting of unit commanders and other personalities in Kigali.  Upon his return, this is what he told us.  And so I went back to my position.  

But, unfortunately, in the night of the 7th to the 8th, war practically broke out.  Our -- the battle front was actually torn through, and that was the beginning of the war.  

Let me add that when Lieutenant Colonel Mungiye (sic), the sector commander, returned, he told us that Kigali was under siege and that it was almost all-out war in Kigali.  He said that the RPF troops that had been in the bunker of the national assembly had come out of their area and war had broken out, and that an appeal had been lodged to -- with the UNAMIR and General Dallaire to ensure that calm returned to the capital for the Arusha Accords to be implemented.  So that is what he told us upon his return from Kigali.  But, unfortunately, also from our end, the war had already broken out.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, could we have the name of the sector commander again, and a spelling for the name, again, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am sorry for omitting to spell that name again.  He was then known as Lieutenant Colonel Mundiye (sic), Léonard.  Nkundiye is spelt N-K-U-N-D-I-Y-E, Nkundiye, Léonard.  Léonard is spelt L-E-O -- L-E-O-N-A-R-D.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you also mentioned Sagatwa and Nsabimana.  Would you please kindly spell out those names.  
A.	Sagatwa is S-A-G-A-T-W-A.  And Nsabimana:  N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

On the 7th of April 1994, as the war resumed and you had an invasion on your hands, did you think or feel that the forces against you had been precipitously mobilised, or did you think that they were well prepared for the invasion?  
A.	On the 8th of April the forces before us seemed to be very well organised.  On the government side we had four battalions in the Mutara sector:  Three at the battle front and one reserve in Gabiro.  And that is the usual military strategy.  So the government forces were simply what could be referred to as a transitional setup.  Because even support weapons had already been withdrawn, compliant to the Arusha Accords, and had been taken to Arusha where they were stored in an armoury, and the keys of that bunker were handed over to General Dallaire, who was the then-commander of UNAMIR, and his superiors, that is -- I'm referring to that international organisation.  So for the operational sector we had three battalions at the front and one reserve battalion.  And again, I must emphasise that these battalions did not have the necessary arms or weapons. 

Now, let me also state that the battalions at the battle front were under the command of lieutenants.  And this is unusual because normally such battalions should be commanded by a senior officer in order to be able to lead the battalions properly.  Now, let me also say that almost all the battalion commanders had been called back to Kigali because they were expecting, according to the government, for the cake to be shared, as such, within the context prevailing at that time.  

Now, as for the RPF, what I noticed was that at the time they attacked in Kagitumba, referring only to that area, the battalion commander who was there was able to identify at least four battalions that thrust in through Kagitumba, very well organised, very well motivated, and properly organised.  If you went further on, another group of four battalions was identified.  And, further to the left, there was another group of four battalions.  And there was heavy gun firing in support of the advances of these battalions.  So that was in fact the -- the first attack that I saw in my life that was very well organised.  There were -- there was shelling at night and planes were dropping bombs that would light up the sky, and it -- it looked like a movie.  It was really like a movie.  

So because the government army did not have the necessary weapons to fight back, they were simply crushed.  There was disproportionate strength in terms of weapons and in terms of men.  So we tried to put in place some delaying tactics from our own side in order to see how much time we could gain in order to -- to delay the advance, and then give the authorities in -- in Kigali a chance to work for a ceasefire in order to go forward to implement the Arusha Accords.  That is why we put in place those delaying tactics.  

But we were not able to hold back long enough because the thrust from the other side was so strong that the attack which had started on the 8th had shifted us as far back as Kayonza, which is at the junction between the Kigali and Kagitumba roads leading to the border with Tanzania -- that is the country in which we are right now.  So that was the situation between the 8th and the 10th of April.  

In summary, therefore, there was an asymmetric balance of forces, and the conventional warfare scenario was not in place:  On the one hand a weak -- a feeble, weaponless side expecting the Arusha Accords to be implemented, and on the other side a strong army in terms of weapons and men which had a clearly visible intention of going as far as capturing Kigali.  That is it.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for your clarification.  Maybe to explain, an army the strength -- with the strength that you are referring to, the RPF acting within the context that you describe, does that easily move at the first command, or do they take time to organise themselves -- strategic tactical terms, logistical terms?  Did they just move on the 7th of April after the attack on the president?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  In all armies of the world there are stages you go through to start a -- a battle.  The first one is the preparation of the forces.  Preparation of the forces means training them, look at their physical, mental states.  Another aspect of the preparation is equipment, armament, weapons that you need to use to complete your mission, transportation, accommodation, food, communication equipment, that is the first phase of preparing for war, for a battle.  

The next phase is the establishment that I said when I got to the border, we saw unusual movement in relation to what was already in place.  That movement, in military parlance, is referred to as advance patrol.  And when you see that kind of movement, then you should think of a possible attack subsequently.  Now, you have to move the forces to get them close to the objective.  That is the second thing.  

The third thing is reconnaissance, recce, to determine that the situation on the field is this.  This situation cannot be improvised; it's a situation that takes a lot of time, a lot of -- a lot of observation, examination, counter-examination, until you are sure that the attack will be advanced.  Because attack is not like defence.  You defend yourself as you are.  But when you attack, it is to take an objective.  And that is what the RPF did, they prepared.  We saw them.  We saw them advance.  They had been preparing for a long time.  I can't say since when, but I can say that the attack that took place was a phase of the war, if I put that in military parlance.

1015H 
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Witness, for many, the attack against President Habyarimana sparked off the war.  Do you think that is an accurate description on account of what you have just said, when the war was prepared and the attack was simply the -- the bugle call to attack? 
A.	Mr. President -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I think Mr. Weyl has a tendency to actually make points to the witness and get him to confirm his own -- the information contained in this question.  And sometimes it's -- it's not very harmful, but at this stage I think it is crossing the line, with the last question in particular. 
MR. WEYL:
I'll rephrase my question, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, on the basis of your observations, do you think that the attack against the presidential plane is what started off the war? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President. 

As the -- as counsel for the Prosecution has just said, it's not a matter of thinking.  What I am saying is what I observed.  And after analysing the situation, I can tell the Court that, contrary to some statements, the attack against the president, since you are putting this question to me and this is personal, as far as I am concerned it was a phase of the war. 

That attack was part of the war process.  It's a phase.  The one who prepared the attack decided that there will be this, then followed by that.  They knew what they wanted, the one who prepared -- the one who made the preparations. 

Now, who this was is another question we can't answer.  But the one who made the preparation knew that this was a phase of the war, that there would be a continuation and knew exactly what he was going to do. 

Mr. President, I don't know if I have answered the question. 
Q.	Witness, on account of your last answer, under the circumstances of the 6th April 1994, who had interests in assassinating President Habyarimana? 
A.	This is also a delicate question, because there are many assumptions.  What I can tell you is the result of my own research.  That can be discussed, contested by -- challenged by some, admitted by others.  

To tell you the truth, in 1994 when I was in Kigali -- and I'll probably come back to that issue -- it was said that it was the -- some Hutu extremists who wanted to maintain power.  And that is why they shot down the plane. 

I was inclined, 60 per cent, to believe that.  But then I said to myself that there was the need to carry out the research, look at the facts.  We came on the basis of evidence to the conclusion and, for me, came to the conclusion that there is no doubt that the plane was shot down by the RPF.  Not the RPF as an organisation, but a group within the RPF, led by the current president of the Rwanda.  That is the result of my -- my research, our research with other persons and that is the conclusion we arrived at. 

And even there -- we have put this in our memorandum which was sent to the Secretary General of the United Nations.  We thought of sending a copy to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  From the reports, delivery reports of my computer, I know the report got to the ICTR.  

But others are entitled to float their own assumptions, but for us it's no longer an assumption, it is a reality on the basis of our research.  I don't know if that answers your question. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

On the basis of your observations, and the conclusions that you drew, why would the RPF want to assassinate President Habyarimana and those accompanying -- accompanying him in the plane that was shot down on the 6th of April?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President. 

What I'm going to tell you is not my personal thoughts.  It is the result of investigations we conducted. 

Why?  Let's put ourselves within the context of the Arusha Accords.  President Habyarimana, like it or not, had a certain credibility within the population and he also had some credibility at the international level and in that regard he was a major obstacle, particularly if there were going to be democratic elections.  And not only that, he was also an obstacle to take -- for someone to take over power and be legitimised.  

So that was a delicate obstacle for -- and that is why the person fighting him had to kill him.  So he was not only an obstacle politically, but also strategically.  If in his presence, even if he were sent out of Kigali, he was considered as somebody who can re-organise forces and come back to power.  

Politically it is possible that if there were elections, in spite of the multiparty system, he may have won.  So he was a major obstacle that had to be eliminated.  
Q.	Maybe you can tell us about some of the factual elements or some of the facts that confirmed your thinking that the plane was shot down by the RPF. 
A.	The facts as contained in our memo are many.  Meetings that may have been organised in Uganda, Mbarara, Burkina Faso, there were meetings to that affect.  These are factual political elements, facts in relation to the preparation.  We know that the missiles were sent to Kigali -- I don't want to go into the details -- but the facts are there.  

Operational facts.  We know that the soldiers were trained in the use of those missiles.  They did a recce of the -- of the field and they determined that they -- they were sure that they were not going to miss their target.  

And then the diplomatic fact is the meeting that took place in Dar es Salaam, an improvised meeting which brought together the chief of staff.  And from -- from existing documents the previous day the president -- President Habyarimana went to see his friend in Gbadolite, Mobutu, and probably he heard about the possibility that the plane would be shot down.  But unfortunately he went.  

All those elements, plus others, because in 1994 I was in Kigali and RPF troops were proud to say that they shot down the plane.  They probably did not see the consequences, possible consequences after that.  They were saying it.  And even today some members of the RPF, Mugabe and others say it, including the one who wrote the book.  I cannot recall the title of the book.  Then there are
RPF members, dissidents or not, who say it. 

And then finally -- and maybe I will come back to this -- when I was minister of defence, off record a lot of people told me, described to me how the plane was shot down. 
Q.	Witness, maybe I'm -- I'm a bit undisciplined myself.  I don't observe the pause and I would like to apologise for that. 

Witness, we will get back to that in detail when we continue with your political and military career. 

Let me now focus on the days following the 6th -- 7th of April 1994. 

So on the 8th -- on the 7th and 8th you had to face this attack of the RPF.  But tell us the prevailing situation in your secteur at the time. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President. 

As I started staying, there was -- the -- the balance of forces was asymmetrical.  I did say that on the 8th they had already been repulsed all the way to Kayonza.  It appears that the resistance was virtually impossible.  We got to Kayonza.  The armed forces sent reinforcement, but minimal.  They sent a battalion, because there was also a war front at Kigali.  The RPF had attacked on three fronts; the Kagitumba front, where I was, the Byumba front and then the Ruhengeri front.  So three fronts with same number of troops and the same disproportionality in the forces.  

And in the central front of Kigali where there was the battalion that went to the CND according -- as per the Arusha Accords, but which unfortunately for Rwanda and probably fortunately for the RPF, through interposed infiltration went from 6,000 -- 3,000 to 6,000 men.  So there was a central front in Kigali, and three fronts: Kagitumba, Byumba and Ruhengeri.  

Ruhengeri, I don't know if it is the first time I'm using.  That is, Romeo, Uniform, November, Golf, Echo, Romeo, India (sic).  

So those three fronts were the central front.  The armed forces did not have the means to face up to that, that is why the situation became somehow hypothetical.  We were in Kayonza, as far as I -- in my own case.  In Kayonza the front was reinforced, but we realised that we had to abandon that front and defend Kigali.  That is how I was called to other functions in Kigali to become a director of studies at the military academy, because it was being -- we -- we thought that we had to defend Kigali because we had lost the other fronts.  The Byumba front had also been pushed all the way to Karuvuma (sic).  The Ruhengeri had been pushed all the way to Base.  And the risk was that the government forces were going to be completely encircled.  And government authorities as well. 

So the situation -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The witness used a military term which I did not understand.  
THE WITNESS:  
Base is Bravo, Alpha, Sierra, Echo.  I don't know if there were other names.  Karuvuma.  Nyacyonga, it was Nyacyonga instead of Karuvuma.  Nyacyonga is November, Yankee, Alpha, Charlie, Yankee, Oscar, November, Golf, Alpha.  So put Nyacyonga instead of Karuvuma.  
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, I'm looking at the clock in front of you.  May I proceed or will it be the time for us to take the break?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for asking, Mr. Weyl.  I agree we can take the break now. 

We take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1032H to 1102H)

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, we shall proceed.  You were explaining to me that faced with the advance of the RPF you applied manoeuvres to move backwards.  Can I call that as -- a strategy, a fallback strategy?
A.	This manoeuvre to delay is one strategy and falling back is another strategy.  Normally falling back, 
	you -- you fall back when you are no longer able to defend the targeted objectives. 
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber what you were able to observe during these delay manoeuvres which led you from the border to Kayonza, if I understood, between the 7th of April and the 10th of April?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I don't know if I have a lot to explain here, because I did say that the first observation is that there was -- the balance of forces was asymmetrical.  Initially we thought we were going to be able to resist, at least for a month or at -- two weeks at least.  Then we realised that we were not going to be able to do that because the invading -- invading forces were stronger, and as you were saying it would have -- we probably -- it would have been better for us to make a strategic fallback.  

And second thing was that there was a flow of populations, at least on the front where I was.  So it was a -- a mix of troops and people moving and you had cattle, sometimes you get to a point there were war-displaced persons and we moved together.  It was practically impossible to even conduct the war and the RPF knew that and that is why they were shelling beyond the front, the battle line first of all, to scare the population and send them fleeing. 

Because where -- there were places where the shelling had destroyed houses, camps, whereas they were launched even before the RPF came.  They had done their reconnaissance.  They knew where the displaced persons camps were, so they were shelling them from a distance.  That is the first macabre observation.  Up till now we don't know.  I asked the question when I was in Kigali to some members of the RPF.  And they -- some of them told me, up front, that it was orders from President (sic) Kigeli and they were not afraid to say that it was to decimate the population. 

The second observation, which is also unfortunate, is that these displaced persons were leaving the camps with propaganda, were also carrying out some excesses when they were falling back and they were accusing the Tutsi population that they were conducting this.  

So these were some of the things that were happening and which was decimating the people.  That is the most heinous observations that I had to make in my life.  Others I will refer to when I come to talk about my stay at the École supérieure militaire of Kigali. 
Q.	Witness, during that period, did you have the opportunity to cross roadblocks along the way? 
A.	From Nyagatare to Kayonza there were no roadblocks, because the people were so many that they could not have put up roadblocks.  But I had to go across roadblocks later on.  But from Kagitumba to Kayonza there were no roadblocks.  And besides, the roadblock could not have been there because who would have put up the roadblock?  There were no people up until that time. 
Q.	So you got to Kayonza and then you continued along -- in the -- in the same movement of delay manoeuvres. 
A.	Mixed with civilians on -- towards the Kigali.  No, those who came from Kagitumba were not going to Kigali.  They were going towards Kibungo.  It is those populations that were disseminated at Murambi on the border with Tanzania when RPF took the Rusumo bridge.  Those who went to Kigali were the people who came from Byumba, the Byumba front. 

When I -- I arrive in Kigali I had already started.  That is when we said that, "Well, finally we may be encircled.  You need to come to Kigali so that we start training other officers quickly."  And that is when I was appointed as a director of studies at the military academy.  It was an accelerated training of officers.  But the front had been lost to the point that all the battalions were called to fall back to Kigali to strengthen, or to enforce Kigali. 
Q.	And that, Witness, are you able to say around which date you arrived in Kigali? 
A.	I got to Kigali on the 12th, the evening of the 12th.  And we had to go in stages.  One thing that I probably didn't point out was that I was saying that the RPF had attacked on four fronts; Kagitumba, Nyagatare, Byumba and Ruhengeri fronts, and of course the central front of Kigali.  That was conventional or classical war. 

There was another guerrilla warfare that the RPF was conducting which was complicating things, and that was the infiltration.  The final objective of which was to carry out violent -- violent acts against the people within the country, terrorist activities, place bombs in taxis, public places and so on.  That is the tragedy of violence which they were carrying out alongside the conventional warfare.  So when I arrived, to go from Kayonza to Kigali you want to be careful because you didn't know who you were going to meet along the road.  Sometimes it could take even a week.  So I got to Kigali in the evening of the 12th and then in the morning I started working a director of studies. 
Q.	And until when did you stay in Kigali? 
A.	In Kigali, as I said -- I probably did not point that out, when the transitional government that had just been set up observed that they may have, they may be encircled -- that was my position as well -- they decided to go to Gitarama with -- alongside with all the bodies of government.  When I got there the chief of staff was still there.  I went to introduce myself and he said, "You are going to take up your new position.  We're trying to establish -- re-establish order as best we can in Kigali."  With UNAMIR the situation was a bit complicated.  UNAMIR was leaving, the Belgian battalion was leaving.  The situation was confused.  

And there were displaced persons' camp at Nyacyonga.  RPF got there -- between the 7th and 10th they were already there and they had already bombed the Nyacyonga camp.  The town was full of young persons who managed to flee, such that the situation was very confusing.  The -- in the capital the government had just left.  The soldiers had been abandoned to their fate.  There was a camp of the republican guard that had been -- just attacked by the RPF, so it was complicated.  

And the chief, the then chief of staff -- I did say -- and I'm going to say this one day -- that -- I said it one day that on account of the situation we -- it would have been better for us to say, "Well, we abandon the war efforts.  We leave the RPF to take power and then we discuss later on."  That would have been my position if I had an opinion -- if I had the opportunity to express my opinion at the time. 

Now, the RPF had almost won the war, and they were only waiting to legitimise their takeover. 
Q.	Witness, I would like you to tell me a little more, because the war lasted about three more months.  It -- it lasted three months.  And yet, according to you, the RPF had won as of the 12th of April and the war -- the war continued.  
A.	Yes, the war continued.  What I'm saying is my position.  It continued in an asymmetrical manner.  It was not useful, at least from the position of the government, if not only to legitimise the takeover by the RPF.  Legitimise in a sense that the government forces could not carry out a conventional warfare, that was impossible.  They could neither control -- they could also not control the infiltration and acts of violence, they did not have the means, such that there was violence, the killings had begun.  And all that was ascribed to the government forces.  And that is why I was saying that if I was at the head of things at the time I would have decided that the government had lost the war, leave RPF take power and then position myself elsewhere. 

But the RPF did not want that.  So that is why they were playing -- playing a mouse and cat game saying that they are saying -- they are claiming I have taken the power.  

The Arusha Accords, the RPF was able to manage that situation with a lot of tact, and with the mediation efforts that were going on.  And one thing that one should not forget is that a country had been decapitated.  President Habyarimana, who had authority over the armed forces, and over the government, was dead.  The chief of staff who also had authority over the armed forces, Nsabimana, General Nsabimana, was dead.  The RPF ensured that the minister of defence was not in the country at the time they were shooting down the plane.  The minister of interior, the same.  Officers of the staff headquarters were virtually absent.  General Kabiligi, the other generals that I referred to -- in fact there was no head of the army, there were only troops of the Presidential Guard.  They also had no head because the leader of the Presidential Guard was dead with the president.  They were furious.  They did not know what to do.  The RPF was shelling them, shelling their camp and they were afraid that they were going to be massacred. 
So they were overwhelmed.  That is what we were able to establish following our research.  Well, that of course does not mean that the killings that were carried out on the population were reasons for which they should not be punished, because if there is a government, however weak that government may be, its role would be to protect the population.  That is why I was saying that if I were in government at the time I would have said that I declare that we are defeated and then we leave.  

The RPF continues saying that we were going to negotiate.  There will be a ceasefire tomorrow.  And meanwhile they continued shelling and to ensure -- to drag the situation, to ensure that the situation drags on and bring in the international community by saying that the government does not defend the population.  That was my own observation at the time. 
Q.	What was the situation in the RPF controlled areas?  Was the population safe in those areas that had been taken over by the RPF? 
A.	No.  Those areas we got to know much late -- after the war.  We even heard this from some survivors who were leaving that area.  And first of all, as I was saying, the refugee camps had been shelled.  And as I pointed out, the RPF was also carried -- carrying out guerrilla warfare through infiltration and by carrying out acts of terrorism, such that even before the attack, particularly in those areas that were referred to as intermediary zones between the RPF and the government were terrorised.  And after the invasion of the 17th April -- and here we have specific testimony -- the RPF was organising, they were saying these were meetings to distribute food, and all those populations without distinction were massacred.  

Such killings took place in Murambi.  Murambi is between Gabiro and Kayonza.  It is not the Murambi of Kibungo, it's the Murambi of Byumba.  It is spelt Mike, Uniform, Romeo, Alpha, Mike, Bravo, India.  

The first killing that was organised by the RPF took place there, at least from the 7th.  On the first day the population came, others were afraid.  By the third day everybody came.  They put some of them in houses.  These were commercial -- it was -- this was a recognised commercial centre of Kiramuruzi.  Kiramuruzi is Kilo, India, Romeo, Alpha, Mike, Uniform, Romeo, Uniform, Zulu, India. 

That is also between Gabiro and Kayonza.  They threw grenades into houses.  They shot people with sub-machine guns.  No one was able to get out, people who were massacred, children, elderly persons, about 10,000 persons.  

There were others in Gahini.  I was making reference to Murambi on the border with Tanzania and with bodies thrown into the Kagera which came -- that went all the way to Lake Victoria.  Lately I heard that these are being -- these bodies are being recovered, saying that these were bodies of people killed by government forces whereas these forces did not have the opportunity to be there at the time.  They had already been moved -- moved to Kigali.  When they were in Kayonza they could not go there because they did not have the means to carry out operations in those areas.  I was there. 

Now, generally, in areas occupied by the RPF they were carrying out mopping-up operations.  
Somebody who was a member of our research group, Major Furuma, wrote a report which -- at the time he was an officer in charge -- in charge of -- there was somebody who was in charge of RPF propaganda, Major Furuma.  Furuma is Foxtrot, Uniform, Romeo, Uniform, Mike, Alpha.  He is a former refugee in Rwanda, fought for the RPF since the 1st October, who stood against the killings.  He even wrote a letter to the Secretary General -- to the United Nations.  He is even -- he is a member of our organisation, and yesterday I heard that he had made another request to the Secretary General of the United Nations.  Before going to Uganda he was a native of the area, and he wanted to bring that to light and eventually had to flee.  So this is to say that the RPF, among its -- its objectives, intended to disseminate -- to decimate populations.  Why?  Maybe they would have to answer one day.  And one can -- can no longer recognise the people who lived there.  Today it is occupied by the former refugees that came from Uganda. 
Q.	Witness, the situation you are referring to leads me to ask you a follow-up question. 

On account of the killings and the excesses of the RPF, as they advanced in their conquest of Uganda, it was legitimate to retard its advancement so as to protect the populations living in those parts of the country that had not yet been conquered.  
A.	Mr. President, I don't think if the government forces -- the government forces spent three months and did not even know what was happening in those zones.  We got to know this subsequently. 

Now, if they delayed, as far as I'm concerned, it was out of a -- a bad assessment of the geopolitics of the RPF and a bad assessment of their tactics.  We should -- ought to have known this and should have written to the government that the force was so asymmetrical that we should not continue, and the government should declare to the international community the end of hostilities.  The RPF would have been taken off guard.  Unfortunately this was not the case for the populations on either side. 
Q.	Witness, during that period did you get to know of attempts of the government side to obtain a ceasefire? 
A.	Yes, of course.  In fact the meetings -- the meeting that took place the day after the attack on Habyarimana's place at the ESM, the main objective of that meeting was to request a ceasefire from the RPF.  There were several delegations, including General Gatsinzi, who is a minister in Rwanda today.  And he was on that delegation. 

General Satira (sic) as well.  All those officers were part of delegations which on each occasion wanted to obtain a ceasefire from the RPF so as to stabilise the situation.  And particularly to explain to the people that killings amounted to crimes and that there was need to stop that.  But the RPF did not want that.  They, rather, declared to the United Nations that they did not even want the United Nation forces in Rwanda at the time that we really needed them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

Witness, you were in Kigali in April 1994.  What were your duties?  And did you stay in Kigali till the end of the war, or you had other duties?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President. 

I was in Kigali as a director of studies at the ESM.  My main duty was to plan training.  I started working, like all soldiers, to plan accelerated training.  But since there was no peace in Kigali at the time, they decided to move the ESM to Nyanza.  Nyanza is November, Yankee, Alpha, November, Zulu, Alpha.  

This is towards the south of the country so that we can deal with the task of accelerated training.  We went there towards the end of the month of April and when we got there we also realised that there was a lot of infiltration.  As I was saying, the RPF guerrilla warfare involved infiltration and a major objective was to destroy that -- that centre of accelerated training for officers.  So we went towards Kigali -- we went to Kigeme towards the end of May.  And that is where I was until I went to Bukavu.  I spent a week before coming back to Rwanda. 
Q.	We probably will come to that -- come back to that later.  But at this stage I want you to -- to say in what circumstances did you come back to Rwanda, as you just said. 
A.	Mr. President, the circumstances are simple for a soldier.  As a soldier, I always thought that first of all a soldier had to remain in the country, whatever the difficulties, to contribute to the protection of the population. 

So from within me on the basis of my oath, there are others that have left, there are others that have been killed within the country.  That was the first motivation. 

The second motivation was that a government had just been set up as a result of international pressure.  At that time it was said that it was as per the Arusha Accords.  The first minister of the agreements, Twagira -- Twagiramungu, Faustin -- 

Twagiramungu is Tango, Whiskey, Golf, India, Romeo, Alpha, Mike, Uniform, November, Golf, Alpha (sic).  

He had been appointed.  We had a good fit, thinking that the appointed prime minister had been maintained.  Several ministers were proposed to the extended -- government that had been set up.  The broad-based government that had been set up, there were -- colleagues that were in Brussels with me were there and were saying that it was dangerous to go back to Kigali.  But I said, "No.  One way or the other I have to go back.  I'm a soldier."  And it was in that context that I decided, together with my colleagues, we were 50 -- there were about 50 of us, including General Gatsinzi, General Gat - 
Satira (sic), and General -- another general whose name we missed who unfortunately was killed by the RPF. 

So we went back to continue with the -- with the fight.  And this fight -- this time unarm fight to see if we can get back -- if we can rectify things.  

I have another document which is a personal one in which I said the RPF attacked from the north.  But when I was in prison and I was not coming back, members of my family had been decimated beginning of -- beginning of January 1991.  What I was told, or what I thought was that they were assassinated by people who were not happy and who claim that I was in intelligence with the enemy.  This was propaganda that I believe was started by the RPF.  So I had something against that government which not only put me in prison, but assassinated members of my family. 

With time, given that the Rwandan situation is a complex one and it need -- one needs time to understand, we had contradictions, counter-contradictions which we've always had.  With time I started understanding that these members of my family were assassinated by the RPF, as they did for others.  So I also had that duty to go back, go back to Rwanda and get to know exactly what -- what happened in relation to my family.  That was the third fam -- reason.  And the rest we probably can discuss later. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, that is how you returned to Rwanda.  Can you tell us at what period, or what time you returned to Rwanda.  
A.	Yes, I left Kigeme on a date which I do not recall, but it was towards end of July 1994.  I got to Bukavu and it was at that time that the government was announced with Twagiramungu being the prime minister in accordance with the provisions of the Arusha Accord.  

So in spite of the danger we decided to go back.  And if I do recall properly we went through Goma, crossed the border on the 29th of July 1994, if my recollection is correct. 

Then we got to Cyangugu, where luckily we were received by some journalists and the international media.  And the media were there.  And the point I want to add is that the RPF was also there.  And when we were in Bukavu one Nsengiyumva, a member of the RPF, came to -- to see us.  

Nsengiyumva is spelt N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A.

1140H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
As we went about in the city, he came to see us and told us that the transitional government had been set up by the RPF.  And we said, "Yes, we were aware of that", and we told him that we wanted to return to Rwanda, although our lives were at risk.  

He told us that what we were saying was true because others had gone back and had been arrest -- had been assassinated.  He even mentioned some examples.  And he agreed to accompany us.  And maybe without him things will -- was -- well, he is the one who advised us to contact the media -- to show ourselves to the media before contacting the RPF.  

Well, he had to pay for this because, in fact, he ended up being jailed for about ten years simply for having done what he did.  He is still alive today, although somewhat diminished, but he's still alive.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, from the time you returned to Rwanda, what activities did you engage in? 
A.	Well, Mr. President, the experiences were quite difficult, and we ran into several hurdles.  When we got to Gisenyi, we were taken to Kigali and we thought that we would remain in the city.  But we were taken directly to Gako -- Gako, where I was transferred to work at the training centre as I had told you.  

Gako had then become a centre for moral education or training, and one can even say that it was an intoxication camp.  That is the expression that was used.  

Now, we were taken to that camp, and we were taught about the bravery of the RPF.  But some of the officers resisted and were asking questions as to what the source of such information was, and they got angry, but some of them were thrown into jail.  

I was questioned for about a week on the Kigeme declaration.  I might refer to this later on.  

They asked me why I had said that the RPF was not patriotic, why I had claimed that people had been killed and so on and so forth.  So I said that I was simply speaking about what I thought and what I knew and they -- and -- and asked them to draw whatever conclusions. 

They asked me whether I still stood by my position, and I said, "Yes."  And I said that this was not only my personal position, but the position of a working group which had come to those conclusions and we were ready to defend our positions.  

We spent about five months in Gako, from July to the end of November 1994.  
Then in January 1994, following international pressure from the Americans and the English, who felt that they were the master allies of the people in power in Kigali, they wanted them to come clean with the international community by rehabilitating some persons pursuant to the provisions of the Arusha Accords, and, in so doing, they would project themselves as being democratic, applying the Arusha principles for the benefit of the entire population.  

So at that time I was designated to be a deputy or a member of parliament representing the army at the national assembly.  So I said, "I'm a soldier.  How could I end up being a member of parliament?"
But that's how things happened.  The central committee of the RPF came to that decision, although I am not a member of the -- of the RPF, but all the decisions were taken at the central committee of the RPF.  

So I was a member of parliament and, at the same time, director of planning at the ministry of defence.  And -- well, I said, "This is somewhat connected to my career, and I will pick up the job and I'll do what I can".  But then later on I -- I -- I was happy to have been designated or appointed a member of parliament because I got to learn a lot.  

I became a member of parliament in January 1995 and director of planning at the ministry of the defence, which is not an easy job.  So I was involved in planning and putting together documents that had been scattered all over the place.  I was able to put some telegrams together, to read some mail, and so on and so forth. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you kindly slow down.  I think you're going a little too fast for the interpreters as well as for the court reporters.
A.	Well, thank you, Mr. President.  I -- it -- it does happen that I can -- I -- I speed up, and I'm sorry for that.  But what I was saying is that I became director of planning at the ministry of defence at the time.  And in that capacity I was able to put together various documents, including those which had not been -- well, rather, those which had not been burnt.  I tried to file them properly, and I proceeded to an analysis of the various correspondences that were available.  

Then I was a member of parliament.  And what pleased me about being a member of parliament is the opportunity to look into the famous law on the Rwandan genocide.  I say so because I was one of the members of parliament who scrutinised and introduced or -- so to speak, this -- this -- that law.  

At that time, and contrary to what some opinions held, the -- the national assembly was functional.  And it included people from the MDR, from the PL, from the RPF and five persons representing the army.  That was the new approach to parliamentary matters, and this was introduced by the RPF.  

And, of course, there were no members of parliament from the MRND.  And we always wondered why, but we never received any convincing answers to that question.  

However, the assembly appeared to be democratic at that time, because people were free to express themselves.  And so we said, "This is the time for us to look into the situation in Rwanda."  

We looked into that law.  And people of the RPF argued that there had been a Hutu government in place which had massacred the Tutsis.  And we said, "You know, you, yourselves, also killed people in Murambi, in Byumba and elsewhere, and you bombarded various camps."  And so we came to some kind of balance of forces and we agreed that the law would be captioned...(no interpretation)... in Rwanda.  

Yes.  That is the title that was given to the law in -- in Rwanda.  I am not a legislator, and I'm not a legal expert, but that is exactly what was agreed to, and this is the title that was accepted at the United Nations.  And so, in French, it was called the law on the Rwandan genocide, if my recollection is correct -- that is, pursuant to the United Nations resolution.  

And this is what we came up with, and maybe we will revisit this point because it is a point of interest to me.  I was there.  I was present at the national assembly when the law was drafted, when it was scrutinised.  

Now, in 2004, the -- there has been a change with reference to the genocide of the Tutsi.  Yes, I do agree that there were Tutsi -- Rwandans who were massacred, but I do not agree with the idea of planning such a genocide; although I know that there was killing and that people were killed because they were Tutsis.  And it's most unfortunate.  And -- but that doesn't forbid me from stating what I know to have been the case.  

Working as a member of parliament and as director of planning in the ministry of defence, I was subsequently appointed general director.  You see, the position of director of cabinet had been eliminated.  Now, I was appointed director general at the ministry of defence.  And in that position I was in charge of the administration and the finances of the ministry.  I, therefore, was no longer able to go to the national assembly and I had to drop that -- those functions of a member of parliament and focus more on the administrative duties I was given at the ministry of defence.  

I remained in that capacity till 1998.  And, thereafter, following international pressure, the country was urged to draw up budgets which would be defended by -- before the national assembly by each ministry.  So Kagame being president -- or vice-president, rather, felt that he would not have to go to the national assembly to defend the budget, and he asked to be given a secretary of state to defend the budget and that, in his capacity as a boss and vice-president, he could not go to the national assembly to defend the budget.  So I was, for that lone reason, designated secretary of state.  

Then in about 2000, when Kagame became president of the republic -- then it was said that he cannot be minister of defence and president of the republic at the same time, and that is when I was appointed minister of defence.  

What I can say is that there were -- there was pending litigation even at the time I was appointed, litigation going back as far as when I was minister -- when I was director of planning.  What I had started to do at that time was to prepare a draft bill on the -- the -- the strength of the Rwandan forces.  

Why did I engage in this exercise? 

It is because I felt that soldiers were behaving in a disordinate manner.  They would go to the ministry and claim money.  People and their wives would act in various manners which were not appropriate.  And, therefore, I felt it was necessary for a law to be drafted to govern soldiers, commissioned and non-commissioned officers, and their families and various rules dealing with their functions and also rules pertaining to the reintegration of ex-Rwandan armed forces' soldiers.  

This draft law was prepared.  I had prepared it.  And it was forwarded to Kagame, who was minister of defence at the time, and he -- he put it in his drawer and left it there.  As the minister I asked him -- and he still kept the -- the papers in his drawer.  But when I became minister of defence, I decided to forward that draft bill to the council for consideration.  And Kagame was there.  He realised that the law had been forwarded and he couldn't do anything about it.  

So the law was scrutinised.  And the RPF stalwarts objected, and they said, "No.  We cannot allow such a bill to pass."  And others, who were more progressively minded, said that it was a good bill and it, therefore, should pass.  

Now, this had a bearing -- or, in fact, this would have a bearing on the current situation in Rwanda.  

Now, these are the things that I argued.  I said first that everybody must respect the law and must be treated or dealt with according to the terms of the law.  If anybody commits a crime, they will be punished.  If an officer or a -- a commissioned or non-commissioned officer commits a crime, they -- they -- they would have to be punished accordingly.  Now, those who knew that they had skeletons in their closets were recalcitrant.  
Now, I also indicated in the draft bill conditions for becoming an officer.  Soldiers must all be treated in the same manner.  But you know that, before the law was drafted, people were sent to the army even though they did not hold a -- a -- a primary school certificate, and some had benefits because they were French speaking and what have you.  

Now, we were going to include laws that would apply across the board pursuant to the Arusha Accords.  And I was -- I was accused at the time of trying to transform the army into a Hutu army; whereas, that was not my purpose.  All I was seeking was to have a -- an army of the republic that would represent all citizens.  

So these matters became extremely complicated.  

And they wanted to use the acronym APR for the army.  This might be an ordinary looking acronym.  But, you see, you cannot talk about the Rwandan armed forces as such.  The Rwandan armed forces is a terminology that has a negative connotation or bearing on the minds of Tutsis survivors, and that is why they clamoured for the name of the Rwandan armed forces to be eliminated because of the memories connected with -- to -- with that name.  

And so if you look at APR -- the APR, which was the proposed name, then you also have those similar memories.  My fellow people from Byumba, whenever they hear the APR as a -- as a name for the army, they also felt bad and they would have those types of bitter memories.  So there was a discussion and division among persons in government and at the army, but at the end of it all, the name of the army was changed.  

This is what I did in the ministry of defence with all the attendant consequences that led me ultimately to go into exile in early 2003.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, once again, I'll ask you to slow down in the answers that you provide in order to facilitate the translation and the work of the court reporters.  

Now, Mr. Witness, who was the minister of defence when you were director at the ministry of defence? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  Kagame was minister of defence from the time the government was set up on the 17th of July 1994.  And he held that position till May or thereabouts in the year 2000 when he became president of the republic.  So President Kagame had always been minister of defence. 
Q.	Mr. Witness --
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...before he takes the next question, could Mr. Weyl get the new name of the army that the witness claims he participated in suggesting.  
MR. WEYL:
Well, I have no objection to that.  Maybe the witness should tell the Court the name -- the new name of the army that he proposed to replace the FAR and APR.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I do not claim to have created the name, but I simply proposed a name in 
my capacity as minister.  It was the Rwandan defence forces, Forces rwandaises de défense.  The Rwandan defence forces.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Let us proceed with the examination-in-chief.  

One can say that you rubbed shoulders closely with the person who ultimately became president, that is, Mr. Kagame.  You were the general director of the ministry when he was minister.  You were secretary of state in that ministry and you also served as a minister in his government.  

Now, during that period -- during that entire period, did you have an opportunity to meet him and 
to have any discussions with him? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Throughout that period, from the time I became director of planning and he was vice-president at the time, Vice-President Kagame, obviously, I -- I met him when he called for me for technical consultations.  Whenever he needed clarification on any question or any matter, he would call me up.  And whenever I had a proposal like -- such as a draft bill, I would go there to -- I would meet him to discuss the issue.  

I have never been to his home.  I had never gone to his house, but I met him often in his office either to deal with some official matter at his request or upon my request for an audience to deal with any specific matters.  And I also met him when he became president in my capacity as minister of defence. He always granted me an audience whenever I requested to see him.  
Q.	Did you ever have an opportunity to discuss the Rwandan tragedy with him?  And did you ever talk with him about the conditions in which he came to power?  
A.	Well, I do not know whether I ever talked with him about the conditions in which he came to power, but we talked about the Rwandan tragedy several times.  You know, I was aware of the conditions in which he came to power.  I was aware of those, and I do not see why I should have put the question to him.  But we had several discussions on the Rwandan tragedy.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court the thrust -- the -- of your discussions and the comments or observations he may have made to you about his understanding or his analysis or his intentions? 
A.	Well, I am not going to talk about my own presumptions, but what he told me, and what he continues to say even today, is that the RPF is a political and military organisation which went back to Rwanda in order to facilitate the return of Rwandan refugees and also to institute democracy in Rwanda.  That has always been his consistent position up to this day.  

But I made suggestions to him that were contrary to what he was saying.  For example, the theories that I have expatiated -- or the killings in Byumba and what have you.  I talked to him about those things and raised the idea with him that these were the acts of soldiers who were angry and that their families had been killed.  

So I told him, for example, "Mr. President, I am from Byumba.  My family is in Byumba.  Can you quote any Tutsi -- can you tell me about any Tutsi who was killed in Byumba?  Now, if that is not possible, then why did you end up killing all the persons who were gathered at the stadium?"  And whenever we got to that point, he would tell me, "We will talk about that later on."  

I know that I'm not the only one who has put that question to him.  I know that somebody raised that question with him directly at a meeting at the presidency of the republic, because he had the -- the habit of convening authorities from various provinces to the presidency for a meeting.  

Then it came to the term from -- of a judge from a -- a -- a judge in a court in Byumba who was quite elderly, about 75 years old, who asked him, "Now you are the leader of the RPF, we are working for reconciliation.  What do you think about those persons who were killed by the RPF in the stadium in Byumba in my area?" 

I do recall that Kagame was very angry.  He almost called the meeting to a close, and thank God one Kayumba, Déogratias was present.  Kayumba is spelt K-A-Y-U-M-B-A.  Déogratias.  Kayumba, Déogratias was a Josephite Brother, who was Tutsi, and who told him, "Well, Mr. President, I am aware of this problem.  It is a genuine problem."

That man was -- was really a gentleman.  He is still alive, and I think he is a member of the 
Rwandan human rights commission today.  

So at that point he said, "Mr. President, I am very familiar with this problem.  It is a genuine problem, and so give us the time to look into it."  And that is what calmed Kagame down.  And then he called the meeting to a close.  That's an example, among others.  

So we often talked about these things.  And when we came to that particular point, either the discussions ended there or consideration of the issue was deferred to other meetings which never took place.  

So the -- the -- the idea he put forth was that the RPF was a good organisation which had come to facilitate the return of the refugees and to institute democracy.  But when questions were raised to him about the acts of violence of the RPF, he reacted differently.  So in very broad strokes, that is what I can say to you to answer your question.  
Q.	Witness, did you have the opportunity to discuss with Paul Kagame or other personalities the reasons for which they sustained the war for over three months; whereas, they were on the outskirts of Kigali on the 10th and 12th of April? 
A.	Yes.  I'm not the only one.  There are others, members of the RPF, who asked the same question, who said the Tutsis were sacrificed because the RPF had sufficient means to take Kigali in one day.  That they did when they got to Nyacyonga.  

Now, when you asked this question, they said that these -- these are fantasies; that they did what they should have done, that they fought.  It took the time that it should have taken until when, according to him, they stopped the genocide three months on.  That has been his answer.  

Well, quite often they tried to demonstrate the contrary to -- to him, and he does not agree with that.  
Q.	Witness, a while ago you made reference to the manner in which your relatives were killed.  Initially, you ascribed this act to the government, but later on you said you had information indicating that it was the RPF that committed those killings.  Are you able to say a little more about the information you had which led you to that conclusion? 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...we've listened to quite a bit of testimony about the RPF and the shooting down of the plane, and some of it is really marginal to what we are doing in this trial.  And now I think we're really going past the point where it's useful to the Chamber.  

So I would object as this is starting to become a bit irrelevant.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it appears to me that anything that would shed light on the situation within which the RPF committed violence -- violent acts in that period prior to 1994 and ascribing that to the government -- subsequently, I think all that, in my opinion, does not appear to be outside the indictment because that is where we always get argument to support the accusations -- the charges brought against the 
accused persons.  

This, I believe, would shed light on issues that would clarify things for the Chamber.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think there's any allegation in the indictment about killings in Byumba.  And I think that we've been very clear all along that we were not ascribing to the government killings of civilians in the areas in the north of the country that were held by the RPF, which would include Byumba.  That's the only reason I've objected at this point.  
MR. WEYL:
Monsieur le Président, il me semble...

Excusez-moi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we think we should allow the question. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you want me to repeat the question, or are you able to answer directly?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I would wish that the question be repeated.  
Q.	Witness, I was saying that a while -- a little earlier in the morning I was saying that you made reference to the manner in which your relatives were killed and how that was ascribed to the government forces in 1991, and that later on you got information to the effect that it's the RPF that committed those atrocities.  Are you able to say a little more about the information you gathered and what led you to that conclusion? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I become very deeply saddened when I have to answer this question because it's not that I don't want to answer the question, but each time I have to talk about the atrocious manner in which my relatives, members of my family, friends were killed, sometimes it makes me feel as if they were the only ones who died.  

And that's why I'm saying that these deaths that make me sad -- the deaths of my -- of members of my family -- I place that within the context of all Rwandans who were killed for unknown reasons:  Children, elderly persons, women, intellectuals, great leaders who were killed for geopolitical dynamics that we're still grappling with.  

Now, when I have to reduce that to talking about only members of my family, it's a situation that I don't like dealing with most of the time.  

The Prosecutor said that the issues -- the killings of Byumba were not ascribed to the government forces -- forces.  I'm happy to hear that from somebody -- an -- an officer of the ICTR.  At least that's an indication.  

I'm sorry, Mr. President, if I'm going beyond what I'm entitled to do here.  I will stop.  But at least I'm very happy to hear that from an officer of the Tribunal about who committed those atrocities and that there is a possibility of arresting the perpetrators.  That is the first thing.  

Now, since the question has been put to me, even if it's -- even if I feel sad answering that question in that a lot of people were killed, friends and other people that I did not know, when I was living in prison, there was some propaganda going on.  We had spent a full year in prison, and it was being said that, when you're in prison, things did not stop there.  Government forces dispatched people to kill members of your family.  

I had no reason to doubt that at the time, because I was saying that I myself was put into prison.  I was court-martialled, and why would the government not do that?  That was in the heat of the moment after I'd been in prison for a year.  And that was my conviction for about four years.  

But then, in a more determined manner when I became a minister -- a minister of defence, some officers of the RPF, who presented their condolences, unfortunately beginning with the Major Furuma that I mentioned, explained to me in detail how the operation was carried out under the instructions -- the orders of Kagame.  

Bwisige -- Bwisige, that is where I lived.  It's more specifically in a locality called Gihengeri.  Gihengeri is:  Golf India November Golf Echo Romeo India (sic). 

Now, what happened, the RPF, before sending -- carrying out the operation, sent messengers because Kagame -- or at least his mother is a native of my region as well as the queen mother, Rosalie Gicanda.  They're natives of my region.  That means they grew up with my mother.  

And that is one of the reasons why Kagame, when he was a child, together with the mother and father, spent some time in my -- some months in my region when they were fleeing to Uganda.  They found -- they took refuge in my region, and people from my region protected them and led them to Uganda. 

To tell you to what extent the Rwandan issue is complicated -- so Major Furuma was aware of all that, and that is what made him angry.  He said, "I do not see how Kagame ordered that people from that region be killed."  Whereas, these were the people who sheltered him and Furuma went to Uganda later on.  

In Rwisero most of those people, including Tito Rutaremara, when they left after their secondary school education -- and that is what one does not understand, and that is what complicates the Rwandan issue.  

When you look -- when you take Kimenyi, who studied in Rwanda, completed his university studies in Rwanda, had a scholarship to go to the United States -- and who suddenly says, "I'm a political refugee, because the government has taken my rights away."

Now, to come back to the local issue, those are the people who explained to me in detail how the operation was decided by Kagame.  They put them in a truck, ferried them to Cyondo on the pretext that they were going to protect them.  The convoy lasted five days.  As usual, when they had a sufficient number, they machine-gunned them.  

Cyondo is:  Charlie Yankee Oscar November December Oscar.  

That is where they perished under the direct orders of Kagame.  And Furuma and others were categoric that that is exactly what happened.  

And then after that I interviewed some survivors, particularly Tutsis who were coming back, and they told me exactly the same thing.  And that is in relation to this specific incident that I don't like talking about because the scope of the Rwandan tragedy constrains me to think about the killings in general.  
Q.	Witness, I thank you very much for telling the Chamber -- or for telling the Chamber about this touching experience.  

I'm going to ask you and, once again, request you to slow down for the interpretation, to tell the Court if you know other targeted assassinations of political personalities in that period prior to the 6th of April 1994, killings that were ascribed to the MRND, to government forces but which were, in fact, committed by the RPF or upon the instructions of the RPF.  Do you -- are you aware of other such acts?  And if so, tell the Court.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I hope that counsel has gone through our memorandum which we sent to the Secretary General of the United Nations, but since this question has been put to me in this courtroom, I would try to go -- to -- to go back to that.  

Sincerely, I must say in this courtroom that when I heard about the death of Gatabazi, who was the executive secretary of the PSD, when I heard about the death of the president of the CDR, the coalition, Bucyana, Martin, when I heard of Gapyisi, initially, I was convinced that all those killings were committed by a group that is close to President Habyarimana.  

I will not say the MRND because, as I said earlier on, there were honest people in the MRND, people who were friends, and I cannot ascribe this act to them.  What I was saying is that there was some level of propaganda, Mr. President.  
Another weapon that the RPF had was a media weapon.  They had people trained that were propagating certain ideas in a very short time and in a very convincing manner.  So when Gatabazi was killed, I was with one Nyampame.  It was in the evening, around 2000 hours.  And suddenly, there were some people who came and who said the MRND had just killed Gatabazi.  

And believe me -- nobody doubted this, such that the following day there were demonstrations -- spontaneous demonstrations.  People were saying that the MRND is killing political leaders of the country.  This was the same for Bucyana, Martin and Gapyisi.  

All the way to the end of the war, the end of 1994, I was convinced that those political leaders, particularly Gatabazi, who was my friend and who taught me at the university -- he taught me physics at the university -- was a great intellectual that I liked very much.  And I used to say that everything should be done to remove the Habyarimana government.  That is what we used to think.  

The RPF was so organised that it was difficult for us to see things in their right perspective.  But later on I had a discussion with a major of the RPF.  I would request the Chamber's indulgence not to mention his name because it might -- it might be risky for him.  He's still in the country.  He's a general today, and I don't know what may happen to him.  
Q.	Witness, are you able to put that name on a piece of paper, which we will request the Chamber to admit into the records under seal?  Otherwise, we could leave it that way.  
A.	Except if this request comes from the Chamber, I would prefer not to put that name anywhere.  

Before I proceed, I don't know what the position is.  
Q.	If you don't put it on a piece of paper, you -- you may proceed.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  So he told me that the operation was carried out as follows: 

A few days earlier Gatabazi said, "I'm a democrat.  The RPF has to accept democratic rules, in particular, accept to hold open and democratic elections."  It appears that the RPF did not want to hear that.  He was convened to a meeting at the Hôtel des Mille Collines in Kigali.  And during the meeting there were other politicians, particularly from the RPF, including Tito Rutaremara.  

So he was saying that the -- "We have a common enemy, who is Habyarimana.  Let's get rid of him, and then we'll discuss the details later on."  

Gatabazi said, "Persons are not my enemies.  My enemy is oppression, injustice, the absence of democracy, but not personalities.  Now, to eliminate a person unjustly is another thing that I cannot accept."
So when he went home, on his way -- it was planned that he should be killed on his way home.  But when he went home the first time, they had not completed the arrangements, so they called him back a second time.  And while he was at the Hôtel des Mille Collines, they put in place the mechanism to kill him.  And when he got to the -- the gate -- when he got to the gate -- the entrance, he was shot and those who kill -- who shot him left on motorbikes and taxis.  

And that person told me this the first time.  And since I was doubting -- I decided to talk to other persons and carry out investigations, and all investigations carried out so far confirm this assertion.  

This was the same situation because the killers were the same, those who killed Bucyana, those who killed Gapyisi.  And later on I heard that it is the same killers -- and this is something I'm checking right now -- and I heard it is the same killers who killed the Congo -- the Congolese president, Kabila.  And one of the members of that group is the one who went to kill General Nyamwasa in South Africa, which is very unfortunate.  

These are examples that I'm giving.  There are several others.  And if you want other -- others, you can find as many in our memorandum.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Witness, thank you for giving this information.  There's something that I noted incidentally in your testimony -- that is, with the preparation of the killing of Gatabazi, the objective was the killing of President Habyarimana.  Is that what you were telling the Chamber? 
A.	I don't know if that was the objective, but I'm saying that the motives were the same.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Witness, is it these observations -- investigations that you were able to carry out and the difficulties that you encountered that led you to leave Rwanda?  Are you able to speak to that, under what circumstances? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I accepted that and there were even worse than that, attempts -- assassinations attempts.  I'm a soldier, and I can contain most of that, but the worst of all happened at the end of 2002.  

At that time we were trying -- or were making preparations to vote in a new constitution for Rwanda, and then parliamentary elections were going to follow that and then presidential elections.  

The situation became very complicated and -- a lot of intolerance.  As far as I was concerned -- well, for me, in particular, it was suggested as minister of -- it was decided that the minister of defence should go to the RPF, so that if that were to happen, I would be answerable to the RPF and then they can control me.  

So I told them that, "I am a soldier.  Even if I'm a minister, I did not ask to be a minister.  And once my position as a minister is taken away, I'll have to go back to the army and that I'm first and foremost a military man."  That was the first major problem.  

The second problem related to the -- to the council of ministers.  I'm not going to say everything that happened there, but then whatever it is that happened was in the press.  So I'm not saying it -- it wouldn't be a secret.  The issue was to tame -- well, taming -- normally, it shouldn't be a problem because in various countries it's a process that takes place.  

But the problem was -- I was talking about the preparation for elections, but the problem is when you tame people for a certain specific purpose -- it's like you're privatising a coffee plantation.  
A tea -- for example, they said they were going to privatise coffee and tea plantations and the proceeds would go into the elections.  

So that was how the privatisation process was taking place.  So they privatised and they sell to an organisation belonging to the RPF, and the proceeds go to the RPF.  So they privatised various business -- various entities and the proceeds would go to the RPF.  

And they wanted to privatise the Mulindi tea factory where I hailed from.  And I said that, according to the agreement between FED and the local village population, the plantation should remain -- or the property of the -- should revert to the local population after 20 years.  Because each time they sold a kilo of tea, a certain percentage went to the FED.  So the 20 years had elapsed, and the plantation should go to the village people, to the villagers.  

So during a cabinet meeting I told Kagame that the Mulindi tea plantation belonged to the village people and we cannot privatise something that does not belong to the government.  And he said, "No.  The villagers do not know how to manage the plantation."  But they suspended the decision.  I heard later on that the plantation was privatised when I left in 2006. 

Since I didn't go -- go back -- that is the first thing.  And then I said that I will not vote for a constitution which has a provision on a forum of parties because it is unconstitutional.  We were against article 7 of the various -- of the previous constitution, which provides that all Rwandans are members of the MRND.  

So why are we going to introduce another one?  And that was another big problem and so on and so forth.  

So Kagame decided that this minister -- as far as his work is concerned, he does his work properly.  
So "I do not -- I cannot find any way of -- any reason for removing him from his ministry.  So he has to be assassinated."  And that is why I left. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I've concluded with this line of questioning relating to the military career of the witness.  The Chamber would understand why I did not want to start it yesterday because it is through his military career beginning 1977 to 2003 that the person -- or the personality of the witness would shed light on certain issues for the Chamber.  

Mr. President, I think this is the lunchtime and I propose that we adjourn.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The comment I was going to make was that I think we've ruled on a number of occasions that events subsequent to 1994 do not have much relevance in this case.  We are prepared to hear evidence only of events before 1994 as it could provide background information.  

Now, you're not completed with this witness yet?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, after the -- the lunch break, I intend to deal directly with issues relating to the period prior to 1994.  But my understanding that -- is that regarding the testimony of this witness, it is important for the Chamber to hear testimony that he himself was able to gather at the time that he was Mr. Kagame's minister.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't understand you.  You're trying to set him up as an expert giving testimony about research he's conducted, because this should be events that occurred after 1994.  
MR. WEYL:
Not at all, Mr. President.  I'm dealing with the issue of the attack by the RPF against Rwanda, the killings perpetrated that were unjustly ascribed to the government forces.  Some of them were unjustly, unfairly ascribed to government activists.  

So the light that Mr. -- Mr. -- the witness intends to shed on this would demonstrate or clarify facts that are at issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much more time do you anticipate his testimony will take? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the Chamber would realise that regarding the timelines that the Chamber had given in relation to witnesses have been respected thus far -- have been respected with a few exceptions from Mr. Habyarimana.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I simply asked you how much more time you anticipate to have with this witness.  That does not imply any criticism.  Can you give us an indication of how much more time is expected for this witness to be testifying in chief?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I do not think I'll be able to conclude this afternoon.  But I think I -- I would have finished by the -- before the break tomorrow.  We -- for this witness, we requested for six hours in examination-in-chief, and we'll try and stick to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We will take our luncheon recess now.

(Court resumed at 1405H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Weyl.  You may continue. 
MR. WEYL: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, everyone. 
Q.	Witness, I would like to reiterate my request that you should slow down.  I understand that this morning the courtroom reporters were put to the test because your speed -- or, rather, you -- you were so fast.

Witness, have you already testified before the ICTR? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you remember having been interviewed or questioned by the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	Yes, once. 
Q.	You said, "Yes, once."  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is correct. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you remember the context in which you were interviewed? 
A.	I do not know whether I should say so now, but it is certain that I remember the circumstances. 
Q.	Do you remember the period and the -- the purpose of your interview with the officers from the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	Yes, I remember it was in 1999.  But the purpose and content of the interview, I do not know whether it is up to me to say what the purpose of the interview or questioning was. 
Q.	I would like that you invite into court -- so long as the Prosecution does not object -- and please kindly tell us the person about whom you were interviewed.  
A.	Yes, with the authorisation of the Prosecutor, I'm ready to tell you that. 
Q.	Go ahead, Witness.  So long as the Prosecution does not object, it means they have no objection.  
A.	In fact, my testimony was related to Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana. 
Q.	Do you remember what you said, what you told the Prosecutor regarding Mr. Nzabonimana? 
A.	I was asked how we lived together at the ministry of defence and what Mr. Nzabonimana was doing, what I was doing.  In a nutshell, that is what the questioning was about. 
Q.	Was it at the time -- or, rather, was it in connection with the ministry of youth when you were seconded to that ministry?  
A.	Yes, before then I knew him by name.  And after I left the ministry, I no longer saw him again.
Q.	With the assistance of Mr. Issa of the registry, I would like to give you a document and I'll be asking you questions on that document.  
A.	Yes, I'm waiting for the document. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  Can I see the document before it's given to the witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Of course, my learned colleague.  I asked Mr. Issa to give you a copy and also give a copy to the Bench.  It is a document that you had disclosed to us. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I don't know what the question is going to be, but I think we're starting off on the wrong foot by giving the witness his own statement during the course of a direct examination.  Mr. Weyl started off by talking about his interview with the OTP.  I'm not sure if that was an appropriate way to begin the discussion.  If he wants to ask the witness about Callixte Nzabonimana, that's one thing, but to go directly to a document and to what the witness mentioned during an investigation, I think, is not the right way to approach this -- this issue. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I asked the witness whether he had met the Prosecution, if he had given a statement to the Office of the Prosecutor.  The witness said, yes, he gave a statement to the Office of the Prosecutor.  And I asked him whether he could identify the document as being the document which he signed, in order to ask him a few questions regarding what he said concerning Mr. Nzabonimana.  And this matter is of importance to our case. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, that's exactly what I'm objecting to.  If Mr. Weyl wants to ask him about Nzabonimana, that's fine.  But it shouldn't start with a review of the witness's statement.  That's for cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, I think the legal principles are very clear, and we've discussed this in the trial before.  The witness can't see his own statement as part of his examination-in-chief.  It can be used in cross-examination if the purpose is to show that he made a conflicting statement at some previous time.  But his own lawyer can't put the question to him -- can't put a statement to him.
But you can continue with the questions that you're going to ask without showing him the document to refresh his memory.  

Has he seen the document already?  Mr. Issa, can you --  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have the document.  I've already gone through it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see.  

Now, Mr. Weyl, the legal effect of that is that that undermines the testimony of the witness on this subject.  And when we are considering his testimony on this subject, we will take this into consideration and it will be less effective than if he had not gone through this document.

Do you understand that, Mr. Witness?  Under the Rules of Procedure, there are all these special circumstances under which you are permitted to refresh your memory from your own document. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am surprised.  We learn every day.  But I think that the Bench would be more enlightened when they realise where I am heading to.  I would simply like to ask the witness whether he remembers having seen at the ministry young members or militants of the MRND party who came to visit Mr. Nzabonimana and whether the witness in that regard could tell us what the situation was. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness can answer that question. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.

I saw several young people, including the young people of the MRND party.  I saw them come to the ministry of youth.  They came there several times.  And this can be justified perhaps because it was the ministry of youth affairs.  But they were not -- they were not visiting as such.  They were young people who came in groups for demonstrations or to prepare demonstrations.  And for the case in point, since this was during the time when political parties were coming into being, they were young people who were coming to prepare their participation in the events or demonstrations of the MRND political party. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, were they coming to the ministry to undergo training? 
A.	I do not know because the term you have used is not appropriate.  When you talk of training, it depends on the meaning.  But the young people came -- well, the term I would use would be some guidance or some exercises or some rehearsals for their participation in the meetings of political parties or rallies of political parties. 
Q.	What kind of exercises or rehearsals? 
A.	In fact, these were dances, singing, because at that time the political parties put all of this in the context of the movement.  The political parties got into the habit of involving the young people of their parties, beginning with the PL, the Parti libéral, the PSD, the Parti social-démocrate, the MRND and the MDR.  So it is a kind of competition to see which party had many young people -- the party that had young people who could impose their presence by entertaining others.  It was in that kind of context. 
Q.	According to you, were these rehearsals? 
A.	No, we cannot talk of rehearsals as such, because a rehearsal would be something you have to repeat over and over.  Sometimes there were rehearsals.  But on other occasions there were new songs that they had to learn and at other times there were rallies involving young people.  The rallies sometimes would be led by someone who provided guidance to the young people.  In fact, that was the context. 
Q.	Was there any military training given to the young people? 
A.	Military training?  No, that could not be possible because the -- the ministry of youth affairs was located where -- it was in the business district.  It was -- I do not see what term to use, but it was a term borrowed from a businessman, and the premises borrowed were transformed into the ministry.  In any case, the area was not suitable for military training.  Military training could be conducted elsewhere, but not there in the ministry. 
Q.	As far as you can remember, did the young people show up with weapons? 
A.	Yes. I also think that when the Prosecutor asked me that question I answered in the affirmative.  Obviously with time, I tried to distinguish the young people concerned.  Indeed, you could see young people; sometimes you could see some of them with weapons.  But who were they?  

You should always remember that this was a period of war.  This was the period of 1991, 1992, 1993.  It was at that time that I was at the ministry of youth affairs.  You should also remember that it was near a taxi park.  At that time many bombs exploded in taxis.  And, as I was saying, there were cases of infiltration.  According to analyses that were carried out, the research that was conducted, these bombs were placed by RPF infiltrators.  

That means that the armed forces at the time had the power to provide some guidance to young people, especially in groups of meetings.  There were people armed in civilian clothing, unfortunately, so you could not know whether they were soldiers, whether they were infiltrators, whether they were soldiers who were positioned there, whether they were RPF infiltrators.  That, indeed, was the question or the issue.  

But later on -- I apologise to the President who requested that I should restrict my testimony to the period preceding 1994, but since I've been asked a question -- subsequently, following some research carried out, I noticed that most of the young people who were carrying weapons were infiltrators, 
RPF infiltrators.  They wore MRND clothes and they passed for MRND members.  Unfortunately, that was the case. 
Q.	What enabled you to believe that RPF infiltrators wanted to pass for young people or passed for young members of the MRND party? 
A.	Well, the first thing is that, if we go back, according to the investigations we carried out -- if we go back in time, the MRND -- well, as a soldier in the ministry of youth affairs, I didn't have time to think about it.  

But, subsequently, I asked questions about this matter.  And the first question I asked was -- well, according to some information, the question I put to the former minister of youth affairs, Mr. Gasana -- I had heard that he was the person who founded the youth wing of the MRND when he was at the ministry of home affairs or the interior.  When I asked him a question in -- on this matter, he answered in the affirmative.  Out of curiosity, I asked him -- or I sought to know from him why it was said that the youth of the MRND party were young Hutu extremists, even though its president or chairman was a Tutsi.  

I asked him the question in that manner directly.  I was confused on the matter.  He told me, "No, when the MRND was created -- or, rather, the youth wing of the MRND, they, like the MRND -- the MRND is youth who comprised everyone, the Hutus, Tutsi, Twas, people from the north, people from the south, and so on."  So that was the first answer he gave me.  He said that was the reason why that connotation was given by appointing as a head of the youth wing a Tutsi.  

I continued, because I had been told that Gasana was in connivance, just as I also had been accused -- that he was in connivance with the RPF.  Then I told him that, "You are acting" -- "You are conniving with the RPF, and that's why you appointed a Tutsi to head the MRND."  He told me, "No."  He said, "The fact that people say I'm conniving with the RPF, is just a rumour.  I wanted" -- "I wanted to ensure some national cohesion.  But on that basis, this means that, in view of the situation and considering the RPF's determination to come into the country, they used that channel in order to be able to infiltrate the MRND."  Major Furuma is the one who told me that, as I have already told you.

Many other members of the RPF told me that, "Well, even the RPF, which was considered as the youth wing of Hutu extremists, many people who were active had infiltrated it.  They are our agents."  It was information like that which enabled me to accept that what I was hearing was correct. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if the witness could perhaps slow down for more appropriate interpretation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the interpreters have requested that you speak a bit more slowly to facilitate correct interpretation of your evidence. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, mention has been made of the MRND youth wing.  When these young people became known, were there any youth movements of other parties that were active? 
A.	Mr. President, as I was saying, the first youth movement was probably the RPF youth wing.  The RPF from its inception had the idea of creating a youth wing, especially as sometimes the youths -- the youth wing to recruit what was referred to as kadogo.  Kadogo means -- is K-O-D-O-G-A (sic).  Kadogo is a Swahili word which means a young boy.  So these young boys were sometimes used as soldiers.  

So from the inception of the RPF, the RPF had a youth wing.  And in that young wing -- youth wing, rather, they recruited child soldiers.  So that was a third youth wing of a party.  

Now, if my memory serves me right, the second youth wing was that of the MRND party.  And this was under the inspiration, probably, of the RPF youth wing.  

The third youth wing of a party was the liberal party youth wing, the PL party youth wing, and also the youth wing of the PSD.  

All these -- all these parties have youth wings who were some kind of foreigners of meetings of demonstrations during rallies and so on.  They went ahead.  This was not peculiar to the MRND.  The MRND was not the only party that created a youth wing.  In any case, they were not the first to create a youth wing. 
Q.	According to you, the creation of youth -- of the youth wing of the MRND, did it have a criminal objective?  Was its objective to exterminate the Tutsi? 
A.	What I would tell you, since you have asked the question, in my opinion -- I wasn't there, but in my opinion, and following what I saw, at least initially, this youth wing was a youth wing like any other youth wing.  

What -- at some point in time, I remember that the youth of the MRND, the PSD, the MDR, the PL, and so on, under the instigation of the bishop of Kabgayi, who unfortunately was murdered, alongside other bishops, he wanted to invite -- invite all the young people of all these -- all the representatives of these youth wings to a seminar, which I believed lasted about two weeks.  

The MRND youth wing, the MDR youth wing, the FPR -- RPF youth wing, the PSD youth wing, the PL youth wing, all these youth movements were gathered there.  In fact, this was a way of ensuring some peaceful coexistence among youth movements and this gives us the impression that the youth wings were not meant to be armed or to be used for hostilities. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can I ask you once more to speak a little bit slowly to ensure some self-discipline as a soldier in order to maintain an even modest pace.  Because it would appear that the translators -- or, rather, the interpreters and the courtroom reporters are having some difficulties recording your testimony.

Witness, were you aware -- or, rather, did you personally notice military training of young people of the MRND party, or did you hear of such training, military training, that is, the military training of the young people of the MRND? 
A.	Noticed personally?  No.  But according to some propaganda or rumours, we heard about that.  And when we sought to know where the training was taking place -- well, when I was at the ministry, it was said that young people were given training as Gabiro.  

When -- as I was saying before, when I was appointed to Gabiro, the first question I asked, and the first thing I wanted to find out, was to see whether indeed there was a training centre for these young people in Gabiro.  I put the question to the sector commander, asked him whether there are young people being trained here, in particular, the young people of the MRND.  He told me, "You are an esprit.  You can go everywhere and you will see for yourselves."  

I did not see anything of the sort.  And I did not hear anything that could make or give me the impression that there was training, military training, given to young people in that area.  That is to show me that there were rumours -- there were false rumours spread here and there, but the reality was different. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to ask you the same question.  How about the distribution of weapons to the young people of the MRND party? 
A.	Mr. President, I do not know whether questions are always asked about the young people of the MRND party, the distribution weapons to the young people of the MRND.  Personally, I did not witness the distribution of weapons to any youth movement.  Personally, I did not see that. 
Q.	Witness, as far as you are concerned, what do you think of what was referred to as the Interahamwe from the 6th of April 1994?  And does it -- Interahamwe, does it mean anything to you? 
A.	Mr. President, it must have some meaning to me because, as we hear, here and there, Interahamwe must have some meaning to whoever is concerned by the Rwandan conflict.  

The Interahamwe, as I had said before, were created at the end or the beginning of 1992 with the emergence of multiparty politics.  The Interahamwe was the name given to the young -- youth of the MRND party.  Since -- just like you had the Inkuba, I believe that was the youth movement of the MDR party, that the PSD youth wing was called Abakombozi.  The youth wing of the PL, I do not remember their name, but probably they had another name.  

Youth movements always sought to give themselves appropriate names.  Interahamwe is a Kinyarwanda word which means people who work together.  It is a word which had existed well before in the history of Rwanda.  Because King Kigeli in 1959 had a movement of young people called Interahamwe za mwami.  Za mwami.  Za mwami  is the king.  It is an historical name.  I do not know whether the MRND youth movement took that name for that reason to indicate that we are people who are together.  I do not know whether that was the reason why they took on that name.  But in any case that was the name given to that youth movement and which has -- signifies something noble in normal circumstances.  Interahamwe is a name that was given to the youth movement of the MRND initially, and that was since its inception.  
Now, the question put to me, whether the Interahamwe from the 6th of April were the same, whether they could be given the same name.  In answer to that question I would say no.  Why do I say no?  Because before the 6th of April -- moreover, even those who say today that the Interahamwe were killers, murderers, and so on, this could not be seen in the population.  In most -- among most people this was not the view.  

This came into being with -- or, rather, shortly before the 6th of April with the death or the murder of the Burundian president, Melchoir Ndadaye.  As you know, he had just been elected -- first elected president -- democratically-elected president.  He was assassinated.  I do not want to go into the circumstances -- circumstances of his assassination.  I said a few words about this before.  

His assassination had repercussions in Rwanda, especially among young people, because it is an assassination that triggered a series of cases of violence in Burundi.  And Burundi is a neighbouring country.  

In Burundi, the young people of the MDR, the young people of the PSD and other parties, started saying, "Well, there is a risk.  There is a general risk for everyone."  They did not come together, but that feeling was there.  This means that there was some kind of transformation generated by the violence in Burundi.  So the concept was the young people started having these violent feelings.  That is the first stage.  

The second stage -- as I was saying, when the RPF started bombing camps of displaced persons in Nyacyonga -- I believe I've already spelled Nyacyonga -- the young people who survived -- let us mention in passing, Nyacyonga had about 100,000 war-displaced persons, and maybe more.  So the young people who survived said, "Well, we are coming from the north.  At the border we moved under the threats of the RPF.  Some of us were killed.  Now the displaced camps" -- "the camps of displaced persons is being bombed.  That means that there is an attempt to exterminate us."  

So these young people instinctively joined other young people in Kigali, young people of other parties.  It was not just the young people of the MRND.  In fact, all the young people -- because after the 6th there was no longer any distinction between the young people of the MRND and the young people of other parties.  In any case, there was no event taking place.  There were no rallies.  Everyone tried to survive.  

It is this escalation in violence which leads me to say, well, the Interahamwes as they existed before, who constituted the youth wing of the MRND party, cannot in any circumstances whatsoever be considered as the Interahamwe after the 6th, because after the 6th it was young people of 
various origins.  

We should also mention in passing that among these young people, as I said before, there were young people -- young infiltrators of the RPF party.  So this amalgamation, it must be borne in mind, and it was given publicity in the media -- in fact, all these young people now came to be known as the Interahamwe and today they are being considered as genocide perpetrators.  

I do not know whether I've answered your question properly. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  You have just testified that the young people who were collectively referred to as the Interahamwe after the 6th of April, among those youths were also RPF activists.  Did you have any evidence that previously they were members of the RPF?  
A.	Well, if you're asking me to call somebody to this box to testify in that regard, I may not be able to do so.  However, what I can say is that the RPF used the tactics of infiltration, and this has already been demonstrated even before today.  

So I was able to come to that conclusion because people of the RPF themselves said so and continued to maintain that position.  

If you look at all the documents, beginning with the one written by Furuma, he deals with this matter in depth and talks about how the RPF infiltrated, how they went to the roadblocks, how they pushed people on, and how they appeared to be Interahamwe youth.  And these are statements that have been made by former RPF members.  I, therefore, do not have any reason to doubt the -- the veracity of statements made of former RPF members.  

Let me also add that additional evidence is something that I experienced in Gitarama, spelled G-I-T-A-R-A-M-A.  I was present at a Gacaca court session once in Gitarama.  And I believe that you're all familiar with that word and I do not need to spell the word.  

During the Gacaca court proceeding we usually sent policemen or soldiers, some in military attire and others in civilian attire, to supervise or monitor the Gacaca proceedings.  Unfortunately, on that particular day there was a soldier in attendance bearing a weapon.  And when the proceedings began, the population said, "Oh, this is an Interahamwe."  But he was a Tutsi soldier.  So the population jumped upon this man, and we could see the population pointing out that individual as the person who coordinated killings at a roadblock.  

The soldier was taken away to Kigali by other soldiers and -- to Kigali.  But this was a soldier of the former RPA.  And that is evidence of infiltration, even as far as the roadblocks that were set up at the time.

1445H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry to interrupt.  The witness gave a name -- named someone as his source and I missed it in the interpretation.  If it could be elicited again, please.  He was mentioning an RPF person who provided information about infiltration. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I mentioned Major Furuma.  Furuma, it's a name which I had spelt before, and I felt that the 
	honourable Prosecutor may have taken note.  But let me spell out the name again.  Furuma is spelt F-U-M -- rather, F-U-R-U-M-A.  Furuma. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  And I would like to ask you to be more specific as to the time frame when that Gacaca court session took place in Gitarama.  
A.	In Gitarama, that was around 2006.  I do not clearly recollect the month, but it must have been in 2006, because -- I remember because it was quite a scandalous situation that was broadcast, so to speak, worldwide. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, regarding the military situation obtaining at that time, that is, prior to the Arusha Accords, in your testimony you referred to some imbalance.  According to you, would it have been legitimate to organise a civil defence movement at that time? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Civil defence is a defence system, like other defence systems.  When I was at the war school I remember that we spent six months studying civil defence systems.  This is an international system applicable across the world -- in the United States, in Europe, in Rwanda, and in Africa -- wherever there is conflict.  It is a system, as other systems, that can be implemented.  If we take Europe, for example, you would note that the civil defence system is quite diversified in its application. 

Now, where or when there is war -- for example, the war in Rwanda in 1994, there were four battle fronts.  I also talked about guerilla warfare, which uses tactics of infiltration and other acts of terrorism and acts of violence against the population by laying mines, burning down banks and public facilities, and what have you, by laying mines in -- or explosives in buses, attacking strategic areas at night, and what have you, in that context, any government which is faced with guerilla warfare ordinarily should organise a defence system.  Because, you see, we are no longer looking at conventional warfare here, and this is exactly what happened in Rwanda. 

You see, in 1994 we had four battle fronts, and the armed forces that were pitted against each other were in an asymmetrical situation.  You see, it was not possible for the civil defence movement to be properly organised for the reason that the resources were not available.  

Elsewhere, when such a system is set up, the necessary resources are provided for control of various areas or control of various itineraries, positioning, and what have you.  So it is a defence system that is legally recognised above everything else.  And I believe that the Rwandan law also provides for this through what is known as the local defence force system and which is applied. 

Now, the question which may come to mind then is the following:  What is the mission of the civil defence movement whenever it is set up?  The simple answer to your question, therefore, is that it is legal to organise a civil defence system, and this is provided for by international law. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you for your answer.  Before the 6th of April 1994, was there a civil defence system in place in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  As far as I know, yes.  Particularly at the height of the October attack, a civil defence was put in place.  When the attackers went through, they looted the banks; they burnt down the communal offices, and so people were called upon to organise themselves in order to protect their property and protect their communes, and what have you.  So a civil defence system was set up and implemented at that time. 

Now, with the Arusha Accords, focus shifted to peace and that led to a reduction of the system.  And, in fact, towards the end of the year 1990, the so-called civil defence system at that time was more or less inexistent. 
Q.	Now, maybe I didn't put the question properly, but my question was -- as you corrected yourself when you answered in relation to the attack of October 1990.  So thank you very much for answering the question specifically to -- with reference to the period of October 1990.  My own question was not as clear as your answer, and I thank you for that. 

Now, Mr. Witness, from 1992 to '93 to '94, were you aware that the enemy was identified -- in fact, as far as you know, was the enemy identified? 
A.	I thank you for that question.  It is a question which -- over which many do not agree.  It is true that the enemy was identified.  The enemy was somewhat known.  But if your question is -- and I don't know whether I should provide a technical answer to your question from a military point of view, or should I simply testify as to what I saw?  

Now, Mr. President, I don't know how to proceed, but I could provide a technical answer and I could go in depth into this whole concept of the enemy. 
Q.	Now, without delving too much into details, give us some idea, both in scope and depth, as to what you understood and what you experienced.  
A.	Well, the concept of the enemy, to be properly understood, needs to be clearly explained, otherwise we end up with the kind of problems we are experiencing today.  As I have already said, the enemy -- well, given -- particularly in my case where I was accused of collaborating with the enemy.  You see, at the international level, when reference is made to an enemy, it must be a foreign power, a foreign country that has attacked another country. 

Now, as for the Rwandan conflict, it was an internal -- intra-internal conflict.  That is, although the RPF came from Uganda, as nature would have it, and in spite of the international dimension, government was brought to understand that the RPF was a political and military organisation in Rwanda.  So that was taken as such, and those facts stand. 

The enemy of the government forces was identified as the RPF; the political and military organisation known as the RPF.  And that was the specific definition of the enemy, and it is with that enemy that the Arusha Accords were negotiated. 

Now, when we talk about the enemy, we may also want to find out who is supplying weapons and ammunition to the so-called enemy.  And by extension, that hand behind the enemy could also be defined as the enemy.  So in Rwanda's case, because the RPF was assisted, supported by Uganda, then, by extension, Uganda could also be identified as being the enemy of the Rwandan government. 

But the Rwandan government stopped short of identifying Uganda as an enemy.  Uganda instead was called upon to intervene as a mediator; whereas, those forces came from Uganda, and that is the whole complexity of this matter that is to difficult to explain. 
Q.	During the time when reference was made to the enemy, when politicians used the word "enemy", could there have been any misunderstanding as to who or what they were referring to?  Could it be mistaken -- or, could the Tutsis have been mistaken for the enemy? 
A.	No, no.  There couldn't have been any misunderstanding whatsoever, because the enemy is a strategic assessment made by the general staff of a country.  It is not a suggestion.  It is a matter of a clear definition.  Otherwise things cannot move.  If you don't identify your enemy, you cannot engage in war.  You will engage in a counter-war, and that is why it is always necessary for the enemy to be properly defined. 

In Rwanda, the enemy was identified as the RPF, a political, military organisation.  And that was essentially the enemy as identified.  

Then government, as all governments would have done, had to stop the RPF from recruiting, had to avoid any acts of violence that went beyond that specific definition of the enemy.  So, as far as the Government of Rwanda was concerned, the enemy was defined as the RPF, the 
political, military organisation that bore that name. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, as far as you know, and in view of your own observations, during the period prior to the 6th of April 1994, was there a desire to exterminate Tutsis as such?  Was there any call by political leaders for Tutsis to be eliminated?  Or was there any call to hatred of the Tutsi? 
A.	Mr. Witness, that question is very complex and delicate, but I will attempt to answer it all the same.  The RPF's strategy, as I was saying, was to escalate violence.  

Now, I had earlier explained that after the president's plane, President Habyarimana's plane was brought down, and he died with his director of cabinet, with the chief of staff and the chief of the Presidential Guard and ministers who had travelled with him, this amounted to a decapitation of the state of the country.  That's the first point. 

Secondly, the RPF directly launched attacks at those fronts which I referred to, and even went as far as shelling camps of displaced people and displacing youth from those camps who then were scattered all over the place without any guidance or any control.  And they became in turn a threat for the population. 

Now, let us even go as far as saying that when Habyarimana's plane was brought down by the RPF, this Tutsi political, military organisation, some persons began to argue that the Tutsis have now started bombing the camps; they are shelling the Presidential Guard.  And so an anti-Tutsi sentiment developed within the population, unfortunately. 

Now, since there were no supervisory structures, no control mechanisms in place, and given that this was no longer conventional warfare, and the security and gendarmerie facilities were no longer in place, it was difficult to proceed otherwise than by a ceasefire.  The government asked for a ceasefire, but the RPF did not respond positively. 

So what happened is that those youths who left the camps, who were wandering about, and who, from the very onset of the war in 1990 -- imagine that the Presidential Guard battalion had been attacked, its commander had died, and we also need at least to recognise the fact that this battalion was, to a large extent, made up of persons from Habyarimana's area, and he was the president, and we need to make that point as well.  

So the president was killed, the chief of staff was killed, all of them from the same area.  The director of cabinet was dead, from the same area.  The commander of the Presidential Guard, from the same area, has also been killed.  So what happened was that most of the soldiers had hailed from the same area, and some other soldiers from Kigali who had been working, even in the administration, were natives of the same area, and they became frightened because they felt that they would be exterminated. 

So when the killings started in the early days, those people who were extremely frightened -- now, with the leave of the President, let me inform this Court that the very first killings were not targeted at Tutsis.  The first killings were targeted at Hutu leaders, and that is why the context was one in which the first person who died was the president of the supreme court, Kavaruganda.  May his soul rest in peace.  He was a well-loved man by all persons.  I knew him personally.  He was my professor.  He was the first person to die, and he was Hutu.  

Then the next was Nzamurambaho, minister of agriculture.  He was Hutu.  And then another one who died was the prime minister, Uwilingiyimana, Agathe.  She was Hutu.  Ngulinzira, who was killed in Kanombe, was Hutu.  

So the escalation towards the killing of Tutsis only began when those who had been shelled at the camps for displaced persons, working with soldiers of the Presidential Guard, who no longer had a leader who could control them, when they felt targeted and feared that they would be exterminated, that is when, alongside the infiltration of the RPF, the escalation began.  And so they clamoured for the Hutus to defend themselves.  

I don't know why they did so, but I have been told and it has been written in a number of documents how people were rallied to move in this manner.  Because when they left those camps for displaced persons, the RPF moved along with them, and reference was made to the fact that Tutsis were part of this, and so there was a rally to (sic) hatred against the Tutsi.  And that is where there was a transformation away from murdering the politicians who were suspected of collaborating with the RPF to killing the Tutsis for the reasons I have just mentioned. 

And I think this point needs to be made clearly.  Tutsis were massacred.  I talked about this.  I saw it myself.  And the Tutsis were killed by those people who were angry.  Once they were identified as Tutsis, they were killed immediately.  And the armed forces at some point were overwhelmed and were wondering whether they should remain in their positions, because they even shot at some persons.  But the atmosphere was rather confused. 

Now, your question as to what I think, the answer I can provide is that, yes, there was loss of control over these young people.  The republican guard had lost its leadership and their command and could not be controlled.  The RPF had attacked their camp, and this is what led to that confusion of matters, including the infiltrations by the RPF.  These, to my mind, are the factors that contributed, unfortunately, to the killings of the Rwandan people, particularly of Tutsi ethnicity. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Witness, according to the Prosecution case, and to lend credence to the idea of the preparation of genocide, genocide of Tutsi, it is said that hoes and machetes were imported, which hoes and machetes were used to implement the plan to eliminate Tutsis.  Do you have any comments on that?  And if yes, can you share those comments with the Court.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  It is difficult for a Rwandan in a position of responsibility, if we have to deal with the death of many people, people who died unjustly, it becomes difficult to talk about things which apparently seem to be trivial.  To say that hoes and machetes were imported for the murder of many people seems to me to be a joke.  Why?  Because Rwanda is a country where hoes and machetes have always been used and are continued to be used today.  They are still being imported for the small farmers to use.  That is the first observation. 

The second, I heard about the importation of these implements and I was angered by that rumour, because people run away from this truth inasmuch as I know it.  In the Rwandan constitution, it is clearly written, black on white, and this was included in the accords at the request of the RPF, and the RPF, of course, write that this be included in the accords.  It was said that hundreds of thousands of refugees would have to return and that it was necessary for them to find agriculture implements on the spot.  It is in that context that this point was mentioned in the Arusha Accords; namely, that the government, before the refugees returned, had to buy machetes, hoes and other implements to be used by small farmers. 

Following that, a bid for tenders was made, an official bid for tenders.  And the tender was awarded to some people, as always.  And those people imported hoes and machetes.  

In fact, what is even surprising is that the hoes referred to were still at Magerwa after the 6th.  So if hoes and machetes were used, it was the hoes and machetes which had been bought before, not those referred to now in this case, because those hoes were taken from the warehouse by the RPF when they took over certain areas. 

Unfortunately, even in the presence of so many people who died, people tend to trivialise certain points, and this is what I had to say on this matter.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Witness, in our case file -- and this has been -- these documents have been admitted for the time being.  We have - in our case file we have the Arusha Accords.  I have an excerpt of this accord, which is called: Protocol of the Agreement Between the Government of Rwanda and the RPF on the Repatriation of Rwandans.  This is document D. NG85, A for the French and B for the English.  

MR. WEYL: 
With the assistance of Mr. Issa, can this document be shown to the witness for him to tell us whether this is what he was referring to. 

Perhaps to make the work easier for Mr. Issa, I have the document before me. 

Mr. President, the difficulty is that, once more, I do not have the same page numbering in the 
official document and the one disclosed to me. 

Yes, Mr. President, I have it now.  It starts with K0209167.  
(Pages 49 to 55 by Joe Reynosa)



























1515H 
MR. WEYL: 
The difficulty -- and I apologise for that -- is that I am working with the signed version of the Arusha Accords as they were disclosed to us and the document admitted into evidence is an unsigned transcript. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you have before you now the document in question and the page on where we have at the right -- okay -- 0209167 at the top right-hand corner -- K0209167 at the top right-hand corner? 
A.	Yes.  I have that document and that page. 
Q.	And it is the portion referring to the protocol agreement between the government of Rwanda and the RPF regarding the repatriation of Rwandan refugees and reinstallation of displaced persons; am I correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you -- now, if you can, go to article 10.  Following the numbering of the articles, go to article 10 and read, in particular, the first sub-paragraph and point number 6 and confirm to the Court whether this corresponds to what you said regarding -- what you said regarding -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel didn't complete his statement. 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Can you read it into the record, please.  
A.	I am going to read point 6. 
Q.	Yes.  Please do.  
A.	"Supervise all forms of assistance to those repatriated, for example, providing food aid, agricultural implements, building materials, household goods, seedlings, and so on and so forth." 
Q.	Can you also go to article 15 below what you just read and read into the record what has -- what is written.  
A.	"Assisted by the international community, the government of Rwanda will help those repatriated in the following areas:  Food aid, household goods, agricultural implements, building materials, health, education, and so on." 
Q.	Can you also read article 18.  
A.	"The programme for settling those repatriated will also have a set of agricultural implements, seedlings -- selected seedlings that are appropriate for the region so as to enable those repatriated agriculturers -- or farmers and livestock breeders to start agricultural activities as soon as possible." 
Q.	Can you also read below article 35 the title, chapter 2.  
A.	The title of chapter 2, "Return of war-displaced persons and social disorder.  Section 1, preparatory measures". 
Q.	Can you please read article 43.  
A.	"Humanitarian aid will comprise food aid, household goods, agricultural implements, building materials, health care, medication." 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Perhaps you should also read article 42.  That's above 43.  
A.	"Humanitarian aid will be distributed by the secretary of state for rehabilitation and social integration with the assistance of humanitarian organisations." 
Q.	Witness, when in the Arusha Accords reference was made to agricultural implements, what was the understanding in Rwanda? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  In Rwanda, unfortunately, these are the implements we still use.  We do not have tractors.  We use hoes.  But before the use of hoes, in the past we used sickles or took lances or -- and machetes.  Not only do we use this as agricultural implements but also for building, for example, to cut or fell wood.  You cannot build in Rwanda -- a small farmer cannot build in Rwanda without the use of a machete. 
Q.	Witness, at the time the Arusha Accords were being implemented or were accepted or put in place, how many refugees were there, refugees whose return had to be ensured, and how many dis -- war-displaced persons were there who had to be resettled, in a descending order of numbers? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  We should be talking about 1 million refugees who had to return to Rwanda.  Then war-displaced persons, at least at the end of 1993, were estimated at about 2 million.  
Q.	Witness, the implementation of the Arusha Accords and annex 5 thereto, relating in particular to the provision of agricultural implements and agricultural materials, could this have led to the import of considerable numbers of hoes and machetes? 
A.	Of course.  I share the view of those who were in Arusha and who signed this agreement.  It was normal because the refugees who were coming from abroad did not have hoes nor machetes, yet they had to build houses, do farming.  

The same applied to displaced persons.  After several years of moving about, they no longer had property.  Many houses had been burnt down.  And this could be explained.  In fact, it was a duty to import a huge number of hoes and machetes. 
Q.	Importing hoes and machetes in a considerable number amounted to preparing genocide, or did it fall within the context of implementing the Arusha Accords? 
A.	It was rather implementing the Arusha Accords.  This is simple to understand. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Witness, do you know the person sitting next to me, Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Perhaps if he stands up.  Can he stand up so that I can see him.  I cannot see him from where I am sitting.  I cannot see him from where I am sitting. 
Q.	I think, for the purposes of the record, it's been acknowledged that the person sitting to my right is Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Did you know him whilst you were in Rwanda?  And if yes, can you tell the Court the context or the circumstances under which you knew him. 
A.	Mr. President, allow me to come back a little.  I think I should see him first.  That is my wish.  I should see him first for me to acknowledge that he is indeed the person. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, can the Court authorise Mathieu Ngirumpatse to stand up. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, your manner of dealing with this ensures that we can attach no weight to any identification.  You have already told the witness who is Mathieu Ngirumpatse and where he is sitting.  So to ask him to identify him now means nothing.  But let him -- let him stand up. 

The witness now asks to say he'd like to see him to identify him.  But Mr. Weyl has already said he's the person sitting next to him.  So what's the point?  

Let -- let him look -- let the witness look anyway.  

Stand up, Mr. Witness, and look. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you once more, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, apart from identifying Mathieu Ngirumpatse in this courtroom, did you know him before?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Once more, if I requested that Mathieu Ngirumpatse stand up for me to see him -- well, I respect the Court entirely.  And I have no doubt as to what the Court is saying.  

How -- however, recently, people have been talking about some plastic surgery or things to that effect.  When one has the opportunity of being on the spot, of -- of being present, you have to verify what you have heard.  

So, Counsel, please, can you repeat your question. 
Q.	Yes.  Witness, do you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, I do.  First of all, I knew him when I was a child.  I knew him -- without having seen him, I knew him through the songs he composed.  I knew him through other persons who knew him who said that he was a good person, a person who worked hard, who composed songs in the church and the other areas.  We sang his songs.  They were beautiful songs.  

Furthermore, I was saying that I went to school in Ruyendo (sic), and I come from Byumba.  The proximity of that area enables me to know him even if he did not know me.  
Now, as to know him physically by sight, yes, I knew him, when -- especially when I was an officer.  I saw him from time to time.  I also met him -- I met him especially in the nineteen -- in 1992, I believe.  When he passed by, I saw him.  And when he also took over his dutos -- his duties, we heard it being said that he was elected executive secretary of the MRND, that the president of the MRND had been elected.  So we had to be aware of these facts or events.  

Therefore, regarding his work, his social work, his songs, I knew him very well.  Even before seeing him, I knew him since I was a child.  By sight I saw him from time to time, and I would greet him from a political and administrative standpoint as a citizen who followed political matters of the country.  Even if I did not belong to any party, I, nevertheless, was aware of the duties or the positions of the major leaders of the party. 
Q.	Witness, you talked about Eden Garden.  At Eden Garden -- did you have the opportunity of going to that institution? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  It was not only once.  I went to Eden Garden several times.  Eden Garden was a cafe -- pleasant cafe.  I went there often.  I went there several times.  
Q.	As far as you can remember, who were the customers?  Were the -- were the customers mainly from one ethnic group? 
A.	This, in fact, is a complex -- a difficult question.  When I went there, I was not seeking to know which -- who came from which ethnic group.  

But what I can say is that the friends I met there -- well, when we took appointments, we took appointments of our friends.  Our friends came from everywhere.  I had Hutu friends.  I had Twa friends.  I had Tutsis friends.  In fact, many of them were Tutsis.  

So when we met at Eden Garden, we met with everyone.  And those I met there were sometimes Hutus, Tutsis.  The cafe was a pleasant place where you could meet everyone.  

In fact, the manager of the cafe was a Tutsi, a well-known Tutsi in Rwanda.  So no one can say that it was a cafe which was visited mainly -- only by people from one ethnic group. 
Q.	Witness, you said that at the time referred to the manager of that cafe was a well-known Tutsi in Rwanda.  To enlighten the Court, can you specify who that well-known Tutsi in Rwanda was, the Tutsi who was manager of Eden Garden.  
A.	If my memory serves me right, I think it was the father of Jeannette Kagame, the current president -- the first lady of Rwanda, the current first lady of Rwanda.  It was her father who managed that cafe, of course, with her assistance. 
Q.	Witness, you made reference to the political activities of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Did you have the opportunity of listening to any speech that he made? 
A.	To be candid, I did not have the opportunity of hearing his speech, but I think that, even if I heard his speeches, they must have been speeches related to social matters. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, perhaps a last question before we break up for the day.  I can see the time.  I have a last question on this last -- but one line of questioning.  And tomorrow I'll have another line of questioning on which I will concentrate my efforts. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you talked about your region -- your -- your region where Mathieu Ngirumpatse also comes from.  You talked about your awareness of Mathieu Ngirumpatse as a public figure in Rwanda, the Rwanda of 1992 through 1994.  What is Mathieu Ngirumpatse's reputation? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I was saying, we knew him when we were children.  He was somebody considered to be pious, who went to Mass, who went to church, who prayed, who composed hymns in church.  He was a sociable person.  Nobody could deny that.  He made -- he had a wide circle of friends and from all social structure as well as all ethnic groups.  He was a -- somebody considered to be intelligent who organised his work properly and who did his work properly.  

In particular, he was a democrat.  He -- he was a man who knew people's rights.  From all that I was able to observe, he was somebody who stood for human rights, the rule of law, individual law -- individual freedoms and so on.  This is what I can say in a few words about him. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, let's look at the clock -- the wall clock.  I think -- well, the decision is up to you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Well, we take the -- the adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1535H)
