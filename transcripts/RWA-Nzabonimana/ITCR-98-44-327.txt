P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 14th April 2008, for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, there is a slight change on our side.  My colleagues Hounkpatin and Weyl are not there.  Mr. Weyl will be coming shortly, but in the meantime, I will be responsible for holding brief for his client, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, with his agreement, of course. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Also, Mr. President, Mr. Nimy, my co-counsel, has now joined us in person here in Arusha, and also our investigator, Daniel Ntawumenyumunsi, has now arrived and is now joining us.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I had forgotten to point out also that my investigator was involved in a terrible accident on Saturday.  He was in hospital, so we are deprived of that important member.  But I can tell you right now that regarding his personal health, he is recovering, and we expect him to make a greater progress.  Because when you really see the vehicle, there are many questions that can be asked, but I believe that he will be much better soon.  And that was the unfortunate incident that we had in our team. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
And we regret that and we hope that he has a speedy and complete recovery.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I mention, for Your Honours' assistance, Your Honours may recall that there was an enquiry set in motion in respect of the BDW letter of the 20th of December of 2002, and Your Honours had hoped that we might have the letter by this morning.  The Kibuye prison has closed and has been, I think, knocked down.  All the records have been moved elsewhere, and we are still in the process of looking to see what was filed at the prison in 2002.  I may have further information later this afternoon when one of our investigators returns from Kigali. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

Mr. Witness, we continue with your testimony this morning.  Your cross-examination will continue.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning. 
WITNESS BTH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, mwaramutse.  Amakuru ki?  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I am doing fine. 
Q.	When we left off on Thursday you had provided the name of the person representing the prosecutor general who had come to Ruhengeri prison and had a conversation with you about confession and accusing others.  Now, can you tell us -- turning your attention to that conversation that you had with the representative of the prosecutor general, whose name is on Exhibit D. NZ458, can you tell us what he said to you during that conversation? 
A.	It was a representative of the prosecutor general at the court of appeal.  He told me that I had to plead guilty and make a confession.  And in order for my confession to be accepted, I had to accuse all the authorities who were supposed to have incited us to perpetrate those crimes, and this was the criterion for the confession of a detainee to be accepted.  He told me what had been explained before at the prosecutor's office, so he told me that I could accept to become a witness to tell the truth and to come and testify before this Arusha Tribunal.  

He explained to me that the Accused persons detained in Arusha were those who were really responsible for what had happened.  He added that we were not the ones who had really committed those crimes, that it was the accused people in Rwanda (sic) who were responsible.  He told me to reflect on it, and he told me that the director of the prison was going to assist me.  He also told me that I could get back to him with an answer subsequently.  
Q.	And what did you say to that?  
A.	I had not yet made my decision, so I did not give him a conclusive answer.  I had been accused of preventing other prisoners from pleading guilty.  I knew that that individual, the prosecutor of the republic -- of the prosecutor general and the director of the prison were accusing me of those crimes.  I felt that I would be punished.  And following those accusations against me that I was preventing the other prisoners from pleading guilty, I felt I would be punished.  I was given the names of other witnesses who had already been contacted, and I was told that later on I would inform the director of the prison of my decision. 
Q.	Now, during this conversation with the representative of the prosecutor general, did you understand that he was asking you to lie or asking you to tell the truth? 
A.	He dwelled at length on what the deputy prosecutor had told me, that is, the deputy prosecutor at the Ruhengeri prosecutor's office had already spoken with me.  So he told me to think about it and make a decision to accuse the persons detained in Arusha.  So he told me to reflect on the matter and give him an answer later.  He explained to me that if I wished to be released from prison, I should do that so that my sentence should be reduced and I would be freed.  
Q.	But I'm wondering whether or not this prosecutor general who you were speaking with, was he indicating to you that he believed that you knew -- you had information against these authorities, truthful information, that you could give, or was he asking you to lie about these authorities?  What was your understanding about that? 
A.	The fact of the matter is that it was the same thing that the deputy prosecutor had told me.  He was asking me to fabricate information and to corroborate what the other witnesses were going to say here.  If those people had known that I had any information, they were going to simply ask me for that information, instead of asking me to repeat what the other witnesses had said, that is, the witnesses who had cooperated with those authorities.  So he asked me to corroborate the testimony of the other witnesses who had already testified before this Tribunal.  

Furthermore, when the witnesses have information, they come to you and they would come and talk to you as if you had also been a witness.  So they knew that I was not aware of that information.  They simply wanted me to repeat information that was not mine.  It was a way of asking me to tell a lie.  And that is why I'm saying these were lies because most of the information given to me concerned things that never happened, so I had to come and confirm or corroborate all the lies that had been told before this Tribunal.  I realised that many of those incidents had never happened at all.  But given that these were authorities telling me to do this, I consented to do it while, at the same time, knowing that it was not reality. 
Q.	After your meeting with the prosecutor general's representative, what was the next step that you took to decide whether or not to join the group of confessors and accusers?  
A.	I contacted my co-detainees, that is, the witnesses who were coming to testify before this Tribunal or who had already testified, and they explained to me exactly what the procedure was.  I do recall that the witnesses reported our discussions to the director of the prison, who, in turn, reported to the prosecutor general.  So there was a channel of transmission.  I spoke with the other detainees.  And the director of the prison summoned later.  He told me that he had explained my situation to the prosecutor general but that the prosecutor general had not fully understood.  And he told me that he was advising me to accept what was being proposed to me, because that was the only way I could be treated better or released or even transferred.  

It was only later on that I realised that I had committed myself to a rather delicate procedure.  But I told the director of the prison that I had accepted to plead guilty.  He asked me to go and see a certain Nduhira, who was going to draft a document in my name and that the information was to be included in that document.  So I went and saw Nduhira, who drafted that document for me.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And Nduhira is spelled N-D-U-H-I-R-A.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  I'm going to ask the registrar to give you a blank piece of paper, and we're going to put down the names of the detainees that you contacted after you had met with the prosecutor general's representative.  And if you could number those so that we can refer to them by number.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  If the registrar can collect that document from the witness and then show it to the Judges and the parties.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, while that is being distributed, you've given a list of five names of detainees that you discussed with after your meeting with the prosecutor general's representative, and I would ask that that list be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ452, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ452 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, from your discussions -- well, can you give us -- 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, I haven't seen the exhibit yet.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, can you tell us, in general, what were the discussions that you had with these five detainees? 
A.	I started by discussing with the first three on the list because they had just returned from testifying in Arusha.  And they explained to me what type of testimony they had given before this Tribunal.  They explained to me the procedure of giving testimony and added that no one should contradict the other witnesses.  I had to corroborate what they had already said so that they -- there should not be any subsequent contradictions.  

Now, with regard to the fourth witness, we discussed the substance of our testimony.  We also talked about the fact that he had already testified as a Defence witness and that he was being told to withdraw his testimony and to testify for the Prosecution.  He was wondering what to do, and he explained to me that since it was an instruction that was being given to him, that he was going to testify for the Prosecution, but he felt that that was a problem because he had already testified as a Defence witness.  He was wondering whether to come and testify for the Prosecution, but he told me that I could have problems if I did not accept what was being proposed to me.  He also said that since this was my first time, I had not yet testified, it was possible for me to accept the proposal and come and testify in order to be released.  He said that the director of the prison and the prosecutor general were really involved in that operation and that since I hailed from the same region as those accused, I would be able to give credible information.  

And now with regard to the last name, I spoke with him, but not for long.  He asked us questions regarding the testimony, because he actually came to testify after me.  However, I remember that when we were in the solidarity camps, we gave a statement.  The prosecutor general came and said that the evidence against Kajelijeli was not sufficient, so he proposed that he would come and see us in order for us to go and testify against Kajelijeli.  He told us that we should try to concoct evidence.  And the prosecutor general said he would explain that we had already given that evidence before.  So while we were in the solidarity camp, they came and saw me and this other witness, that is, the last one on the list.  So we came to corroborate what the previous witnesses had said against him.  
Q.	Now, with respect to number 4 on your list, you testified -- you indicated that he came and testified as a Defence witness.  Was that in Kajelijeli's case? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And had he told the truth or had he lied when he came and testified in Kajelijeli's case? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, did this witness have access to the testimony of this witness in Kajelijeli?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, you can ask him that on cross-examination, but maybe I can make my question more clearer.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	When you spoke with number 4, did he tell you whether or not he had lied or told the truth in Kajelijeli's trial? 
A.	I do not know precisely what he said in the Kajelijeli case.  We discussed his testimony in another case, that is, when he testified for the Defence, and that was his problem.  He was wondering how he should testify for the Prosecution, whereas he had already testified for the Defence.  And he said that if I refused to testify for the Prosecution, I would have problems.  So he was simply saying that he had already testified for the Defence but that he had no choice than to go and testify for the Prosecution in another case.  But he said that testimony was not true.  

I did not discuss with him what he had said in Kajelijeli.  He did not speak about it, and he did not want the other detainees to know what he had said in the Kajelijeli case.  It was only later that we realised -- or we learned that he had given that testimony.  So it was a sort of secret.  He did not want everyone to know about it.  So he was not in the same category as those who had testified for the Prosecution, because everybody was thinking that he had gone to contradict what they had said, and that is why he did not want to discuss the matter with the others.  And, in fact, he did have problems later on after his release.  
Q.	And do you know whether or not he ever came and testified for the Prosecution in any trial in Arusha, number 4?  
A.	What I know is that he did not agree to that.  Therefore, he did not come to testify.  I know that when we were released, he subsequently was taken back to prison, and I know that from time to time we would hear about him because he came to testify for the Defence, but then he continued refusing to come here to testify for the Prosecution, because he said by doing so he would be telling lies.  Given the fact that he had already been in Arusha to testify for the Defence, he could not agree to come here to testify for the Prosecution, but I do not know whether later he accepted to do that.  But from what I know, he had not yet agreed to come and testify for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Now, turning to number 5 on the list, do you happen to know in which trial he testified here in Arusha? 
A.	I do not remember very clearly whether it was Bizimungu's trial or Nzirorera's trial, but I know that he came to testify here.  Furthermore, when I spoke to him, we had talked about what was said, be it in Augustin Bizimungu's trial or Nzirorera's trial, but I do not remember -- I know that he came to testify here, but I do not remember in which case he came to testify. 
Q.	And did you know his pseudonym that he used here in Arusha?  
A.	No. 
Q.	And is number 5 the brother of number 3? 
A.	Yes, they are brothers.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Now, Mr. President, if the registrar could have another blank piece of paper, and this time if the registrar could bring it to me, I would like to write down a few names and ask the witness about them concerning people who may be protected witnesses.  

And, Issa, after the Prosecutor has looked at the document, if you could leave it with the witness so he can have it in front of him as we're referring to it.  

Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit 453, under seal, D. NZ453.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ453 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like -- I assume you don't want us to go down to the lobby, but besides that, would you like us to proceed while you're somewhat distracted with your computer, or do you want us to wait for you?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm actually not dealing with the computer, as you can see.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I know you have the capacity to multitask in any event.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, directing your attention to number 6 on that list, is that person a prisoner at Ruhengeri prison, or was he during the time you were there? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And to your knowledge, is he among the people who came to Arusha to give testimony?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you know in which case in Arusha he gave testimony?  
A.	I was told that he had come here to testify for the Prosecution in Nzirorera's case, but that is something which I already knew because he's a member of the group which I referred to earlier, and, therefore, he was aware of everything that had been said in testimony, and he came to corroborate what had been said. 
Q.	And do you know his pseudonym? 
A.	No, because after his testimony in Arusha, I did not see him again.  He was still in prison, whereas we had been released.  Therefore, it was not possible for me to know his pseudonym.  But I was told that he had come here to testify.  And, moreover, we spoke just like other prisoners; we decided what we had to say, and we had to come here in order to narrate fabrications, pure fabrications. 
Q.	And do you know whether number 6 actually testified when he came to Arusha or not? 
A.	I do not know.  
Q.	Had he agreed to give fabricated testimony in discussions that you had with him?  

I'll repeat the question just so we have it clear.  Was number 6, in your discussions with him, giving truthful testimony or fabricated testimony?  
A.	What I am sure of is that in his written statement, there's nothing but lies because that was something which was made up.  Therefore, his testimony were just lies, just like the other witnesses.  He relied on number 3's testimony -- I do not know -- I'm not sure whether it's number 2 or number 3, because number 2 gave him advice regarding how he should proceed.  I know that when he came to testify here, he just told lies.  I do not know whether he subsequently retracted his evidence and spoke the truth, but at least when I spoke with him, it was agreed that we would come here and tell lies.  
Q.	Now, directing your attention to number 7 on the list, did you ever have any discussions with him about statements or testimony against people in Arusha?  
A.	No, I never spoke to that individual regarding testimony or statement that had to be made.  I simply know that he told me he had to come here to testify before this Tribunal, testify for the Defence in the Kajelijeli case.  He was to come here in the company of number 4 and other people who are not on this list.  But given that he had just confessed and entered a guilty plea, as had been asked, he decided that he will not come to testify because he had just adopted the said procedure.  

So he came here to testify for Kajelijeli, but I did not talk to him about any testimony which he might have made in Arusha.  What I know is that he came here to testify in the Kajelijeli case, and he had confessed and made a guilty plea.  People were not supposed to know what he had said.  That was a secret.  Therefore, I did not know much regarding his testimony.  
Q.	And do you know whether or not he actually testified in the Kajelijeli case?  
A.	I know that when they came to look for people who would testify for Kajelijeli, he refused.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, did the court reporters get that last answer, or is it necessary to repeat it?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The record shows that the witness says that he does not know -- when they came to look for people who would testify in Kajelijeli, he refused.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the answer that you're referring to?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Okay.  I can go to my next question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, directing your attention to numbers 8 and 9 on that list, these are two people who were at Ruhengeri prison but were natives of Kibuye.  Did you know any of those two individuals?  
A.	No, I do not know these individuals.  These names are not familiar to me.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  
A.	I'm saying so because there were many prisoners coming from Kibuye who had been transferred to Ruhengeri after our departure from the solidarity camp.  Therefore, they were transferred to Kibuye to go to that prison.  But by then we had already left the solidarity camp; therefore, I do not know these individuals.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, after you had discussed with the co-detainees 1 through 5, following your meeting with the representative of the prosecutor general, who was the next authority with whom you had contact about whether you would be participating in the confessions and accusations?  
A.	When we were at the solidarity camp, a soldier called Bunani (phonetic) came to see us.  He asked us to repeat what we would say here in Arusha.  I also know that he had a camera and he filmed everything that was going on when we were exercising.  There were also employees of the committee for unity and reconciliation who came to the solidarity camp, and they invited us to come here and make such testimonies.  And then there were instructors who were at the solidarity camp who called on us to do the same.  They always ask people to come here and make accusations against detainees here in Arusha.  And there were often comparisons between us and detainees in Arusha, because they were saying that detainees in Arusha were the real people responsible for what had happened in Rwanda, yet they were better treated than us.  And that was not acceptable.  It would not be acceptable for us not to denounce them.  And if we refused to speak out against them, we were going to face the consequences.  So we were told what we had to come and say here in respect of the detainees in Arusha; namely, every time add new information we were shown the list of former authorities of Ruhengeri, be they natives of Ruhengeri or people who had worked in Ruhengeri.  

So we were -- the list was shown to other people who had confessed and pleaded guilty so that they can level such accusations against them.  And if we had said anything on any person, we had to repeat what we had said.  And if we had said nothing about someone, we still had to find something to say about him.  
That was asked of us throughout the period when we were at the solidarity camp.  And even when -- after we had left the solidarity camp and we were in our homes, they would still come to see us and talk to us.  
Q.	Now, going back to the time that you were still in the prison, you had been visited by the representative of the prosecutor general who had asked you to consider participating in the confession procedure, then you had spoken with some of these detainees, numbers 1 through 5, and then was there a time that -- while you were still in the prison when they got your answer or they contacted you to get an answer from you? 
A.	Yes, that happened.  I think I've talked about it to you.  The first person who came there was the attorney for the PPO.  I told you that I was summoned to the PPO's office and then the chief prison warden summoned me.  Some days later, the general prosecutor turned up -- actually, it was not the representative of the PPO or the general prosecutor.  It was indeed the general prosecutor himself who came there.  

And some days later the prison chief -- the chief prison warden called me and we talked about what we had discussed.  And he told me that if I were ever to agree to that, I would be given security and I would -- and some advantages.  I ended up by agreeing to that.  

The reason I was selected -- or elected to be the head of prisoners is because the chief prison warden and people in that particular jurisdiction were all aware of such things, and we had agreed to do what we had been told, because that was something that had been decided upon.  So it was agreed that I should hold that post because I had agreed to do what had been asked of me.  

So those are the people to whom I spoke.  Others came to see me at the solidarity camp.  You have to know that the chief prison warden collaborated with officials of the PPO, and the general prosecutor -- and the prosecutor general was someone who placed a significant emphasis on the fact that prisoners should adopt the procedure of confession and guilty plea, and he was the one who decided that the former authorities who were detained in Ruhengeri should be transferred elsewhere because he said that it was the same authorities who were preventing the other prisoners from confessing and from pleading guilty.  

I know that he was a very influential person in -- at the level of our préfecture.  You also have to understand that he was a representative of the government in the Ruhengeri region.  He was the representative of the government in Ruhengeri; therefore, he was very influential. 
Q.	And the person that you're speaking of as the prosecutor general is the person whose name you wrote down for us on Thursday on the piece of paper?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did you ever meet the prosecutor general for the country of Rwanda, whose name was 
	Gerald Gahima at that time?  
A.	No, he never came to our prison.  
Q.	Now, you told us that when you informed the director of the prison that you were ready to agree, that he assigned a man named Nduhira to draft your confession.  We have in evidence as Exhibits D. NZ139 through 141 a confession document dated the 12th of September 2002 with two annexes.  Is that the confession that was drawn for you? 
A.	Yes, that is a document that I prepared when I resorted to the confession and guilty plea procedure.  
Q.	Now, we also have in evidence D. NZ150, which is a report of an interview that you had with ICTR investigators on the 24th of September 2002, 12 days after you submitted your confession.  Now, how was it that the ICTR investigators came to see you after you had confessed? 
A.	When I submitted the confession to the director of the prison and he signed it, nothing happened, but a few days later, I was called and informed that a representative of the Arusha Tribunal wanted to see me, and I was asked to talk about Nzirorera.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, may the witness be shown Exhibit D. NZ150, please?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, what has been placed in front of you is an ICTR witness statement dated the 
	24th of September 2002 at Ruhengeri prison.  And it reports the results of an interview between you and two ICTR investigators, Nathan Danquah, D-A-N-Q-U-A-H, and Harouna, H-A-R-O-U-N-A, Lamine, L-A-M-I-N-E, and they have an interpreter there as well.  And you've already testified that this is the document that bears your signature.  And indeed the content of the document is the stories about Kajelijeli organising the Interahamwe, Nzirorera holding meetings with them at his mother's house and with other authorities and how the authorities, including Colonel Bizimungu, were responsible for ordering Interahamwe to kill Tutsis.  

Now, when you narrated this story to the investigators of the ICTR, where had you gotten this information?  
A.	When I provided that information to the investigators of the Tribunal, it was the information that I had discussed with the other witnesses following testimony that they had given before or which they were going to give.  Some of those witnesses had already testified before me.  So this was testimony I gave relying on the testimonies given by the other witnesses regarding what they had said or what they were going to say.  
Q.	Now, at any time during the interview of the 24th of September with these two investigators from ICTR, did you indicate to them that any of the information you had given them was false? 
A.	I could not dare to tell them that.  I had received instructions to work for the government.  That is what I was explaining to you a short while ago.  I could, therefore, not dare to tell them that I was lying, given that I had told the authorities that I was going to do what they had asked me to do.  So I could not tell that to the investigators.  Instead, I told them that I was telling the truth.  
Q.	So was it your understanding that the ICTR investigators were not aware that what they were being told by prisoners in Ruhengeri were lies?  
A.	I think they thought that we were telling the truth.  They were not present in Rwanda at the time of the events.  They felt that since it was the Rwandan judicial system which was helping them to contact those witnesses, they were telling the truth.  They thought that we were telling the truth.  They did not imagine that the witnesses were prepared prior to being introduced to them.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I'd like you to be shown Exhibit D. NZ149, which is another statement that you gave to the ICTR on the 18th of October 2002, some three weeks after this one.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm wondering where we're going from here in terms of Mr. Robinson's examination.  If he's going to ask the witness about his subsequent statements, he should do that, rather than showing him the statements and then asking the witness to tell us what he's obviously reading from it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if you prefer, I can ask the witness some questions before putting the document before him.  It's not a problem.  Maybe the document can be circulated to the other parties before I -- while I'm asking my questions, and then after the witness has given some answers, he can look at the document.  May that be done?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, on the 18th of October 2002, you signed another statement, this time in the presence of two different ICTR investigators:  Emmanuel Anoja and Dominic Cassidy.  And also they had an interpreter with them.  And this time you talked about Colonel Setako.  So, do you recall the circumstances under which you are -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, what's the difference between telling the witness what he said in his statement and who he talked about and showing him the statement?  That's exactly the point I'm getting to.  If the demonstration is to show the credibility of this witness in terms of what he told the ICTR, let's elicit that from the witness before we show him or give him the information.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I'm doing that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances under which the investigators came to Ruhengeri prison -- or, to Ruhengeri prosecutor's office to talk to you about Colonel Setako? 
A.	What I know regarding the statement that I gave about Colonel Setako is that a deputy prosecutor named Marc, who was responsible for case files in Nkuli commune, asked me to come and see him and that I had to give a statement regarding Colonel Setako.  Since I had already started giving statements, he asked me to go and see another witness, and I believe his pseudonym is JDD.  He told me to go and see that witness, and he was the one who was going to give me information that I would use to give the statement.  The following day I received a document.  It was a summons for me to go and meet with the investigators from the Arusha Tribunal, and those investigators asked me questions about Colonel Setako.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could the witness be asked to repeat the pseudonym, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, you mentioned the pseudonym before.  Is it GDD or JDD?  
A.	GDD.  
Q.	Thank you.  And the deputy prosecutor who came and talked to you, you said his name was Marc.  Can you spell that?  
A.	M-A-R-C.  
Q.	Do you know his other name?  
A.	I no longer remember his other name.  What I know is that he was the one who was responsible for files from Nkuli commune. 
Q.	And was Colonel Setako from Nkuli commune?  
A.	Yes.  And to my knowledge, that is where he lived.  
Q.	And before you gave the statement that's in Exhibit D. NZ149 to the ICTR, did you speak with this witness, GDD, about the events in Nkuli commune?  
A.	Yes, I spoke with that witness.  I asked him questions about Colonel Setako.  He also knew about that because he was cooperating with Marc.  Each deputy was in charge of a specific region, so Marc collaborated closely with that witness, and their purpose was to seek witnesses.  So I spoke with that witness, and I believe that everything I said in my statement was based on information he had given to me.  

I did not know very much about what had happened in Nkuli commune because I was living in 
Mukingo commune during the events.  And so when, in that statement, I say that I saw Setako, it is because that witness had told me that that is what happened.  So my statement is based on what that witness had told me.  And he had been introduced to me by the deputy prosecutor called Marc. 
Q.	Now, in that statement there was -- you gave -- you said that you saw Setako in a bar in mid-May 1994 belonging to Kayondo, K-A-Y-O-N-D-O, in Mukamira and that Witness GDD was with Setako.  Was that true?  
A.	It was not true.  It is that witness who had told me to provide that information.  I believe that it was based on testimony that he had given about Colonel Setako.  So he was asking me to corroborate what he had already said in another testimony.  It was not true because I did not witness that incident that I talked about.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, after you had given testimony against -- or at least given statements about Nzirorera and Kajelijeli and Setako, did there come a time when you were again contacted by the ICTR and asked to give another statement?  
A.	You have just mentioned three names, but I believe that I gave statements against more than three persons.  This means that the investigators of the Tribunal came and saw me later on, and that is because I did not give statements against only three persons.  I provided information against two other accused persons:  Bicamumpaka and Augustin Bizimungu.  
Q.	Now, I'm going to refer to Exhibit D. NG18.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And I wonder if the registrar could retrieve that and show it to me because I can't seem to find my copy.  That's D. NG.  It's an Ngirumpatse exhibit.

1030H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, I'm looking at Exhibit D. NG18, which is a statement on the 11th of March 2003 from you by an investigator from the ICTR, named Julie Watson and it was taken at Nkumba camp in 
Ruhengeri préfecture.  Now, by the 11th of March 2003, had you been transferred to this camp? 
A.	Yes.  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...that we're in cross-examination, but if the Chamber's concerned about examining this witness with a view to obtaining the truth from him, my suggestion to Mr. Robinson is that he not feed the witness information that, obviously, is going to help him in his testimony.  Now, if it's a question of when this witness went to a solidarity camp, he should be asked to provide that information independently without it being fed to him by Mr. Robinson.  

So the Chamber's going to have to exercise some discretion here, and make some decisions about what best suits the examination of this witness for purposes of examining his credibility and the truth of the matter.  And, if Mr. Robinson continues by telling him who he gave information about, who he gave it to, when he gave it, where he gave it, this Chamber will be at a loss to assess -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you please slow down. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President, I can proceed in a different way; it's no problem.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, just -- I want to go back to the time while you were still in the Ruhengeri prison.  We've seen that you gave two statements to the ICTR investigators.  Had you testified in any trials in Arusha while you were still in Ruhengeri prison? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, while you were in the prison, was there a document prepared for Gacaca purposes in which different inmates -- either accused or exonerated, other inmates -- and a table was prepared summarising that information? 
A.	Yes, I'm aware of the existence of that document.  
Q.	And were the contents of that document true or false? 
A.	Some of the information in that document was true while the rest was false.  
Q.	Now, while you were still in the prison, did there come a time when some people came from Kigali or outside to assist inmates with their confessions? 
A.	Yes, there were meetings which were organised to sensitise inmates to plead guilty.  At one time the minister of internal security visited the prison and talked to us about that.  The prosecutor general that I have talked about frequently visited the prison and organised meetings to encourage inmates to plead guilty.  

On one occasion, there were certain people who came, and it was said that they came from Kigali prison and Gitarama prison and they were sensitising inmates in the Ruhengeri prison to resort to the confession and guilty plea procedure.  They assisted them in drafting the relevant documents.  The prisoners would go out and meet with these people who helped them to draft those documents.  In fact, the purpose was to explain to the prisoners the advantages of that procedure so that they should make a decision as to whether to resort to it or not.  
Q.	And was this group involved in fabricating testimony against people here in Arusha or only in encouraging people to confess in their own cases? 
A.	From what I know, they had received the same orders as us; but I never wrote the confession that they had written for other inmates.  I know that they'd come there with the prosecutor general, and that they had come from other prisoners, but I do not know what their orders were.  But we were told that if we -- if we agreed to confess and plead guilty, we would be taken to the office of the prison -- the supervisor's office, and that is where the documents were written.  

Those documents were subsequently sent to the chief prison warden who signed them.  I -- but we did not see the documents in that I did not know -- we did not know the contents of the documents, but it was obvious that inmates who pleaded guilty had more advantages than other inmates.  They did not wear a prison uniform; they wore their own clothes.  Therefore, I think that they received the same orders as we did.  They insisted and said that we had to denounce the authorities of the former regime, and they explained to us that it was because of those authorities that we were in prison because they had -- they were the ones who had given us the orders to kill.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take the recess now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think it's a good time.  We will take the mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1036H to 1122H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry that the tea break took such a long time, but I can assure you that there were a couple of activities that attracted our -- our attention.  So I'm sorry for the prolonged break.  
MR. ROBINSON:
No problem, if we see some decisions being issued, we will excuse you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In any event, Witness BTH, I wanted to ask you now about while you were still at Ruhengeri prison, I thought you had testified on Thursday that at some time there was a group of 10 people that were set up who were no longer required to wear uniforms.  Can you tell us what that was about? 
A.	The prison administration and the judicial authorities -- that is, the prosecutor general and the state council brought people from other prisons, and I have already talked to you about that.  These people came from Kigali and Gitarama to try and sensitise the prisoners to confess.  

A few days later, the administration called me up because I was responsible for the other inmates and I was told that some of the prisoners who had pleaded guilty were no longer going to wear the prison uniforms and that they would receive the same advantages as the other prisoners who had come from the other prisons.  And, this was so as to show the other prisoners that there were clear benefits in pleading guilty.  

This was a way of strengthening cooperation between the prisoners and the judicial authorities, particularly when it came to the confession and guilty plea procedures and the identification of witnesses.  So this is how come 10 prisoners were selected, including myself, who were no longer compelled to wear the prison uniforms; they could dress in their own clothes.  

When we went out of the prison we were no longer accompanied by prison wardens.  We were free to move about, but we had to return to the prison before a specific time.  This means that we were no longer prisoners like the others, and this encouraged the other inmates, because if you are no longer guarded by a prison warden and you are no longer compelled to wear a prison uniform, you have hope that you would be released in the near future.  All these things encouraged us to cooperate with the authorities in doing what they were asking us to do.  

In fact, before accepting to cooperate, the benefits to be given to the other prisoners if they did the same thing were explained to them.  
Q.	Now, considering only the time that you were in Ruhengeri prison after you made your confession, did you participate in assisting others in either drafting their confessions or confirming their statements - or, conforming their statements to those of other inmates? 
A.	There were people who were responsible for that task; they had to draft the confessions of the other prisoners.  Certain individuals had been designated for that.  I had my own duties; I was responsible for the other prisoners, so I could not interfere in those other activities of drafting confessions.  

Nevertheless, certain prisoners contact me -- contacted me in the presence of others and we explained to them what type of statements they should give.  This is the role that I played.  Some witnesses contacted me both in prison, in the solidarity camps and even here.  Someone asked me to assist a witness who was actually here.  That witness discussed his testimony with me and I explained to him what he had to do.  

In fact, this witness had come to testify in a case in which I had already testified myself.  So I would say that I was one of those who assisted the other witnesses in preparing their testimony.  We kept in touch, and each time an accused person had to be contacted by an investigator --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
THE WITNESS:
-- we had to contact that person to discuss what he was going to say.  Some of these people came from Mukingo while the others came from Nkuli.  So this was a group of Prosecution witnesses that cooperated amongst themselves.  There were always contacts between these witnesses, and they had to come up with a credible story to show that those witnesses had witnessed the same events at the same locations.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you remember the approximate month and year that you were released from the prison to go to the solidarity camp? 
A.	It was at the end of January 2003.  
Q.	Now, when you got to the solidarity camp, can you tell us in general -- well, first of all, when you got to the solidarity camp, who was the first authority to speak with you about assisting people to accuse those in Arusha? 
A.	Immediately after our arrival in the solidarity camp, the authorities in that camp told us how we were supposed to conduct ourselves.  And every day, the state council or prosecutor general would come to the camp.  They came to verify who was there, because certain people had been released, whereas they hadn't -- they were not supposed to be released.  

Some of the Gacaca authorities also visited the camp, and the prosecutors told us that we had to find other witnesses who would give the same testimony as ourselves.  The camp authorities, who were members of the reconciliation commission, started talking to us about those witnesses.  This was the first time that they were organised in such a way in those camps, and they encouraged us to continue testifying because that would lead to reconciliation.  

Regarding the witnesses -- regarding the detainees in Arusha, we were asked to find other witnesses to testify in the Kajelijeli case, for example, because the number of witnesses was not sufficient.  We were told that I and number five on the list would go and testify in the Kajelijeli case, and sometime after that, people came from Arusha to ask us questions.  
Q.	Now, the prosecutor general who came to the solidarity camp and asked you to get more witnesses against Kajelijeli, was that the individual whose name that you have written down for us on a piece of paper? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did there come a time when an investigator from the Office of the Prosecutor came to talk to you about Kajelijeli again while you were at the -- this time while you were at the solidarity camp? 
A.	Yes, an investigator came to see me and I made a statement regarding Kajelijeli when I was at the solidarity camp.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And Mr. President, now may the witness be shown Exhibit D. NG18, and this has also already been shown to all the parties, so it can be shown directly to the witness now.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And directing your attention to the document D. NG18, which has been placed in front of you, dated the 11th of March 2003, is that the statement that you made against Kajelijeli while in the solidarity camp? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, did there come a time when somebody from the ICTR came to talk to you about 
Jérôme Bicamumpaka? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, prior to making a statement about Bicamumpaka, had you discussed with any authorities or other detainees what you were supposed to say about Bicamumpaka? 
A.	Yes, I talked about it with them.  
Q.	Was that with any authorities? 
A.	I talked about it with other witnesses, and before the investigators came to interview me, I talked about it with the attorney from the office of the public prosecutor, who often had us called.  We used to be told:  "Oh, there's some people who wanted to see you" and then when we went to meet them, they would tell us what they wanted us to do.  So I spoke to the attorney from the public prosecutor's office as well as with some of the other witnesses, and I discussed with them the contents of my statement in respect of Bicamumpaka.  
Q.	And that -- was that before the investigator for the ICTR came? 
A.	Before an investigator came to ask me questions about Bicamumpaka, I discussed this with an attorney from the OPP, as well with another witness who had been detained with me at the Ruhengeri prison.  The name of that witness is on the list, but I do not remember what is his number on the list.  
Q.	Was it on the list that you drew up or the list that I gave you?  In other words, numbers one through five or numbers six through nine? 
A.	No, the -- his name is one of the first five names. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness could be shown Exhibit 452, which is the list of five names, D. NZ452.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness BTH, if you could give us the number of the person with whom you discussed Bicamumpaka? 
A.	It is number two.  
Q.	And what was the name of the person from the office of the public prosecutor that you discussed Bicamumpaka with?  Was it the person that's name you wrote down or some other person? 
A.	It was another person; his name is Rukira wa Muhizi.  
I think that he was a senior state attorney from the office of the public prosecutor, or -- but what I know is that he -- he was more senior than the other attorneys from the office of the public prosecutor.  
Q.	And Rukira wa Muhizi is spelt R-U-K-I-R-A, and the second word is W-A, and the third is M-U-H-I-Z-I.  

Had you spoke with him, before you discussed Bicamumpaka, about any other confessions or accusations you were making?  And I'm speaking now specifically with Rukira wa Muhizi.  
A.	Rukira wa Muhizi was a senior state attorney of the OPP.  He knew all the cases; he was more senior than the other attorneys from the office of the public prosecutor.  He knew how it worked and I spoke to him about another testimony. 
Q.	And what was that testimony? 
A.	Testimony against Nzirorera and against Kajelijeli, and even against Bizimungu.  He dealt with the Kigombe commune cases because Kajelijeli was also implicated or involved in the Kigombe case.  He also dealt with the Mukingo case, so we spoke to him about information that we'd give in those matters or cases.  Sometimes he had witnesses called -- and I'm talking about witnesses who were going to testify in the Mukingo case.  He worked with someone else whose name I have forgotten and that person's name is Rwisegenya Renzaho. 
Q.	And Rwisegenya is R-W-I-S-E-G-E-N-Y-A.  I think we know the spelling of Renzaho.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Actually, the witness makes a correction; he says it's not Renzaho, it's Vincent instead of Renzaho.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, while at the solidarity camp, did you participate in assisting other inmates in preparing to meet ICTR investigators? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And how much notice would you have before an ICTR investigator appeared? 
A.	Sometimes we would be informed two days prior to their arrival of the investigators -- well, two or three days prior to their arrival.  But when I testified in respect of Setako, Marc informed me that the investigators would come to see me only on the previous day -- that is, prior to their arrival.  
Q.	Was there ever an occasion when the investigator simply turned up to speak with a person in the solidarity camp? 
A.	I don't know.  I know that in our case we were informed in advance that he would come because in a solidarity camp it's not easy to see someone without prior arrangement, because before meeting anyone in the solidarity camp, you have to inform the authorities beforehand.  So in our case we were informed about the arrival of the investigators prior to their coming there.  
Q.	What about when Defence counsel came to the prison, were the inmates informed in advance? 
A.	I do not know, I do not know how they went about it.  I only saw -- I saw only one Defence counsel and he was arguing with Rukira wa Muhizi.  I think it was Kajelijeli's counsel.  I saw him, but I did not know under what circumstance he had come there, but I do know he was there, because he was arguing with Rukira wa Muhizi.  We heard therefore that this senior attorney for the OPP had argued with 
Kajelijeli's counsel, but I do not know what procedure Defence counsel used in order for them to be able to meet inmates.  
Q.	How long did you stay at the solidarity camp? 
A.	We arrived at the solidarity camp at the end of January and we stayed there up to May.  
Q.	And in May 2003 what happened?  Were you released or did you go back to the prison? 
A.	I was released and I went home.  I did not go back to prison.  
Q.	Now at that time, had you been sentenced? 
A.	No, I had not yet been sentenced.  
Q.	So were you given provisional release? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And was that done by a judge or by the prosecutors? 
A.	In the documents given to us, the document was issued by the prosecutor and not by the -- by a judge, and it was a prosecutor who had signed the document.  
Q.	Now, from May of 2003 while you were on release, were you contacted by investigators from the ICTR? 
A.	I do not remember clearly; however, I remember that I spoke to investigators at the Tribunal's office in Remera.  
Q.	Now, before you went to the Tribunal's office in Remera, did you ever meet any investigators at the 
EER guest house in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes, I think that I spoke to employees of the Tribunal at the EER guest house.  
Q.	Now, I'm looking at a report of an investigation in ****************** in which it's indicated that you were interviewed at the EER guest house in Ruhengeri and that you were asked about rapes.  Do you recall that? 
A.	I remember that -- that question was put to me, but I do not remember where I was when -- I do not remember where I was when that question was put to me, but I think now I can remember.  
Q.	And during that interview, it's reported that you indicated that you witnessed the rape of a Tutsi lady named Joyce.  Was that true? 
A.	That was not true.  I heard that that lady was -- had been raped, but I did not witness the rape because I was not in the same area as she.  
Q.	Now, you also talked about another woman in Mukingo commune at Byangabo centre who has testified in relation to rape and you said the woman can be found at Byangabo centre.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, actually, I think it's better if I put this name on a piece of paper.  So if the registrar could give me a blank piece of paper, I'm going to give you the name in that manner.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness, while I'm doing that, let me put my next question to you, which is:  If you had already been released, why did you continue to lie to the ICTR? 
A.	First of all, I was released provisionally.  I had not yet been sentenced; the judgement had not yet been delivered, so if I had changed anything at all in my testimony, there would be consequences on my own trial.  I know -- or, rather, I think that at times in Rwanda authorities can give their opinion on an accused person and such an opinion can have consequences on the judgement.  So I knew that if I were to change my testimony, I would suffer the consequences thereof.  And I knew that some of my brothers -- some of my brothers were still appearing in court.  Therefore, I did not want to change in order to avoid such consequences.  There are some people who changed their testimonies and they were taken back to prison.  I did not want to undergo the same fate.  I wanted to wait for my judgement to be delivered first.  
Q.	Now, the name of the person who -- I'm taking this directly from the report of the investigators of your meeting in 8 -- ***************.  And you gave that name as someone who was in Byangabo centre; a Tutsi survivor who had been -- who had testified in relation to rape.  Do you recall that? 
A.	Yes, I remember that name; I did not witness the rape.  I repeated information that had been given to me by other witnesses.  
Q.	Also during this meeting you said that women were raped in the house of Nzirorera's father.  Was that true? 
A.	Nzirorera's father had several houses in Byangabo.  It was said that Noël was renting one of the houses belonging to Nzirorera's father; however, that detail did not have anything to do with the fact that he had raped women.  He lived in that house.  People were saying that the house belonged to Nzirorera's father.  Actually, it was a commercial building which was being rented by that young man, Noël -- and that's where the crime occurred.  
Q.	And on the occasion when you met the investigators from ICTR at the EER guest house, did you also go around and point out to them the different locations in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I no longer remember that.  I think that on one occasion I showed them a place where a victim had been buried, and a place where a roadblock had been set up, as well as Setako's house.  But I do not -- I do not remember all the places which I showed the investigators.  
Q.	Now, it's stated in this report that as the witness had other obligations, he was provided with transport money, and will travel to Kigali on 26 August 2003 so that a comprehensive statement in relation to these matters can be taken.  

Now, did you receive some money from the ICTR on the occasion that you met them at the guest house? 
A.	Yes, I think that they gave me money for transport.  
Q.	And do you remember how much it was? 
A.	No, I no longer recall.  
Q.	Was it approximately the amount of the cost of transport or was it more? 
A.	No, it was sufficient to pay my trip right up to Kigali.  
Q.	Were you asked to sign a receipt for the money? 
A.	I no longer remember.  I probably signed a document, but what I know is that whenever Tribunal employees give you money, you have to sign something.  So I must have signed or I signed when I was at the Tribunal and when I was given more money to return home, so I believe I signed somewhere.  
Q.	And was this the first time that anyone had given you money either from the ICTR or from the Rwandan authorities related to your accusing people in Arusha? 
A.	While we were still in prison we were not authorised to receive any money.  The money had to be handed over to the prison authorities; however, after our release, when the Tribunal staff contacted us, they gave us money for transport and so we had to sign.  

Now, regarding the state authorities, they never gave me any money.  They took a decision to release us and that is what I explained to you a short while ago, and I'm prepared to give you further explanations.  
Q.	Now, while you were a prisoner in the solidarity camp was there any discussion among the inmates or with the authorities about any financial advantages that someone would receive if they came to Arusha? 
A.	The state authorities did not talk to us about that; however, certain witnesses who had come here told us that some of them had received money.  It was not compensation of any sort; it was simply money given to those people for the time that they had taken to come and testify.  

While we were in prison, some of the prisoners who had come to Arusha returned with money.  That money was not taken away from them, and that is because since they had come to testify here in Arusha, they were considered favourably, because usually when a prisoner was caught with money, that money was taken away from him.  But when the witnesses who had testified in Rwanda -- in Arusha returned, the money was not taken away from them.  So we understood that when someone left Rwanda to come and testify here, they had to receive some money for the time spent.  
Q.	And was that money the $3 a day that prisoners are given by the ICTR for what we call the daily subsistence allowance? 
A.	Yes, I believe that is why the money was given to them.  I do not know anything about that money paid to witnesses, because it never happened to me.  What I know is that when the witnesses returned from Arusha, they told us about it and told us that they had money.  

As to the authorities, they simply told us that we would be released, and you have to understand that if you are a prisoner and you are proposed either 1 million Rwandan francs or release, the choice is clear:  You would prefer to be released.  When you've spent a few years in prison and you have come to understand that the situation in prison is very difficult, the first thing you would want is to be released, and this is because when you are in prison, you are not even allowed to go out.  You are given a meal once a day and the quantity of food is not even sufficient.  So you usually need an authorisation to go out of the prison in order to find some food to eat.  And, so, when you have the authority to go out of the prison, it is a major advantage.  Given that we had spent a lot of time in prison, we did everything to be released.  

I even forgot to tell you that when you're in prison it is not easy for the members of your family to come and visit you.  But once you resort to the confession and guilty plea procedure, it becomes very easy.  When the members of your family arrive, you are given the opportunity to sit down and discuss everything -- and that advantage is not enjoyed by prisoners who have not confessed.  So when authorities promised to release us, we felt that that was something very important and so it had no connection with any amount of money that we could possibly get.  
Q.	Okay, thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that the witness now be shown Exhibit D. NZ148. 
MR. WEBSTER:
While Mr. Issa is looking for that, an enquiry for Mr. Robinson:  Are we admitting the two other documents that were shown to this witness?  I believe the last statement and the one before that were never admitted in evidence.  Is it part of your plan to do that now?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, I would like to admit those documents.  Unfortunately, I hadn't printed them yet, so I was going to wait until after the lunch break, but I would like to admit those two documents and I'll do that immediately upon reconvening after lunch.  

Issa, if you could give him both copies, English and French, because his signature is on the English copy.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, what we have in front of us is a document dated the 26th of August 2003; it's a witness statement, and it indicates the place of interview was at the ICTR, Amahoro hotel.  And I'll ask you if looking at the English version you can see your signature on that document? 
A.	Yes, I can see my signature.  
Q.	And is the information which you provided in that document also the same lies that you had been telling while in prison and at the solidarity camp? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, that's August 26th of 2003.  Did there come a time when you went back to the solidarity camp? 
A.	No.  
Q.	I'm looking at a witness statement from the 2nd of December 2003 from the ICTR of an interview with you, and it indicates that the place of interview was the centre of re-education in Nkumba commune in Ruhengeri.  Did you meet the Office of the Prosecutor's investigators at that location in December 2003? 
A.	Counsel, I did not quite understand your question, specifically the date.  
Q.	The date is the 2nd of December 2003 and the witness statement indicates that you were interviewed at the centre of re-education in Nkumba -- N-K-U-M-B-A -- Ruhengeri préfecture.  
A.	I never returned to the solidarity camp in May 2003.  I left the solidarity camp and I never went back there.  
Q.	Well, perhaps they made a mistake about the location, but did you, once again -- were you, once again, interviewed in Ruhengeri préfecture by investigators of the ICTR for the second time concerning Bicamumpaka? 
A.	I do not quite remember.  All I know is that before I came to testify in the Bicamumpaka case, the investigators came to see me at Muhabura hotel -- that is, if my memory serves me correctly.
Q.	Okay.  Now, approximately when was the first time that you came to Arusha to give testimony? 
A.	I believe it was in 2004.  
Q.	And was Mr. Nzirorera's first trial the first case in which you testified at the ICTR? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And when you came to testify in Mr. Nzirorera's trial, were you kept at a safe house or in the 
UN detention facility here in Arusha? 
A.	I was lodged in a safe house.  I believe it was in block number three here in town.  
Q.	And were you with any other witnesses in that safe house? 
A.	I remember that on the first occasion I came with Witness GBU.  We stayed here for about one month, but we were not able to testify; we returned to Rwanda.  We came back a second time, I was still with that witness and other witnesses that I no longer remember, but I should like to point out that on those two occasions I was with GBU.  
Q.	And did you stay in the safe house with GBU here in Arusha? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you discuss your testimony? 
A.	Yes, every day after our return from the court session, we would tell each other everything that had happened.  
Q.	How did you prepare for your testimony in Mr. Nzirorera's first trial?  Did you review any documents? 
A.	The Prosecutor used to come and then we would talk about what was going to be said.  And each time I realised that there was a point that was not clear to me, I would discuss with the other witness so as to know how to go about it.  

When we realised that there was a difficult point, then we would consult the documents so that there should be no confusion.  But the Prosecutor of the ICTR did not tell me to dwell on any specific points; he prepared me just like the other witnesses.  However, every time I realised that there was a point that could lead to contradictions I would try to correct whatever it was based on what the other witnesses had told me so as to avoid any contradictions.  
Q.	And where did you get access to the documents that you were reviewing? 
A.	When I talk about documents, I'm referring to documents that were presented to me by the Prosecutor; it is not documents that were in the safe house.  When we were in the safe house, we simply exchanged information.  The Prosecutor used to bring documents to us; we would go through them and then he would take them away.  
Q.	So did the Prosecutor show you your prior statements at the safe house? 
A.	Regarding this point, I remember that on one occasion a statement was left with me.  As you are well aware, that trial commenced at one point and was recommenced at another point, and on that second occasion I asked that my statement in that first segment of the trial be given to me, and that was done.  
Q.	And who gave you that statement or testimony? 
A.	It was the Prosecutor.  
Q.	Which Prosecutor? 
A.	Don Webster.  
Q.	When you met with Don Webster, did you give him any indication that you were going to lie? 
A.	No.  
Q.	And did he ever suggest that you should lie? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now after Don Webster would leave, would you discuss with the other witnesses in the safe house how to change or explain what might be a contradiction? 
A.	Yes, I discussed it with GBU, and I also discussed it with other witnesses.  
Q.	The first time you came to testify in Mr. Nzirorera's first trial, in addition to GBU, do you remember the identities of the other witnesses with whom you discussed it here in Arusha? 
A.	When we were here, it was only GBU that I knew, but I knew other people in Rwanda, specifically the person who had come to testify in defence of Kajelijeli; we had discussed it.  The same applies to the person at number five on the list.  When I left Arusha and returned to Rwanda, I discussed with that individual.  There are also witnesses who came to testify in the Bizimungu case and I discussed with them.  
Q.	Now, did Mr. Webster or anyone else from the Prosecution tell you not to discuss anything about your testimony or information with Witness GBU or other witnesses?  
A.	Staff members from WVSS and also from the OTP talked to us about that, but they were not aware of what had been decided.  When we left Arusha to go to Rwanda, we carried out our normal activities so we could resort to those types of tricks, and we talked about everything and they could not prevent me from discussing with GBU.  They had asked us not to discuss our testimony, but they did not ask us to stop talking completely.  But while I was here with GBU, we discussed practically everything.  

It is the normal principle that we are told not to talk -- not to discuss our testimonies, but when we were in private, we discussed it.  We knew that we had both come here to testify in one case, so we could not hide anything from each other.  So we talked about everything specifically since I had to ask him for some information, given that he had come to testify in Arusha well before me.  
Q.	Now, for Mr. Nzirorera's case, do you remember during the first trial who testified first?  You or 
Witness GBU? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this a new line?  
MR. ROBINSON:
It's not a new line, but we could take a break before this, if you're ready.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are coming up to 12:30, I'm just wondering if you could find a convenient time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I think we could take it that this is a convenient time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our luncheon recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1229H) 
(Pages 15 to 27 by Jean Baigent)













(Court resumed at 1412H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can resume now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, you had testified about your coming to testify in Mr. Nzirorera's trial, his first trial in March of 2004.  Now, our records show that you came again to testify against Bicamumpaka in 
	October of 2004.  Were you still released at that time? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And while in Arusha, did you stay here at the safe house? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And during your stay in October of 2004 for Bicamumpaka's case, were there other -- any other witnesses in that case with whom you stayed at the safe house? 
A.	No.  I do not know of any.  I did not know in what context -- or, in the context of which cases those witnesses had come to testify.  
Q.	And during your stay in October of 2004 in the safe house, did anyone ask you to try to influence or have any discussion with the other witnesses? 
A.	No, nobody.  
Q.	Now, did there come a time in May of 2005 when you were sentenced by Gacaca? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And what sentence did you receive? 
A.	Seven years of imprisonment. 
Q.	Did you have to go back to prison, or had you already served more than seven years? 
A.	I had already served that sentence.  
Q.	Now, our records show that you came back to Arusha and testified against Augustin Bizimungu in the Ndindiliyimana trial, beginning on the 30th of January 2006.  Were you still free at that time?
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And when you came to Arusha, did you stay at the safe house here? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Were there any other witnesses that were testifying in the Ndindiliyimana case with you in the 
	safe house? 
A.	I do not remember.  I don't even remember the witnesses who were living in the same safe house as me.  I might need to take some time in order to refresh my memory on the subject and remember who those witnesses were who were in that house with me at that time.  
Q.	Okay.  If you think of something that -- during the course of your testimony, you could let us know.  

Now, when you testified against General Bizimungu, did you continue to tell the same lies that you had given in your statements? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And why did you do that in light of the fact that you had already been sentenced by Gacaca? 
A.	Firstly, it was because I was still living in the country, and it was also because some members of my family still had their trials ongoing and my behaviour who have had an influence on their trial.  There was also the gathering of information exercise which was still ongoing, and I had been told that I might be accused or prosecuted before another court and that it might be that I would have to appear again before another court, even if this Court was not to be found under the same administrative entity as that which was responsible for my first case or trial.  
Q.	Now, did you attend Gacaca proceedings while you were free, in addition to your own trial? 
A.	Yes, I did take part in some of the proceedings.  
Q.	Did you tell the truth at Gacaca? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Why did you tell the truth at Gacaca and lie about authorities in Arusha? 
A.	The courts are not the same, and there was no link between my trial and those trials which were ongoing before this Tribunal.  The Gacaca courts have a specific procedure, and when one testifies before a Gacaca court, one only speaks of those details relevant to the accused person.  One does not talk about other subjects.  And the testimony I gave before this Tribunal covered issues that were not covered during my trial.  

	And you will also recall that the Rwandan authorities had requested that I come and bring false testimony.  I had already discussed this with those witnesses who had testified before me, and I already knew that the information we were giving before this Tribunal was not given or transmitted to the Gacaca courts when the witness was a protected witness, that is.  I was surprised to note that what I had said in my testimony here had, indeed, been transmitted to the Gacaca courts; however, the other witnesses had led me to believe otherwise.  So I knew that what -- or, thought that what I was saying would have no impact on my trial before the Gacaca courts.  
Q.	In general, are people telling the truth before Gacaca in Busogo secteur about the events in Mukingo? 
A.	It depends on the trial.  However, generally speaking, the witnesses try to tell the truth, and those witnesses who are testifying before Gacaca courts avoid giving information relevant to people who are accused by this Tribunal.  And when witnesses do not tell the truth before a Gacaca court, and if this is found out, they are severely punished.  And other members of the population are there to corroborate the information or evidence he or she provides.  So when one testifies against an influential person, one might run the risk of getting up against those witnesses who have been told what to say by the members of the family -- or, the family members of the accused.  However, those who testify before a Gacaca court, in general, tell the truth; however, my judgement of this might only be based on the trials that I was able to attend, or trials during which I provided testimony.  
Q.	Now, when you -- the last time that you were here in this trial, beginning on the 8th of June 2006, did you also stay at the safe house? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And I believe that you testified on Thursday that it was on this occasion that you were asked to discuss with another inmate or other witnesses some of your experiences; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And can you tell us how that came about? 
A.	I arrived here in Arusha and I was accommodated in a safe house.  A few days later, another witness was brought, a witness whom I knew.  He was also coming to testify in the Augustin Bizimungu trial.  So he spent his time in the same place as me.  And a few days later, employees of the offices of this Tribunal came to see us.  These were people who were in charge of the Setako trial, or the Setako file, and they asked me whether I might be able to find any other witnesses in the case -- the Setako case.  I said that I only knew of a few of the individuals, as he submitted a list to me.  And those people then talked to the witness who was with me in the safe house, and they asked me to help this witness because I already knew what the procedure applied by this Tribunal was.  So I needed to explain to him how it would work.  I then talked to this witness and I talked to him about his testimony, explaining to him how he was going to go about it before the Trial Chamber, and we even went on to discuss the contents of his testimony.  I suggested to him what he might say, and I even told him what we had testified to before the Trial Chamber, in view of the fact that I had already testified in that trial.  

I would give you an example:  This witness told me how he was going to go about it because he said that he had followed military training.  And in another statement, he said that he had followed this training in Camp Kamira and not in Nkuli.  So I advised him on this point.  I was obliged to do this because if I had refused to help him, and if this witness had informed the Rwandan authorities subsequently that I had refused to help him, this would have caused me problems.  
Q.	Now, this witness, is he on the list, one through five, that you made up earlier? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Do you know his pseudonym that he was using in the Bizimungu trial? 
A.	I have already forgotten it.  However, were the pseudonym to come to mind, I will give it to you.  
Q.	In the meantime, I am going to ask the registrar to give you a piece of paper to write down his name.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, whilst that's being done, I would like to offer some exhibits.  First of all, the witness had written before the break the name of a rape victim, or a person who claimed they were a rape victim in his area, and I would ask that that be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ454, under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ454 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Then I have three statements that were referred to during his testimony.  I would like to offer his statement of the 18th of March 2003 as Exhibit D. NZ455, A for the English and B for the French, 
under seal; his statement of the 18th of August 2003, which, actually, is an interview note of his interview of 18th August 2003.  It is only in English, and I would offer it as D. NZ456.  And then for 
D. NZ457, A and B, his statement of 2 December 2003; A for the English and B for the French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  All admitted under seal.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ455A and D. NZ455B admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. NZ456 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ457A and D. NZ457B admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, while the name is being circulated -- actually -- perhaps I will wait until the name has been circulated and I will have some more questions.  

Mr. President, may the piece of paper on which the witness has written the name of the person with whom he was at the safe house in June 2006 be admitted under seal as D. NZ458?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ458 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Witness BTH, did you sign a statement while you were in Arusha about Setako in June of 2006? 
A.	No.  To the best of my recollection, I did not sign a statement.  
Q.	When the investigators were talking to you about Setako in the safe house, were they taking down notes? 
A.	No.  They just noted down the names of people who could be potential witnesses.  During the previous visit in Rwanda, they asked me to get for them names of people who could come here to testify for the Prosecution against Setako.  And when they spoke to me at the safe house, I gave them the names which I could remember.  Actually, they had come to speak to the second witness and another witness whose name I do not remember.  They promised me that they would contact the people whose names 
	I had given them.  They discussed with regard to the other issues with the second witness and not with me.  
Q.	Okay.  Do you remember the names of the people who came from the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	If my memory serves me correctly, there is the person whose name I gave you on the piece of paper; it's a man.  I think that there was also a lady who worked for the same trial in the Office of the Prosecutor -- or, rather, who worked for the Kajelijeli case.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, when you were talking to the person whose name is on that piece of paper in the safe house, did you discuss with him -- well, did you understand that he wanted you to convince this person to tell lies, or did he want you, simply, to educate him as to what the procedure was for a witness in Arusha? 
A.	That person knew me even prior to that.  The person was informed of what the authorities had asked us to say.  He knew very well that most of our testimonies were lies and knew that we had to corroborate testimonies and statements of witnesses who had preceded us, so that person already knew our testimonies and our testimonies were lies.  

	I also know that the information given to me by that witness were pure lies, and I know very well 
	that he -- that that was what was asked of him, in other words, to come and say that before the 
	Trial Chamber.  I, therefore, confirm that I was asked to convince that witness to tell lies, and even the witness himself was informed of that.  So the same people were at the root of the false testimonies given before the Tribunal.  
Q.	Do you know whether or not that person gave testimony in General Bizimungu's case, the person whose name you put on the paper, that is, D. NZ458? 
A.	Yes, that person came to testify for the Prosecution against General Bizimungu.  I even knew that before he came here to Arusha.  There were other witnesses whom I knew who were supposed to come to Arusha and testify for the Prosecution against General Bizimungu.  He himself did not hide such -- would not have hidden such information from me because we had already discussed the contents of his testimony.  
Q.	Did he give his testimony whilst you were still at the safe house? 
A.	I no longer remember.  However, I know that I -- I know that I left before he completed his testimony. And when he left Arusha -- by the time he left Arusha, I was already in Rwanda.  
Q.	Now, you have already told us that the testimony you have given in Mr. Nzirorera's trial in June 2006 was false.  After that you gave that testimony, did you see Witness GBU before he came and testified in December of 2006? 
A.	Yes, I saw him.  I saw him often, and on several occasions, we discussed the matter.  
Q.	And did you tell him what testimony you had given in Arusha at Mr. Nzirorera's trial? 
A.	Yes, I told him about the testimony because, he, too, was curious.  He wanted to know how the trial was going on because we had to come back to testify.  So he was curious.  He wanted to know how he should conduct himself and what I had done during my testimony, therefore, we spoke about the subject.  Furthermore, I saw him after his testimony.  
Q.	And what did he say to you after he had given his testimony? 
A.	He told me that he had come back from Arusha where he had testified, and he explained to me, in summary, the problems he had had, how he had conducted himself.  He had already testified, and he told me how things had gone on.  
Q.	Did you understand that he had told the lies that you and he had agreed on, or that he had told the truth in his testimony in this trial for the second time? 
A.	I do not think that he changed his deposition.  I think that he maintained what he had said earlier on, that is, what we had agreed on, and I knew that he had come here prior to that.  In fact, he had even come here even before me.  So I think that he maintained the same account which he had already given before.  
Q.	Now, after you returned to Rwanda, after testifying in Mr. Nzirorera's trial in June 2006, did there come a time when you were asked to give evidence against the French? 
A.	Yes.  When I arrived I found out that he had tried to contact me through one of my younger brothers.  And there is a neighbour who is also a witness.  First, my brother hid from that person the place where I was, and when I returned from Arusha, he called them because he had told them that -- they told -- they said that I should be contacted when I came back.  And then they came to see me and said that I should give evidence against the French because, as you know, during the war, there were problems between Rwanda and France.  
Q.	And who was it that you are referring to when you say "he"?  Who was asking you to give evidence against the French? 
A.	I am talking about a man who is not very much older than me.  I think either he works for CID or the military intelligence agency.  And then there is another man who works for what is known as the national security services.  That person is also the chairman or president of Ibuka association in Ruhengeri.  He, too, had been called, and he told me that I should testify against the French.  But he also told me about the Arusha trials, and I noticed that I would have many problems, that's why I really decided to leave -- I had to leave the country.  
Q.	Now, at the time in Rwanda, had a commission been established to investigate the role of the French in the genocide? 
A.	Yes, such a commission had, indeed, been established.  
Q.	And was that the purpose for which these people were contacting you to testify before that commission? 
A.	Those people contacted me so that I could testify, but I do not know whether it was before the commission or a court, but what they wanted is that I should give evidence against the French.  That's all that I know.  
Q.	Did you have any evidence -- truthful evidence against the French? 
A.	No.  The French never came to our area.  They never carried out operations in our area.  He asked me to look for bullets which they had used in the Gisesero, but I did not know anything about that, and I realised that I could not really get out of that situation, so I decided that I had to leave.  
Q.	Now, who -- what was the name of the person who contacted you from the CID, the first contact you had about giving information about the French? 
A.	I no longer remember his name, but I can find it.  I can find his name because that person is a native of a neighbouring area.  I know that my younger brother knows that person and knows his name; therefore, I can look for his name.  I am not making up anything; that person actually exists.  
Q.	And what is the name of that person who you say was the chairman of Ibuka, who also contacted you about testifying regarding the French? 
A.	His name is Rwasibo, which is written R-W-A-S-I-B-O, Rwasibo.  
Q.	And when you met with Mr. Rwasibo, what did he tell you? 
A.	On the first occasion, he had me called so that I could give him copies of my statements which I had given before this Tribunal.  I told him that I did not have them and I told him that I had copies of evidence which I had given before Rwandan courts.  So I gave him such copies.  Later on, he told me that that was not enough and that what interested him were documents related to the Arusha Tribunal, and I told him that I did not have any such documents due to security reasons.  He explained to me that they needed such documents and that they wanted to keep them so that they would see how different witnesses will testify.  Later, he asked me whether I was in contact with the prosecutor general.  I told him that I knew the prosecutor general, and he told me that he would contact that prosecutor so that the prosecutor general could give the documents which he needed.  

	After that, he had me called once again, and he told me that he wanted to know people who could give evidence against the French.  I told him that I did not know them, but he said that I had to do it, because if we had decided to speak the truth and cooperate with them, then I had to look for witnesses.  He explained to me that most members of the Ibuka were not in Rwanda during the events, therefore, they needed our services.  I told him that I knew a former gendarme, and I gave him the name of that former gendarme.  I told him that maybe that gendarme could know something about the French.  We went together on the motorbike and gave -- showed him the gendarme in question, but that former gendarme told him that he knew nothing about the French.  And the Ibuka chairman went into a rage and told me that I should give evidence at all costs and cooperate with another witness in order to seek all information concerning the French.  

That witness exists, and I know that he has been contacted by the investigators of this Tribunal in connection with the Bizimungu trial and another trial.  I know that that witness has already testified before this Tribunal.  I know that he is one of the people in that group who has to give the same testimony.  

Later, I realised that that CID officer had already contacted the other witness, and I realised that the situation overwhelmed me because I could not say anything about the French because I did not know anything about the French.  I was frightened and I realised that my -- I could also be endangering my life.  When you are often used, you just say about anything, and you lose your credibility.  And even those people who have used you will come to the realisation that you can turn against them.  They can even make you disappear for those reasons.  I, therefore, realised that my life was in danger, and I wanted to protect myself and, therefore, I left.  
Q.	Now, the person that you had contacted the witness concerning giving evidence against the French and to the one who has given testimony here, is that person's name on numbers one through five of the list you previously made? 
A.	No, his name is not on this list.  There are many people that I have not mentioned, but I am giving you the names as in the process of you putting questions to me.  But I am saying that he has been contacted by investigators.  I do not know whether he has already testified, or he will come later to testify.  I know that he has been interviewed by investigators with regard to trials before this Tribunal.  I also know that he is one of the witnesses who are giving false testimonies based on evidence given previously by other witnesses.  
Q.	Okay.  I am going to ask you to write his name just in case he has testified as a protected witness.  
	I think it's the safest thing, to just put his name on paper, instead of saying it publicly.  So if the registry can give you a piece of paper, I will ask you to write down that person's name.  

And whilst that's being circulated, I will just go onto a slightly different subject.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I will ask that the piece of paper that the witness has written the latest name down be admitted under seal as D. NZ459.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ459 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	After you testified in Mr. Nzirorera's trial in June of 2006, when you returned to Rwanda, did there come a time when Gacaca proceedings commenced again involving you? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And can you tell us how that came about? 
A.	I had already been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.  I was waiting for a decision by another court, so the trials were still ongoing.  We were waiting for a decision from another court.  
Q.	Which court was that? 
A.	It was the Busogo Gacaca court or the Rwigomvu Gacaca court, thus in the same region, that is, the Mukingo region.  
Q.	And did you have another trial in Gacaca, or did you receive notice that you would have another trial in Gacaca? 
A.	Before Gacaca courts, everything depends on the charges against you, or they depend on witnesses testifying against you.  I had heard about it because before the actual trial you have a phase where information is collected, and it was said that in 1994, I, and other people, had taken money from other people, but the main perpetrator had asserted that I was not there and I was not a member of that group.  And then there was someone also who accused us of having pursued his wife, who was a Tutsi, but investigations showed that the wife in question had passed away in 1992.  So, things were still at the investigation phase, and we did not know whether the matter would be brought before Gacaca courts.  So, at that time, I was still waiting.  
Q.	Do you know whether -- or, before you left Rwanda, did you receive any other sentence or have any other trial in Gacaca? 
A.	No.  Before my departure from Rwanda, I had been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment once, but I had not yet been summoned for another case.  I was aware of that information, but I did not know whether a trial would be held or not.  But two members of my family are still being prosecuted before Gacaca courts, and their cases are important cases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, how much more time do you envisage?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think about 30 minutes, or so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, while you were in Rwanda dealing with various prosecutors and other officials, did you ever have any contact with the prosecutor by the name of Tharcisse Karugaruma?  K-A-R-U-G-A-R-U-M-A.  
A.	I know Tharcisse Karugaruma; however, I have never talked to him.
Q.	And, to your knowledge, was he involved in the recruiting of people to make false accusations against those in Arusha? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry.  If Mr. Robinson could lay a little bit more foundation for this -- this line of questioning.  
I think you are going up beyond Ruhengeri now, and if that's the case, let's hear how the witness would know any of this information.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I can do that.  Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us, what was the position of Tharcisse Karugaruma in Rwanda when you were in prison? 
A.	Tharcisse Karugaruma was the chief prosecutor of the Ruhengeri prosecutor's office.  At a later stage, he worked for the Gacaca courts.  I believe that he is currently minister of justice.  He was the prosecutor general, in fact.
Q.	And you have told us that members of the prosecutor's office in Ruhengeri were asking you to falsely accuse those in Arusha.  Do you know of any involvement of Mr. Karugaruma in that? 
A.	I gave you the name of the prosecutor.  At the time I was requested to make or give a false testimony, 
	I do not know whether he contacted Mr. Karugaruma -- was contacted before that, or not, but he asked me to replace him.  
Q.	I didn't understand that last answer, "He asked me to replace him."  What does that mean?  Maybe we have a translation error.  
A.	Here is what I just said.  I talked with his replacement, i.e., the person who replaced him at the post of prosecutor general.  I have already provided you with his name.  I do not know whether the previous witness had testified when Karugaruma was still prosecutor general or not, and, in that case, he would have been the one to contact them.  I know that before coming to testify in Arusha, it was via the intermediary of the prosecutor general or the state prosecutor that the investigators can enter into contact with prisoners.  Preparations were made at either the level of the prosecutor general or the state prosecutor.  So I have never talked with Mr. Karugaruma.  However, I talked with the person who replaced him in the post of prosecutor general.  
Q.	Can you give us that person's name again? 
A.	I have already provided you with this name in writing.  I believe that it was this individual who had replaced Tharcisse Karugaruma at this -- in his post, if my memory serves me correctly, because this person was prosecutor general when we discussed or had a discussion together.  
Q.	Okay.  I understand that that name is already an exhibit.  Okay.  Now, can you tell us why it was that you decided to leave Rwanda? 
A.	There are a number of reasons behind this.  Firstly, this had been an issue which had arisen here, of which I had not been informed, however, at the time of its occurrence.  There was one witness who had appeared before this Tribunal who talked about this to me subsequently, and he said that they decided not to take care -- I mean, he might end up behind bars for this, and that would even encourage the CID officers and other officers from the police to come and interview me.  

Secondly, the police, of which some members were informed of what we had said before this very Tribunal, and of which some were behind our placement in detention, asked that I provide them with the text of my testimony, or, at least, explain to them the points I had raised during my testimonies.  

Thirdly, officers of the international agency of security, international security agencies through the Ibuka association in Ruhengeri préfecture, who were, therefore, members or employees of the international security agency, asked that I hand over to Ibuka the text of my testimony and said that if I was not prepared to do so, they would use their own means to go about getting hold of my testimony.  They even contacted the former prosecutor general, who, subsequently, became an officer of the prosecutor's office with a view to getting hold of my testimony.  

Subsequently, as I have already said to you, the same person got in contact with me requesting that I come and testify against the French.  I was asked to go and find remains of shells that the French might have used, and I understood that I could not back out of this case knowing that the witnesses used by the security services either disappeared, or were put in prison.  I understood that I was risking a great deal if I went on collaborating with those services.  And, in view of the fact that the cases of my family members had drawn to a close, I thought it was best that I leave the country, especially since all the members of my family had already finished their trials and as all the other witnesses like me had collaborated and had then been put in prison, I thought I was up against the same fate.  

So, in view of the threats that were being preferred against my person by the CID, by the -- also the military intelligence services and members of the public, I realised that I could not face up to all these threats coming at me from various sides.

	1510H
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	In August 2006. 
Q.	Have you subsequently learned that additional sentences have been imposed on you in Gacaca? 
A.	Yes, subsequently people came and told me that other sentences had been imposed on me in absentia.  And even if those people did not explain everything to me, they told me that after my departure I had had other sentences imposed upon me.  And this did not come as a surprise because I had already collaborated.  I had done what those services approached me and asked me to do, and I was useless now.  And I couldn't even testify against the French.  

And my situation was a difficult one because I could no longer stay in the country after the other witnesses, for whom their trials had come to a close, had also been prosecuted in other trials and subsequently sentences, prison sentences, had been imposed upon them.  So I thought that I could not hope for a better fate than theirs. 
Q.	Do you know how many years you have now been sentenced to by Gacaca in absentia? 
A.	The persons who contacted me did not inform me about the sentence imposed upon me. 
Q.	In August of 2007 did you write a letter to the President of the ICTR asking to meet defence lawyers in cases in which you have given testimony? 
A.	Yes, I did write this letter addressed to the President of this Tribunal.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, that letter is number 1 in my packet of exhibits, and I will offer that as Exhibit D. NZ460 under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ460 admitted, under seal)
MR. WEBSTER:
I wonder if Mr. Robinson would clarify how that letter came into his possession.  Did it come from the President's office or by some other means?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, when he calls me as a witness I can do that.  Even I don't remember.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, after you had written that letter in August of 2007, did there come a time in February of 2008 when you participated in an interview between the Defence teams of Bicamumpaka and the Prosecutor which was videotaped? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.

MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, my exhibit number 2 in my packet of documents is the language section's translation of this videotape, and I would offer it as Exhibit D. NZ461, under seal.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ461 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	After you gave that interview in February of 2008, did you have any contact with any other members of either the Defence team or the Prosecution -- any Defence team or the Prosecution before coming to give your testimony again on Thursday? 
A.	No, I only saw the person who came to pick me up.  I also had other telephone calls or conversations before my journey.  However, I believe that the people who contacted me by telephone is in fact the person who came to pick me up, and the person who came to pick me up in the safe house worked for WVSS. 
Q.	Okay.  And can you tell us why you decided to come forward and admit that you had lied in these trials? 
A.	Yes, there are reasons.  When one does something, one does not forget what it is.  When it is positive, one does not forget it as such.  If it is negative, one might feel regret.  And in my case, I wanted to re-establish the truth and at the same time wanted to cleanse my reputation, because in my testimony I had admitted to killing people and this might have even been used against me.  And that might be information that might be recuperated by those individuals who had requested that I make false testimony by those accused before this Tribunal.  

I did not believe that one day I might testify before this Tribunal.  I thought that I would do so in writing.  However, I still carried on, regretting what I had done.  And those people who used me might use my false testimony against me.  And even if I was not prosecuted by the services who had influenced me because I might say the truth, they might, however, recuperate the information of the claims I had made before the Trial Chamber and used them against me because I had admitted to killing certain people, even if this was not the truth.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Are there any other Defence team that wishes to cross-examine this witness?  
MR. WEYL:  
	Mr. President, I would have a number of questions to put to the witness.  I believe that I have about half an hour's worth maximum.  Would you like me to do so before the midafternoon break or afterwards?  I leave that to your discretion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you could straddle the break.  If you started now you'd have about 8 minutes and then we could break at 3:30.   

We'll take the break now.  We'll take 15 minutes.  We will break for our midafternoon recess, 15 minutes.  
	(Court recessed from 1525H to 1550H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are now to respond to questions put to you by counsel representing Ngirumpatse, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my name is Frédéric Weyl, one of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's lawyers.  

Mr. Witness, I think that you will recall your previous appearance before the Trial Chamber in June 2006 we cross-examined you for about one day.  Do you remember that phase of your testimony in June 2006? 
A.	I remember, Counsel.  I remember that you cross-examined me.  
Q.	You will undoubtedly remember that I was particularly placing emphasis on highlighting contradictions between your prior statements in the testimony, and we had quite strong exchanges in that regard.  Do you remember that?  
A.	What I remember and what I confirm is that there are indeed many inconsistencies in my prior statements and testimonies.   
Q.	And in June 2006 I told you what you had told this Court last Thursday, namely, it's difficult to narrate several times the same story with the same details when such a story is invented.
A.	You're right, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm very pleased to hear you confirming that, and to hear you admit that there were many contradictions in your prior statements.  However, I would like to ask you for clarification regarding the conditions in which the Office of the Prosecutor proceeded in preparing you when you appeared before the Trial Chamber -- or rather before you appeared before the Trial Chamber.  The Office of the Prosecutor, or rather Mr. Webster, more specifically, because he was the one who prepped you, must have pointed out the inconsistencies between your various statements.  Am I right in saying that? 
A.	The inconsistencies are obvious.  He asked me questions, and I gave him some reasons similar to the ones that I gave you.  But, as a matter of fact, I did not give him the main reason for those contradictions because I did not want to show him that what I was saying was not the truth.  I did not want him to understand that I was obeying other people who had sent me here.  Otherwise, the contradictions are obvious.  And we were trying to give explanations by saying that they were due to memory lapses or maybe not so not well taken.  But I do agree with you, you cannot always give the same account several times in detail, particularly when you're telling lies. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I'm sorry for having to interrupt the testimony of this witness.  I just wanted to inform you that my client Mr. Karemera has a medical appointment, and I am seeking authorisation from you to continue sitting in his absence, of course, with your leave. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to briefly refer to some of your statements during your interview of 8 February 2008, which were referred to by my learned friend Mr. Robinson earlier on.  Do you remember your statements during that interview? 
A.	I answered in general questions put to me during that interview.  I talked about Bicamumpaka, and I said that what I had said in my testimony in his case, what I said were lies.  And I also said that the testimony which I had given in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Nzirorera was not quite the truth.  I also answered questions regarding my safety.  But I cannot remember the contents of the statement in detail. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, specifically at one point in time you said, more or less, before this Trial Chamber that, and I quote, "Before Gacaca court I confessed to the acts which I have committed.  However, in my testimony against people accused in Arusha, I added other information.  I added acts which I had not committed so that my testimony would be more reliable."  Do you confirm this? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, further down you say, "We believe that these statements would be used only in Arusha, and that is why we admitted to having committed things which we did not commit in order to make our testimonies credible."  Is that right? 
A.	I can confirm that fact, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, if the Gacaca courts were to learn what you have stated before this Trial Chamber, before the Tribunal or before the Office of the Prosecution before testifying, your guilty plea, if it was not complete or if it is incomplete or has not been completed in any manner, would that then make your guilty plea not acceptable? 
A.	Were the Gacaca courts to learn the contents of my testimony here, then my confession would be incomplete because there are new elements which have been added to my confession in the sense that I have admitted to playing a role in other facts and events, which I did not include in my confession.  I also mentioned having taken part in the meetings with a view to showing my presence there, and so thereby saying that I was able to follow the acts of the Accused.  And this would certainly have an impact because I might then take the risk of being reclassified in a superior category, whereas the accusations levelled against me previously were not quite as severe.  

You know, it is difficult to admit to a crime which one has not committed when there are other important reasons, and that is why I wanted to specify that we had been approached by the judicial authorities who had asked us to bring new elements or details to our statements with a view to laying more charges at the door of those accused before this Tribunal.  And they said that in so doing we would not run any risk because our testimony and our statements before the Tribunal would not have any bearing upon our trials, our respective trials, in Rwanda. 
Q.	Yet, in fact, the statements you made before this Tribunal in June 2006 might have exposed you to further prosecution in Rwanda, is that not correct? 
A.	I am not sure that the new charges have a bearing upon or are linked to the statements I made before this Tribunal.  I do not know whether the contents of those statements have been translated to the Rwandan jurisdictions.  However, when I left the country I was not informed of that fact.  I know that the Rwandan courts were preparing to request for those statements to be transferred because those officials who had requested that I come and testify against the accused had requested this.  However, I am of the opinion that what I have done might have an impact upon my trial and that this might backfire.  And what is more, that is the plan of those individuals who had used us. 
Q.	Is it these worries that might lead the Prosecution witnesses to testify anonymously under pseudonym? 
A.	Yes, that is the main reason, because if these statements provided by the Prosecution witnesses before this Tribunal were transmitted to the Gacaca courts, it would indeed have an impact on the trials of the witnesses before those courts.  So that is why they prefer to testify under a pseudonym.  And when one starts testifying before this Tribunal, one makes enemies, of course.  Depending on the case one is testifying in, one does attract certain animosity, and that is why people tend to prefer to testify under a pseudonym because those individuals who know about the cases will then not know about the testimony provided before this Tribunal. 
Q.	Witness, in your statements dated the 8th of February 2008, you also went on to say the following:  "When you are in Rwanda and you become a Defence witness, people see you badly and they treat you differently.  I have an example in the person of one of my friends who was virtually beaten to death."  Can you confirm this fact? 
A.	I can confirm that fact, Counsel.  The individual I mentioned had problems.  This individual was beaten and then thrown in prison.  This person had been called to testify during the genocide commemoration period whilst people were being buried.  And people turned up and started beating this individual.  A few days later that person was placed in detention and is still behind bars today. 
Q.	Witness, I have nearly come to an end, with reference to my commitment made to the Trial Chamber in terms of time, because I also believe you have been very clear, Witness.  

I would like to summarise in order to ascertain whether I have understood you correctly.  So, if you pleaded guilty in Rwanda, it was with a view to benefitting from a treatment less painful and also with a view to obtaining a number of benefits, is that not correct? 
A.	I pleaded guilty essentially for two reasons.  I pleaded guilty in order to benefit from a reduction of sentence.  And for my guilty plea to be admitted, I accepted therefore to collaborate and to follow the instructions given to me, and this with a view to having my confession accepted.

	1610H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	And once you embarked upon this road, it is no longer possible to turn back now, is it?  
A.	Once one has embarked on this road, one can no longer turn back.  It would be a contradiction in terms.  And even when the confession is not accepted, the documents still exist, and they are used during the trial.  So, one can no longer turn back.  
Q.	Witness, it is because you had been caught in a trap, and because you were not a free man, that you lied during your previous testimonies; is that not correct?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Weyl's question -- I understand he's coming to the end, but he's actually testifying for the witness and I don't think that's the objective for this examination.  
MR. WEYL:
I am putting a question to the witness which he is capable of responding to.  
THE WITNESS:
Could you please repeat your question, Counsel?  I did not quite grasp it.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, it is because you were caught in a trap, and because you were no longer a free man, that you lied before this Tribunal during your previous testimonies; is that not correct?  
A.	That is correct.  I had been in detention for quite some years.  And in such a situation, you are ready to do anything requested of you in order to be released.  And that is why I accepted to appear and to testify in the manner I did before this Tribunal, because pressure was being exacted upon my person and I found myself in an uncomfortable situation.  However, had I had the choice, I would not have come and lied to this Tribunal.  If I did so, it was because I could no longer put up any resistance to the pressure exacted upon me, as I have already explained to you.
Q.	Witness, I have come to an end of my cross-examination, and may I say and congratulate --
	(Microphone not activated) 
MR. WEYL:
     Mr. President, can you hear me now?  

As I was saying, as an aside, this is highly symbolical that I was interrupted at a time when I wanted to hail the courage of the witness and thank him for having testified this morning -- this afternoon -- in order to speak the words of a brilliant man.
MR. SOW:  
	Obliged, Mr. President.  I wanted to cross-examine the witness myself.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	You will probably remember who I am.  I am Counsel Moussa Félix Sow, and I am co-counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera.  

In the month of June, I cross-examined you.  And in view of the fact that you have returned today, then you are providing me with an opportunity to put a number of questions to you.  These questions will have a bearing, essentially, upon your status as prosecution witness.  And I would also like you to provide me with details as to the preparation for your testimony before you came to testify before the Tribunal.  

Could you, please, confirm to me, Witness, that in order to be a prosecution witness, you are initially requested to make your -- or, enter your guilty plea and your confession; is that true?  
A.	In my case, this is what was requested of me beforehand.  These were two procedures that went hand in hand.  And this is one of the means used.  You cannot be requested to be a prosecution witness with a view to being released; subsequently, this is virtually impossible.  However, all potential witnesses are requested to enter a guilty plea and to make a confession with a view to obtaining a promise that if he then agrees to go and testify for the Prosecution, this will have a positive influence upon his trial.  And the same situation applies for the other witnesses.  

However, the situation may differ if one is a witness sent by Ibuka.  It may be that they have another procedure to follow in order to prepare their witnesses. Ibuka is an association of which one of the objectives is to provide Prosecution testimony against the accused persons before this Tribunal.  But, in my case, I was requested to enter a guilty plea and to make a confession beforehand.  
Q.	Witness, today you said that you were part of quite a large group which was located at the solidarity camp comprising witnesses -- prosecution witnesses, that is; is that correct?  
A.	You might not have understood me quite correctly, Counsel.  I was explaining that some witnesses were in prison with me, and that we shared the status of witnesses before this Tribunal.  However, at the solidarity camp, we were more numerous, and we came from different groups.  However, the people who were in the solidarity camps were not necessarily those people who were in the group of witnesses.  I would need to add that the witnesses were individuals who had entered a guilty plea and who had, therefore, admitted to their crimes.
Q.	Witness, can you confirm that in order to make his or her testimony more credible, a prosecution witness will accept to admit to crimes he or she committed in order to, subsequently, say that he committed these crimes under the instructions of an accused?  
A.	Yes, I can confirm this fact, because when you enter a guilty plea, and when you are a potential witness, then this gives further credibility to the testimony that this person might provide.  Because, in such a case, one is testifying as an eyewitness, which makes the testimony that much more 
	credible -- or, let us say that such a testimony is more credible than one that might be provided than somebody who was at the site of the crime.  This is done with a view to proving that there are individuals who encourage or sensitise others to commit crimes.  And that is what the Rwandan government intends to do by asking potential witnesses to enter a guilty plea saying that this will be beneficial to the witness, him or herself, but also will help to prove that the genocide was prepared, and that this is proven, therefore, by the existence of those individuals who admit to having committed a crime, and admits that preparation, there was.  Because, the truth is that those individuals we come to testify against here are individuals we might not even have (unintelligible) at the time of the events.  

However, during our preparation, the individuals who are versed in law prepare us -- help us to prepare our testimony, and they ask us to admit to the role we played in the events, even if we never actually took part in these events; and this is with a view to giving what we say further weight.  
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, the aim is to actually aim at the superior command individuals, or to establish command responsibility?  
A.	Indeed.  
Q.	Witness, I shall go over with you the preparation circumstances for a prosecution witness in a joint-accused case.  Now, by joint-accused case, I mean that this is a trial where there are a number of accused, as is the situation in this trial, that is, Karemera et al. 

Now, according to what you said, you had distributed roles amongst yourselves.  Your role was to incriminate Joseph Nzirorera.  So, I wanted to ask you, still in the context of the preparation, those are those who were supposed to testify, Édouard Karemera or Mathieu Ngirumpatse; did you have the possibility to know anything about this, or was anything said to you about the other accused here in this case?  
A.	As I have already stated, there are witnesses who testified against Nzirorera, but also against other accused such as Augustin Bizimungu, Setako, Kajelijeli.  These are the accused whose names I have heard mentioned.  I have heard witnesses talk about these, and I believe that this is the same for other cases.  There were lists of names of former officials in the region, or who hailed from the region, and each witness would choose an accused against whom he would -- or, she would -- testify.  I have already given you those names because I have proof, and because I talked to the witnesses who testified against those individuals.  

So, I have given you the names of those individuals I know.  However, I did talk to another witness who testified against Ngirumpatse who had came from Kigali prison.  I believe I came across him on two or three occasions here.  However, there is a list of accused that is shown to you, and then each and every person chooses a name and chooses a name of the person they're going to testify against.  
Q.	Were I to ask you to write on a piece of paper the name of this witness, would you be a position to do so? 
A.	I do not know his name, but I can describe him to you.  And what I can say to you is that he was quite a reserved individual; he did not talk much.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  

Now, Witness, I know that you came to testify against Joseph Nzirorera.  Now, before coming, and in the context of the preparation, were you told that counsel representing other accused might also put questions to you?  
A.	Yes, I was told that when I came to testify on the first occasion.  I was told that any party might put questions to me in view of the fact that it was a joint-accused trial.  I had been told that fact.  However, on this occasion, when I came to testify, I did not know that I was coming to talk about Nzirorera.  I thought I was coming from the Bicamumpaka case because I had talked to the defence counsel for Bicamumpaka recently, and to my surprise, I was brought here.  And I answered the questions put to me.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, still within the context of preparation, were you told what attitude you should adopt, vis-â-vis, MRND?  
A.	That is something which is well known.  We were told that we had to accuse those people of having prepared activities of MRND and of having committed crimes.  So, we were to say that we were Interahamwes in order to confirm what you're saying; because, when you're talking about MRND, you have to prove that one has a connection with MRND.  So we had to say that we were Interahamwes, we had joined the Interahamwes in such and such a manner.  So I said that I was an Interahamwe, whereas that was not true.  I said that I had an Interahamwe card, whereas this was never the case.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, in June 2006, when I asked you questions regarding your belonging to MRND, you told me that you remained in the MRND because you were afraid of being described as an enemy.  Should I then understand that that assertion was not true? 
A.	What I can say is that I participated in those activities because I was afraid; that is true.  However, one could be a member of MRND, just like one could be a member of any other party.  You could take a membership card of MRND because that was the most well-known party.  When I said that I was afraid, what I meant is that I was afraid and, therefore, I participated in the activities of Interahamwe.  It is true that I was afraid, but that is not why I joined the MRND.  I joined the MRND because I knew the MRND party; I made that choice.  

Now, with regard to the offences I committed, I committed the offences because I was afraid of being considered to be an enemy.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, still with respect to your preparation, were you told what answers you should give when you are asked about the activities of RPF during the war? 
A.	In general, you were told what you should say.  You see, RPF is on one side, the accused are on the other side.  So, you're, in brief, told what you should say and, therefore, it is up to you to choose the exact words which you are going to use.  

Furthermore, certain witnesses who came here before me told me how they had answered some questions.  Before coming here, we were told to go and contact other witnesses so that we could learn how to go about things in case of problems -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you give us some examples of answers which were normally suggested to you when it came to talking about RPF, or when it came to avoiding talking about the RPF?  
A.	I can give an example.  Now I'm no longer under the control of the RPF, so I can talk about the crimes that the RPF committed.  But if I know that I'm under the RPF control, I cannot say anything in that regard.  

In short, we are told that we should heap responsibility of everything that had been done on MRND and its leaders, and to say that the new regime is better socially, politically.  So we are told that we have to accuse MRND of all evil, and to say that RPF did not do anything wrong. 

So, since you're intelligent, it's up to you to know what you're going to say, particularly since after your testimony you're going to return to RPF control.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you know that you have come here to testify before a court, before judges, and you knew in advance that you're not going to speak the truth because you're under duress.  And you explained to us that -- how things were done.  And now, with regard to preparation, what is the attitude regarding the answers suggested to you when you have been summoned to come here before the Tribunal?  
A.	We were told that the judges here cannot question our testimonies, and we were told that judges would only listen to our testimonies, and that it was only later that they were going to assess the testimonies; and in order for people not to know that we're lying, witnesses would meet and discuss points which we are going to raise in our testimonies.  For example, they can say that I was in a meeting with someone, and another witness will corroborate what you said.  So, each witness confirms the lies of another witness.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, on several occasions, we have examined witnesses here and asked them whether they have discussed their testimonies with other witnesses, and they have been answering us that they have not discussed their testimonies with anyone else.  

So, is this also part of the advice which you're given during your preparation?  
A.	Witnesses are not stupid.  If they know that we are not supposed to discuss our testimonies with anyone, even if you discuss your testimony with someone else, you're not going to admit it before the Tribunal, because that would be prejudicial to the credibility of the concerned witness.  So, often witnesses say that they did not discuss their testimonies with anyone.  However, I can give you an example of a testimony which was given by another witness -- I can tell you such and such a person said this, whereas such a person would come here and say he did not discuss his testimony with anyone else, and that would be a lie.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, the last question:  In view of the testimonies which you gave under duress, as you have said, and maybe testimonies which have led to the conviction of some people -- which, in your conscience and soul, you know that they have not done anything wrong.  So, what does this situation create in your conscience?  
A.	God has helped me.  And I think that Kajelijeli was convicted before I testified against him.  I think that no one else has been convicted subsequent to my testimony against them.  And if that had been the case, I would beg for forgiveness, because what I had said would not have been the truth.  It's very serious to have someone convicted for something he or she did not commit, because God -- God is more important.  He is above governmental authorities.  

Even if someone has not been convicted or sentenced to imprisonment, but the accusations cause him to be beaten up, that is really a shame.  So, this is why I have decided to come here again, so that no one should be convicted because of my fault.  Me, too, I confessed to having committed crimes which I did not commit.  I confessed that I had killed people, whereas this was not the case.  And that has harmed my reputation.  And that is very serious.  It's very serious when one gives false evidence, because that has many repercussions.  

I know that even in law one can ask for forgiveness and be forgiven.  I believe that I have acted in good time.  So as to avoid serious problems arising, I think that it's better to speak the truth, rather than to give false testimony, be it against other accused, or be it against myself.

1645H 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to thank you.  I have listened to you attentively.  I hope the Trial Chamber has also listened to you carefully.  And may the Almighty God guard you.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I have completed my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Is there any redirect?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Should I?  The Court is in a good mood.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sir.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, it would be very brief. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I think the technicians put on the wrong microphone on Mr. Webster's right-hand side, sir.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, of course, there will be a brief redirect examination.  Of course, brief is a relative term.  I don't think we will end today, even though that would be nice, but I will proceed, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, you may proceed.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay, Your Honour.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. BTH, we meet again. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You can look at me.  

Do you agree with Mr. Weyl when he ended his cross-examination?  Mr. Weyl said that you are a courageous man.  Do you agree with him? 
A.	I think that Mr. Weyl has his reasons for saying so.  Maybe you see things differently, but it is not 
easy -- or, rather, it would not -- it would not be easy to find witnesses who act like me, take the same decisions, as I did, that is, to admit that they have come here to give false testimony on their own volition.  I think everyone is entitled to see things in his or her own way, according to his or her interest.  That is what I can tell you.  
Q.	Well, that's perhaps the key to it, the whole question of one's interest.  Were you being courageous on the morning of the 7th of April when you joined a mob and bludgeoned someone to death?  Was that an act of courage? 
A.	I did not commit the crime you are talking about.  I did not kill anyone with a club.  I did not kill anyone.  I think this is the first time that you are saying so.  When I was here, you never talked about that.  What I did during that period was that I tried to save one of my parents -- or, rather, relative.  That was one courageous act on my part, but when one takes the decision to tell the truth, then, I think that is a courageous act. 
Q.	Well, BTH, I am just going by what I heard you say earlier during your testimony.  You say that you were on the scene when Rukara was bludgeoned to death by your friend -- I don't want to say the name.  It is number 4 on our list.  That's what you said.  

You also said that you drove a car load of militiamen -- Interahamwes it's how you used to describe them, but we can call them agricultural -- an agricultural organisation, if that's the term you want to use today.  You drove them around when they set about killing a whole community in Musomba.  Isn't that what you said?  Isn't that what you admitted in your plea? 
A.	That is true.  However, you have just said that I had bludgeoned someone, but I did not kill anyone.  I asked for forgiveness in relation to acts which I had committed.  It is true that I helped killers against my will or my wish.  I followed their orders, but you have to understand that sometimes you can commit an act without wishing to do so, because you are following orders to do something.  But I am not happy when I talk about what happened 14 years ago.  I'll rather talk about something else.  I think that I should be convicted for what I did, but things have to be clear.  I do not want to have any problem with anyone at all.  I was asked to come and tell lies here.  I do not know what will happen to me later.  Maybe whether -- God's help, I can find a shelter somewhere. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you look back at your testimony in four trials; your testimony in this case in 2004, and, again, in June of 2006, in the Bizimungu trial, wouldn't you agree that, really, the only thing that has changed is that you have surgically excised Kajelijeli and Nzirorera from your account of the killings that took place in (inaudible).  You are still saying that the Interahamwe killed people; you are still saying that you participated.  The only difference now is that you carefully excised the Accused person sitting right across the courtroom? 
A.	My testimony was very long with regard to Kajelijeli, Nzirorera and other accused persons.  So, I changed parts of the testimony which were not truthful, but it's true that people died.  But to say that those people died after a meeting by Nzirorera, is not true.  That is a lie.  Certain witnesses say that Nzirorera was there in the evening, others say that he was there in the morning, and I can explain to you the contradictions made by those witnesses.  We tell a lot of lies because we have been prepped to speak -- to tell those lies; to give false testimony. 
Q.	Let's just focus on the crime for right now.  You are not saying that the Bagogwe were not attacked in 1991 and 1992 and 1993.  That actually happened.  That's consistent with your evidence from 2006 whether Rudatinya was abducted; when the Bagogwe were attacked in 1993, 1992 and 1991.  All of that is true; is it not?  Just tell me if it was true or not.  
A.	The Bagogwes were attacked, but I have to tell you something.  In our statements and testimonies -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I know that this is Mr. Webster's first cross-examination, but I think that he has to stick to rules that were set down for all of us.  First of all, I want to object to his question, compound.  So when he asked whether something is true and put ten propositions to a witness, it is not possible to be answered correctly and accurately.  So I object to his question as compound, and I would ask that he refrain from interrupting the witness just as we refrained from interrupting the 
29 witnesses who testified on his behalf.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
Well, first of all, it is not my first cross-examination.  And, if Mr. Robinson is concerned about compound questions, he should have been honest on his feet 10 minutes ago.  Now, I proceed.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are not denying that these attacks against the Bagogwe in your community were perpetrated by militias from your community, are you?  Just answer yes or no, please.  
A.	I think that we have to agree on one thing before I answer your question, Mr. Prosecutor.  This is not the first time that you are asking me questions.  And you know that with -- we've already come across this kind of situation.  You are asking me questions -- I think that you should give me the opportunity to elucidate, instead of asking me to answer you with a simple yes or a simple no.  Even if you are not satisfied with my answers, I think that you should be satisfied with my answers, and, therefore, under these conditions, we should be able to agree with one another.  

Now, let me go back to your question.  I have to say that there were Tutsis who were attacked, including the Bagogwe, but the way we talked about those events included involving people who 
were -- or implicating people who did not participate in the attacks, we claimed that such-and-such a person gave orders for the attacks to be carried out, whereas such things never existed.  We can even claim that we arrested such-and-such a person and handed him to someone else, whereas such a thing never took place.  

I would tell you that the reason I am here before the Trial Chamber today is not to deny that people died.  What I would like to do today is to speak the truth regarding what happened and explain the exact circumstances in which those people were killed. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, both for yourself and the witness, need to assist the recording of the process.  Witness, in particular, if you are speaking much too quickly, to assist the recording to be recorded properly.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, I am accepting, for the time being, your proposition.  And just for the purpose of this portion of our examination, that Kajelijeli and Nzirorera were not ordering those killings.  That is not what my question is focused.  I am asking you, you've already answered that killings took place against the Bagogwe and the Tutsi in your community prior to 1994.  Now, I would like to ask you about 1994.  It is true, isn't it, that in Busogo, the overwhelming majority of Tutsi in your community were killed on the 7th and 8th of April at the parish; in their homes, that's true?  Would you agree? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And they were killed by militias from your community, that's true? 
A.	As I have already stated, it was the militia who did this, but even the members of the public also took part, and I believe that we should say, rather, that the victims were killed by their neighbours. 
Q.	Their neighbours who were organised into militias, and who attacked them with axes, clubs, guns and whatever was available.  That's true? 
A.	According to the orders given, many members of the public took part in these killings without this actually being originally their wish.  There were people who took part in these attacks with a view to looting possessions, and it would not be surprising if you were told that people took part in the killings and today are being prosecuted, whereas they never belonged to the same association, and if these persons had ever collaborated beforehand.  I believe that taking part in the attack was with reference to people's state of mind, and there were those who took part and it depended upon the assailants.  There were those individuals who had different reasons for doing so. 
Q.	My question to you, Mr. Witness, was very specific because you, during your direct examination from Mr. Robinson, or during Mr. Robinson's portion of his examination, talked about an agricultural collective, who were turned into -- turned themselves into a militia of which number four on the list was the president.  That's what I am talking about.  

Now, my question to you is that those people, who were part of that militia, committed the devastation in Busogo and Rwankeli on the 7th and 8th of April.  You can answer that just by saying yes, or if you don't agree, you can say so.  But it doesn't require a long explanation.  This is going right back to what you, yourself, said yesterday, excuse me, on Thursday.  
A.	In a few words, the names I gave are the names of some of the individuals who committed these acts, but I also told you that we met other individuals in Busogo parish and that those people in military attire also committed killings or perpetrated killings, and I went on to say that these individuals in uniform were not known in the region.  So, I cannot say that these crimes were committed solely by those individuals under the command of that individual at number 4 on the list, because there were other assailants who were in military uniform, who, at a certain moment in time, perpetrated killings. 
Q.	And when the Bagogwe were attacked in 1992 and 1993, the same militia, under the leadership of the militia, participated in those attacks; isn't that true? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, you told us that those attacks did not require -- were not preceded by orders from Kajelijeli or Nzirorera.  But my question to you now is whether Kajelijeli was aware of those attacks back in 1992 and 1993? 
A.	I cannot confirm whether he was informed of this or not, and under which circumstances or in which context he was informed.  He was the bourgmestre of the commune and I cannot deny the fact that the communal officials might have been informed of these attacks.  However, the attack did take place and the gendarmerie had to get involved in order to protect the victims.  The gendarmerie was part of the state security apparel, and the gendarmerie were invited to protect those individuals who had come under attack because the information had reached the officials. 
Q.	And are you suggesting that Kajelijeli, as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, would be on hand in 1993, when gendarmes are intervening to protect the Bagogwe and not know that they had been attacked?  That's your evidence?  It's a simple question.  Did Kajelijeli know of these attacks back in 1993? 
A.	I cannot answer with respect to the period 1993 because I no longer know at what date Kajelijeli ceased to be bourgmestre.  My answer was, therefore, formulated in a general manner.  He could not be unaware of the fact that they had come under attack because the members of the public were the ones who were supposed to be in control, and when those attacks did occur, the state did take control.  
Q.	Yes, and in 1992, when he was definitely the bourgmestre, he must have been aware of the attacks then.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	I have already answered your question, Counsel.  I said that the officials were aware of the attacks, but I can't tell you who informed Kajelijeli, and I can't even tell you whether he was present on site.  However, I said that, by and large, as bourgmestre of the commune, he should have been informed of attacks launched against part of the population of his commune.  And as I have already said, measures were taken with a view to protecting the victims.  

But in order to complete my answer, I cannot confirm one hundred percent that he was, indeed, informed, especially because I was not present when the information was given to him, if ever it was.  
Q.	Well, what about Nzirorera who was a figure of national authority, at the time, if you think about 1992.  Are you suggesting to this Tribunal that Nzirorera was unaware of what happened to the Bagogwe in 1992? 
A.	I cannot confirm that he was informed.  Personally, I would never have informed him.  However, in view of the fact that the incidents were occurring in the country, these figures of authority could be informed of, and from the moment when I was no longer present when reports on these attacks might allegedly have been given over to him and I was not the person to be the bearer of the news, then I cannot say that he was informed.  I am aware of the methods used in order to administer the country.  The radios were working, and anybody could hear this information over the radio.  However, I cannot confirm that Nzirorera was, indeed, informed of the fact that these attacks had occurred.

1715H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, let's talk about 1994, after the 7th and the 8th of April, when that entire community was destroyed. Based on what you lived through, was Nzirorera aware of those killings on the 7th and the 8th of April? 
A.	Counsel, that's the same response I have just provided.  In view of the situation prevailing at the time, Nzirorera, who was a national figure of authority, could have been informed of it.  However, I cannot confirm this fact, nor can I deny it.  All I can say is that I did not submit a report to him myself.  And, as I have already said, the officials had a means of going about gathering information, but I cannot tell you whose job it was to inform him, and I cannot say whether the person who was supposed to inform Nzirorera did, in fact, do so.  So I can neither confirm nor deny that. 
Q.	Well, wouldn't it have been obvious to anyone visiting Mukingo that an entire community had been killed; that their homes had been burned; that the church had been attacked?  Aren't those things obvious to the people in the community? 
A.	The individuals who lived in this neighbourhood heard gunshot and they might have seen everything.  However, I cannot confirm that Nzirorera was informed of this because I did not see him on the site and I did not see him go by.  So how do you expect me to be able to conflay (sic) -- to be able to claim, as an individual, who was not on site was informed of what was going on there?  The people who were there were able to see what was happening, so they were informed of the attacks.  But I cannot say the same for those people whom I did not see on site. 
Q.	Well, is it your testimony that Nzirorera never returned to Mukingo during the genocide? 
A.	I did not see him.  Whether it be on the date of the 7th, date to which some people claim to have seen him in Mukingo, or whether it be at a later date, I never saw him, and those are lies. 
Q.	Did you ever hear about him returning to Mukingo during the genocide, and I am talking beyond the 7th and the 8th April now?  Between April, May, June, July, did you ever see or hear of Nzirorera returning to Mukingo commune? 
A.	I have already partly responded to your question.  I did not see him and I did not hear anybody mention his presence.  I did not live far from his residence, and I would, at least, have heard that he had passed by, or I might have seen his car.  There are only these false testimonies that bore witness to his presence on the morning of the 7th of April.  And, as I have already told you, the witnesses had come to an agreement that some people would come and claim that he was in Mukingo, and some people would come and claim that he was in Hotel Muhabura, others were going to say that he went via Mukingo in order to go to Gisenyi.  However, this was all a concoction. 
Q.	Would that include your own testimony back in June of 2006 when you told this Chamber that you had heard Nzirorera was present in Mukingo for the reinstallation of Kajelijeli? 
A.	Yes, it was a lie, and I am still asking or requesting pardon from this Chamber for that fact.  It was with a view to corroborating the statements provided by other witnesses with whom we had concocted our testimony. 
Q.	Well, with respect -- 
A.	However, otherwise, he was not present. 
Q.	With respect to that particular lie, who concoct -- who did you concoct that particular lie with, that Nzirorera was not -- was present in Mukingo in June for the reinstallation of Juvénal Kajelijeli as bourgmestre? 
A.	I have already given you a number of names, and if you were to pass me a sheet of paper, I would be able to give you the names of those individuals with whom we concocted this testimony.  But I remember that the name of the individual listed at number four on the list also made mention of this.  There is another person I remember, and I can provide you with his name on a sheet of paper. 
Q.	And you concocted that lie with number four in order to hold Nzirorera responsible for the events in Mukingo, is that your testimony, when you gave that testimony in June of 2006? 
A.	It was not in the month of June 2006 that I began to testify against Nzirorera.  It was, rather, in the year 2002, and everything I said during that period was a version which we had agreed on previously, i.e., during the period 2002 to 2006.  It was not only in the year 2006 that I began to tell lies with a view to accusing Nzirorera.  

Already, since the year 2002, we had been holding meetings and we had been agreeing on what each and every one of us was going to say in order to accuse Nzirorera, and we were making sure that each and every one of us corroborated the testimonies.  Not only numbers one and four.  There are other witnesses.  And were you to pass me a sheet of paper, I could give you other names.  I might even give you a name of a witness -- another witness who might have testified before this very Trial Chamber.  Otherwise, we agreed, a number of us, on the false testimony we were going to make before this Tribunal. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, and today you're insisting that that particular piece of evidence is false and you're explaining why.  Yet, back in June of 2006, you put just as much energy into saying that that was the truth; that Nzirorera had been present in Mukingo at the ceremony to reinstall Kajelijeli.  Isn't that true? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  In all of my statements, and not only with reference to this point, in all of my statements, I did everything possible in order to implicate Nzirorera and other officials.  But the truth be told, we were telling a tissue of lies.  

The officials or authorities had asked me to give a version of events that implicated those figures of authority.  I do not know whether you want me to go through all the explanations I provided all over again.  I did not only lie as to the presence of Nzirorera in Mukingo in the month of June 1994.  I lied in all of my statements, from beginning to end.  And I believe that you would have done the same thing if somebody had threatened you with a rifle, threatened you so that you gave a version of events on which you had agreed with others. 
Q.	Well, we are not concerned with me now, Mr. Witness.  We are concerned with you and your testimony.  Wouldn't you agree that by giving evidence that Nzirorera was present at the reinstallation of Kajelijeli, that that would tend to cast him as a genocidaire, as someone that supported the killings that had taken place up to that point?  Isn't that why you put that in your evidence in June of 2006? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to say that most of my statement or testimony was a lie, so it is not only with reference to Nzirorera's presence in Mukingo in the month of June 1994 that I lied.  My objective was not only to prove that Nzirorera was a genocidaire.  The mission which been -- had been assigned to me was to prove that he was in charge; that he was the one who was commanding the other genocidaire, and I do admit to the fact that what I said was a lie.  

Even if I did say that he was present in the month of June, and that he did this and that, inside myself I knew only too well that I was lying, and that Nzirorera had never been present at the locations at which I placed him. 
Q.	Okay.  But let's focus again so it's clear that when Nzirorera returned to Mukingo to be present for the reinstallation of Juvénal Kajelijeli, in your mind, and in the mind of others that gave similar evidence, that would tend to demonstrate that he was responsible for what Kajelijeli did.  Isn't that why it was important in your evidence in June of 2006? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Try and break it down a bit.  No wonder the witness can't answer.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  I am sorry. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what I am asking you to clarify for us is why that particular piece of evidence was important to you when you gave it in June of 2006, and I am suggesting to you that it was because Nzirorera's presence at Kajelijeli's reinstallation would tend to show that he supported what Kajelijeli did the prior three months.  Isn't that why you gave that evidence? 
A.	No, that is not true.  I was not the only person to make mention of that.  And if we did talk about this fact, it was with a view to underscoring what Nzirorera had said with reference to the massacre of Tutsis.  

If you recall, you put a question to me seeking to ascertain what Nzirorera had said, and I told you what Nzirorera allegedly said.  And in telling you what he had said, we wanted that -- we wanted Nzirorera's position with reference to the massacre of Tutsis to be revealed to the general public.  We wanted it to be known that he had a position with reference to these massacres.  But as I have already told you, this does not correspond to the truth because it is part of the testimony that we had concocted.  It does not only concern Nzirorera; this also concerns other individuals whom we implicated. 

Now, just to give you an example.  I was asked to become a prosecution witness against Mr. Bicamumpaka whom I didn't even know.  And even if I was requested to recognise Bicamumpaka in the Trial Chamber itself, I was not able to do so because I did not know this individual.  However, I did testify against him as a prosecution witness. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's stay focussed on what I am asking you right now about Juvénal Kajelijeli and Joseph Nzirorera, because I still haven't gotten a straight answer from you.  The reason that incident was important was because it brought out the relationship between Joseph Nzirorera and the former bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, Juvénal Kajelijeli.  Isn't why that evidence was important when you gave it; yes or no? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let me give you my own version.  If I told you that Nzirorera was present, I wanted to have it understood that he supported the massacres perpetrated against the Tutsis in that he never condemned these massacres.  If I included this event in my testimony, it was not with a view to proving the lessens (sic) of - of a link between Nzirorera and Kajelijeli.  It was to prove that Nzirorera was supporting the massacre of Tutsis.  I have talked at another moment of the relation between Nzirorera and Kajelijeli, notably, when I said that Kajelijeli was the school treasurer or bursar. 

However, as I have already stated, this is all a tissue of lies, and I was repeating before the 
Trial Chamber what I had been requested to say. 
Q.	If Nzirorera was present at the reinstallation of Kajelijeli, that would tend to make him a genocidaire; isn't that the case? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, that is not a proper question for this witness.  That's Mr. Nzir -- that's 
Mr. Webster's argument.  If he wants to ask the witness what he was thinking when he gave that testimony, what he said with others, that's fine, but to make that -- ask that kind of question is just argumentative. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'd like the witness to answer the question.  The question was direct.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you can give a direct answer.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. Webster isn't the one to rule on my objection.  Mr. President, will you please rule on my objection?  My objection is:  The question was argumentative.  It's to you, not Mr. Webster, to rule on that objection.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And, Your Honour, I am putting a proposition to the witness.  The witness can agree or disagree. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, are you in control of this courtroom, or is Mr. Webster - 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's just about it right now.  I have got enough from both of you. 

We think the witness can answer the question.  He probably has answered it already on more than one occasion. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, if Nzirorera was at that reinstallation, that would make him a genocidaire?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, Mr. Webster, you are putting it too strongly now.  Now you are asking the witness to define what an act of commission of genocide is, which is a legal question. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Let me rephrase it.  Excuse me. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	If Nzirorera was at the reinstallation of Kajelijeli as bourgmestre, that would suggest that he was a genocidaire and he was complicit in what Kajelijeli was doing; isn't that what you were -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Maybe we should take a recess and Mr. Webster can -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We said you can ask the question, but the way you are putting it almost replaces the witness with the Bench. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
This is a point where we have to finish this evening, Your Honour.  It's only going to take a few minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you can put the question.  We have permitted you to put the idea.
MR. WEBSTER:  
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
But don't turn him into a great lawyer or a judge. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, I also have an objection.  Mr. President, I also wonder whether the question is not somewhat speculative. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, as I had indicated already, we think that the witness has answered that question on more than one occasion during the course of his examination on both sides of the table this afternoon.  So we think he can answer the question, but it just has to be rephrased. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, your testimony from June of 2006, that Nzirorera was present for the reinstallation of Kajelijeli would tend to show that he supported -- he, Nzirorera, supported what Kajelijeli did in Mukingo up to that point, wouldn't you agree? 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  I told you that I, as a witness, having made my statements, wanted, in collaboration with other witnesses who gave statements on this point, wanted to show that Nzirorera did support the massacres against the Tutsis because he did not rise up against these massacres.  But were we to say that Nzirorera is a genocidaire, it is not up to me to confirm that fact.  And all that I can say to you today is that everything I said against Nzirorera is a lie. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, would it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, could you find a convenient point, so...  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  Just two or three more questions. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would it surprise you to know that Nzirorera admits to being present in Mukingo commune for the reinstallation of Kajelijeli? 
A.	That would not surprise me, and this is why:  Firstly, I never said in any of my statements that I was present at that ceremony.  The concerned people were there, but I was not there in his company, and I think that this is clear.  

I told you that we would agree amongst ourselves as to what we were going to testify to without being eyewitnesses to those events.  But today I can tell you that I was not present at that ceremony, and, therefore, I do not know whether Nzirorera was present there.  

You will agree with me that I cannot say Nzirorera was present whereas I did not attend that ceremony, therefore, I could not have seen Nzirorera.  Therefore, I cannot confirm, or otherwise, his presence there. 
Q.	Your testimony was that this was one of the -- one of the sequence of lies that you concocted with your co-detainees.  Your testimony was that you lied when you gave that evidence because you didn't know that Nzirorera admitted to being there.

1743H 
THE WITNESS:
This is what I can say:  Nzirorera -- whether Nzirorera was present or not, I cannot confirm everything that I'm saying today is that what I said before the Trial Chamber was information that had been given to me by other witnesses and information regarding which we had agreed upon prior -- previously.  That could have been the case, but that could have been a lie.  I endorsed that part of the statement or testimony as being an eyewitness, whereas I was not even there.  And as I have already told you, all the events which I referred to in my statements from 2000 to 2006 do not reflect the truth.  They were mere inventions.  
MR. WEBSTER:
     All right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have to close now.  We take our adjournment now.  Mr. Witness, I remind you that during this, as in all other adjournments, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
(Court adjourned at 1744H)
