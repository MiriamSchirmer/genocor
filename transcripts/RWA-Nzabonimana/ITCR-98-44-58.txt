RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, do you recall being asked the question, how many roads led from Mukingo going to the village of Susa, and you answered there was just one; do you recall that when you were asked that question on cross-examination by the Prosecutor? 
A.	Yes, I recall. 
Q.	And do you recall the Prosecutor asking you if there was any other way of getting to Susa from Mukingo without taking that particular road; do you recall being asked that question? 
A.	Yes, I remember, and I answered that there was possibility either of going through Ruhengeri town, and in that case, you would come to Susa from the back, in relation to the road which goes to Susa through Shingiro.
Q.	Now, witness, we would like you to go to the map.  And can you demonstrate or show to members of the Trial Chamber how could someone get to Susa other than the direct route that you described, by way of Ruhengeri? 
A.	The first possibility is to use this road which goes from Gataraga and goes up towards Ndorahe, and it reaches there and it continues towards Kinigi, and you will come back this way. 

The second possibility is to go --
Q.	Witness, just with the first possibility, can you do it more slowly so that the Trial Chamber sees where the person would go? 
A.	The second possibility that I have just mentioned would be from Gataraga here.  It goes up westward of Kimonyi and you would go through this Ndorahe roadblock.  When you get here, at this crossroads, there's a possibility, because we are already in Kinigi commune.  You can go towards Kinigi and go back that way on the road, or you can go towards Musanze, join up with the road from Kinigi north of Gihora and you would go back westward to Susa.  Alternatively --
Q.	Now, witness, just stay with that first alternative.  In the time the person, then, would be in Kinigi, on April 9th or 10th, can you describe what that individual travelling, tracing the path that you have shown, what obstacles they would be facing -- that is, a vehicle, civilian vehicle, travelling along that route on April 9th or 10th? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.  Is my learned friend reopening his examination-in-chief?  This issue was well ventilated in his examination-in-chief.  The same issue of road and movement of vehicles and -- in the same area, I would object on that ground. 
MR. HINDS:
Do I need to respond to this, Your Honour?  If I do, I will take the time and spread it on the record, but it's a question that she asked about whether or not there were other routes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Do you want me to go, through, explaining?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. HINDS:
Yah.  Should we excuse the witness or you want me to --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, no.  Other routes.
MR. HINDS:
Can I -- he can proceed? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes; yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, can you describe the obstacles that someone travelling the route that you have just described would face trying to get to Susa, that route? 
A.	Well, the first question, that was to show the roads up through which one could reach Susa, I had not yet spoken about the alternative.  Now I'm going to answer your question by considering the possibilities as to whether it was possible to reach Susa.  

So from the night of 6th April, after the death of the president was announced on the radio, I said in the beginning that the units at the front received orders to go into maximum alert.  And it was from that night of the 6th April, the night of 6th to 7th, that roadblocks which were on the road going towards Kinigi, on the roads in plural to Kinigi, became obstacles, held under fire; in other words, from the 6th of April, all these possibilities of going towards Kinigi were closed.  I do not know whether I have made myself understood. 
Q.	Yes, but assuming someone got past those obstacles that were in the road and got into Kinigi using the path that you have shown, can you tell the Trial Chamber, based upon information that you have, what such vehicles would face? 
A.	The first constraint would be that it was impossible to pass.  That's one.  And to explain the constraint, that wouldn't have -- that wouldn't take place because this was not a possibility. 

I'm going to try and explain the impossible, because it was impossible to pass. But suppose that one was able to pass -- this was not doable, but let's imagine that that was possible.  Your question deals with the 7th and 8th April.  I have already indicated that from the day of 7th April fighting with individual armaments and mortar shells had already started.  Were we to suppose that the obstacles were to be crossed, that was not possible.  

Once you reached that area, there was a dual risk.  The first risk would be that the vehicle that crosses into this zone would be brought under fire by elements of the Rwandan Armed Forces to the south of Kinigi.  On the other side also, the elements of the RPF -- so the second risk was that this vehicle could also be coming under the fire of those elements, the RPF elements.  So if the impossible were to be possible, and the obstacle was indeed crossed, there would be that dual risk for anyone finding himself in that area. 
Q.	All right, witness, can you then demonstrate the next alternative for getting to Susa, other than the one that you have just shown?  You say that was the first option.  What was the second option?
A.	If we leave aside the Shingiro itinerary, I said that the first possibility was to go from Gataraga towards Ndorahe to that obstacle.  Another possibility, another possibility is to go through Musanze, but that is in Kigombe commune.  You go up Musanze to Kinigi.

Another possibility is to go directly to Ruhengeri and take the road that goes directly to Kinigi.  

The last possibility is to go through Kigombe, the Kigombe commune, and to take right, turn right to Gashangiro, go up to join the Nkumba-Kinigi road, and in that case you turn to the west and come to Susa through Kinigi.  But there, as well, I'm saying that if I've put roadblocks here, it is because you asked me to put them there to concentrate on the Mukingo commune.  But all these roads that lead to Kinigi, the same night of 6th to 7th April became obstacles, held by fire. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, witness.  You can now take your seat. 

Witness, you were asked questions concerning the responsibility for security in Ruhengeri, especially with respect to the establishment of roadblocks?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you like to raise that in open session, perhaps, counsel? 
MR. HINDS:
Yeah, because I'm not -- the question was -- the question that was asked was not relating to his position, but just what --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we're just, you know -

MR. HINDS:
Yeah, I'm -- I'm mindful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, remember that we are now in open session and if you think that there are any questions -- the answer to any questions may reveal your identity, just signal to the Trial Chamber and you will be instructed accordingly.  But if you can answer the question without personalising your situation, attempt to do so, so that we can spend as much time in open session as opposed as in closed session.  Do you understand this? 
A.	Yes, I do.  But even then I think the manner of putting the question has a possibility of revealing my identity, even before I start answering. 
MR. HINDS:
Okay, fair enough.  I am sensitive to it.  Okay, so, Your Honour, could we go into closed session?
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We'll go into closed session.

	1645H
PROFESSOR HINDS:
The document is entitled -- there is a document disclosure number which is RWINTGT-01, and it is in the case of The Prosecutor v. ELiezer, E-L-I-E-Z-E-R.  Niyitegeka, N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you can give those copies --
MR. HINDS:
Yes, we will.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then be made available to the stenographers.  Can you --
MR. HINDS:
Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has had the list and you can ask him straightaway. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, does that refresh your recollection of the dates of the announcement?
A.	Let me repeat.  This communiqué per se concerning the appointment of the préfet, I can see that very well, but the date of 17th April 1994, we were concerned with the military activities on the front.  Therefore, I can say that I did not personally listen to this communiqué.  

As for knowing whether the new préfets were appointed, I said yes, because even at Ruhengeri since the earlier one had been killed in Kigali, he was replaced and the person who replaced him, I saw him in Ruhengeri and I know him.
Q.	Okay.  Witness, you were asked concerning a meeting with an a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx, 
	G-A-H-U-N-D-E.  Did you attend any meetings with that individual? 
A.	I didn't attend any meeting with this gentleman known as xxxxxxx.
Q.	Witness, you were asked about your knowledge of killings that took place during the period of April 1994 in the préfecture of Ruhengeri, and in particular, the Court of Appeals.  Can you describe to the Tribunal whether or not you took any action to protect Tutsis when you became aware that they might have been in danger, given the situation that prevailed at that time, that is after April 6 of 1994? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.  My learned friend is exploring a new area.  I didn't go that far about what action he took to protect Tutsis. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, not only did she go that far, but the Prosecutor accused him of being involved in ordering people to be killed. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think it does arise. 
THE WITNESS:
You are asking me whether after what happened at the Court of Appeal where Tutsis were killed and whether I took any measures to protect those who were still alive.  Yes.  Yes, I would like to give a few examples.  Obviously in relation to the tragedy which brought about quite a lot of loss of life, I can mention a few examples, and I will begin with the town of Ruhengeri to which we assigned a unit to the people who were in Ruhengeri, who were being threatened under the pretext that the Tutsis were hiding there.  I myself contacted the Bishop of Ruhengeri late Nitigwize (phonetic)  He told me, in fact, that there were refugees there, and I asked him whether, if we were to send a force there to protect them, it would be possible, if that wasn't inconvenient for him, to have the holy places protected.  He said that that was not a problem to him, and that is how we sent or dispatched a unit there.  

A moment ago I spoke of a family -- of a Belgian man who was married to a Tutsi woman, they are still married, I shouldn't have used it in the past tense.  So apparently, there were people who were going to kill them and this brought us to sending a force and proceeded with the evacuation of the family by helicopter because the roads were impassable.  

I will give another example, a third example.  The Ruwaza school where there were nuns, there was a school there and the girls were still there.  In that school there were Tutsis who had sought refuge there, at the same time there were Hutu and Tutsi girls and this brought us to taking the decision to dispatch a unit there also.  

Example No. 4 which I can give took place at Ruhondo, at the Camelite Convent.  I had to dispatch a military unit there too.  

Regarding the protection of civilians under threat, I explained to you the case of the Ruhengeri hospital.  We had a unit to protect the Tutsis working there and the survivors who escaped the massacres at the Ruhengeri Court of Appeal.  

The last example I will give in order to be brief, is at the time when we were forced to leave Ruhengeri and at that time arose the problem of people we had under our protection, where were we going to send them?  What were we going to do about them?  We assigned buses for these persons as well as military escort.  From Ruhengeri we had a convoy established right up to Ngoma, and maybe some persons can verify that the information that I have provided is correct.  Those are the few examples I am able to give you now. 
Q.	Did you at any time learn the identity of the white man who was threatened with death for having married a Tutsi woman whom you saved? 
A.	Are you asking me about the identity of the man?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Yes, I know the man's identity.  He was known as xxxx-xxxxxx xxxx and he was of Belgian nationality.
Q.	Now, Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell the name, please? 
THE WITNESS:
The man's name is -- the surname is x-x-x-x, xxxx and his first name of xxxx-xxxxxx.  Should I also spell xxxx-xxxxxx?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You can go on. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, how could you remember specific dates with respect to the combat zone and activities there and not be able to remember the specific date of the attack at the Court of Appeal, could you explain that? 
A.	I gave that reason to the Prosecutor in the following terms:  The Ruhengeri -- the massacre of Tutsis in Ruhengeri, I got to hear about that and I repeated that I did not -- could not remember the date, but I said also that did not minimise the scope of the killings.  

As for the various operations on different dates concerning the progress of the operations, I must say that that was the most captivating activity, if we were to take matters hour by hour, day by day and on the ground.  If you are impressed by an event which is continuous in its development, you will register it and notice it more and you would be readily remembering certain dates than an event which affects you and you remain with the image.  It is not to say that I forgot about the massacre at the Court of Appeal.  It is only the date which escapes me, but the image which I saw will never ever disappear from my memory.  So if the date escapes me, the horror I saw there will never escape my memory.
Q.	Now, Witness, you testified that you learnt of the killing that took place at the Court of Appeal on cross-examination.  I am now going to ask you to share with the Tribunal the circumstances under which you learnt of this, who told you and under what circumstances? 
A.	I was coming from outside.  I reached the command post, I found xxxxxxxxx, he was still colonel at the time, and his head was in his hand like this.  So I asked him what was happening and he is the one who told me.  His answer was: "They have been killed".  So I asked him who has been killed, who has been killed?  He said, "They have been killed".  He told me the people who were at the Court of Appeal --
Q.	When you say that xxxxxxx xxxxxxx had his head in his hands, what do you mean by that? 
A.	I meant he was depressed, if that is the correct word, shaken. 
Q.	Now, was he able to give you any more information concerning "They had been killed?" Did you find out at that time, when you saw xxxxxxx with his head in hands, when he told you this? 
A.	The state in which I found him did not enable me to ask further questions.  I rather went to the Court of Appeal to see what had happened.  And I got there, I told you a while ago that I saw a pool of blood and that at the hospital, I found the wounded survivors.  So I did not push further to find out from him who, when, and how that was done.  So I went directly to the Court of Appeal to see for myself. 
Q.	Now when you got to the Court of Appeal, did you make any investigation on your own to ascertain whether or not these people who were killed, were they supposed to be under protection or secured by any security personnel, that is the people who were at the Court of Appeal? 
A.	Those who were there were under the protection of the gendarme of the group.  So when I got to the place, I did not ask for investigations.  I took note of the horror and that is when I learnt that the survivors were at the préfecture -- rather the hospital.  So I went directly to the hospital.  At that very time, I did not think about investigations, nor did I think about the survivors because I did not even know that there were survivors.  So I went directly to the hospital, and for me, that was not the time to think about investigations, but rather, the time to think about those who could have survived. 
Q.	Did you subsequently, sir, request any explanation from the commander of the gendarme of how these people could be killed under the protection of the gendarme? 
A.	Yes, I asked the group commander what happened.  He told me that he did not understand.  He told me that among the victims there were gendarmes and that other gendarmes were missing.  So he talked to me about the gendarmes who were victims and those who were reported as missing. 
Q.	Did you form any personal opinion with respect to the credibility of that report that you were given?  I am asking for your personal opinion.
A.	In receiving -- you mean a personal opinion I could have formed when I received this information from the group commander, particularly when he referred to the gendarmes who were victims.  And I wondered who the perpetrators of this crime could be, who could dare to face gendarmes, because it might be said that the gendarmes were carrying weapons, gendarmes who were in charge of the security of these people were carrying weapons.  So I thought there were a lot of questions to be answered.  But a group commander who had the soldiers, the solders who were protecting the people and under whose command these soldiers were, he himself said that he had lost some soldiers and that investigations were going to be carried.  So I then had a hope that as a result of the investigations, we were going to be able to find the perpetrators of these killings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
I think I am just about there, Your Honour

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did you subsequently at any time find out whether or not there were any investigations or results of 	investigations in terms of who may have been the perpetrators of these killings at the Court of Appeal?  Do you know if that ever was done? 
A.	Once again, let me refer to the situation that prevailed at the time, the chaos that prevailed at the time, and this up until mid-July when we left the Ruhengeri town, the group commander had not yet submitted his report on the killings.  From the préfecture, it was the same situation because I told you that in -- the event of crimes, the civilian authorities were immediately informed and it was the case with these killings, in this case, the Ruhengeri préfet and the group commander.  Unfortunately, in mid-July 1994 when we were departing Ruhengeri no report had been submitted. 
Q.	Do you know Hotel Muhabura? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.  This question was --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does it arise, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
It is my last question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it may be, but does it arise?
MR. HINDS:
I just want to know if he knows where Hotel Muhabura was.  I thought it was a nice hotel.  No further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned Counsel.  

Judge Ramaroson has some questions to ask the witness. 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Witness, following the death of Habyarimana, that is on the 6th, you did say that you were in a state of maximum alert vis-a-vis the RPF.  At that time between the 7th and the 13th, there were already killings of Tutsis in the region, in the area, and you were an intelligence officer, and therefore, up to the 13th you did not hear of any possible killings of Tutsis in your area in Ruhengeri, that is one.  

Two, on account of the fact that you were in a state of alert, wouldn't you have taken preventive measures to forestall a possible killing of Tutsis?

THE WITNESS:
The first question on information relating to the killings of Tutsis which might have come from intelligence report, let me say that during the period that you have mentioned, that is the 7th, 13th of April 1994, on the killings of Tutsis, military intelligence here has to be distinguished from civilian intelligence.  Military intelligence relates to operations from the 6th April, and you did mention that we were on maximum alert, that means all activities from the sector command post are directed towards military operations, such that the field of security of the people fell directly under civilian intelligence which was under the préfecture.  That does mean that if plans of killing Tutsis should come to us, it should not come -- it will not come through military intelligence; it should have come through civilian intelligence of the préfecture.  

But let me answer that with the second question, since you were talking about preventive measures.  It is specifically based on the unfortunate incident at the Court of Appeal, that on the military side, we tried to listen to the civilian authorities so as to strengthen or reinforce one or the other area of Ruhengeri which might be directly threatened.  I referred, for example, to the case of the Bishop's residence and the unfortunate event that occurred at the Court of Appeal. 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
It is true that you talked about intelligence from the military standpoint -- from the civilian standpoint.  We understood that, but I am asking you this question from a practical standpoint.  For example, from the 7th of April you held a meeting and in the course of that meeting, it was said that the general situation should be taken into account, the attitude to be adopted to avoid excesses and obviously these killings were excesses, constituted excesses. 

If you want to answer my question, are you saying that you were not aware at all of possible killings of Tutsis in Ruhengeri; is that it?  Were you aware or not, before the onset of the attack at the Court of Appeal?  Were you aware?
THE WITNESS:
I was not aware of cases of killings of Tutsis in Ruhengeri at that time before the unfortunate event of the Court of Appeal. 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
And when that started, what did you do since it took a while?  Did you wait for it to be finished? 
THE WITNESS:
No, we did not wait for it to finish, because a while ago, I talked about the measures that we took to protect --
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
No, no.

MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, could you let the witness complete his answer.
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
Yes, but he did not understand my question.  I am not talking about measures taken subsequent to the attack, but measures taken during the attack. 
THE WITNESS:
During the attack at the Court of Appeal, measures had already been taken because a while ago, I talked about the group commander who had stationed gendarmes there to protect the people.  There was already a preventive measure.  And even in spite of that, people were killed.  Then this time around we should look at the efficiency of the measures taken. 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
And during the killing, did you come to the assistance of these people?  The question is direct.
THE WITNESS:
Personally, I told you a while ago about when I heard about these killings.  I told you that I heard of this at the command post that I found xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx overwhelmed.  It was the event -- the incident was over and that is when I got to know.
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
I am not talking about you personally, but of soldiers.  Soldiers did not go to the assistance of these people, that is what I want to know.  When the killings were being perpetrated, soldiers remained with their hands folded, I am not talking about you individually.
THE WITNESS:
In that case, I will say that the group commander who had troops there and who had not only people under his command whom he had sent there, maybe he underestimated the situation and therefore the attackers were stronger.  If in that regard -- if he had forces in reserve who were not working, and the mission of protection of those civilians failed, that should not be directly -- that should not be directed at the army because sometimes the situation is more complicated.  The gendarmerie -- as long as the gendarmerie has not exhausted all its resources in that kind of situation and have not asked for reinforcement from the army, it is difficult for the army to plan for reinforcement, except if you are saying that there were soldiers in the streets who did not assist, in that case, I could say that it was a failure on their part, but that the soldiers did not give protection to the people does not arise because the unit that was protected and did not express the need for reinforcement. 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
Regarding the roadblock, were there no killings at the roadblocks?  There were a lot of roadblocks, there was no killing of Tutsis, yes or no?
THE WITNESS:
You are referring to the roadblocks in Ruhengeri, and once again, I think we need to specify the area, because when I told you that I personally met groups and if I had not met them before the event, they would have committed a crime.  So I cannot say that the killings did not occur.  

Now, there were two types of roadblocks; those in the combat zone which became obstacles, there, there were no killings.  Now the roadblocks, when it comes to the roadblocks, these violent people, they themselves can even erect barriers.  It is possible when people are in groups like that and they are going round the town, they could have committed violent acts, which we probably would not be aware of.  And I told you that there were things that I got to know while I was in exile. 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
I think that should be enough for me, but I just want to put this question.  You were a commander, and therefore, security was part of your duty and there were gendarmes and you were saying that there were roadblocks, which were erected by these bandits where people were killed.
THE WITNESS:
No, that is not what I am saying.  I am talking about a possibility because in a situation of crisis, a chaos --
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
But was it not your responsibility as a commander that security was in your hands?  Did you not have the control of the roadblocks?  Was it out of your control, the roadblocks?
THE WITNESS:
I think we need to separate, distinguish the two operations, defence and security.  There is security, security which is a responsibility of the préfecture, and they use the gendarmerie as their forces and there is defence; in terms of defence, the soldiers are positioned in various places on the field, I did mention that.  

Now regarding security and that takes us back to operations which are under the responsibility of the civilian authorities reinforced by the gendarmerie, and that so as to facilitate the implementation of the operation to re-establish responsibilities, because imagine a situation where the army was doing everything, they wouldn't be enough troops to do everything.  Imagine if the gendarmerie was doing everything, they could not do it, and that is why I was saying that when the préfet was appointed to replace the -- 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
I think that is enough.  I just wanted to raise a question.  You were saying that there were roadblocks manned by the gendarmes, so there was security everywhere.  Now I am talking about Ruhengeri which was squarely under your responsibility.  Were there roadblocks where the Interahamwe were killing?  Were there Tutsis killed at those roadblocks?  Is it yes or no, or were they all manned by the gendarmes and that there was total security?
THE WITNESS:
No, I would not say that there was total security because the people as I said, had committed -- had perpetrated killings.  It is not security given what happened. 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
So, were there killings of Tutsis at these roadblocks?
THE WITNESS:
In the town of Ruhengeri?  No.  Let me explain because if I say yes without identifying the dead body and the person who killed him, I will be going too far.  But if I say no, whereas I had not been there and somebody had been killed, I would have been denying what had been done, and that is why I am saying that  one ought to be prudent.  I am not denying the fact that killings did take place.  What I am saying is that possibly the perpetrators were not identified, that would be inadequacy, but the fact is that the killings did take place.  But  personally, I cannot say that A or B was killed at this roadblock by this other individual, because personally I was not on that roadblock.  I did not conduct investigations myself.  I did not establish -- I did not determine the responsibilities myself and I said a while ago that the report that was commissioned, the préfet and a group commanders who were to seek after the perpetrators.  I said that unfortunately at the time I was leaving the country in a situation of chaos, there was no report.  But the fact that there was no report does not mean that there were no killings, that is different.  The killings did take place.  The responsibilities, unfortunately, have not been determined. 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Judge Maqutu has some questions to the witness. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
I have five questions.  The first one is this: You have come here at the instance of the Defence to tell us about the situation in Susa and its environs; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
And you have been able to think about that because that is what you are here for; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is true. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
What I heard or learnt from you when you were asked by Defence and by the Prosecution is that this whatever you said, is what you learnt from military intelligence of which you were in charge? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Now, from this I can deduce therefore the quality of intelligence you gathered depends or should depend on the efficiency of the army or the military in the entire area; is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Right.  Now if this military intelligence of which you headed was efficient or effective at least, you would have heard most of the major killings in the area under your command; is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
We need to specify the period.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Well, first of all you were promoted on the 14th and you became commander with broader duties; is that correct?  You were promoted on the 14th April and had broader duties; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
No, it was not a promotion in the sense of rank, but in terms of duties, from the 14th April as you said, I became the commander, a sector commander, an acting sector commander, which meant that during that period I was acting commander and therefore, I had not yet been confirmed.  Since I was discharging those functions, I could consider it to be a promotion in terms of duties. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Yes.  Now I will not at this stage, at least with this question, ask you beyond the 14th when your duties were broader.  My questions will only focus for the time being on the period when you were military intelligence, the overall officer in Ruhengeri, do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand.  But in that case, I think we have to talk about military intelligence and not security because they are two different things.  
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Well, with the greatest respect, that answer does not impress me, because your orders were specific to look out for -- to look over the entire internal situation and prevent excesses.  So your job at that stage was also to put an ear on the ground in the security area, unless I was wrong that those were the orders from Kigali on the day you were there on behalf of the commander.  Do you understand?  So I am saying to you, and I will invite your comment.  What you have been saying, civilian or this, does not impress me.  So your duty as a witness is to try and persuade me to understand.  You had been given specific orders on the 7th that you are to keep an eye on the entire internal situation after the death of Habyarimana to prevent excesses, this is what you say, am I wrong? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, you are correct, but let me add something, very important. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Before you add something, did you obey this order as military intelligence officer of keeping an eye on the internal security area to have knowledge of possible excesses or actual excesses in order to let your commander xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx know? 
THE WITNESS:
In part I will say yes, and let me explain why I am saying in part.  In part I said yes, because the mission of intelligence directed towards military operations is a responsibility of the command structure to set in motion the military planning branch.  

Now regarding security within -- regarding internal security, there you are talking about the collaboration that should exist between two services, that is the intelligence service of the préfecture, who has amongst its duties to set off the process of security to be able to plan within the préfecture together with the assistance of the gendarmerie.  So the officer in charge of intelligence has no oversight over these activities planned by the préfecture.  But the fact that there is oversight, responsibility is not there, does not preclude possibilities of contact between intelligence services of the préfecture and the military intelligence.  Knowing or having information which would require the intervention of the gendarmerie or even the army and they would address this to the command post through the commanding officer.  So the link or subordination between the commanding officer and the military intelligence officer is linked up to the sector officer and the security officer.  In fact, he is not even an officer.  The security area is linked to the command post, but the link between the commanding officer and the intelligence officer is recommended. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
I don't know.  I think you are making a long answer increasing questions unnecessarily.  You were given an order to direct specific attention to the internal security, where the authorities expected excesses.  Now, I don't need all this story about civilians, this and that.  Do you see my problem?  Did the army keep its ear, military intelligence on the ground just to look out and to listen for excesses.  I am not coming to planning, just information because you cannot plan without information.  Do you see what I am driving at?  That is what I would like you to answer.  What the military itself did and that under you, because those were your specific orders.  Here it was not xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx whom you criticised of underestimating the situation.  No, no, I am not there.  I am here on intelligence where you, not everybody else was in charge. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I cannot talk about intelligence without distinguishing these missions.  And when you have two officers on the field, each one with his area, each one with his area of operation, each one with his superior officer to whom he is responsible, that is what I was referring to, that on the military side that was my responsibility, responsibility of military operations and to prevent the chaos and excesses.  That is why at the level of the civil administration, there was this intelligence unit which was all over the place in the military and in the civilian environment to gather intelligence, report to the préfet so as to prevent the chaos, and once the préfet is informed about the possibility of criminal organisations would call upon the gendarmerie for the forces that have to be deployed to prevent that.  That does not mean that the excesses were limited to only the civilian sector.  The civilians could also bring about insecurity, but I did say that there were various possibilities for soldiers to be involved in these killings or insecurity.  So the responsibility is shared and the reports to superior officers were also shared. 
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Well, I don't think I will pursue that question because you are evading it.  I say you are evading it because you had been given specific orders and therefore, to tell us about préfets et cetera, is not proper when you had been given specific orders as an army officer.  

Now I will pass.  You see why I am asking this question is because the witness that came before you says -- told this Chamber that close to a hundred people were called to go and kill Tutsis who had defended themselves at Mt. Busogo and very many people were killed there, very many.  Whether this witness said it was soldiers, do you understand?  Whether it was soldiers or gendarmes to a civilian, it is difficult, but what I just would like to know is, how come you as a military officer seem to be completely unaware of this?  That is the source of these many questions that I have been asking you.  I would like your short comment, don't tell me of préfets and their internal -- what do you call it -- security because here your orders were direct from the centre that you should look out for that.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am going to answer your question.  Regarding the involvement of soldiers in the killings, I am not denying the involvement of the soldiers in the killings.  That is why I give categories, and I do not want to place the responsibility of these killings exclusively at the doorstep of the civilians, that is not my idea.  

I am also not avoiding my responsibility when I say I do not know this or that.  If for example, a soldier commits or kills, he is not the one who is going to report to the commander that he has killed.  There are two possibilities, either the surviving victims, be it the civilians or soldiers who are going to accuse him to the command post or to the civilian authorities.  I also referred to another category, that a soldier can get out of the command structure and commit a crime.  There it is up to the unit to report that.  So if soldiers were involved in the killings, something I have not denied, I only regretted the fact that at the time I was leaving our country because of the chaotic situation that prevailed, the authorities that ought to have pursued these perpetrators of these crimes did not do so, did not function.  That means that even if we had known of the involvement subsequently and this is not the place to deny it, because I am not here to deny the involvement of soldiers in the killings of civilians and of Tutsis.  What I regret and I repeat it, is that the authorities which should have functioned to identify and punish the criminals did not function because of the prevailing chaos, and it was the same chaos which was blocking the flow of information.  And if this or that case did not come to us, it was because sometimes the channels of communication were disturbed.  You know for example, that some bourgmestres left their communes and could not be found, whereas the people will normally complain to the authorities, that will mean that it is possible that there were people who were victims but who did not have or who did not know where to go and complain, and that is why some criminal acts became known little by little only subsequently.  I don't know --
JUDGE MAQUTU:
That is all, please don't continue.

Thank you, Mr. President.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Judge Maqutu.

I just have only one small little question.  According to your knowledge and experience, would you or would you not describe these killings that you have been talking about or had been talked about here as matters of security concern?  What would you say to that? 
THE WITNESS:
Once again, Mr. President, it is difficult for me to describe it because when I told you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a general question.  Would they or could they be categorised or could have been categorised as matters of security concern?  That is my question, just like that.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they could be categorised under security because for people who were passing through there, their security needed to be guaranteed, and once they were killed, it would mean that security measures did not operate properly.  And I am saying properly because they were not killed on military grounds or elsewhere for them to have been confused with such and such a force.  So those who killed them knew patently well that they were killing people without defence, and if they were killed, it is not like soldiers who sent a bomb somewhere because there was a position there or a weapon that they needed to destroy.  It wasn't such an objective, but because here we are dealing with people who were at the Court of Appeal.  I cannot find a more appropriate word than --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I just wanted to know, then according to your evidence, who was primarily responsible for -- I think you have said, but maybe you can confirm.  Who was primarily responsible for this kind of security concern?
THE WITNESS:
The case that we have mentioned, the person most directly responsible would be the unit itself, which by its presence was in place, that was their shortcoming. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question is general.  Just listen to me.  Would that be civilian or military, that is the way I am seeing it?   That is the nature of my question.  I am not going to the unit, that is not what I am trying to address.  According to your evidence, that was the preserve for the concern of the civilian security; is that correct, primarily? 
THE WITNESS:
I can see that.  My opinion is that it belonged to security not under intelligence, but it is under the purview of security.  I think we need to make a distinction between crimes committed by soldiers on prisoners for instance, that wouldn't be on the battleground.  In that case, I think that is clear. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Agreed.  Now my last question is that, even if you were to take that kind of approach, was the security arrangement in Ruhengeri or maybe in Rwanda for that matter, so compartmentalised, that is, civilian, security or whatever it is, would not have any kind of impact or flow to the other armed services -- to the other services dealing with this security, in this case, the military, in the ordinary run of events, particularly with regard to people dealing with the issues of security and intelligence, be it intelligence security or security as it applies to civilians and intelligence that applies to the military, were things so cut off?  There was no area for co-ordination that things could happen at a particular level or in a particular area that the other arm of public service would keep itself or be kept completely uninformed.  That is what I want to understand from your evidence. 
THE WITNESS:
Let me say here, the problem in my view is not of a compartmentalisation of services or departments, and when one refers to the situation of April 1994 up until July, and when one sees that neighbours become enemies of one another and that brothers because of political parties become enemies, and that you see within families the man, the woman and children become enemies because of their ethnicity, I think that the poor operation of the services is also linked to the times because these services existed in the past, they worked together, they cooperated and they succeeded in their activities, but we noticed that there is a failure from April 1994, and I think this is linked mostly to the tendency for people to harbour this hatred amongst themselves and that this had gone beyond the limits.  

I am saying this because I personally had problems with the unit that I commanded because there were Tutsis.  I spent a great deal of time in making soldiers on the front aware, showing them left and right that if a Tutsi and a Hutu were to be in the foxhole and that the hatred which prevailed outside the combat zone  -- I said that I didn't want that hatred to enter the military operations.  We wouldn't have managed to remain on the military zone for as long as we did had we been affected by chaos which was obtaining in the civilian field, and this is why we were overwhelmed by events, and I think we need to accept this.  

On the military side, we were overwhelmed by events and if information did not flow very quickly, the little flow of information was able to be done because we had these disciplined soldiers on the front, but these soldiers were disciplined. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, this then Witness FMB, marks the end of your testimony, we thank you.  We shall have time at a later stage to consider and review your evidence, together with all the other evidence that has been adduced and will be adduced in the course of this trial.  But once again, we thank you and you may leave.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we cannot take the next witness.  So we will come back to -- during the weekend we will -- during tomorrow the Trial Chamber will be finishing the deliberation on the expert motion we had yesterday, and we should have a decision made and be able to proceed whichever way on Monday.  

So we will adjourn these proceedings to Monday and proceed with the next witness whoever it will be. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honours, just for the Trial Chamber's information, I think we had given order of witnesses.  We are down to the two witnesses which would end our case in terms of witnesses on our direct case.  So it is the expert who is next.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, depending on the ruling, of course.  
MR. HINDS:
That is right.  I mean in terms of -- and then the defendant. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Accused, yes, we are aware of that.  And we have seen the time frames and I think you have indicated in the timetable that if all things had been done according to what you had indicated, we would have had the Accused start on Monday and go on to the 10th, I think.
MR. HINDS:
Our estimate was two and a half weeks, that is what I had said to you.  So we are within -- we are moving swiftly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Okay, thank you.  Then we will adjourn these proceedings to Monday at nine in the morning.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned.
	(Court adjourned at 1800H)
