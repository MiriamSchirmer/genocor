Thank you, and good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.
WITNESS AXA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness AXA, waramutse.  Amakuru ki? 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, yesterday we went over the interview notes of the interview for this witness by the Office of the Prosecutor on the 4th of November 2004.  Those are admitted as D. NZ446, and copies have been distributed now this morning as item number 1 in my packet.  

I've also distributed separately another document which is a page from the book written -- or, a report written by Mr. Guichaoua, "The crisis" -- "The political crisis in Burundi and Rwanda in 1993 and 1994".  And page 697 of that report shows that on the 12th of April 1994, among the people evacuated from the French embassy to Bujumbura, was Cyprien Munyampundu, who's listed as number 12 on the second page of that exhibit.  It's a two-page exhibit.  First is the cover page, second is the pertinent page, 697.  

And at this time, Mr. President, I would like to offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ447.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The difficulty with the document is the source of the information to Mr. Guichaoua is untested and unknown before Your Honours.  Mr. Robinson, during the course of the presentation of his Defence, is, of course, entitled to call Mr. Guichaoua, or to call such evidence as justifies the suggestion that Munyampundu certainly was removed on the 12th of April.  

Your Honours will know that there is a lot of material which was generated arising out of the genocide, in which various dates have been put forward, and subsequently on analysis they have turned out to be wrong.  The date may be right, it may be wrong, but to simply offer this document in the way that Mr. Robinson is doing is not, I respectfully submit, properly into evidence.  So I would respectfully invite Your Honours to say it can be marked for identification, but its relevance and its provenance, in terms of Your Honours' decision-making, will not become apparent until Mr. Robinson later calls evidence to justify the statement within it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, that's a very interesting argument coming from Mr. Morley, because he urged you to admit Exhibits P. 293 and P. 294 through 298 from the bar table.  That was an attestation by Guichaoua, as well as five different minutes of a crisis committee meetings which Mr. Guichaoua had compiled during the course of his expertise.  And -- so you had granted that motion and admitted those documents from the bar table.  I see no difference between that document and the document I'm now offering, except that this document is not consistent with the Prosecution's theory.  

So I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ447, and you can give it whatever weight you feel it deserves at the end.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY: 
And, briefly, the response is simply, Mr. Guichaoua can give reports of his opinions arising from his analysis of material.  Those reports can be considered by Your Honours.  But what we have in this document is a -- an offering of a statement of fact relating to someone other than Mr. Guichaoua, namely, Mr. Munyampundu.  And whether or not it is entirely accurate that Mr. Munyampundu left Rwanda on the 12th of April is open to question on the face of this document.  This document is not offering an opinion from an expert, it's offering a fact in relation to a third party. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We already understood your submission; I think you're just repeating it.  We can make our decision already.  Thank you. 

Mr. Robinson, this cannot be admitted for the purpose you are putting it in.  We will have it marked for identification.  You are asking us to admit this as a fact of a date on which the -- the individual was evacuated.  We don't think that this is an authentic source of that fact.  There are other ways you can approach it, and we will mark the document for identification at this stage.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President.  At this time, Mr. President, I would move for reconsideration of your decision admitting Exhibit P. 293 through 298, because those are exactly the same situation.  It's a factual documents that were compiled by Mr. Guichaoua -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, a motion for reconsideration has to be put in writing.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of that motion.  That motion has to be put in writing.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I will do that.  Thank you.  

Mr. President, I would ask that this be marked as Exhibit ID. NZ67. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's marked for identification.  ID.  
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ67 marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness AXA, it's been asserted by an expert witness, André Guichaoua, that Cyprien Munyampundu was among the persons evacuated from the French embassy to Bujumbura on the 12th of April 1994.  And therefore, since you have testified that Mr. Munyampundu was with Mr. Karemera in Bwakira commune approximately one week after the death of President Habyarimana, which would have been the 13th of April, I want to ask you if you'd like to comment on the information provided by the expert witness, Guichaoua.  
A.	Thank you.  I do not know whether that expert was living in Rwanda at that time.  What I know is that Munyampundu was on the scene.  What you are saying is not well-founded, because when we were in Zaire, Munyampundu left Tingi-Tingi to go abroad.  So I do not know where you got your information. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, yesterday we started talking about the statements that I found in your file in Rwanda, and I now have those statements in Court, and we're going to go over some of them.  So, first of all I would like you to be shown document number 2 in my packet of exhibits.  

Witness AXA, what's been placed in front of you is a two-page document which appear to be a series of questions and answers that were put to you on the 9th of November 1998 in Rwanda by an individual called Gregoire Nyanzi, N-Y-A-N-Z-I, and appears to be in two pages with a finger -- a thumb -- with a fingerprint at the very end after your name.  

First of all, do you recognise this document?  
A.	I do not recognise this document.  I did not write it. 
Q.	Okay, I realise you did not write it.  But it appears, at least on the face of it, to be the recording of questions that were put to you and answers that you gave when you were interviewed by Mr. Nyanzi.  So I'm going to ask my legal assistant to read to you the questions and the answers, and you can tell us whether or not those were the questions that were asked of you and those were the answers that you gave when you had this interview.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So, this is a relatively short document, Mr. President, and I would ask permission for my legal assistant to read it in Kinyarwandan.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, permission granted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And when it comes to the name of the witness he will say "Witness AXA".  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:  
"Pro justitia.  On the 9th day of the month of November, I, Nyanzi, Gregoire, attorney with the office of the public prosecutor at the first instance court of Kibuye, at 12 hours, interviewed Mr. AXA."  And then further down it says:  "Transcript of the interview".  

Question:  "You have been accused of having participated -- of having participated in an attack with Amani," spelt A-M-A-N-I, "Silas, Noheri," which is spelt N-O-H-E-R-I, "Norego," which is spelt N-O-R-E-G-O, "and many other people.  During the said attack you killed people who were hiding at the ESI."  ESI is spelt in capital letters.  "You killed about 100 people who were hiding at the ESI.  You also killed people who were at the hospital, including --"  well, the first name is not legible.  And then you have "Tito," T-I-T-O, "Muremangingo," which is spelt M-U-R-E-M-A-N-G-I-N-G-O, "as well as their spouses.  Do you admit to having committed the said crime?"  

Answer:  "I did not take part in their deaths.  Those ladies were killed at --" a place not legible.  "They were not killed in Shyembe."  Shyembe is spelt S-H-Y-E-M-B-E.  "I heard people talk about who their killers were."  

Next question:  "What is your basis for your challenging what we have said, whereas the perpetrators of those crimes have also accused you, and people who actually witnessed those killings have levelled accusations against you in that regard?"  

Answer:  "I will defend myself before my accusers."  

Question:  "So, who killed those people?"  

Answer:  "Silas killed them, because in the morning when we got up we found that they had already been killed."  

Question:  "You are accused in view of the fact that you were in possession of a firearm and that you were working with Sibirindi (phonetic).  Where is this firearm to be found, currently?"  
Answer:  "This is a lie.  I was not carrying a firearm."  

Question:  "When the assailants went to drown these individuals in the river, were you not present?"  

Answer:  "I was not on that location."  

Question:  "It is said that Nyiresenge took you in a vehicle when you went to drown those individuals."  

Answer -- Nyiresenge is spelt N-Y-I-R-E-S-E-N-G-E.  

Answer:  "Nyiresenge will explain himself on the subject and he will say whether it is true that I went to pick him up at his home for him to come and transport those individuals."  

Question:  "Would it not be true to say that you were one of the individuals who was manning the roadblock at Nyabarongo river?"  

Nyabarongo is spelt N-Y-A-B-A-R-O-N-G-O.  

Answer:  "No, I was not manning that roadblock."  

Question:  "The people you were working with are the ones to level accusations against you.  For example, Kaliganya."  Kaliganya is spelt K-A-L-I-G-A-N-Y-A.  "Those individuals with whom you were working say that you killed many people at that location."  

Answer:  "Those individuals with whom I was working can claim that.  However, I say that I was not manning that roadblock."  

Answer -- question, rather:  "So, you deny the fact that you went to the hospital, but Kaliganya (sic) says that you were there amongst the killers."  Kaginana is spelt K-A-G-I-N-A-N-A.  

Answer:  "He's lying."  

Question:  "What can you tell us about the death of Urufurede (phonetic)?"  

Answer:  "I do not know the circumstances of his death."  

Question:  "Have you anything to add to your statement?"  
Answer:  "No.  I swear that this -- that these minutes are true and sincere."  

And the witness appended his fingerprint to said document.  

Nyanzi, Gregoire -- signed Nyanzi, Gregoire.  (French spoken), that is to say, attorney for the state prosecutor's office.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. Nsengiyumva.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness AXA, are those the questions that you were asked and the answers that you gave during your interview in November of 1998?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  These are indeed the questions that were put to me and the answers I provided.  And as I have already stated here before the Trial Chamber, in the year 1998 I was not ready to confess to the crimes I had committed.  And it was therefore during the period when I had not yet entered a -- or, confessed, and that is when I provided the answers you have just read.  
Q.	And so when you swore to be telling the truth before this officer in 1998, in fact you lied to him; correct?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  One does not take an oath before going through an interview in front of the state prosecutor's office, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, at the very bottom before you affixed your fingerprint, it is written that you attest that the contents of that document were true.  Didn't you do that?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Affixing one's fingerprint does not mean that one is saying that the contents of the document actually correspond to the truth.  When you answer the questions put to you by an attorney representing the state prosecutor's office, you are obliged to sign the document of the interview, even if the answers you have provided do not correspond to the truth.  
Q.	In any event, you were lying during this interview; correct?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I have already told you that at this moment in time I had not yet taken the decision to tell the truth as to what happened.  
Q.	And therefore the answers that you gave to this official were false; correct?  
A.	The answers I provided were not correct.  
Q.	And in fact you were involved in the attack on the ESI and the hospital; correct?  
A.	Yes, I did take part in the two attacks. 
Q.	And you were carrying a firearm, despite your statement that those who accused you of carrying a firearm were lying.  
A.	Yes, at the time I was carrying a firearm.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer the document numbered 2 in my packet as Exhibit D. NZ447, under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ447 admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  And if the witness could now be shown documents 3 and 4 in my packet.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness AXA, directing your attention to the first document, which at the very top it's written:  "Kibuye, the 5th of July 1999", and appears your name.  It's a letter.  And I'm wondering if you could tell us if you recognise that.  
A.	Yes, I do recognise this document.  
Q.	And is it a letter that you sent concerning your appeal to the Court in Ruhengeri?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, this is a letter I wrote after the judgement was handed down at the end of my trial. 
Q.	And the letter makes no mention of Édouard Karemera; correct?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I told you that this was a letter lodging an appeal.  Therefore one does not have to include in this document any information relative to the confession.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ448, under seal.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I respectfully submit that the letter is irrelevant, in light of the answer which was just given.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, the witness has testified that he provided information to the authorities about Mr. Karemera while he was in Kibuye prison, and that those -- that information would be contained in his file.  As you know, I went to Ruhengeri and I looked at his entire file, and these are the documents that -- the only documents that were in that file from this witness.  And I think that we're entitled to have the document admitted so that it can be established that none of these documents refer to Mr. Karemera.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ448 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And now, Witness AXA, if you can look at the second document that was put before you.  Is this also a letter that you wrote to the court of appeal in Ruhengeri?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And can we also agree that in this letter you made no mention of Édouard Karemera?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I did not mention the name of Édouard Karemera in the documents that you are producing before the Trial Chamber today.  However, his name does figure in other documents I drafted.  And I am surprised to see that you are only producing the documents where I did not mention Édouard Karemera's name. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document number 4 in my packet be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ449.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ449 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness AXA, this is where I need your help.  You see, the Prosecution has undertaken what they have described as very, very diligent efforts to obtain documents showing that you had mentioned Édouard Karemera in your case file, and they've found none.  And then after you testified the last time, I myself went to the Ruhengeri court of appeal and I saw your file.  It's in 12 volumes sitting on the shelf of the registrar's office in Ruhengeri.  And along with my investigator, who's fluent in Kinyarwanda, and the registrar of the court, we sat there and we went through every page of those 12 volumes.  And what we found were the three documents that I've shown you today, and nothing else.  

Now, can you -- do you have any copies of any of the letters that you wrote in which you mentioned Édouard Karemera?  
A.	No, I do not have any copies.  I gave all the copies to the tribunal.  
Q.	And do you know of anyone else who is aware -- who can corroborate the fact that while you were in the Kibuye prison, you were accusing Édouard Karemera of participation in the genocide?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I believe that the only person capable of this would be the person who aided me in drafting these documents, or the person who went to have them signed.  
Q.	Okay.  So, can you give us the name of the person who aided you in drafting these documents?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The person who drafted the document hails from Ruhengeri, and I do not know his name.  However, the individual who went to have the documents signed was the person in charge of the prisoners, or general captain, if you like, at Ruhengeri prison.  
Q.	Do you know his name?  
A.	His name was Laurent. 
Q.	And would he have read your letter, the contents?  
A.	Yes.  Common practice has that he first reads the contents of the documents before having it signed. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, we're talking about people in Ruhengeri prison.  But, really, my question to you was about letters that you'd written while you were in Kibuye prison in which you had mentioned Karemera.  What is the name of the individual who wrote the document for you in Kibuye prison that you claim contained the name of Karemera?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The person who aided me in drafting these documents was called Léonidas Nyandwi. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nyandwi is spelt N-Y-A-N-D-W-I. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And from which commune was he?  
A.	The commune of Gakira (sic).  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Bwakira is B-W-A-K-I-R-A.  Bwakira.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What secteur?  
A.	Murambi secteur. 
Q.	And do you know where he is today?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you know whether he's been released or is still in prison?  
A.	He might have been released, but I'm not sure. 
Q.	Okay.  And is there anyone else who could confirm that while in Ruhengeri -- while in Kibuye prison, you had written documents accusing Édouard Karemera?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I did not show these documents to anybody else, with the exception of the person I just mentioned.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, I want to put it to you -- and I think we've discussed this before -- that -- well, let me suggest that we -- we believe that you never mentioned Édouard Karemera while in Kibuye prison.  And that when you arrived in Ruhengeri prison, after having been sentenced to 20 years in prison, you learned from other inmates that it was possible to have your sentence reduced if you accused the people who were being held in Arusha by the ICTR.  And that at the Ruhengeri prison, there were groups of people who were trying to accuse those people in Arusha as a way to get their sentence reduced.  And I suggest to you that it was at that time, facing the prospect of 20 years in prison, that you decided to falsely accuse Édouard Karemera.  Would you like to comment on that?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  That is your opinion, but I do not believe you are in a position to give one sole example of a person who had their pain -- their sentence reduced because they had decided to lie in their testimony against those who are accused before the ICTR.  
Q.	Well, I can give you those examples, but I don't think this is the place to do that.  But I want to give you the opportunity to provide to me any -- the name, or -- of any person who could corroborate that while in Kibuye prison you were accusing Édouard Karemera, or to show me any document that would corroborate that.  So, do you have anything more than what you've already told us?  You've told us that Léonidas Nyandwi wrote those documents.  You said you don't have those documents yourself.  Is there anything you can help us with to show that while in Kibuye prison you had accused Édouard Karemera?  
A.	Counsel, what would you like in addition?  I am here before you and I can confirm this fact. 
Q.	Well, that's the problem, is that we just have your word for it.  And we're looking to find out whether what you're telling us is the truth, or it's not the truth.  So, I've given you the opportunity to point us in the direction of evidence which can corroborate your testimony.  And if you don't have any other information to provide, you can say so.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  There is nothing surprising if one could not lay one's hands on such documents.  You know, those documents disappear quite easily because they are important in nature.  So it comes as no surprise that they have disappeared from the file.  And this would not be the first time that this has happened.  
Q.	Witness AXA, thank you very much for answering my questions.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I have no further questions, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Are there any further cross-examination of this witness? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, as we have already said, we do not intend to cross-examine Witness AXA.  And what happened yesterday afternoon confirms us in this decision.  I might like to make a few observations as to the documents that were handed to us yesterday afternoon, and with regard to the misunderstanding underlying this.  

What we have in terms of document, in terms of an expert report by a doctor, ascertaining the ability of the witness to testify, is not, to our mind, a doctor's report, but in fact a certificate of physical aptitude to testify.  And this does not at all convey the ability or -- or, this does not reflect the mental health of the witness in all the circumstances.  

Our opinion is that the Trial Chamber would have the power -- in terms of guaranteeing evidence, as such, it would have the power to make a doctor's report happen.  We are of the opinion that all the elements that have already been put before the Trial Chamber establish the absence of mental health of the witness.  And on the basis of this documentation, the Trial Chamber should have -- should order that a doctor consult with the witness, because we do not believe that the witness can -- is in a position to provide a credible or believable testimony.  And that is the reason why we do not intend to cross-examine this witness.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, we still have not received disclosure of the certificate that was put in front of us briefly and surreptitiously yesterday, and I would request that you order for this medical certificate or report, established here by the medical services of this Tribunal, to be disclosed to us. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ah -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
May I offer a thought?  It may be that it will be of some assistance.  

There is a difficulty in the position being expressed by my learned friends for Ngirumpatse and Karemera.  Without wishing to overstate it, there is arguably an element of holding a gun to Your Honours' heads.  There is a suggestion that they will not cross-examine this witness because they are dissatisfied with the enquiry into his health, and it may be appropriate for the Prosecution to express the position.  

Firstly, there are two medical reports.  There is material within them to make comment later, and appropriately -- I emphasise that word -- to cross-examine this witness.  It's not for my learned friends to say that those reports are valueless.  If they had wanted a further report, it would have been available to them in the past four months to make an application.  And it may not be a proper position at all for my learned friends to take the posture that they do presently, that they're not going to cross-examination -- that they're not going to cross-examine because they aren't happy with the medical reports.  

Your Honours have seen the demeanour of the witness, Your Honours have heard him cross-examined by Mr. Robinson, and to some extent by Ms. Diagne, and the Prosecution expresses the view that this is a witness that Your Honours are capable of evaluating, seized of two medical reports and sight of the witness, on a lot of occasions now.  He was only examined-in-chief for an hour, but he's been cross-examined for, if we add it all up, approaching four days.  So, it may be appropriate -- and I hope I don't overstep the position -- simply to say that my learned friends' position, as they express it, does not bar Your Honours from evaluating this witness and, if appropriate, relying on him.  And if they need to argue later that Your Honours should not evaluate him to the advantage of the Prosecution, now is the time for them to cross-examine him.  It won't necessarily work to complain later that they didn't have the medical report they wanted.  

I don't know if that's assist -- of assistance.  I saw Your Honour ruminating in response to Mr. Weyl's observation.  And I'm simply expressing, if I may, the Prosecution position with regard to the arguments which have been advanced now by the teams for Ngirumpatse and Karemera.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

You see, it -- we are not certain exactly the rationale behind the comments made by counsel for Ngirumpatse and Karemera.  We think that they have had an opportunity to cross-examine.  There has been no -- nothing that we have done that has prevented them from taking full advantage of the presence of the witness to cross-examine him to the extent that they wish to do so.  

As I understand their position, they don't want to cross-examine him because it is their view that they have an arguable case that his entire testimony should be excluded.  Now, that is not a decision which we will make at this time.  Now, I have indicated that if they wish to make that challenge on medical grounds, then they have an opportunity to make application for leave to call an expert, or to cross-examine the experts who have already produced reports.  But that is a matter which they have the freedom to do, or not to do, as they please.  And we don't think we should make any further order, except to indicate that they have permission to do so, if they wish.  

With regard to the existing documents, I just had a brief consultation with the registry, and he told me -- the registrar, and he told me that he exhibited the documents in the way he usually does.  But if anybody wishes to have a copy and they ask, the copy will be provided.  So there is no mystery; there are no additional documents.  The Court acted in a routine manner, and the documents have been exhibited.  And if anybody wishes to have a copy -- well, in fact, we can go both beyond that.  

Mr. Registrar, we will accept Ms. Diagne's comments in court as a request for a copy, and I would require that you give copies to all parties to the proceedings.  So that should deal with that matter.  Thank you.  

Has that clarified the position in any way?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I think there is not a best time, but there's the best way of making an application publicly.  I did not think that I should make a request to the registry.  I would like to express our satisfaction with what you've just said, and at the same time I would like to make an application in respect of the document which was shown to us, and which has been sought by Édouard Karemera's team.  But I want to -- also to let the Court know that we have understood your position.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Is there any re-examination, Mr. Morley?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Brief.  I'm hoping to finish before the break.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you were answering questions from Mr. Robinson today, in respect of an interview with the prosecutor in Rwanda in 1998, you fairly admitted you had not told the truth.  Do you remember that part of your testimony earlier today?  
A.	Thank you, Prosecutor.  When I was answering the question of the public -- when I was answering the public prosecutor's questions, I did not speak the truth.  
Q.	And why was that?  
A.	At that time I was not willing to tell the truth regarding what had happened.  And as I have already explained, some people intimidated us, some accused people told us that their brothers or relatives who were outside the country would return soon to the country, and that was something which scared us.  
Q.	Have you told the truth to the Judges at this Tribunal?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And why is that?  
A.	I've told the truth here because the conditions here are conducive to me telling the truth.  And my conscience dictates that I speak the truth, because I have been moved by what had happened.  
Q.	When you say the conditions here are conducive to telling the truth, what do you mean by "conducive"?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I examined my conscience and I had remorse, and I decided to speak the whole truth.  
Q.	Mr. Robinson yesterday, very helpfully, took you through, line by line, a note of an interview which took place between you and an investigator from the ICTR on the 4th of November of 2004.  And, while going through that note, to summarise it, it is recorded that when first approached by the ICTR, you mentioned that Karemera had been present in Shyembe in 1993, and had said to the MRND youth:  "We are in a war; the time will come when you must fight the Tutsis.  For you to be prepared you will be trained and supplied with weapons."  Is that right or wrong?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  He did not make those comments in Shyembe.  Rather, we were at the communal office. 
Q.	Thank you, that's helpful.  Did he make those comments at the communal office?  
A.	Yes, we had gathered at the meeting room of the communal office.  
Q.	Also in the note helpfully read out by Mr. Robinson, it is recorded that you told the investigator that:  "In mid-April 1994", adding "10th April", "Karemera came in a red Toyota pickup wearing a military jacket.  In the pickup there were weapons such as Kalashnikovs, R4s, grenades, and axes."  Is that right or wrong?  
A.	Thank you.  That is correct, he came there about one week after the president's death.  He had all those -- equipment with him in a red pickup truck.  
Q.	Also in the note, and finally dealing with that, it is recorded that you reported that Karemera had said that you and others should use the weapons he had brought to kill Tutsis hiding at the ESI hospital and at the Kalinda school.  Is that right or wrong?  
A.	That is what happened, and that is what he said in front of people who had gathered there with us.  
Q.	I would like to ask you, please, now, about Corporal Evariste.  You have told us when you first gave evidence in October, that you were trained as a member of the militraham -- start again.  As a member of the Interahamwe in military matters.  Amongst the trainers, was there a Corporal Evariste?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I think that I gave you the name of instructors.  Among those instructors there were corporals and sergeants, and even soldiers of other ranks.  I have already said that amongst the names of the instructors there was one Evariste. 
Q.	Did you ever know Evariste's surname?  
A.	No, I just remember -- or, rather, I knew only the first name.  
Q.	Have you mixed with or seen Corporal Evariste whilst you've been at prison?  
A.	Our last meeting was a long time ago.  If I had met him at a given time, he might have recognised me.  But personally I did not recognise him as being one of the people I met at the prison. 
Q.	In short, have you recognised Corporal Evariste amongst any of the prisoners in any of the prisons you have been placed?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I did not pay attention in order to know whether Evariste was in one of the prisons where I was placed, particularly since he was not a native of my secteur, so I did not have any reason at all to pay any attention to his presence.  
MR. MORLEY: 
That concludes my re-examination.  Do Your Honours have any questions of this witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Maybe we will complete the -- we will first finish with this witness, and I will -- but what I wanted to say, I would like to make submissions on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  But maybe I could do that after this witness has left the courtroom, after his examination -- after his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

We don't have any questions of this witness.  

Witness AXA, we thank you for returning to Arusha to complete your evidence before the Tribunal.  You have assisted the Tribunal in its work.  But now we can excuse you, and you can return.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, what is the subject on which you wish to address us?  Is it something -- should we do it -- should we take our recess now, or is it connected to this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it is related to the witness, but in any case, it will be very brief.  I think I will be done within two minutes.  

Mr. President, on the 5th of December 2007, we had a status conference, and during that status conference we had a long discussion in order to know whether the evidence adduced by the Prosecution was over.  And we were told that since the witness -- some witnesses will be recalled, there could be cross-examinations, as well as re-examination.  The Prosecutor's case, therefore, was not complete.  

As part of that debate it was submitted by the Prosecution that, in as far as there would be no re-examination, the evidence should be considered as being complete.  There was -- there was even a question of -- regarding whether they would examine, or re-examine AXA.  The Prosecution said they would not re-examine AXA because they considered, after cross-examination, the evidence will be complete.  But I've noticed here that they have re-examined the witness, in spite of having made commitments to do otherwise.  And we hope that they will not violate their commitments regarding other witnesses.  

It's only today, on the 10th of April 2008, that we can consider that the Prosecution case is closed.  And I wanted to say this for the record on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's team.  In other words, I want to say -- I wanted to say that the Prosecution case has been closed today, and not last time, because they have re-examined.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, if I could just intervene.  Frankly, I don't agree, myself.  I think they have the right to re-examine.  But I also don't agree that the Prosecution's case has closed, because my cross-examination of Witness BDW, which was postponed, will continue on Monday.  So, just as long as we're making statements for the record, it's Mr. Nzirorera's position that the Prosecution's case has not yet closed.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, just to complete the record.  Quite frankly, I have no recollection of making the submission that Mr. Weyl attributes to the Prosecution.  It would be ridiculous, quite frankly, to suggest that we'd hear additional cross-examination of a witness and not redirect limited to that.  So I think we're just playing with semantics here.  I think the Chamber has already commented on how we view the closure of the Prosecution case is really, in the words of Your Honour, I think, is how we looked at a flower.  So it really doesn't matter at this point.  

But if Mr. Weyl thinks that the Prosecution had confined itself to what would come forth in cross-examination, he was wrong.  I certainly don't think I misspoke.  But if there's something on the record that would indicate that, clearly I did, because we do not surrender our right to re-examine a witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  I don't think that we need to say anything else for the record, because I think we've spoken already.  What we will do now, we will take our mid-morning recess.  What's next on our agenda?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Cross-examination of Witness BTH by me.
MR. WEBSTER:
I forgot.  All questions must be directed to the far side of the courtroom first.  So I will have to get used to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Let us take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1027H) 
(Pages 1 to 17 by Kirstin McLean)



















(Court resumed at 1154H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registrar, could you bring in the witness, please?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, just one thing I could place on the record before the witness comes in.  Witness BTH appeared before this Chamber in June of 2006, and prior to that he testified in three other proceedings before this Tribunal where he swore to tell the truth under oath.  He testified in the first Karemera trial in March of 2004.  He testified in the Bizimungu trial, and here I am referring to the Government II trial, in October of 2004; and he testified in the Ndindiliyimana trial in January and February 2006; and then, again, his last testimony was before us in Karemera in June of 2006.  So, on four previous occasions, he has given consistent evidence where he agreed to tell the truth, and now, based on the transcription of the -- an interview he had -- an interview of this witness in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) in February this 
month (sic), he seems to suggest that portions of his evidence were not true.  

We all have a sense of what we can expect from his testimony, and I think it would be wise for the Chamber to make some decision about how we are going to approach his examination.  

Under Rule 91, section A, it states that:  "The Chamber proprio moto, or at the request of a party, may warn a witness of the duty to tell the truth and the consequences that may result from a failure to do so."  And I would urge the Chamber to have a look at that and to make a preliminary decision as to how we are going to proceed with this witness, and to decide whether it will be appropriate before he even begins his testimony, to give him a warning and to explain what the possible consequences could be if a determination was made that he was either lying in his four previous testimonies before the Chamber, or if a determination is made that he was lying when he gave his testimony during the course of today.  So that's my suggestion.  I don't know if Mr. Robinson wants to be heard, but somehow we need to resolve that before the witness actually begins his evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
A moment.  Just a moment. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, there is no more translation into French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)  
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. President, this was with a view to calling to your attention that during the Prosecutor's intervention, we no longer had interpretation through the French channel at one moment in time.  So the Prosecutor would not mind speaking again.  I don't quite know when it was cut off, but it would be very useful for the French speaking people present to understand what was going on.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll be happy to do so.  It's a fairly short submission.  I am simply requesting the Chamber to have a look at Rule 91, sub A and make some preliminary decision as to how we should proceed with this witness.  My suggestion is that the witness be warned about the consequences of giving false testimony.  So, perhaps Mr. Robinson would like to be heard, but the Chamber should give some thought to that particular provision and make a preliminary decision before the witness is even brought in. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  On every occasion in which I asked you to warn a witness concerning consequences of false testimony, the Prosecution objected and you refused to warn the witness.  To now warn a witness who is about to give exculpatory evidence on behalf of the Accused would be having a chilling effect on whether or not he gives that evidence, and under the circumstances, we believe it would be very inappropriate.  So I think we should take it step by step.  Let's bring the witness in; we will start the examination.  If you feel, at any time, something needs to be -- he needs to be advised of rights, or anything like that, you can do it at this time, but to pre-emptively discourage his testimony by warning him of the consequences of false testimony when you refused to do that every time we've asked of Prosecution witnesses, then I don't think it will be appropriate and it would, in fact, discourage the truth that, I think, we are about to hear.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I would beg to differ a bit from Mr. Robinson.  In this situation, we have a transcript of an interview taken only two months ago where the witness stated categorically that he wanted to retract aspects of his evidence because he had lied when he had given it.  So the situation is quite different.  But, ultimately, this is an issue for the Chamber.  This is not an issue that is going to be -- the issue with this witness and the substance of his testimony is going to go far beyond today and his cross-examination.  And bearing that in mind, I think it will be appropriate to start on a good footing.  That's my suggestion, but, ultimately, the Chamber will know how best to handle the matter. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I am wondering if Mr. Webster can clarify what he just said that "the consequences will go far beyond..."  Is he intimidating (sic) that if the witness now tells the truth, he is going to prosecute him for false testimony because he testified to something differently in the Prosecution case?  I think he should be clear.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My understanding from what Mr. Robinson has repeatedly stated over the past several days is that he contends that there is a conspiracy in Ruhengeri to encourage false testimony of Prosecution witnesses.  So, just given the forecast that he has made of the examination he is going to make of this witness, it has consequences beyond this witness and this case, and it affects other cases.  This witness has testified in three other trials.  There are other witnesses that this witness has identified in his interview in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  So, clearly, depending on what he said, there may be further investigations and consequences, depending on the results of that investigation.  That's all I am saying.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
We have considered the submissions and we do think that an appropriate warning is appropriate.  I can assure Mr. Robinson that it will not be delivered in a manner which will discourage him from telling the truth.  

Could you bring in the witness, please?  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness BTH.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness BTH, you have been recalled to testify in this trail, and in just a minute or two, the registrar will be administering an oath for you to tell the truth.  Now, among the documents that have been circulated prior to your attendance here today is a document which seems to indicate that you had declared that you had not previously told the truth on oath, and it is my duty to warn you that when you are in this witness box, you are obligated to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and that if you fail to do so, there will be judicial consequences.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, will you please administer the oath to the witness?  
(Declaration made by Witness BTH in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson will be examining you at this stage.  
MR. ROBINSON:  
	Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS BTH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q   	Witness BTH, Waramutse.  Amarakuru ki?  
A.  	Good morning, Counsel.  I am fine, thank you.  
Q.  	Witness BTH, the circumstances which have brought you here today is that after your testimony in this trial, the Defence was in receipt of a letter you had sent to the Prosecutor in August 2007 requesting a meeting.  Subsequently, on the 8th of February 2008, one of the Defence teams met you in the presence of the Prosecutor and you gave a statement at that time.  Based upon that you have been recalled as a witness in this case.  The parties have been prohibited from having any contact with you, and I am now going to ask you questions about the events which were the subject of your testimony earlier.  Are you ready to tell the truth?
A.  	I am ready to speak the truth.  However, as you might have heard, I do not live in my country.  I live in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), due to security reasons, and up to now, I am not sure of my security.  

You know that during this period in Rwanda, they are commemorating the genocide.  Therefore, it is a very difficult period.  It is very difficult for one to give testimony, like the one I am willing to give.  The government does not appreciate this kind of testimony -- same thing applies to the inhabitants of Rwanda, particularly during this period when they are commemorating the genocide, because during this period there are many speeches which are delivered, and for these reasons, I am not sure that my security will be guaranteed.  

I can explain to you the reasons which made me write -- or, rather, I am not ready to give you the reasons why I wrote this letter related to security issue.  

Firstly, I would like to apologise to the Trial Chamber, because during my testimony, I gave a false testimony.  And I can explain the reasons for doing so, when asked.  

I was told to do that, and the people who told me to do that are important people.  Actually, they are in the government.  Therefore, I would like to apologise for what I did.  I did what I did because of the pressure exerted on me.  

Now, with regard to my security, I think that this issue has to be settled before I testify, because, as you know, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) is not far from Rwanda.  I could be killed within days of my return to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I believe it is probably more appropriate for you to address the issue of his security with him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the -- the measures taken to protect your security in the courtroom has to do with our machinery for protecting your identity from being revealed to the public.  Now, we have been managing that through controlling the answers that are given in open session.  And those answers which might -- are likely to disclose who you are, are redacted from the public record.  Those are the measures which are available to us in the courtroom.  

I would -- therefore, Mr. Robinson, what we will be doing, we will be managing the questions you are asked, and I assume also you will have a fairly good idea of what can be done in open session and what needs to go in closed session.  And that's the regime that we will introduce while he is in the courtroom.  If there are things that need to be done other than that, then the relevant -- the relevant person or authority could make an application at the conclusion of his testimony.  But we think that for the purpose of our proceedings here, we will use the established regime of identity concealment from the public.  

Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

What I am saying is serious.  I know very well that my security is not guaranteed.  I can give you an example.  Recently, I was not here in Arusha, but people came to look me from Arusha -- came to -- came from Arusha to look me in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  Two days later people called me from Rwanda and told me what I had testified to.  So how could those people have known what I had said if your protective measures are effective?  Because no one mentioned my name during my evidence.  What I want to say is that, in general, witnesses know one another when they come from the same area.  

I will give you another example.  A witness went to tell my mother that he had heard on the radio what I had said.  My name was not mentioned on the -- was not mentioned on the radio, but my mother was told what I had said.  And then there is a young girl who is a student in Butare who called me and told me that she understood that they were talking about me when they heard what was being said on the radio.  So there are many reasons which can lead to my recognition through my testimony.  

Another thing is that there are people working for this Tribunal who know me, and some of those people are -- actually, are at the root of my problems in that they are the ones who revealed what I had said.  That is another problem which is facing me.  Therefore, I am not sure that my security is guaranteed.  I don't know how to put it, but this is something that concerns me, preoccupies me.  

Another example is that, I am living with someone who is a former soldier of RPF.  I am staying in his house, but he does not stay (sic) the circumstances under which I go to his place.  But you cannot prevent the media to report -- you cannot prevent them from reporting what I say here and who I am.  When I return, that person will ask me, "Where are you coming from?"  And, probably, he will not accommodate me any longer.  He could even kill me or have me arrested.  So, I am really very worried.  

What I am telling you is very serious.  I have many concrete examples which could show you that even if my pseudonym is used, I could still be recognised.  I am saying this particularly since the testimonies which we give, in general, are testimonies which we concocted together with other witnesses, so they know what the contents are and, therefore, they would be able to recognise me.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we understand what you have said, and we will act on the premise that your concerns are genuine.  

Now, as I have indicated, there are two levels of protection which the Tribunal can offer.  One is protection in the courtroom.  And in the courtroom, the protection regime that we have in place has to do with trying to reduce the risk that your identity is revealed by the way information is extracted from you.  So, if it appears that there is some information which is capable of identifying you, that information is not published in the public record.  

Now, the second level of protection has to do with what happens when you are not in the courtroom.  If the existing protection order is inadequate for your particular situation, the method of addressing it is that when your testimony is completed, you will have to make representation to the registry through the WVSS officers who have been assisting you, and they will make investigations and make recommendations as to what, if any, further steps are required for your protection.  But the Tribunal takes issues of witness protection seriously, and those are the two levels which we can operate.  

I think, in the circumstances, what we should do now is to take your evidence.  We will manage the courtroom as we have said, and when your testimony is completed, you will have the opportunity to address the registry who will investigate and make recommendations on any further steps which it considers to be desirable, in the circumstances.  

Yes, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  

I don't want to be difficult because I have not come here for that.  I have come here -- I came here in the evening.  I thought that I would have time to make representation to the WVSS before testifying.  I left my country because of problems, whose genesis is here in this Tribunal.  That is why I left my country.  I know that nothing can happen to me here in the courtroom, but after my testimony, there will be risks.  I do not want to remain here in the hands of the Tribunal, because I want to go back home.  And, therefore, I would like to know who should I contact in order to explain to them my security problems after my testimony.  Could I contact that person prior to my testimony, or after my testimony?  I will not be at peace during my testimony if this problem has not been resolved.  Maybe I will complete my testimony today, tomorrow or next week, but when I return to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), I could well be killed.  Therefore, I would like this issue to be resolved prior to my giving testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, just tune in for a minute.  The Tribunal has already made a protection order for you.  You have to give your testimony now.  I just told you that when your testimony is finished, you will have another opportunity to ask for a reconsideration of the protection measures that are already in place.  At that time, the registry will make enquiries and make recommendations to the Chamber, and we will take action.  But we cannot postpone your evidence.  You will have to do it at the conclusion of your testimony, and then they will investigate the matter and decide whether to recommend that the measures already in place should be varied.  We can't do anything more than that at this time. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we should start now. 

Mr. Robinson, are you ready?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, are you prepared to answer my questions at this time? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Was there Interahamwe in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Personally, I would say that there were no real Interahamwes in the Mukingo commune.  There was militia, that is true, but it was not a militia that was legally recognised.  And the national organs of Interahamwes were not represented when the militia was founded.  So I can say that there were no real Interahamwes in the Mukingo commune, although there was a militia there. 
Q.	And who was the head of the militia that you are referring to? 
A.	Michel Niyigaba. 

MR. ROBINSON:
That's N-I-Y-I-G-A-B-A. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber the circumstances under which that militia was formed? 
A.	I do not know the circumstances under which the militia was created.  To go back -- but I would like to say that I am not talking about the entire Mukingo commune, rather, I am referring,  specifically, to the Musogo secteur -- Busogo, sorry.  Regarding the circumstances of the creation of that militia, I think it was members -- or, it was the members of the militia who came together.  All of them were members of the MRND.  

During the war, most members of that militia had military uniform or Kitenge uniform.  Initially, it was an association of people who had the same occupation, that is, farmers and herdsmen, livestock breeders; and since they were all -- or, rather, the majority of them were members of the MRND political party, they formed a militia because of the chaotic situation that was prevalent in the country because of the war. 
Q.	Now, prior to the formation of the militia, was Michel Niyigaba the president of this agricultural organisation? 
A.	Yes, he was the president of this association, but, subsequently, this association took part in the killings, as did the other members of the population, who were also involved in the massacres perpetrated. 
Q.	Now, did you have any role, or were you present during the formation of the militia? 
A.	I initially said that this was a militia.  In view of the violent acts that this group had been involved in, a group which was moreover armed, and when this militia was set up, nobody came from the outside with a view to setting it up.  It was, in fact, the members who, each on an individual basis, were involved in violent acts, and I recognise or admit to the fact that I had a role within this association.  I was one of the leaders. 
Q.	And, approximately, when was this militia formed?  When was it first formed? 
A.	Between 1991 and 1994.  I no longer remember, precisely. 
Q.	Okay.  On the 15th of November 1992, there was a meeting in the Ruhengeri stadium where 
President Habyarimana appeared.  Was the militia formed before or after that? 
A.	The association was already in existence even before the visit of President Habyarimana and the rally organised at Ruhengeri stadium. 
Q.	Now, during the first trial you testified that Bourgmestre Kajelijeli had convened a meeting of the youth at the Mukingo communal office and had announced that Joseph Nzirorera had instructed that a youth wing of the MRND be set up, and that about 40 or 50 youths had attended, and here I am referring to testimony given on the 8th of June at pages 28 to 30.  Was that true? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did the leadership of the MRND within Mukingo commune have anything to do with the setting up of the militia? 
A.	No, the -- those in charge of the MRND did not intervene in the setting up of this militia. 
Q.	And did Mr. Nzirorera have anything to do with the setting up of this militia? 
A.	Minister Nzirorera did not have any connection with this association and this militia.  He did not intervene either in the administration or financing of this militia. 
Q.	Now, you testified earlier -- previously in this trial that immediately after the youth wing was set up, the leaders were introduced to Nzirorera, who said that he was ready to work with them, and that all communications should go through Kajelijeli, and that members of the committee had met with Nzirorera, including yourself, Niyigaba and others, and that also present were 
General Augustin Bizimungu; John Niyoyita, N-I-Y-O-Y-I-T-A; Baheza, B-A-H-E-Z-A; and Nyabusore, N-Y-A-B-U-S-O-R-E; and that this meeting took place at the residence of Nzirorera's mother.  Did such a meeting ever take place? 
A.	No, that is what we had to say.  We had been requested to accuse people of having participated in alleged meetings, but the truth be told, this meeting never did exist. 
Q.	I am going to go through all these chronologically, and then at the end, I'm going to ask you how was it that you came to give false testimony.  But, I think, really, the first thing I want to do is just have you tell the truth about what happened so that we all understand, really, what happened.  

Now, you testified also that Nzirorera returned to Mukingo almost every weekend and held meetings at his mother's house, and after those meetings instructions were given to the Interahamwe.  Was that true? 
A.	No, that is not true.  Firstly, there were no Interahamwe.  Even if today everybody is given the label of Interahamwe with a view to putting them down, but the Interahamwe did not exist, as such, in this region, and the alleged meetings never did exist.  Every time Nzirorera came to the region, he would stay with his mother, or he might come to deal with other personal issues which did not concern me.  I did not go there, and I never heard that he had convened a meeting.  However, if I did testify to such an effect, it was because the Rwandan judicial system had helped us to concoct a false testimony that we were to make against those accused persons before this Tribunal, and it was, indeed, the Rwandan authorities who told us precisely what we had to say.  However, there was no meeting, as such.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, and we are going to go into depth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a comment.  I think that the pace at which you are going is a bit fast for accurate reporting.  So, please speak a bit slowly, and the witness, as well.  Please, slow down.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, I will do that, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, BTH, we are going to go into detail about those authorities and what happened after you went to prison, near the end of your testimony.  

Now, did Mr. Nzirorera ever distribute Kitenge uniforms to the militia or the youth in the commune of Mukingo? 
A.	I never saw Nzirorera distributing uniforms to the Interahamwe. 
Q.	At the -- earlier in the trial, on the 8th of June, at page 35 of the transcript, you testified that around August 1992, that Mr. Nzirorera distributed about 40 to 50 Kitenge clothing to Interahamwe, including yourself, at his house, at his own residence.  Was that true? 
A.	No, that is not the truth, because I never went to Nzirorera's house.  I might go to his mother's home. However, I never went to Mr. Nzirorera's home.  I knew where his residence was, but I never went there. 
Q.	Did you ever have a membership card for the Interahamwe? 
A.	No. 
Q.	At the earlier trial, you testified, again, on the 8th of June, beginning at page 34 of the transcript, that you had received a membership card of the Interahamwe in 1992, and that the Interahamwe had been instructed to turn over a list of their members to Mr. Niyoyita by Mr. Nzirorera, and thereafter received membership cards which were signed by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Was that true? 
A.	No.  To my knowledge, nobody within our region was in possession of Interahamwe cards -- membership cards.  This was all an invention, and this is what we had been requested to come and testify to before the Trial Chamber.  I had a membership card for the MRND party, as any other member of the public might have had.  However, I never had a membership card for the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Do you know the building called Isimbi? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	At the previous trial you testified that Mr. Nzirorera gave this building to the Interahamwe to use as their headquarters.  Was that true? 
A.	I merely know that this building belonged to Nzirorera and that there was an MRND flag flying at this location.  But, as regards the fact that Nzirorera might have given over this building to the Interahamwe, this is not true because there were no Interahamwe there, and there was also a shop located in this building.  Before -- in the past, there has been a pharmacy, and previously, there had been a food shop -- or, foodstuff shop.  Now, if the MRND came to set up its office there, it is because it paid rent there, as anybody else might have been able to set up an office there within this building.  However, I never went to this building myself in order to visit an Interahamwe office. 
Q.	Was there ever any military training at or near the Isimbi building? 
A.	No, there was no military training given in the Isimbe building.  And when we said or claimed that there had been military training, it was with a view to falsely accusing Mr. Nzirorera with a view to proving that he had given this building over to the Interahamwe.  So, this was only invention on our part.  And even if I did claim that I did take part in such training sessions, they did not, in fact, exist.  And I never, personally, followed any form of military training.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have to ask you again to consciously speak a bit more slowly.  The recorder will not be accurate if you continue to speak so fast.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	You testified earlier that at one meeting at the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother, he had given instructions to take down the flags of other political parties.  Is that true? 
A.	No, that is not true.  As I already said, I did not take part in any meetings, and it was never brought to my attention that Nzirorera allegedly held any meetings. 
Q.	Was there ever an occasion where militia or other persons from Mukingo commune went and took down the flags of other political parties? 
A.	Personally, I know not of any such incidents, and any similar incidents that we might have talked about before the Trial Chamber was an invention.  I told you that we had received instructions to come and testify falsely.  So I do not know of any incidents, personally.
Q.	During your earlier testimony you testified that the Interahamwe in Mukingo had pointed out some people who had later been abducted and killed, such as Rudatinya, and that testimony was given on the 8th of June, at page 42, and that in early 1993, after a meeting at Nzirorera's house, Nzirorera had told the Interahamwe to attack the Bagogwe and that they had done so.  Was that true? 
A.	Counsel, could I ask you to repeat what you just said because I did not quite grasp it with reference to what you said about Mr. Ruta -- Rudatinya?
Q.	Yes, I will.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am sorry.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, I was saying that you had testified at the earlier that the Interahamwe in Mukingo pointed out some people who had later -- to the authorities, who had later been abducted and killed, such as Rudatinya.  So my question to you is:  Did the militia have any role in pointing out -- or, in any way in the death of Rudatinya? 
A.	What I can say with reference to this issue is that Rudatinya was, indeed, killed.  Now, as to the accusations levelled against him, or the way in which he was identified, I would say, quite simply, that I have no information on this subject.  However, I can confirm that he was abducted and that we did not see him again.  People said that he had been killed.  And if we said that it was the Interahamwe who identified this individual, well, this is not true.  And I should say that there was no Interahamwe, as such, in Busogo secteur.  In brief, I do not know the person who was behind the arrest of Rudatinya.  All that I do know is that he was arrested and subsequently killed, as all the members of the public came to know.  However, I do not know anything else with reference to the circumstances of his arrest or the accusations levelled against him. 
Q.	You testified that in earlier 1993, after a meeting at Nzirorera's house, Nzirorera had told the Interahamwe to act against the accomplices of the Inkotanyi, and thereafter the Interahamwe had attacked the Bagogwe in Busogo secteur causing them to flee to the house of the nuns.  And that was on the 8th of June on page 43 and pages 44.  Was that true? 
A.	I told you that I never went to Nzirorera's mother's house with a view to collecting instructions, and I never heard or saw Nzirorera give any instructions to the Interahamwe with a view to inciting them to launch attacks.  So you will understand that this is not correct.  Nzirorera did not give any instructions with a view to having attacks launched against the Bagogwe.  I believe that the people who attacked the Bagogwe did so on their own initiative, or they might have received instructions from other individuals.  However, personally, during that period, I did not take part in any attack upon the Bagogwe. 
Q.	Now, you also testified about another organisation that was formed after the RPF attack in February of 1993 called Amahindure or Virunga Force, and you testified about a meeting that was held at the Mukingo commune office shortly after the RPF attack in which the formation of this group, Amahindure or Virunga Force was announced.  Did such a meeting take place? 
A.	I have no knowledge of this meeting.  Myself and other witnesses, who were co-detainees, spoke about this meeting because we had been asked to do so, and every witness was supposed to corroborate the testimony provided by the other witnesses with a view to have believe that such a meeting had existed, but, personally, I did not take part in such a meeting. 
Q.	Was the organisation of this group, Amahindure or Virunga Force, created before the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I do not know as I do not have any information on this organisation.  I spoke to you about the 
youth -- the origins of the testimony that I came to provide before this Tribunal, and I cannot speak about this organisation, as such, the Amahindure, because I never took part in a meeting during which this alleged organisation might have been set up. 
Q.	And during your testimony when you said that Mr. Nzirorera had presided over such a meeting and had said they were going to create a group to work in collaboration with soldiers to receive military training in firearms, was that testimony true? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, you testified that four days after that meeting, military training began in Mukingo commune; that some 120 people registered for the training, but by the end, some three to 400 people were trained; that the training lasted for three to four months, and that you participated for one month.  Was that true? 
A.	This is not true.  I did not take part in this training, and I do not know the individuals whose names I mentioned.  This is just a testimony we were requested to provide, and we did so. 
Q.	Did you have a gun before the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I never had a firearm with me. 
Q.	You testified that you received a firearm from Dusabimana at the house of Nzirorera's mother.  Was that true? 
A.	That is not true at all.
MR. ROBINSON:
Dusabimana is D-U-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A; and that testimony was on the 8th of June at page 49.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And you also testified that other Interahamwe had received weapons in 1993 from Ruhehe hill, a military position there, and that you believe that that was pursuant to an agreement that Nzirorera had made with military officers.  Was that true? 
A.	This is not true.  All that is part of the false testimony that had been elaborated for us.  That is not true.  I did not witness those events.  I don't even know whether those events took place or not. 
Q.	Do you have any information that Mr. Nzirorera ever distributed or was responsible for the distribution of weapons in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Makoni, M-A-K-O-N-I? 
A.	Yes, I knew Makoni. 
Q.	You testified that on one occasion during the training, Nzirorera called the Interahamwe into the living room of his mother's house and said that they should hunt for accomplices of the Inkotanyi, and that the president of the Interahamwe had said that there was a problem with Makoni, and that Nzirorera said that "We should kill him."  Did such a meeting ever take place? 
A.	I have already told you that that meeting -- or, those meetings were never held.  We were told to make accusations against the former leaders of the former Rwandan government, and this is what we did.  We decided to place responsibility on them -- in respect of Makoni's death, whereas Makoni had had problems with a soldier called Shyiramuburyo, and it was Shyiramuburyo who killed him, but, otherwise, he did not have anything to do with his death. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the name be repeated by our colleagues in the Kinyarwanda booth?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, I think I can spell that name.  I have it as S-H-Y-I-A-R -- excuse me, S-H-Y-I-R-A-M-U-B-U-R-Y-O. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, you testified that there were lists made up of Tutsis.  Was that true? 
A.	That's not true.  Even if that list had been drawn up, I was not there when it was prepared, so I don't know anything.  But, otherwise, that's not true. 
Q.	Now, I am going to ask you some questions about events that occurred after the death of 
President Habyarimana, but before I do that, I want to try to get a sense from you of, really, what was going on in Mukingo commune that you were involved in or aware of.  Now, during 1991 through 1994, were you in school? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And during part of that, were you living in school, or were you living at home? 
A.	I was living at home. 
Q.	And did you have occasion to see Michel Niyigaba frequently during 1991 to 1994? 
A.	I did not see him frequently, but I would see him sometimes.  We lived near the market.  He worked at the market.  I saw -- I would see him often.  I would -- I saw him at a place where they sold tea.  So I saw him often, yes.  
Q.	And can you tell us the names of some of the other people who were part of this group or militia prior to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I do not remember all the members of the group, but I can give you some names.  There was Ndabahariye; Bagabo; Rwihandagaza; Noel Ndayisaba; Nsekanabo; Gapfobo; Semanza; Hakizimana; Rumaziminsi; Kwitonda, whose full name is Pierre; Célestin Kwitonda; Saidi Gakuro; 
Theoneste Barebereho.  These are the people I remember.  Later, some soldiers left the army and joined the group.  For example, one Gervais Musafiri -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Herve (sic) is spelt H-E-R-V-E.  
THE WITNESS:
-- Jean Pierre Ndagijimana.  In that group, there was also one Iyamuremye, and Sibomana, who was also a member of the group. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you.  Continue.  
A.	The people whose names I mentioned last were soldiers, but for reasons for which I am not aware, they left the army, and it was from that point onwards that that association started committing acts of violence, and, in fact, that's when that association became militia.  I do not know why the main individuals left the army.  People were saying that, for example, they were indisciplined soldiers who refused to go to the warfront.  So it was from then onwards that people started saying that that group was an Interahamwe group.  So it was those individuals who made the association -- who tarnished the good image or reputation that the association had earlier.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, to save time, my team will provide the spellings to the court reporters after the recess. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What about a person by the name of Mwambutsa, M-W-A-M (sic)?  Was he a member of this militia? 
A.	Yes, Theoneste Mwambutsa was a member of that group, but I cannot remember all the names right now, that is why I had not given you that name.  But, yes, he was a member of that group. 
Q.	And what about Gato, the twin brother of Gakuro, was he a member? 
A.	Yes, I had forgotten to mention his name, but, yes, he was part of the group.  The group had many members, so I cannot remember all the names. 
Q.	Was Dusabimana ever a member of the group? 
A.	Dusabimana joined the group later, but he was not one of the founding members.  He, too, was a soldier, but he left the army for reasons which I do not know.  He joined the group at the same time as the other soldiers.  Musafiri, Nsabimana and others.  He, too, was a part of the group.  They were all young people who lived in Byangabo.  They were together at all times and they committed acts of violence.
Q.  	Now, prior to the death of President Habyarimana, can you tell us what acts of violence were committed by these people in the Mukingo commune, to your knowledge?  What did they do?  
A.	Before President Habyarimana's death, they beat up the Bagogwes they found on the road, and they went to Ruda -- no, who were going to Rudatinya -- those people who are currently living in our area.  

I also remember that once they went to fight against the Bagogwes, but the Bagogwes fled to ISAE, that is, the Higher Institute of Agriculture and Livestock. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
ISAE is I-S-A-E in capital.  
THE WITNESS:
They were violent young people by nature, not simply because they were -- had been given orders by anyone.  They were young and indisciplined people and that is why they committed those acts of violence. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	To your knowledge, did any authorities order them to do any of those acts of violence prior to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I don't know.  What I know is that -- what I know is that no authority gave me an order to commit acts of violence.  I was in school.  I would leave my home in the morning and come back in the evening or in the afternoon, so I was not with them when they were committing those acts of violence.  But when I was with them, I never ever saw a leader come there to give them orders.  For example, I know that they beat up people.  They went to attack Bagogwes in their houses.  At that time, I was in school, so I do not know exactly what happened.  But I know that those Bagogwes went to seek refuge at ISAE.  People were talking about this even in bars.  And when they beat people on the road, it was on a Sunday, but I did not see any leader give them orders to beat up those people.  But -- so I witnessed that particular event, and I did not see any authority giving them orders to do that.  But, given the fact that there was a war, there were many political parties; each person had his or her own political views, and the war, everyone had an opinion on the war.  So there were people who hated Tutsis because of that.  But as far as I am concerned, I can say that no authority gave us any order for us to do anything whatsoever. 
Q.	When the Bagogwe Tutsis fled to the ISAE, were they guarded by gendarmes, that is, ISAE? 
A.	Yes, there were gendarmes protecting the Bagogwe at the ISAE.  And even when the Bagogwes would go to fetch water, the gendarmes would escort them. 
Q.	We've heard evidence that the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, up until February 1993, was Juvénal Kajelijeli.  Do you know him? 
A.	I knew Kajelijeli, and I think that if I were to see him today I would recognise him. 
Q.	Can you tell us, during the time he was bourgmestre, did you get -- to your knowledge, did he encourage any kind of killings or attacks against the Tutsi? 
A.	I have told you that, personally, what I know is that no authority, be it Kajelijeli or someone else, no authority gave orders to anyone.  I was often at school most of my time.  I was at school most of the time, so I cannot confirm that Kajelijeli issued orders that Tutsis should be attacked.  And when I happened to see Kajelijeli, he was not giving us orders to go to any place or to commit any act. 
Q.	Now, during the period before the death of the president, how frequently did you see Mr. Nzirorera returning to Mukingo commune? 
A.	He used to come there to visit his family.  He used to come to his residence, but I cannot tell you the number of times that I saw him, but he came there often.  I cannot tell you the number of times when he came there, but I know that he came there, to the Mukingo commune, regularly. 
Q.	And did the frequency in which he came to the Mukingo commune diminished after the attack of the RPF in February 1990 stayed the same? 
A.	I did not notice any difference. 
Q.	Now, directing your attention to Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house.  Were you friends with people who were living there? 
A.	Yes.  François Dusabimana was my friend.  We attended the same school.  We are practically the same age.  We are often together.  We go to their home from time to time.  I cannot say that I used to go to his house every day, but it happened that from time to time I would go there.  Dusabimana and I are almost the same age and we attended the same school. 
Q.	Can you tell us who else was living at the home of Mr. Nzirorera's mother around the time of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I do not know everyone who lived at Nzirorera's mother's place.  There was François Dusabimana and Noel Ndayisaba, and Nshizirungu.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English did not get the last name.  
THE WITNESS:
They lived together, as well as a young girl called Nyirabukiki -- Nyirabushisi.  There were also house helps -- or, rather, home helps, but I do not know their names. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, again.  We can provide those spellings.  

Mr. President, I am going to go into the area of what happened after the death of the president.  So, perhaps you would like to take our luncheon recess at this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I should mention that during the session this morning, the name of a country in which the witness is living was mentioned on a number of occasions and also the place where he is living now was mentioned on a couple of occasions.  I think I should order that those references be redacted.  

We will take the lunch adjournment.  

Mr. Witness, I should remind you that you should not discuss the case with anybody during this or any other adjournments while you are a witness. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, what time do we resume, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We resume at 2 p.m.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, sir.
(Court recessed at 1230H)
(Pages 18 to 34 by Sheriffo Jammeh)









(Court resumed at 1415H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue now, and I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you started this morning.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good afternoon.  

Before we move on to the events after the death of President Habyarimana, I believe there was one interpretation error and I just wanted to clear it up.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, when you were listing the people who were living at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house in 1994, somehow the name of Mr. Nzirorera got included in that list.  Was Mr. Nzirorera living in his mother's house in 1994?  
A.	No, Nzirorera's name was not one of those I mentioned.  
Q.	Okay.  I thought so.  

Now, can you tell us where you were when you learned of the death of President Habyarimana?  
A.	I was at home. 
Q.	And how did you hear of it? 
A.	An announcement was made over the radio the very night the plane came down.  The radio broadcasts continued throughout the night, and that announcement was broadcast over and over again throughout the night, that is, referring to the death of President Habyarimana and all those in his plane.  
Q.	Can you tell us approximately what time or when you first left your house after learning of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I left the house on the morning of the 7th of April at about 6 a.m., and I went to the trading centre in the market square which was not far away. 
Q.	And did you meet some other people there? 
A.	Yes, there were people at the trading centre.  
Q.	And can you tell us what happened at the trading centre between the time you first arrived and the time that the first person was killed on the morning of the 7th?  
A.	As I have just told you, I arrived the centre in the morning and I found two vehicles transporting potatoes.  That is where the vehicles loading potatoes were stationed before transporting their merchandise to Kigali.  And while people were passing, they would be asked whether they did not know what had happened.  People gathered in small groups and were discussing amongst themselves, wondering what had happened.  

A short while afterwards, Michel Niyigaba and Dusabe also arrived, and they were drunk, because they looked like they had spent the night in a drinking place, and they were asking people whether they did not know what had happened.  They asked the people who were there to accompany them so that they should go and kill Tutsis because it was the Tutsis who had killed Habyarimana.  They also said that anyone who did not want to come with them and who stayed put would also be killed after they returned.  Initially, people hesitated.  

And Niyigaba, Michel, and Musafiri moved further up towards the road leading to the Busogo parish.  And after they returned, they were dragging along with them a certain Rukara.  They addressed the crowd and told them that if people were afraid of going to kill Tutsis, they were going to give them a signal by killing Rukara.  Michel Niyigaba, who had a small axe in his hand, starting striking Rukara with that small axe.  Musafiri was throwing stones.  

However, Rukara was able to escape from them, and he started running away, asking them why they were attacking him.  However, they chased after him and caught up with him.  And after he fell down, they started throwing large stones at him.  And this is how he was killed.  

Michel Niyigaba dragged his body from where he had been killed to a place below the road and dumped it in a gutter near the road.  He said that no one should stay there.  

And so it was after that event that all those who had been present moved further up and started perpetrating killings.  
Q.	Now, when you testified at the first trial, you said that you had gone, after arriving in Byangabo centre, to Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house with Niyigaba and Dusabimana, and that at the mother's house you saw Kajelijeli, Baheza and Nyabusore.  Was that true? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you see Kajelijeli in the area of -- well, did you see Kajelijeli at all on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	No, I neither saw Kajelijeli nor Baheza.  I did not go to Nzirorera's mother's home on that morning of the 7th of April.  
Q.	Now, after the death of Rukara, was his brother Lucien killed? 
A.	Yes.  Let me point out that he was Rukara's elder brother.  
Q.	Now, while everyone was in Byangabo before moving on to other areas, did the -- was the conseiller, Assiel Ndisetse, present?  
A.	Yes, I saw Assiel Ndisetse.  He was present.
MR. ROBINSON: 
And that's N-D-I-S-E-T-S-E.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And what did the conseiller do while in -- while in Byangabo centre? 
A.	The conseiller did nothing else, but he warned the killers by telling them that if they continued attacking people, then they would be liable to serious consequences. 
Q.	And what response did he receive?  
A.	I no longer remember the answer that was given to him, because I did not really pay attention.  But I realised that they continued beating on Rukara, which means that they did not heed the warning given to them by the conseiller, and they went on to perpetrate further acts of violence. 
Q.	Can you tell us what you did after Rukara was killed? 
A.	Everyone was asked to go and participate in the killings, and they were told that anyone who did not comply would face consequences.  And because of that, I decided to go along with the others.  
Q.	And specifically from Byangabo centre, where did you go?  Where was the first place that you went?  
A.	We went further up the road towards the road getting -- leading to Busogo parish.  But when we arrived a place close to Rukara and Lucien's house, we realised that the group including Nsabimana had already entered there and killed Lucien, so we went to the area where Rudatinya's family lived.  However, in the meantime, before we arrived Rudatinya's place, some people in the group went in a different direction in order to go and attack the family members of a certain Muhinde. 
Q.	So after leaving Byangabo, the group split into two; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  One group went to Muhinde's home while the others went to go and kill Rudatinya.  But the group that went to Rudatinya's place was larger.  Those who went to Muhinde's house were fewer, because there were fewer people in Muhinde's family than in Rudatinya's family. 
Q.	And to which area did you go yourself?  
A.	I went with the group that went to Rudatinya's home. 
Q.	And what happened when the group arrived there? 
A.	Some members of the group were shown the place where they were supposed to go in order to make sure that no Tutsis managed to escape, whereas others began throwing grenades at the homes.  The Tutsis then came out of their houses in order to gather on a hillside.  And in the interim, the members of the group of assailants were then shown where they were to deploy themselves in order to stop the Tutsis from escaping.  Those who had grenades hauled them.  Others -- other members of the group of assailants went to get more grenades once they ran out.  One of the grenades hit a certain Muhutu -- or Bihutu, in fact, who then fell.  And whilst the others were attacking using grenades, the victims defended themselves with bows and arrows.  However, when Bihutu fell, the group of victims was not able to hold out any further and they then dispersed.  
Q.	And who was leading the group that attacked Rudatinya's residence? 
A.	There was Michel Niyigaba, as well as Dusabe.  The truth be told, the assailants were behind people - or, hiding behind those who had been soldiers in the past, and there were also louts within the group who were interested in whatever they could loot.  However, in our group the first to throw a grenade on the Tutsi homes was Michel Niyigaba. 
Q.	And where had the grenades come from?  Where did people get a hold of grenades? 
A.	Since the year 1990, the country was at war, and Ruhengeri had come under attack on two occasions.  Therefore, it was easy enough to get hold of grenades.  And in view of the fact that amongst us there were individuals who had formerly been soldiers, some of them had been able to get hold of grenades while they were still in active service.  And there were even some who still wore a military uniform.  So, those people who had been soldiers in the past were able to get hold of grenades, or other individuals who had relations with soldiers could also get hold of grenades via these soldiers.  
Q.	Did anyone who participated in the attack on Rudatinya's residence have a gun? 
A.	On the occasion of the first attack, there was nobody amongst the assailants who had a firearm.  However, whilst the family members of Rudatinya put up resistance, we heard gunshot.  This gunshot came from the side of Muhinde's residence.  People began to think that it was soldiers who had come to put a stop to these acts of violence.  However, shortly afterwards, we saw the assailants who had attacked Muhinde's residence.  We saw them come back up the hill, and some of them had firearms.  However, at the beginning of the attack launched on Muhinde's residence there was no firearms. 
Q.	And do you know where those people had acquired firearms during the course of the attack on Muhinde's residence? 
A.	There were firearms which had been distributed to the members of the cellule committee and also other people who went on night rounds and, in addition, trades people.  Those who had acceptable behaviour, as such, had been identified and firearms had given -- been given to them, so Musafiri and others went to pick up the firearms from those who had them in their possession.  Amongst those individuals who had received firearms and those who did not want to take part in the killings, well, they had to hand their firearms over.  And the members of the comité de cellule arrived with their firearms and they then helped the killers to perpetrate the acts. 
Q.	Now, during the attack on Rudatinya's residence, did any soldiers on active duty participate?  
A.	No.  The only people who were there were reservists or the other individuals I have mentioned to you who had either left or deserted the army, even if we did not know quite under what circumstances they had ceased to be of active service. 
Q.	So, were the attacks on the morning of the 7th of April in Mukingo ordered by any authorities, as far as you could tell?  
A.	As far as I know, we were all present and we were there on the road when Dusabe and 
	Niyigaba, Michel, arrived and told people to go and kill the Tutsis.  However, I do not know where they got that order from.  I did not see any official giving such an order, and there were no official present, with the exception of the conseiller, Assiel, who -- and I did not hear him give such an order.  Rather, I heard him warn the killers, telling them that they would have problems if they continued to attack people. 
Q.	And what about the weapons that were used in these attacks, were there authorities who had distributed these weapons? 
A.	As I have already explained to you, there was a system in place.  There were those who conducted night patrols.  There were also those who were part of the comité de cellule who received the firearms.  I do not know quite why these firearms had been handed over to them.  I only knew that they were supposed to use those firearms during their night rounds.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, when you testified at the trial earlier, you testified that you had personally killed three people at the property of Samvura.  That's S-A-M-V-U-R-A.  Was that true? 
A.	No, that was not true, because I did not kill anybody.  And even if you were to consult my file, you would note that I have never been accused of any murder whatsoever or any -- of having killed any member of the Samvura family.  However, we gave such a testimony because we had been ordered to do so.  We had been ordered to provide a false testimony against the Accused who are appearing before this 
	Trial Chamber -- or before this Tribunal.  
Q.	And why was it necessary to admit to killing people that you hadn't killed in order to give testimony against someone else?  
A.	That was not the only thing.  We were also supposed to say or claim that we had taken part in meetings.  And even if this was not true and even if this might give rise to a number of issues, we did not have a choice.  We had already spent a long time in prison, and when we were asked to provide such false testimony with a view to being released, we thought that this was a way out that was being offered to us.  If you did not want to collaborate, you could have problems, as did some of my friends.  So, because of all this, we accepted to collaborate, especially in view of the fact that the orders had been given to us by people who were in a position of authority and who were influential.  
Q.	The very first time you testified against Mr. Nzirorera back in 2004, you testified that you personally had killed five people.  The next time you came in 2006, you said you personally killed three people.  Did you have trouble keeping your story straight?  
A.	It was very easy to contradict one's self because everything that we were saying was a tissue of lies, and at a certain moment in time, it was difficult to remember what one had said in the past. 
Q.	Now -- go ahead.  
A.	But you will agree with me that had this been the truth, one would not be able to forget whether one killed three or five people.  But in view of the fact that this was all an invention, then it was only too easy to make a mistake because we had to repeat a text that we had learnt by heart but which had nothing to do with the truth.  
Q.	Now, what was the relationship of Samvura's property to Rudatinya's?  Was it in the same area or different areas?  
A.	Samvura was the son of Rudatinya, and their residences were close to each other. 
Q.	Do you know a place known as Munyemvano's compound?  That's M-U-N-Y-E-M-V-A-N-O.  
A.	Yes, this was close to Busogo parish. 
Q.	Was anyone killed in Munyemvano's compound, to your knowledge? 
A.	I did not go to Munyemvano's compound on the 7th April, but I do know that -- a member of his family called Gateyiteyi, who was killed, and I even know the individuals who killed him.  However, most of the people who lived in the neighbourhood around Munyemvano's residence were killed at the convent and also at the parish.  
Q.	And who did kill Gateyiteyi, which is G-A-T-E-Y-E-T-I (sic)? 
A.	He was killed by somebody called Ndayambaje, and there was also a certain 
	Bikete Nyamumagume (phonetic).  Those are the two individuals who went to get Gateyiteyi, and they said on their return that they had killed him.  They went on to say that they had killed him at Ruziga's house. 
Q.	Now, after the attack at Rudatinya's property, was a person named Ngabire killed?  That's N-G-A-B-I-R-E.  
A.	Yes, Ngabire was killed. 
Q.	In the first trial - or, in the earlier trial in this case in 2006, you testified that Michel Niyigaba told you that he had had a telephone conversation with Joseph Nzirorera that morning and Nzirorera had ordered that the Tutsis be killed, starting with his son, Ngabire.  Was that true? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did Michel Niyigaba have any contact with Joseph Nzirorera on the 7th of April, as far as you know? 
A.	If we take into account the time when we saw Michel Niyigaba on that occasion and the place where the killings came to an end on that day, especially since I followed all these movements through the various attacks, and Niyigaba never left the group of assailants with a view to going to make a telephone call, then of course it is obvious that he was not able to speak to Nzirorera over the telephone.  His entire story was a montage because we wanted to accuse Nzirorera by bringing a false testimony. 
Q.	Why was Ngabire killed?  
A.	Ngabire was called -- killed for the sole reason that he was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Now, during the time that you were making your way up to Busogo parish on the morning of the 7th, did you encounter a Corporal Rachel, R-A-C-H-E-L? 
A.	Yes, I did chance upon him. 
Q.	And did he participate in the attacks?  
A.	Yes, he did take part, because when we met him at Busogo secteur, he turned back in order to take part in the attack, the attack launched at Busogo parish. 
Q.	Now, when you -- well, by the time you reached Busogo parish, can you tell me about how much time had elapsed since Rukara had been killed? 
A.	That was a long time later, because Rukara was killed at approximately 7:00, and we reached the parish at approximately 10:00 or 11:00.  We had gone to Rudatinya's residence beforehand. 
Q.	Now, at the parish, did the two groups which had split up, one going to Rudatinya's and one going to Muhinde's, did they come together?  
A.	Yes, the two groups came together at the parish because we left Rudatinya's residence in order to go to Busogo parish, and we formed a group.  There was a limited number of Tutsis in Muhinde's family who were quickly killed, and the others who were to be found at Muhinde's residence joined us, and we then went to the parish, where a lot of people were gathered. 
Q.	Now, at the parish, who led the attack? 
A.	I don't quite know how to put this.  As I explained to you, the people who were leading the attack were the ones who had been in the army and who had firearms.  Those are the individuals, therefore, who were leading the attack. 
Q.	Did any active-duty soldiers participate in the attack on the Busogo parish?  
A.	This is what I can tell you on the subject:  Corporal Rachel was in military attire.  I do not know quite why he was still at home, and I wondered whether he was still in active service as a soldier or not.  We found other people there in military attire; however, I cannot say whether, yes or no, they were still members of the army.  I did not talk to anybody with a view to gleaning this information, so I cannot say whether, yes or no, they were still soldiers.  Especially during this period, we noted that there were many people who were not soldiers allowed themselves to wear military attire and to carry firearms.  All I can say is that I saw people in military attire.  Corporal Rachel killed a child; I was an eyewitness to that.  But I cannot confirm whether, yes or no, these people were soldiers, but I did see them there.  
Q.	Approximately how many people participated in the attack on the Busogo parish on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	There were many people there.  However, you need to understand that not everybody present took part in the attack.  Otherwise, there were many people there.  And when we left Rudatinya's residence, some individuals who had sought refuge at Busogo parish went to this location.  There were also other individuals who had gone to loot cows and who joined the group.  All the members of the public of Busogo neighbourhood came running in order to see what was going on.  But I should point out that only those individuals who had grenades and rifles took part in this attack.  Otherwise, there were many people present, and it is impossible to count them all.  Some people had come to take part in the attack; others had come to see what was going on.  
Q.	And did members of this militia group that you described, led by Michel Niyigaba, participate in this attack? 
A.	Yes, they did take part in this attack.  As I said earlier, Michel Niyigaba was the one who killed the first person.  He went with his group when they killed Lucien, they killed the members of the Rudatinya family, and then they carried on their killing spree.  
Q.	And did members of the population who were not members of this militia also participate in the attack? 
A.	Yes.  It depended on their state of conscience.  There were those who took part in this attack.  As I said, there were displaced persons who had come from Butaro commune who took part in this attack, others went looting the livestock of the members of the public, others went to loot at the convent, whereas others went to loot the trade centre, and they were able to take such things as mattresses, et cetera.  
Q.	Now, I want to ask you some questions about these displaced persons.  Where -- where had they come from and when had they arrived in Mukingo commune? 
A.	The individuals in question were displaced persons who had fled Butaro commune in view of the fact that Butaro commune had fallen under the control of the Inkotanyi.  I no longer remember the year when they came to this area, but they had been in Busogo for some time, so it was not on the same day that they arrived. 
Q.	And what was the attitude of these displaced persons towards RPF or Tutsis?  Was it any different than that of other members of the population?  
A.	As far as I know, if someone drives you away from your property, you cannot consider that person as a friend.  Furthermore, it was being said that the Inkotanyis were the ones who had killed Habyarimana, which meant that those displaced persons considered the Tutsis as the enemy.  So it was not possible to imagine how someone who had been chased away by the Inkotanyi could be friendly towards the Tutsi. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us the reasons why so many people participated in the attack on Busogo parish?  You've told us that in Byangabo centre it was stated that if you didn't go and participate, they would come back for you.  You've told us that there were people who were angry after the death of Habyarimana.  So what were the reasons why so many people participated in the killing on the morning of the 7th?  
A.	I believe that many people participated in that attack because when they heard gunshots in that area, they started wondering what was happening, and after rushing to the location, they realised that members of the public were attacking and killing Tutsis.  Some of them had come to loot.  For example, certain people stole Rudatinya's and Samvura's livestock, others went to kill Tutsis, while others still started looting their property.  So I think that the reason which prompted many people to take part in that attack was that it was in broad daylight, information had circulated, and members of the public were moving about from place to place to loot.  And that is how come a large number of people found themselves at that location.  People had rushed there to see what was happening.  
Q.	And those who actually participated in the killing, did they do so out of anger, out of fear of being, themselves, targeted, or out of obedience to orders from authorities?  
A.	Based on the situation that was prevailing at that time, you have to realise that many people liked Habyarimana.  They did not like the Inkotanyis.  And so when they learned that President Habyarimana had just been killed, they decided to revenge.  

You should also bear in mind that not everyone was in the same state of mind.  Certain people had decided to loot, while others had decided to kill.  Some of them had decided to kill because they were afraid of being punished if they did not participate.  So there were various categories.  

And when it comes to telling you whether certain people had received orders to kill, I have no idea about that.  To my knowledge, no one said that they had received orders to go and kill.  They simply told us that people had to kill Tutsis because the Tutsis were the ones who had killed Habyarimana.  And the people who said that were simply members of the public, not authorities.  Each person had their own opinion about the Tutsi, the Inkotanyi, and the war raging in the country.  So it depended on each individual.  
Q.	And can you tell us why you personally decided to participate? 
A.	Yes.  I have my reason for taking part in that attack.  If I had been reluctant or if I had refused, I would have been considered as being a supporter of the Inkotanyi.  So I had relatives who were Tutsis and, therefore, I would have had problems.  So if I participated in that attack, it is not because it pleased me to do so.  It was simply because I wanted to protect myself.  It had been said that anyone who did not comply with those instructions would suffer the consequences, and so I decided to participate because I wanted to protect my family.  
Q.	And about how long did the attack last on the Busogo parish?  
A.	I would say about one hour.  And this is because grenades were lobbed through the windows.  There were not many people inside the building.  They had scattered all over the place.  And after that attack, we went away.  Only the people who had decided to loot the property stayed put. 
Q.	And can you -- do you know an estimate of the number of people who were killed in Mukingo commune on the morning -- or during the day of the 7th of April, in total? 
A.	Counsel, that is a difficult question.  I can only give an approximation because at Rudatinya's place there were about 150 people, and at Muhinde's place I believe there were about 20 people.  At Busogo there were about a hundred people.  So the figures I am giving you are only approximations.  And those were not the only locations where people were killed.  Others were killed elsewhere in 
	Mukingo commune.  So I would say the total figure was between 500 and over 1,000 people.  
Q.	Now, did you witness any rapes on the 7th of April?  
A.	I heard about them, but I was not an eyewitness.  At least where I was, no such incident took place.  
Q.	Now, what did you do after the parish was attacked?  
A.	We went back to Byangabo. 
Q.	And at any time during that day, did you drive any of the parish vehicles?  
A.	Upon our arrival in Byangabo, a certain Phocas Nikwigize arrived in the company of Ndayambaje and Théogène Nsengimana.  They told us that they were looking for someone who can assist -- who could assist them to switch on - or, start a vehicle at that parish.  And when we went there, Ndayambaje and Nsengimana spoke to the priests, and they told us that we had to offload a vehicle which was there.  And the vehicle contained onions.  I was asked to offload that vehicle, and that's what I did.  I was with Phocas Nikwigize.  And after that incident, I was given the keys to the vehicle.  I started the car and I left the compound.  I was told that two vehicles had to be taken out rather than just one, so I was asked to go and start the second vehicle.  When the priest realised that we were going to forcibly take away his vehicle, he handed over the key to Ndayambaje, and so we left.  We left with two vehicles.  I was driving the Suzuki Samurai, and I was with Théogène.  Ndayambaje and Phocas were on board the second vehicle. 
Q.	And where did you take those vehicles? 
A.	Théogène Nsengimana and myself left.  He asked me to drive to Mukamira to fetch fuel because he did not have any at home.  However, on our way there, we came across many other young people who were looking for vehicles.  They even tried to snatch the vehicle that I had, but they ended up leaving me with the vehicle because I was in the company of Théogène.  When we arrived Mukamira, we did not find any fuel, and so Théogène told me that there were some Adventist pastors at Kucyapa.  He told me he knew them and that we should go there and ask for fuel.  

When we were about to arrive, we came across a cow on the road being chased by people who told us that there were orders in the compound of a certain Butsitsi and that those people were looking for Butsitsi and he had continued resisting because he was a Tutsi and a karate expert.  

We went to that place and Théogène asked to speak to his elder brother, Ndayambaje.  And when we arrived the place where we were going to look for fuel, we realised that the second group of people who had taken the second vehicle had already passed by there and had taken away a white vehicle.  Théogène asked me to drive to Butsitsi's place so that he should speak to his elder brother, but when we arrived there, we saw Butsitsi's body, which had been set on fire after having been sprayed with fuel.  

We went back towards Byangabo, where I met Dusabe, Bagabo and Michel Niyigaba.  We took those people on board our vehicle and went on our way.  They told us we had to go to Musumba because they had heard that there were Tutsis there.  All the vehicles of the parish, as well as the vehicle belonging to Isaïe had been taken away, and so they transported all the people who were there to Musumba commune in Nkuli cellule.  When we arrived there, it was late, so we retraced our route to Byangabo and decided to go back to Musumba the following morning.  When we went there the following morning, we killed the people who were there, after which we returned.  
Q.	Now, did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli on the 7th at any time during that day? 
A.	I saw him pass by on board the vehicle that he was using, but that vehicle did not stop.  It was in the afternoon. 
Q.	You testified at this trial earlier that during the day of the 7th in Byangabo you had heard Kajelijeli say that the father of the nation had been killed and the Tutsis must be killed as well.  And I'm referring to 8th of June at page 60.  Was that true?  
A.	No.  Once again, that was false testimony that we were giving against people here when we accused them of crimes that they had not committed. 
Q.	You also testified that after Lucien was killed, as you were going towards Samvura's property, Niyigaba told you that he had received orders from Kajelijeli who had a meeting with Nyabusore and Nzirorera.  Is that true? 
A.	No.  That was simply what we had been asked to do.  It was a way of proving that it was the authorities who had ordered the members of the public to start killing on the 7th of April, but this is not the truth.  
Q.	When you testified on the 12th of June at pages 14 and 15 of the transcript, you testified that Kajelijeli gave the order for the Interahamwe to go to Musumba in Nkuli commune and kill the Tutsis there.  Was that true? 
A.	No.  We had been asked to say that there was an authority at the site of an attack in order to show that it was that authority who had incited the members of the public to take part in the attack.  
Q.	You've also testified that General Augustin Bizimungu came upon a roadblock manned by Interahamwe and ordered that four Tutsis be taken by Captain Hasengineza and killed.  Was that true?  
A.	The truth of the matter is that I never met with General Bizimungu, even though in my testimony I claimed that I had met him. 
Q.	Did you ever see General Augustin Bizimungu from the 6th of April 1994 until you went into exile? 
A.	No, I never saw General Bizimungu during that period.  The only person I saw was Bizabarimana.  At that time, General Bizimungu had been promoted to the position of chief of army staff, and the staff headquarters were not located in our area.  
Q.	Now, during the period from the 6th of April until you went into exile, did you see 
	Colonel Ephrem Setako at all?  
A.	No, I did not see Setako. 
Q.	And during the period from the 6th of April until you went into exile, did you see Casimir Bizimungu at all? 
A.	No, I did not see him.  
Q.	Now, I want to direct your attention to the incident at the Ruhengeri court of appeal.  Can you tell us what you know about that incident? 
A.	I know that people were killed at the Ruhengeri court of appeal and that it was the Interahamwes who carried out those killings.  Those Interahamwe had left from our area, while others had come from Ruhengeri, so together they went and killed the people at the Ruhengeri court of appeal.  The victims were people that Sous-préfet Nzanana had settled at the Ruhengeri court of appeal.  There were gendarmes there who were posted to protect those displaced persons.  And since the Interahamwes from our area could not cross the security cordon of the gendarmes, they requested the assistance of the people from Ruhengeri to go and kill those who had taken refuge at the Ruhengeri court of appeal. 
Q.	During the earlier trial -- or during this trial at an earlier time, you testified that members of the CDR from Ruhengeri town arrived in Mukingo in two vehicles, and when they arrived at the Baheza's petrol station, Kajelijeli ordered you to gather some strong Interahamwe to accompany the CDR members to kill the Tutsi at the court of appeal.  Was that true?  
A.	That the people of Ruhengeri came and requested assistance from Interahamwes in our area is correct, but it is not correct to say that Kajelijeli asked us to go and assist the Interahamwe of Ruhengeri.  This was also a montage, because we were trying to prove that Kajelijeli had played a role in the attack against the displaced persons at the Ruhengeri court of appeal.  However, the Interahamwe of Ruhengeri came and spoke with the Interahamwes of our area.  They asked for the assistance of those in our area who were in the -- in possession of firearms, but Kajelijeli did not take any part in that attack.

1530H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	To your knowledge, did any authorities order or encourage the Interahamwe from Ruhengeri to attack the court of appeal? 
A.	I have no idea because I was not in Ruhengeri.  Maybe the Interahamwes of Ruhengeri are in a better position to answer that question; but personally, I'm not aware that they received orders from any authorities.  Amongst the Interahamwes from our area who went to assist in that operation, some were arrested and detained at the gendarmerie, but I do not know who issued the order to go and attack the displaced persons in -- or, rather, at the court of appeal.  
Q.	One of those who were arrested has a pseudonym of GBU claims that Mr. Karemera called and arranged for him to be released.  Do you know anything about that? 
A.	I know absolutely nothing about that.  I heard it said that amongst the assailants there were some who were arrested; however, I do not know under which circumstances they came to be released.  The person who claimed this has his or her sources.  However, I do know that some of the testimony provided by co-detainees were montages in view of the fact that we had divided a number of roles amongst ourselves and each of us had a text to repeat.  Now, the fact that Nzirorera might have been called -- well, that's the first time I've heard this piece of information.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take the mid-afternoon recess at this time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think it's a good time.  We will take the mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1533H to 1601H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, I want to now turn to an event that you testified about in which the population of Mukingo was assembled at the Gisesero football pitch for the introduction of the swearing of the new préfet.  

Let me start all over, I don't think the place was correctly understood.  So I want to ask you about an event at Gisesero -- that's G-I-S-E-S-E-R-O -- football pitch where you testified that about two weeks after the death of Habyarimana, the new préfet, Basile, was introduced to the population.  Was that true? 
A.	No, that was not true either.  
Q.	You testified that on that occasion, Nzirorera and Casimir Bizimungu, Minister Bicamumpaka and General Augustin Bizimungu had attended this event along with the Interahamwe, and that Nzirorera had said that the population should seek out and kill all the RPF accomplices -- and that they should collaborate with the MDR because the MDR were no longer enemies, and that the other authorities had also spoke.  And then after the meeting, the authorities went to a reception; then went to 
Nzirorera's mother's house where Nzirorera gave the Interahamwe 100,000 Rwandan francs, and asked them to continue to maintain security so the RPF did not infiltrate.  And this testimony was given on the 12th of June and the 16th of June.  Was any of that true? 
A.	No, that was not true.  That testimony was given as part of the montage designed to give false testimony against accused people in this Tribunal.  This would be done by talking about meetings that they convened or chaired, and money that they are supposed to have distributed.  But in reality, no such meetings were organised, and the people mentioned did not participate in the meetings which, of course, did not take place at all.  
Q.	Did you ever see Minister Jérôme Bicamumpaka between the 6th of April 1994 and the time you went into exile? 
A.	No, I never saw him.  
Q.	Now I want to ask you about the incident in which Noël Ndayisaba was killed.  It is said that he was killed by a soldier after the Interahamwe had stopped a bus at Byangabo and assaulted some women on that bus.  Do you know anything about that incident? 
A.	I was not present during that night.  All I can tell you is that I was not there the night when the incident took place, but I heard that a bus arrived -- Byangabo, and that there were displaced persons on board that vehicle.  I do not know where that bus had come from, but people, including Ndayisaba, removed a girl from this bus and took her to where they were living.  But later on, Kajelijeli's driver who was called Avith Muhunde arrived at the location.  He witnessed -- he witnessed the incident and then told a certain Gatsimbanyi about it.  And that person is also supposed to have referred to -- the matter to soldiers at the Mukamira camp.  And a soldier named Mburuburengero came and asked Noël to free the girl that he had taken to his house.  When Noël refused, the soldier shot him and killed him.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, was a group known as Amahindure created in Mukingo and Nkuli communes after the death of President Habyarimana, to your knowledge? 
A.	I'm not aware of any group that is supposed to have been created after the death of 
President Habyarimana -- whether it was Amahindure or another group.  After the death of 
President Habyarimana, the war continued.  People were being killed and one could see refugees coming from Kigali.  Kigali fell and then the fighting spread to areas close to our locality and we fled.  
Q.	Was there any military training of civilians after the death of President Habyarimana in your area? 
A.	I'm not aware of any such training.  I do not recall that there was any such training.  
Q.	Did you attend the ceremony at which Juvénal Kajelijeli was sworn in as bourgmestre for the second time in 1994? 
A.	No, I was not present at that ceremony.  I simply learned that Kajelijeli had been appointed bourgmestre after the death of Habyarimana, but I was not present at his swearing in.  
Q.	Now did you see Joseph Nzirorera after the death of President Habyarimana and before you went into exile? 
A.	No, I did not see Nzirorera during that period.  
Q.	Now earlier in this trial you testified that Nzirorera was the one who had created the Interahamwe and Amahindure in Mukingo.  He gave them uniforms, money, instructions and orders.  And that these Interahamwe were known as "Nzirorera's children"; that they acted under Nzirorera's orders and he is responsible for everything that happened in Mukingo commune.  That was on the 12th of June at 
page 33; is that true? 
A.	What I said is not true; there were never any Interahamwe in our region.  We heard about groups of Interahamwe in other regions that had been officially set up and they had membership cards.  I never witnessed Nzirorera talking about setting up a branch of the Interahamwes.  So everything I told this Trial Chamber was done for a specific reason -- as I have been explaining so far.  

But, to my knowledge, the Interahamwe never existed in our region and it is not him who set up the Amahindure -- at least, I never saw him doing any such thing.  I decided to come and give you the true version of the facts, because in my previous testimony, I did not tell the truth.  I never saw Nzirorera giving money to anyone or distributing uniforms; everything that I said were lies.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I just wanted to draw your attention to the promise you made earlier about providing spelling lists during the break.  And we now have some new reporters here and I wanted to know whether you were going to continue that practice or whether I should request the spelling when the occasion, you know, presents itself.  Would it be easier for you to do it as you promised earlier?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, and we did keep that promise during the last break, so any reporter that wishes to obtain any spellings can obtain them from our team at the next break; I think that would be more expeditious. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, also during the last time you were here and you gave testimony, you said that when you and I had met in the room next to the courtroom that I had offered to give you money if you would testify favourably to Mr. Nzirorera.  Was that true? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, we finished the first part of your testimony in which I'd asked you to recount the events as they really happened.  Now we're going to begin the second part of your testimony, which is all about how you came to give false testimony in the first place.  So I want to ask you about the chain of events that led you to this Tribunal in the first place.  Can you tell us again in which year you were arrested after your return from exile? 
A.	I was arrested on the 1st of April 1995.  
Q.	And when did you arrive in Ruhengeri prison? 
A.	It was on the 20th of April 1995.  
Q.	Now, we have seen a number of statements that you gave after you were first arrested in which you denied your involvement in these crimes.  Now what was it that made you change and start to accuse people who were in Arusha? 
A.	It started after our arrest.  The Rwandan judicial authorities started looking for potential witnesses.  I was contacted as part of this exercise, and this was because I was from the same region and I had been involved in some of the incidents.  

I was asked to accuse some former authorities who hailed from that region, and I was told that this would have a positive impact on the assessment of my confession.  We were told that if we did not accuse the former authorities, our testimony would not be taken into account -- and even our confession would not be taken into consideration.  

So all the candidates for the confession and guilty plea procedure who accepted to comply with those directives would have their confessions accepted.  And those who were prepared to cooperate with the Rwandan justice authorities would receive certain advantages that I will explain to you later.  

Even during the period of our detention, those who cooperated were allowed not to wear prison uniforms and they would benefit from certain advantages.  We were told that if we accepted to testify against certain accused persons in the Tribunal, we could even possibly be released.  And for someone like myself who had just spent quite some time in detention, and given the way the Rwandan justice system functions, and considering that they do not respect judicial principles, I decided to cooperate and to do what was being asked of me so as to stand a chance of being eventually released.  
Q.	Can you tell us: who was the very first person who approached you with the idea of cooperating against people in Arusha? 
A.	The message was conveyed through the staff of the prosecutor's office who managed the files of detainees from the various regions.  I no longer remember the name of the staff member of the public prosecutor's office who approached me for the first time, but these were the people who gave us a list of people against whom we had to give false testimony.  And when we finished providing false testimony, then our confessions would be accepted.  
Secondly, there was a group of detainees who had been trained to draft the confessions of the other detainees.  It was those prisoners who explained to their co-detainees how to prepare their false testimonies, and that would be done in order for the confessions of those detainees to be accepted.  
The third aspect concerned detained persons who had already appeared before this Tribunal.  They came and explained to the other detainees how testimonies are given before this Tribunal -- and this was done in order for the others to familiarise themselves with the procedures in advance.  They informed the other detainees about the points that they had covered in their testimonies so that those listening to them could do the same thing.  

And then you had the administration of the prison.  The director of the prison summoned me and sensitised me regarding the way in which I was to provide a version of the events that he wanted me to give.  And since it was the director of the prison who had to sign all documents intended for the prosecutor's office -- that is, all documents concerning confessions, we were compelled to comply with his instructions.  

In the prison itself a system was set up whereby prisoners who were unwilling to cooperate were maltreated.  For example, those prisoners who were not willing to cooperate were prevented from going out and working outside.  In the prison in which I was, when you decided to resort to the confession and guilty plea procedure, you were transferred to a -- new premises, which had been constructed for people of that category.  And if there were any new advantages intended for the prisoners, it is those prisoners who had made confessions that benefited first.  But those who had refused to cooperate were maltreated and they were even prevented from going out of the prison premises.  

There was clear discrimination against the detainees who did not wish to resort to the confession and guilty plea procedure, and sometimes they were even prevented from receiving any visits.  Whenever a prison warden had to deal -- or maltreated a detainee who had confessed, he could even be disciplined.  But if he maltreated someone who had not confessed, then he was not subjected to any punishment.  
Q.	Now, I want to take you back to the very first meeting you had with a staff member of the prosecutor's office from Ruhengeri.  How long had you been in detention, approximately, when you had that first meeting? 
A.	If you are referring to members of the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Tribunal, when I met them for the first time I had just spent a certain period of time at the Ruhengeri prison.  
Q.	Actually, I'm referring to the Ruhengeri prosecutor:  The staff member of the Ruhengeri prosecutor, who first conveyed to you the message that you should accuse authorities from your region, how long had you been in detention before that message was delivered to you by that staff member? 
A.	I had been in Ruhengeri prison for a long time.  I had spent about six years in that prison.  
Q.	And, when you met with this prosecution staff officer, was it at the parquet or at the prison? 
A.	I met him at the parquet.  A warrant for transfer is issued to the prison officer, and the detainee is allowed to be transferred to the prosecutor's office as if he was going there for questioning.  
Q.	And just focusing on that meeting you had with the staff member of the prosecutor's office can you tell us, in general, what he said to you at that meeting? 
A.	He had me called and I went to his office; he told me the reason why I -- I had been summoned.  He said he had gone through my file and he had realised that I did not have many charges against me; however, he added that it would be difficult to release me and that he was advising me to make a confession.  

He explained the confession procedure to me and elaborated on that confession and guilty plea procedure.  He added that my confession would not be automatically accepted if I did not accuse the people who had incited us to kill, or who had given us orders to kill, and that in that case I would be the only person responsible.  

He told me that he was fully aware that it was the former authorities who had ordered us to do what we did.  And that if I was prepared to accuse some of the former authorities, who hailed from my region, then the examination of my confession would be accelerated and my trial could take place very soon, and I would possibly be released.  

So he told me that if I was prepared to accuse those former authorities, they would come to my assistance and I would be able to benefit from the advantages given to the other detainees who had pleaded guilty.  

He presented a list of the former authorities and asked me questions on each of the names on the list.  He would ask me whether I knew the person; whether I knew his former address; and then he asked me to think about it and decide whether I would be able to accuse these people, given that he had learned that it was those people who were at the origin of the crimes that had been committed.  

He said that I could even contact the other detainees who had appeared before this Tribunal, so that they could tell me about the procedure that is normally followed here.  He allowed me to leave and return to the prison and told me that he would contact me later on.  
Q.	And can you tell us which names were on his list? 
A.	It was a long list of people.  I did not know everybody on that list; however, the name of Nzirorera was on the list.  The name of Ntirivamunda -- Alphonse Ntirivamunda; Michel Bakizakundi; 
Augustin Bizimungu; Augustin -- Casimir; Setako; Gatsimbanyi; Kajelijeli; Jean Damascene Niyoyita; Assiel Ndisetse; Bivugabagabo -- Colonel Bivugabagabo; Boniface Hasengineza; 
Basile Nsabumugisha; Donat Murego; Bicamumpaka; Jean Damascene Munyarukiko and many others, because on this list there were even the names of individuals whom I did not know.  
Q.	Okay.  Now after this meeting when you went back to the prison, did you talk to other detainees about this idea of accusing the authorities? 
A.	I had been told that one might talk to witnesses who had come here to Arusha, so I approached a certain Habiyambere who explained everything to me.  *************************************************** *****************************************************************************.  They explained everything to me; they said how they had come to testify before this Trial Chamber and how they had been able to testify elsewhere.  Thereafter, I did not do anything else, and a few days later the director of our prison called me to his office.  

I presented myself before him and he told me that I had not acted in the correct manner.  He told me that I was one of the people who were taking it out on the detainees, and that had resorted to the confession and guilty plea procedure within Ruhengeri prison.  And that an investigation was underway and that if ever I was found guilty I would be transferred to another prison.  

However, this was not true.  He quite simply wanted to draw my attention to the fact that I should accept the proposal being made to me; however, it was the authorities of the prison who had set up groups who were taking it out on prisoners, those who had refused to confess.  

Two groups had been set up amongst the detainees.  One of the groups comprised those people who had confessed; and the other group comprised those individuals who had not yet confessed.  As a result, he once again summoned me and he told me that my situation was a serious one, and that I should resort to the confession and guilty plea procedure with a view to being transferred to the group of individuals who had done so.  The problem went right to the top:  To the attorney-general.  And, a few days later I was once again summoned and I was told that -- I was requested to explain myself before the attorney-general with reference to the allegations saying that I was persecuting other prisoners who had refused to confess.  

Now in view of the fact that I was aware that the situation in other prisons was worse than that prevailing in Ruhengeri prison, I decided to accept the offer, and I said that I would talk to the other detainees who had accepted to come and testify before this very Tribunal before doing so myself.  

A few days later, after having listened to what people like Michel Niyigaba, Abdul Karim Gato, and  Ezekiel Bazimenyera -- and Habiyambere, I decided to reincorporate the group that had been set up to compile the confessions of the prisoners.  
(Pages 47 to 53 by Jean Baigent)





1645H 
THE WITNESS: (continued)
And my confession was then taken down.  However, I told them that they should not make a comparison between -- or, a connection between my confession and the testimony I would provide before the Tribunal.  This is because when one decides to go and testify, one must say what happened and one must claim that one was present.  So I said that one needed to make a distinction between the confession I was to make and the testimony I was to make before the Tribunal.  

I believe that when testifying before this Tribunal, I said that I was the one to draft my confession; however, it was somebody else by the name of Alphonse Baginaki who drafted my confession.  He was a detainee who had resorted to the confession and guilty plea procedure himself and he was part of the group of detainees who was helping other detainees to draft their confessions.  He was somebody who knew the legal field all too well.  I told him everything as to the others and he said what he knew about the detainees here.  He then went on to write down my confession.  I appended my signature to the document and it was transmitted to the director.  The director of the prisons signed it.  He thanked me.  He was very glad about it, and he said that I could apply to be appointed the chief or head detainee within the prison.  This was done.  

And a few days after the drafting and transmittal of this confession document, I saw the investigators from the Tribunal approach me.  I was not the one who entered into contact with them.  I just saw them arrive and they asked me questions about the detainees here.  And basing myself on the statements of other witnesses who had come to testify here, because, of course, we were supposed to corroborate the evidence given by other witnesses, but we were supposed to say or to not say that this was the information we had been given to report.  We were supposed to say that we had been an eyewitness to the events.  So whilst we were still in the prison other detainees who came from Gitarama and Kigali arrived in Ruhengeri.  I believe that group of individuals comprised approximately 30 detainees.  They were not dressed as prisoners.  They were wearing classic attire and they were introduced to us.  We were told that they were detainees who had resorted to making a confession and who had been provisionally released because they did not spend their nights in prison.  They had come with a view to sensitising the detainees within Ruhengeri prison and also to help them to draft their confessions.  They told them how they should go about it and how to go about their confession in order for it to be accepted.  

During that period a group of 10 individuals was set up who no longer were required to wear the detainee uniform and their role was to sensitise others.  We were released and a solidarity camp was organised for us.  We were asked to draft our confessions and also to add other individuals we might have forgotten.  We then took down our confessions and consulted them in order to make sure that nothing had been forgotten.  And if one realised that something had been forgotten, one needed to point it out.  

When we were in the solidarity camp we needed to do what was requested of us because if we refused to do so, we were knocked about and transferred to prison and classified in the first category and we could no longer appear before a Gacaca court.  

Now, in view of the difficult situation prevailing at the time, we accepted to collaborate and those who refused to do so were transferred to prison where they then underwent further mistreatment.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you, Witness BTH.  Now, I am going to ask that the registrar show you a piece of paper that has three names on it.  We are going to discuss your conversations with each of these people.
MR. ROBINSON:
And if this can first be passed to the Judges, shown to the parties and then to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could I inquire about how much more time do you anticipate?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think I will finish some time on Monday.  And for the benefit of the witness, we don't have court tomorrow, so after we recess at 5:30, we will resume on Monday morning.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, I am going to -- I put a piece of paper in front of you so as to avoid giving the identities of people who have testified here at the Tribunal who may be protected witnesses.  

Now, with respect to the numbers 1, 2 and 3 on that piece of paper, did you talk to each of those individuals after your initial meeting with the staff member of the prosecutor's office of Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes, I did talk to all the individuals whose names appear on this list.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. President, I would ask that this list be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ450, and maintained under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ450 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, with respect to the person listed at number 1, did he tell you that he had testified in a trial here in Arusha? 
A.	Number 1 on the list told me that he had testified before the ICTR in a trial before this very tribunal, and if my memory serves me correctly, I believe that his pseudonym was JBB.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Message from the English interpreter.  Could that pseudonym be please repeated?  It is very unclear.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Could you repeat that pseudonym again? 
A.	He was called JDD, for Dennis.  
Q.	That's GDD, I believe.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Can the interpreter confirm that it is "G" as in George? 
THE WITNESS:
I know that he was used to being called -- I don't know whether it is G for George or -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is very unclear, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, the first letter of that pseudonym, is it "G", which is the sixth letter of the alpha -- the 
	seventh letter of the alphabet, or is it "J"? 
A.	I believe that it is "G".  I did not really pay much attention to that, but it might be a G.  
Q.	Okay, thank you.  And in which trial did he testify?  Who was the Accused here in Arusha? 
A.	Kajelijeli.  
Q.	And according to him, did he tell the truth about Kajelijeli or did he lie? 
A.	Part of his testimony was false.  
Q.	And did he tell you what part was false? 
A.	I no longer recall which part of his testimony did not correspond to the truth.  However, he told me that with a view to being more credible, one could take on a certain degree of responsibility in a given crime even if one hadn't done anything and one could do this even more easily in view of the fact that one was not running the risk of being prosecuted in Rwanda.  

And I will go on to specify that there are other individuals whose names do not appear on this list with whom we created a montage of testimony.  Were I to take the example of my testimony against Setako, this was based on information that this witness had given me.  I am referring here to number 1 on the list.  And the officer of the public prosecutor's office who came to request that I testify against Setako, asked me to talk to the individual whose name corresponds to number 1 on this list.  
Q.	Now, Witness GDD in the Kajelijeli trial testified that he had attended a meeting on the evening of the 6th April 1994, at the canteen next to the Nkuli commune office, and that at that meeting Kajelijeli had been present and had directed them to kill the Tutsis and that he had provided weapons the next day for that purpose.  Do you know whether that part of his testimony was true or false? 
A.	I did not attend that meeting.  Even if the witness in question was present -- if he was present at that meeting of the 6th of April in which the killings of the 7th of April were planned, this would mean that Kajelijeli who is supposed to have organised that meeting in the evening of the 6th knew that the plane would be shot down, or perhaps he even shot down the plane himself.  Everyone knows that the killings started after the presidential plane had been shot down.  However, Kajelijeli owned a house in the Nkuli area and the witness himself hailed from that area.  And based on the information you have just given me, I believe his testimony was false because Kajelijeli could not have convened a meeting to organise killings even before Habyarimana died, since it is the death of the Habyarimana which triggered off the killings.  
Q.	And did Witness GDD ever tell you, one way or the other, or admit to you whether or not he had lied about the involvement of Kajelijeli? 
A.	He told me that one could assume a certain degree of responsibility for events in which one was not involved simply in order to give some weight to the testimony.  So I think that whatever he said was false because he was simply given information on what to say before the Tribunal.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, for the information of the Trial Chamber, the testimony of Witness GDD in Kajelijeli was the subject of factual findings that have been taken judicial notice of by this Trial Chamber as adjudicated facts numbers 41 through 46.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, turning to the second name on the list, do you know the pseudonym that that person used at this Tribunal? 
A.	GBU.  
Q.	And who did he testify against here in Arusha? 
A.	Kajelijeli and Nzirorera.  I do not know whether he testified against Augustin Bizimungu or not, but I know that he provided information in that case.  
Q.	And during your discussions with Witness GBU, did he indicate he was testifying truthfully in Arusha or testifying falsely? 
A.	Even if he did not tell me that, his testimony was false because I had occasion to see him under other circumstances.  We were co-accused and I know the charges against him.  We had the opportunity to meet and agree on what each person was going to say before the Court and I know that there were many lies included in what we had to say.  
Q.	So before coming to give your testimony in this trial, did you and Witness GBU get together and try to fabricate evidence against Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, Witness GBU is one of the people with whom I discussed prior to coming to Arusha to testify.  
Q.	Now, Witness GBU has testified to many of the same things that you did in this trial and has said that he was present when there were meetings at Mr. Nzirorera's house; that Mr. Nzirorera ordered killings and taking down of the flags of other parties and gave money to the Interahamwe, as well as the 
	Isimbi building, firearms, uniforms.  Was any of that true? 
A.	None of that is true.  I know very well that those alleged meetings never took place.  We were told how to structure our testimonies and we were told to dwell on the meetings and acts of violence which took place in order to prove that those authorities had prepared the killings and that they had provided substantial assistance to the Interahamwes.  
Q.	Now, turning to number 3 on that list, do you know the pseudonym that witness had? 
A.	I no longer remember his pseudonym even though he told me about it once.  Nevertheless, I know that he testified before this Tribunal.  
Q.	And do you know against whom he testified in this tribunal? 
A.	He testified for the Prosecution against Kajelijeli, as well as against Nzirorera.  
Q.	And do you know whether he actually came to Arusha and gave testimony against Nzirorera, or whether he had accused Nzirorera in his statements? 
A.	I know that the first time he came with the other two people whose names are on this list and on that occasion they came to testify against Kajelijeli.  However, I am not sure whether he came here to testify for the Prosecution against Nzirorera.  All I know is that he gave us certain points on which we were supposed to dwell during our testimonies against Nzirorera and Bizimungu.  
Q.	And were those points true or were they false? 
A.	They were lies.  For example, he told us to say that we had been given weapons in Ruhehe and that is not true.  He was also the one who talked about the Amahindure, and I have already told you that what was said about the Amahindure is not true.  The other witness talked about it because that is what had been agreed upon, but it was not the truth. 
(Pages 54 to 58 by Sithembiso Moyo)

















1715H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And when he wanted to accuse -- wanted others to accuse Bizimungu, was that General Bizimungu or Casimir Bizimungu or both?
A.	It was General Augustin Bizimungu. 
Q.	Now, in addition to these three people -- well, before you met the director for the first time about being accused of mistreating detainees, were there any other people you had talked to who had testified in Arusha besides these three? 
A.	No, I had not yet talked to other witnesses.  There is another witness who had appeared before this Tribunal, but I was not able to speak with him because he exhibited some violent conduct.  However, I was able to speak with Michel Niyigaba, because he had been contacted several times and he had given testimony that he later on retracted having realised that that testimony could be used against him.
Q.	Okay.  Now, let's go step by step.  I want to ask you about the first time the director of the prison talked to you after you had been given this proposition by the staff member of the Prosecutor's office and had consulted with these three detainees.  The first thing I would like to ask you is the name of the director at that time.
A.	Richard Rugumwa.
Q.	Now, can you tell us exactly to the best of your recollection, when he called you into his office the first time -- and I'm only talking now about this first time -- tell us what he said to you.
A.	He summoned me to his office for the first time in 2002, and this was probably at the beginning of that year.  He told me that I was accused of persecuting prisoners who had resorted to the confession and guilty plea procedure and that I was preventing the other detainees from resorting to that procedure.  He told me that if I continued refusing to resort to that procedure as advised, I should at least allow the others to do so.  He told me that he had received -- or, rather, that if he received any further reports concerning my behavior, then I could be transferred to another prison.  However, the truth of the matter is that he wanted to frighten me in order to -- for me to begin reflecting seriously on the proposal that had been made to me.  He allowed me to leave, but at the same time he told me that he would carry out investigations and get back to me in due course.
Q.	And had you, in fact, done anything to persecute prisoners who had resorted to the confession procedure? 
A.	No, I had not done anything.  I had not attacked anyone.  I had not intimidated anyone.  I never relieved anyone of their duties because at that time I was responsible for security inside the prison.  A few days later the prosecutor general came and told me that my problem had been referred to him.  However, I'm sure he had the same information as the director because he was the one coordinating the information to recruit potential witnesses.  He told me that he had been informed about my problem, and it was about that same time that some prisoners were transferred with the excuse that they were undermining the confession and guilty plea procedures.  But those who transferred were prisoners who had been occupying positions of responsibility within the prison.  When I was told about the possible transfer, I was compelled to think twice about it because everyone was afraid of being transferred to a different prison.  When he told me that he was going to carry out his own investigations, that was not true.  It was simply a way of putting pressure on me.
Q.	And what was the name of the prosecutor general who you spoke with? 
A.	I cannot tell you his name because that person is currently employed in this Tribunal.  You will, therefore, understand that I was correct when at the beginning of my testimony I talked about problems of personal security.
Q.	And in what section of this Tribunal is that person employed? 
A.	I do not know.  All I know is that he worked in this Tribunal and that he is a member of the team in the case the Prosecutor versus Setako.  I also know that he is one of the people who went to carry out investigations and look for my case file in Rwanda when it was announced over the radio that there was a witness who had retracted his testimony and was in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  Even last Friday he came to the safe house where I was and asked me to assist another witness in that safe house who had come to testify in the case Prosecutor versus Bizimungu.  It is for that reason that I have told you that my problem is a very complex problem and I am even in danger of losing my life.  However, I do not have any alternative and I hope that the Tribunal would be able to do its possible best to guarantee my security.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  I don't have the Livenote.  Could we have the witness repeat the last answer?  Or could I hear the question and answer again because I'm confused about the answer?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That was about a five-minute question and answer.  I think maybe I can summarise it for you if you would like. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't need the whole response.  I would like to know about the last incident about the safe house.  I'm not sure what the witness said.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, you've told us that the person who was the prosecutor general who approached you in Ruhengeri prison came to the safe house.  Can you explain that again? 
A.	What I said was that in June 2006, when I came to testify in this Tribunal, that person came and saw me in the safe house and told me that I had to assist another witness who was there with me in the 
safe house regarding the testimony of that other witness before the Court.  He told me that I had to explain to that other witness the procedure that is followed in this Tribunal.
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness BTH.  Now, obviously this is a matter of great importance, especially when the integrity of the proceedings here at the Tribunal are at issue, and I'm sure the Presiding Judge will not release you until he's assured that your security is going to be ensured.  But I'm going to ask you to be given a piece of paper by the registry, a blank piece of paper, and ask you to write down the name of this person, and it won't be broadcast but it will be -- it needs to be known by the Tribunal. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And if that could be circulated.  And then I would ask -- first to the Judges and then to the parties, and I would ask that it be admitted under seal as D. NZ451.  And perhaps, Mr. President, this would be a good time to recess? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think so too. 

The document is admitted under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ451 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are going to adjourn now for the day, but, in fact, it is actually our adjournment for the weekend and your trial will -- the trial will resume on Monday when your testimony will continue.  I remind you that during this or any other adjournment you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anyone.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Before the Court rises, could we discuss the matter of scheduling for next week?  Can we make a brief enquiry -- the witness could be excused.  I would like to see the exhibit first, though.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the -- we have not as yet received an official report from WVSS, but as I had indicated, a representative of the Chamber's team participated in the discussions, and the fact, as unpalatable as it may be, is that WVSS will not be able to provide witnesses for the Karemera Defence case during the course of next week.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Still as a matter of prioritising for us, Your Honour -- so even if the witnesses are not coming -- if we could have some information, however tentative, of the order of appearance of the witnesses, that would help us.  Because we have three days ahead of us and we would like to start to prepare adequately for our cross-examinations.  As I speak to you I still don't know what witness of the 14 that have been identified is coming first and we would like to know that today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, I would not have thought it would have been necessary for the Chamber to make an order for you to comply with that request.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President, but yesterday I filed a motion for reconsideration of your decision of the 2nd of April. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but what is the connection between the two?  You don't intend to call any witnesses in this matter and if you do why can't you give the order?  You at least have agreed on a timetable with WVSS.  The Chamber has not approved that as yet, but you have an agreed timetable.  Why can't that be disclosed to the Prosecutor?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
This has already been done with regard to WVSS.  And, in any case, there is no problem with disclosing this to the Prosecutor.  But for reasons of methodology, I did not want to perform my obligations in a sequence.  Having filed that motion for the review of your decision yesterday, I thought that the sequence of appearances could wait.  But for administrative purposes, I can disclose the order of appearance to the Prosecutor, especially since I have already said that with regard to WVSS that has already been done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My understanding is that the motion for reconsideration concerned disclosure of identifying information for the remaining 54 witnesses, not the order of appearance.  And with respect to the order of appearance, that's something that needs to be filed with the Chamber, so can we hear that now on the record, please?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I refuse to comply with the requirements of the Prosecutor.  You asked me to disclose and I accepted to do so today.  And I will not force -- follow his procedure.  I have never seen the Prosecutor disclose a sequence of appearance in Court.  For the record, this sort of disclosure has never taken place when it came to the list of appearance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, is it necessary to pursue this?  We accept the undertaking from counsel and the matter will be dealt with today. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The problem for us, Your Honour, is we have heard undertakings from counsel before and they have not been forthcoming.  The Prosecution filed this information in advance.  That is why it was never discussed in open court.  We would like to go into a weekend knowing what is ahead of us for the week ahead.  So if Ms. Diagne cannot do it now, can the Court ensure that it is done before tomorrow morning, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, as far as the Court is concerned, an undertaking from the bar table has exactly the same force as an order.  And we have heard an undertaking from the bar table and we accept it as such. 

We will rise now. 
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
