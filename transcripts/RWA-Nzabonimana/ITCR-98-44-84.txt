Prosecution Exhibit P. No. 17..	6


P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is opened.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Yesterday we adjourned at the end of the morning.  I believe there was a problem of interpretation insofar as I had said that we were going to resume later because we were going to be deliberating with your motions, but it would seem that it was said that the session stood adjourned sine die.  We had wanted to resume the session yesterday but we were unable to do so, because the parties had understood that the session stood adjourned sine die.  We therefore sent a message this morning and we are happy to have with us the Accused in the courtroom.  

The Judges were placed before a written motion by the Accused Karemera, and the Judges considered Rule 15 of the Rules, and have decided that there is no need for disqualification of the Judges from this trial.  It is, at this very moment, up to the bureau of the Tribunal to speak with regard to the disqualification motion which has been filed.  

Consequently, we are going to request the Prosecutor, as of now, if his witness is ready so that we may proceed with our trial -- with the session.  I must inform you that since December last year, we have been unable to go into the merits of this trial because of procedural matters, and we would indeed appreciate the possibility of being able to proceed this morning.  

Mr. Prosecutor, over to you.
MR. WEBSTER:
	Thank you, Your Honour.  Yes, sir, the Prosecution is ready to proceed.  We have a witness in the waiting room and who can be called, and this is a protected witness, this is GFA. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Mr. Roach, you have something to say? 
MR. ROACH:
Madam President and to the Court, my client is here today and he has been told about the Court's response to his letter, and in particular, that it bordered on or was contemptuous, and also he is concerned about not so much purging himself of any contempt, but just giving an explanation and an assurance to the Court, and he has asked me to request of the Court an opportunity to allow him to address the tone and the allegation of contempt and his intentions of not having to be or not being in contempt in his opinion and exactly, in his words, he should like to do so and he requests of you an opportunity to make a brief statement with respect to his cooperation. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am going to object now.  The Accused is represented by counsel.  We are here to conduct a trial on the substance.  We have been waiting for this moment for almost two months now.  I suggest that we proceed.  The Court has examined his letter.  If it was worthy of a response, I assume it would have gotten one or the letter would have generated a response.  The witness is waiting outside; he has been waiting for several days.  This is the same witness that was here in mid-January.  So this witness has been waiting for at least two months to testify.  Can we proceed with this trial? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
It is not unusual, and actually, it is traditional in national courts, where there is certain kind of conduct, on the part of the persons before the Court, that has been characterised as either an outrage such as the Prosecutor described the letter, I believe, and the absence from the courtroom, it is not unusual in those circumstances, in national jurisdictions, that an accused person or a party before the Court addresses his intentions to the Court.  And although it is done in cases where there is contempt found, I don't know that you have found any contempt, and this is not an attempt to purge a contempt but it is something very close to that or akin to that, and we, for that reason, would say that this request should be allowed.  And it is admitted that the witness is ready to testimony and he has been here for a long time, but we are talking about a few moments' delay. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would indeed wish to listen to your client, Counsel.  But we deem it fit that he was going to -- that he is going to speak on behalf of everyone because we are not going to give the floor to everyone else.  And if he does so, he can take the floor for no more than five minutes, please. 
THE ACCUSED NGIRUMPATSE:
Madam President, Your Honours, please be reassured that I shall respond to your appeal concerning the brevity of my intervention.  I also wish to reassure you, Your Honours, that I am taking the floor on behalf of my colleagues.  I do seize this opportunity to thank you for having given us the floor, and I also wish to thank you for your understanding.  

Indeed, I am taking the floor presently in order to bring clarification to certain points and also maybe to raise certain issues which have been misunderstood.  I wish to assure you, Madam President, Your Honours, that our absence was not intended to obstruct the proceedings.  We did not wish to provoke a disturbance of the proceedings, and there have been differences, incidents in the proceedings which have taken place during the trial and for which we are not responsible.  The stability and control of the proceedings do not fall upon us.  
The other issue which I wish to clarify, Madam President, is that it has never been our intent to have contempt of this Tribunal.  In the course of a fair and just trial, it seemed to us necessary to address ourselves to the Judges responsible for our trial.  They are the only persons to whom we are able to address our complaints.  We maybe used a style which was sincere, but it was indeed sincerity which guided us in the drafting of our letter and the various motions that we filed before yourselves.  

I do believe, Madam President, Your Honours, that we may indeed come before you as and when necessary.  Yesterday, you reassured the various counsels representing us that you will ensure equality of arms, and this is a decision which we welcome and appreciate.  We hope, and we are indeed convinced, that the same will apply to the various motions that we have filed regarding disclosure of various documents, and especially with regard to the disclosure of the witness statements at appropriate moments.  I am not going to go through the whole list of issues which are of importance to us and which are still pending.  As we have assured you, we have no intent to delay the proceedings.  Our presence today here is an evident sign of this, despite the pending motions before your Bench.  

I wish to reassure you, Your Honours, that we shall be walking step by step with the truth.  If we were to say that we are going to be sincere in addressing yourselves, you are the Judges before our trial and it is normal.  It is indeed appropriate that we address yourselves and for you to be able to find answers to the questions which are of concern to us.  I thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have taken due note of the statement made by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  As we have already stated, we shall continue to ensure that there is equality of arms and fairness in this trial.  Please be reassured of that.  

Mr. Robinson, I am addressing myself to you.  Kindly ensure that we are going to start now.  I believe Mr. Roach and Mr. Ngirumpatse have indeed spoken on behalf all the Accused and for the Defence, and you are not going to go back on this matter. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct, Madam President, I am not going back on this matter. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Therefore, very briefly, please tell us what is your preoccupation, very briefly, because we must indeed proceed.
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand, Madam President.  Very briefly, I wish to notify the Trial  Chamber that we filed a written motion for disqualification this morning with the Presiding Judge of Trial Chamber III, and we make a motion that these proceedings be suspended until the disqualification motions are decided --  are finally decided. 

Secondly, I made a motion yesterday to make a supplemental opening statement before the testimony of this witness, and I would ask that you make a ruling on that motion.  I also have some request for certifications to appeal.  I think those can be done later in the day, but I just would like you to make some time for that at some point during these proceedings.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are saying you filed a motion.  We are not in possession of that motion, and we can therefore not pronounce -- make any pronouncements on that, and we will make a statement regarding the other motions later.  

Mr. Prosecutor, please usher in the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, yesterday I think we had gone to the point where a document was displayed to the Court and to the parties and was placed before the witness.  I would like to pick up from that point. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registry, I do believe you have this document.  You had already shown it to the Chamber and also to the Defence.  I believe this is the document about which mention is made of information regarding the witness.   

I have serious problems, Mr. Technician, with the equipment.  I have moved it away but the noise remains.  It would seem we require technical assistance here.  Technicians, please, come to our aid.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  You are a protected witness and, therefore, we are going to use the pseudonym GFA when we refer to you.  You are going to be examined by the Prosecutor and then you will be cross-examined by the Defence.  It is possible also that the Judges here before you would require some clarifications from you.  We are asking you please to respond clearly and precisely to the questions, and also to inform us any time that a question may appear to you likely to reveal your identity.  Before you answer your questions, therefore, we are going to ask you to be sworn in, and the registry will assist you in that.  

Registry, please proceed.
MR. RAMADHANI:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up, raise your right hand and repeat the following words after me: 
	(Declaration made by Witness GFA in Kinyarwanda)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the witness.  

And, Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor for the examination-in-chief of this witness.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.
WITNESS GFA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you kindly take a look at the document that is placed in front of you.  This is a document which we are identifying on the record as P. 17.  I think 17 is the appropriate number.  Can you confirm that from the registry, please?  

Mr. Witness, taking a look at this document, do you see the pseudonym under which you are testifying, the pseudonym GFA?
A.	Yes, I can see the pseudonym.
Q.	Looking at this document, do you see your name? 
A.	Yes, I can see it. 
Q.	Do you see the year of your birth? 
A.	I also can see the year. 
Q.	Is your ethnic identification listed on this paper? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	There is an indication of a commune and a prefecture. Does that correctly state the commune and the préfecture in which you resided in 1994? 
A.	Yes, it is correct. 
Q.	And with regard to your occupation in 1994, do you see that listed, it is the last entry on that document? 
A.	Yes, I can see that.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, the Prosecution would move P. 17 into evidence.  This is to -- we request this be placed under seal.  It is simply to preserve the record, to accurately identify this witness for the purposes of the record. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, we have no objection.

THE WITNESS:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Yes, Mr. Witness, do you want to say something?
THE WITNESS:
Regarding my name, I have realised, after verification, that there's a letter which has been included in the spelling of my name. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to your surname?  Please just mention the letter in question so that we can amend the document, or we can give you the document and then you will strike out the said letter.  Do you agree?
MR. WEBSTER:
What I would prefer --
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the document here; I can do so. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we have the witness simply write his -- correct the document?  He can simply write over it and simply write out his name and then sign the document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Since there are no objections, the document bearing code -- the identification of 
Witness GFA is admitted as an exhibit from the Prosecutor under code P. 17, and this document shall be placed under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. P.17 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, may we see the document, as amended?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Can you kindly show the document to the Defence? 
	
Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, just as a final reminder, if you think any answer to any question that I ask you is going to reveal your identity, just indicate that to the Trial Chamber and we will find another way of dealing with the question. 

Mr. Witness, would you begin by telling us if you know Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	I know him. 
Q.	Can you tell us where you know him from? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
	Perhaps, I can answer that question in a closed session, because if I give a detailed answer, it may reveal my identity. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let me rephrase the question.  Mr. Witness, tell us what you know about Joseph Nzirorera.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Your Honour.  I have an objection to that question.  That can include all kinds of inadmissible evidence and it is too broad. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know where Mr. Nzirorera was resident in 1994? 
A.	Yes, I know the place.
Q.	And where was that? 
A.	He lived in Kigali, but he did have a house in Busogo secteur in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Have you ever had a face-to-face conversation with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	When he would come to his house on weekends, he would visit his mother.  Sometimes I would speak with him, I was, of course, with others but we did talk with him. 
Q.	Do you recall the first time that you had ever had a conversation with Mr. Nzirorera?  How long ago was that? 
A.	We would go to his parents' house.  I have known them since I was young.  So I have spoken with 
Mr. Nzirorera ever since I was young. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you recognise Mr. Nzirorera if you saw him today? 
A.	Yes, very well. 
Q.	I would like you to take a look around the courtroom today and tell us if you see Mr. Nzirorera in this courtroom.
A.	I have already seen him.  He is in this room. 
Q.	Can you tell us where he is in this room, please? 
A.	He is seated in the second row, next to a white man who is also seated over there, where I am showing you -- where I am indicating with my hand. 
Q.	Can you tell us who is seated on the other side of Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	I see an African woman with black skin seated next -- on the other side next to Mr. Nzirorera. 
Q.	Can you tell me the colour of the jacket that Mr. Nzirorera is wearing? 
A.	It is almost khaki.  The shirt is mauve, kind of mauve, and a coloured tie. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, may I have the record indicate that the witness has identified Joseph Nzirorera? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let it be reflected in the record that the witness has recognised Joseph Nzirorera in the courtroom. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, do you know what political party Joseph Nzirorera belonged to? 
A.	Yes, I know the party; it's the MRND.  He was a member of the MRND party.
Q.	Do you know what status Joseph Nzirorera held in the MRND party in 1994? 
A.	Yes, he was secretary general of the party, of the MRND party at the national level.
Q.	What is Joseph Nzirorera's commune of origin, if you know? 
A.	Mukingo commune.  He is a native of Mukingo commune. 
Q.	And what préfecture is that in? 
A.	It is Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera have any political status in Ruhengeri in 1994? 
A.	I don't think that he worked in Ruhengeri.  All I know is that he was a member of parliament in Rwanda after he was a minister.  That is what I know. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, was Mr. Nzirorera an important person in Mukingo commune in 1994? 
A.	Yes, for a very long time.  He had been an important person in the commune.  He was member of parliament.  He was minister of energy.  He is someone who was very much respected in Ruhengeri préfecture and especially in Mukingo commune. He did many things and the population benefited from him.  He built roads, water installations.  He was very important in the commune and in the region in general. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli?
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Can you tell us if Juvénal Kajelijeli held any particular status in Mukingo commune in 1993? 
A.	Kajelijeli was bourgmestre of Mukingo commune during the war.  Before 1994, he left his job as bourgmestre.  After Habyarimana's death, he took up that job again, but I can't tell you exactly when he stopped being a bourgmestre prior to 1994. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us what, if any, relationship there was between Joseph Nzirorera and Juvénal Kajelijeli?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I have an objection to that based on a lack of foundation.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you wish to respond, Prosecutor?   
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the witness is going to -- there is no need for foundation at this point.  I am asking the witness simply to identify the significant figures in Mukingo commune.  He is in the process of doing that.  He has already identified Joseph Nzirorera as coming from Mukingo commune and being very important in Ruhengeri.  I have asked him who the bourgmestre was in Mukingo in 1993.  I fail to see what foundation is lacking to move on with that question.  I can ask other questions.  We can lay foundations for questions and in 10 and 15 minutes developing a simple point -- if the Court prefers that I do it that way, well, I am happy to do that, but it is unnecessary. 

To add a further comment, I am trying to keep as much of this testimony in open session as possible, Your Honour.  If we are going into closed session, I can go closer to the connections between this witness and the persons that I have asked him to identify, but I would like to have as much testimony as possible in open Court, so that is my concern.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel.  The objection is overruled. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me remind you of the question, please.  Can you tell us, to the extent that you were able to observe it, any relationship between Joseph Nzirorera and Juvénal Kajelijeli? 
A.	They weren't related, but I did know that they were friends.  I could see that they were friends, close friends.  Kajelijeli was from the ESTB school.  Anything Nzirorera wanted done, he could have asked Kajelijeli to do it.  I could say from my perspective that they were very good friends.
Q.	Well, tell us what you mean by the ESTB school, please? 
A.	It is a secondary school located in Busogo in Mukingo commune.  It is also called the Institute Saint Joseph.  Nzirorera was the chairman, if you will, of that school. 
Q.	Was this a private school, Witness, or was this a school that was run by the state? 
A.	It was a private school. 
Q.	Do you know who the owner of this school was? 
A.	The school belonged to Nzirorera.
Q.	You referred to Kajelijeli in relationship to this school.  What was Kajelijeli's relationship to this school? 
A.	He was the treasurer of the school. 
Q.	And was this in 19 -- are you referring to the period of 1994/1993?  Could you be a bit more specific in that regard? 
A.	Ever since the school was created, Kajelijeli was the treasurer, up until the month of the war, up until the time when people started fleeing the country.  He was always the treasurer of the school.  I think that during our flight -- before our flight, the school had been running for some six years. 
Q.	And when you say the time of the war, can you tell us what year you are referring to, please? 
A.	I mean the last -- I mean the last war, the war that occurred after the plane crash of 
President Habyarimana.
Q.	Would that be in 1994? 
A.	Absolutely, 1994. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Esdras Baheza?
A.	Yes, I know Esdras Baheza.
Q.	Can you tell us what his occupation was in 1994, or what his status was in Mukingo commune in 1994? 
A.	He was an important businessman in Byangabo centre up until the point we fled in 1994.
Q.	Do you know if he had any affiliation with a political party at that time? 
A.	He was a member of the MRND party.
Q.	Were you able to perceive any particular relationship between Esdras Baheza and Juvénal Kajelijeli? 
A.	Yes, they would meet each other.  They were important people within the MRND, and sometimes we would receive instructions from those people.  They were always together.  He was an important personality within the MRND.  He knew everything that was going on, and whenever we were asked to do anything, he was often present.
Q.	What about the relationship between Esdras Baheza and Joseph Nzirorera?  Can you tell us a bit about that, please? 
A.	What I do know is that they were in the Abagesera clan, but I don't know if they were relatives beyond that.  Baheza was there; he was also a good friend of Nzirorera. 
Q.	Did you ever see them together? 
A.	I did.  I did see them together. 
Q.	In what context, please? 
A.	I would often see them when Nzirorera came to his parents' house.  He would hold meetings, Kajelijeli was there, Baheza was there, as well as others. 
Q.	Can you tell us the names of any of the other persons that you would see at these meetings? 
A.	I would begin with Juvénal Kajelijeli, Esdras Baheza, Jean-Baptiste, director of ESAE, Colonel would also come to the meeting.  Augustin Bizimungu was there; Asiel Ndisetse the former conseiller, Jean Damascéne, chairman of the MRND in Mukingo commune, Dominique Gatsimbi, bourgmestre of Nkuli commune; Alphonse, director-general, he would also come to the meetings; Bakuzakundi Michel, he also took party; Sode Parel (phonetic,) general director.  There was also Bambonye, President of the CDR, and many others.  I would see many of them but those are the names that I remember. 
Q.	We are going to go over that a bit more slowly, Mr. Witness, and we are going to take it step by step.  

You mentioned Jean-Baptiste.  Do you recall this person's last name? 
A.	Yes, Jean-Baptiste Nyabusore.  I will spell Nyabusore, N-Y-A-B-U-S-O-R-E, Nyabusore. 
Q.	And you mentioned him in relation to ESAE.  Can you tell us what ESAE is, please? 
A.	Nyabusore, Jean-Baptiste was the director of ESAE.  It is a superior institute for agriculture and livestock, located in Busogo secteur in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	What is that?  Tell us what that institution -- what is the function of that institution, please? 
A.	It is a higher school which trains people in agriculture and in livestock.  It is still located and still exists where it is. 
Q.	Is this a private institution or is this something that is run by the government?  And I am directing your attention to 1994.
A.	It is a public institution; it always has been up until today even. 
Q.	You mentioned a certain Asiel Ndisetse.  Can you tell us who that person was, please? 
A.	He was the conseiller of Busogo secteur in Mukingo commune.  He was the conseiller. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May you please spell that name?
THE WITNESS:
Ndisetse, Asiel, Ndisetse is spelt N-D-I-S-E-T-S-E.  Asiel, first name. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you also mentioned a certain Bizimungu.  Can you tell us who this Bizimungu person is, the first name and what his status was in Mukingo at that time?
A.	It is Augustin Bizimungu.  I knew him when he was a colonel.  During our flight, he was a major general.  He was commander of the Mukamira camp.  He replaced Bizabirimana and he became commander of operations in Ruhengeri préfecture.  Later on, he became chief of general staff of the Rwandan Armed Forces. 
Q.	You mentioned the name of --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Bizimungu is spelt, B-I-Z-I-M-U-N-G-U.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You mentioned the name of the camp where he was the commander.  I am not sure if I understood you correctly.  Could you repeat the name of the camp, please? 
A.	Mukamira in Nkuli commune in Ruhengeri préfecture.  M-U-K-A-M-I-R-A, Mukamira camp. 
Q.	Do you know Casmir Bizimungu?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	What was Casmir Bizimungu's status in Ruhengeri in 1994? 
A.	He was chairman of the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture.  He was also a minister, minister of health, and later on, he became minister of foreign affairs. 
Q.	You mentioned many other names.  We are going into them during the course of your testimony.  But for right now, I would like to direct you to the meetings that you mentioned.  

Now, you talked about certain meetings.  Can you tell us where these meetings took place? 
A.	I don't remember the time the meetings took place.  I didn't see the usefulness in that.  But I do know that many of the meetings were held during the weekends.  On the weekends, all of those authorities would show up to see Nzirorera, and they would meet him at Nzirorera's mother's house. 
Q.	Do you recall when -- do you recall how far back in time these meetings started to be held in Mukingo?  In other words, I am not asking you the time of day but referring to the period at which you recall observing these meetings taking place, how far back in time? 
A.	Starting in about 1991.
Q.	Was there anything that happened in 1991 that would explain -- which would lead you to associate 1991 with the beginning of these meetings? 
A.	Yes, yes.  There is an extraordinary event that would remind me that those meetings began in 1991.
Q.	And what is that, please? 
A.	Well, first of all, I remember that the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi attacked Ruhengeri and liberated the prisoners from Ruhengeri.  

Second of all, I remember that year political parties were created, because before 1991, there was only one single party, the MRND.  So, in 1991, we had the advent of the multiparty system. 
Q.	Were you yourself present at these meetings? 
A.	When those authorities would meet, they would go inside the house, into the living room.  We were outside, but we were inside the compound, nonetheless.  When they came out of the meeting, they would speak to us and give us instructions, but we did not participate in the meeting as such in the house.  After the meeting, however, they would tell us what their recommendations were, based on what went on in the meeting inside the house.
Q.	Now, Witness, you used the pronoun "we."  Can you tell us who you are referring to when you say "we?"  "We" waited outside of the house? 
A.	Other Interahamwe and myself.
Q.	Well, with regard to the Interahamwe, tell us what you mean by Interahamwe?  
A.	It is the youth wing of the MRND party; it was called the Interahamwe.
Q.	Were you a member of this youth wing? 
A.	I was. 
Q.	Do you recall when it was created? 
A.	In 1991. 
Q.	When was your first acquaintance with this whole notion of the Interahamwe or the youth wing?  Tell us how you first became aware of the Interahamwe. 
A.	After the advent of multipartyism, the MRND party was renewed and it was -- it became known as the renewed MRND.  And since there were other political parties which came to see the light of day, the youth wing of the MRND was instituted at national and local level, so that the MRND party could have a youth wing which was going to become the strength and force of that party.  I became aware of that youth wing when Kajelijeli called us, we, the youth of Mukingo commune, students and those who had not gone to school, and he told us that all youths must join the MRND and that the MRND would ensure our progress and that the country itself had progressed because of that party, and, therefore, we had to join the MRND.  

He further went to say that we needed to have a focused programme.  We, the youth of the MRND, needed to have this programme, and we therefore needed to create bodies for the youth in Mukingo commune.  That is how I became to be a member of the MRND youth wing.  We therefore started to operate, and when Nzirorera came, he was informed of our existence.  He was told that we had set up bodies which were to govern us and that we had become operational.  He told us that --
Q.	Witness, I am going to try to put questions to you bit by bit so that you can answer specific -- respond to specific concerns that I would like to go into.  

With respect to Joseph Nzirorera, what role, if any, did he play in the creation of Interahamwe in Mukingo? 
A.	The role that he played is that he was the one who gave us the Interahamwe uniforms.  He was the one who gave us all the instructions that we had to follow.  Even in his absence, he would delegate someone.  He was the one who gave us all the materials necessary for our operations.  He would give us money, and when we came back from the operations, he would sometimes provide us with transport.  In brief, I would say that we were like his boys. 
Q.	Okay.  I am concerned by one of your previous responses.  You said that Mr. Nzirorera found the Interahamwe.  I believe that was your response to an earlier question, that you had put together an organisation and Mr. Nzirorera found the organisation in place.  Is that accurate or would you like to clarify that response? 
A.	Yes, I repeat.  He played a role in the establishment of the Interahamwe and he played a very important role, indeed.
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera himself address you or address your group and talk about the creation of this group? 
A.	Yes, he took the floor; he spoke to us and he gave us his building, which was called Isimbi ya Busogo, so that we could hold our meetings there.
Q.	Thank you.  Because your earlier response seemed to focus on Juvénal Kajelijeli.  Did Mr. Nzirorera ever address you in that manner? 
A.	Yes, at that point in time, Kajelijeli addressed us on behalf of Nzirorera and the whole of the MRND party. 
Q.	Well, what would lead you to conclude that he was addressing you on behalf of Nzirorera?  Tell us how you knew of that. 
A.	It is because Kajelijeli himself told us that Nzirorera had delegated him, and that he was absent, and that all the recommendations from the meeting would be transmitted to Nzirorera, and that during our second meeting, we went to Nzirorera's house, and the newly elected committee was introduced to him, and he promised us that he was going to work together with us, that he was giving us his building, and we raised the flag even at his home, and that in his absence we needed to address ourselves to Kajelijeli, who would thereafter communicate to him our request.
Q.	Do you recall when that was, Mr. Witness?  And I am specifically referring to what you described as Nzirorera's recommendations to you that Kajelijeli would transmit information back and forth.
A.	That was in 1991, after the advent of multipartyism and after the attack on Ruhengeri by the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell us what you mean by the "Inkotanyi," please? 
A.	The Inkotanyi were refugees who had fled the country.  When they attacked the country, we were told that it was the Tutsis who had attacked the country, that they were the enemies and that any Tutsi was an Inkotanyi, and that even some Hutu political opponents were considered as Inkotanyi.  Also that Hutus who were married to Tutsi women were Inkotanyi.  That's what we were told.
Q.	And when you say, "we were told," who are you referring to?  Who is the "we" and who is telling you this? 
A.	It was all the authorities who came to instruct us, such as Kajelijeli and Nzirorera, who came to the meeting.  And even on Radio RTLM, we were taught this, even through the newspaper. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I am going to try to confine you to the year 1991.  If you think back, to the extent that you can -- if you can think back to 1991 --
A.	In 1991, the Inkotanyi attacked Ruhengeri and they released the prisoners.  They took people like Lizinde, Biziruka and others.  At that point in time, the people of Bagogwe were being hunted down in our commune.  Subsequently, multipartyism came about, and there were other parties such as the PL, the MDR and others.  We were used to a single party, but at that point in time, new parties saw the light of day.  That is how the leaders of political parties, especially the leaders of MRND, because they were many members in our region, they told us that other parties were working or were collaborating with the Inkotanyi.  In that regard, many people began to hunt down -- persons who were not members of the MRND began to be hunted down, and in particular, the Tutsi.  That is why they were chased, hunted down, because they were considered accomplices of the Inkotanyi and that they were working together with the Inkotanyi in order to attack the country.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, earlier in your response, you had mentioned Joseph Nzirorera bringing uniforms into Mukingo.  Do you recall when that was?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	When was it, please?
A.	He gave us uniforms in 1992.  That's when we received the first batch of uniforms.  The second batch of uniforms was distributed en masse.  The people, in general, received many uniforms, but initially he gave us the uniforms in 1992 and I was amongst those who received the kitenge uniforms in 1992.
Q.	Do you recall when in 1992, if you remember?
A.	I do believe it was around August 1992.
Q.	Now, did you see Mr. Nzirorera himself bring these uniforms?  How were they actually delivered to you?
A.	He himself distributed the uniforms at his home, not at his mother's home but at Nzirorera's residence in Mukingo commune.
Q.	How many persons received uniforms at that time, approximately?
A.	I believe about 50 persons received uniforms.  I do not really remember that well, but more than 50 people received uniforms.
Q.	Did he say anything to you during the process of distributing these uniforms?
A.	He told us that since we had submitted some of our problems to him, he told us that he was going to bring us uniforms and that we needed to continue to search out the country's enemies and the Inkotanyi.  We needed to remain vigilant and continue to monitor all the activities of the enemy.  We needed also to remain firm and we needed to carry out the activities of the Interahamwe properly.
Q.	Okay.  And when you say "monitor the activities of the -- " "to be vigilant and to monitor," what exactly is meant by that?  Tell us exactly what you yourself did or understood your responsibility to be. 
A.	Normally, when a country is attacked, it is the citizens who must defend their country.  Our responsibility was therefore aimed at protecting the country.  When we were told that the Inkotanyi were wily and that all the Tutsis were accomplices of the Inkotanyi, and that they were bringing in soldiers and armaments secretly and that they had Hutu accomplices, we needed to always be vigilant and monitor all these activities so that the enemy cannot infiltrate the country and come to attack again.
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, but when you say to be "vigilant and to monitor," tell me exactly how you did that.  What were you doing?  What were you asked to do?
A.	Usually, being vigilant is to be constantly on the lookout and to be alert and to ensure that the enemy did not come to attack us.  We were supposed to monitor all the activities of the Tutsi, be they persons from other regions, be they persons who can be of assistance to the Inkotanyi, and we needed to report any such activities to Kajelijeli, especially to Kajelijeli, and to soldiers.
Q.	Well, let me ask you this, Mr. Witness:  Did you receive any military training during this period?
A.	In 1992, I learned how to handle weapons, ordinary handling of weapons.  In 1993, we were provided with military training and we received this at the -- at the --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I do beg your pardon. 
THE WITNESS:
The initial military training came about in 1992, therefore, I received training in the ordinary handling of weapons.  In 1993, many of us received military training.  This was training which I would refer to as complete, which was provided to any soldier.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let's restrict ourselves to 1992.  Who provided that training in 1992?
A.	It was soldiers and our Interahamwe colleagues who trained us in the handling of weapons.  Some Interahamwe who lived in our area also taught us -- trained us.
Q.	When you say "soldiers," where did these soldiers come from?
A.	They were soldiers who hailed from our region.  Sometimes they had come on leave and sometimes they were former soldiers who had joined the ranks of the Interahamwe that we were.
Q.	Did you perceive any relationship between Joseph Nzirorera and the training that took place in 1992?
A.	The relationship that existed is that we would do our training in his building, which was referred to as isimbi rya Busogo.  I'm referring to the initial training which took place in 1992.
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera ever specifically address you?  Did he talk to you about the training?
A.	During the initial training, he didn't say anything to us.  But during the subsequent training, he did indeed speak to us.
Q.	During the initial training, did you receive weapons?
A.	We were not given any weapons during the initial training.  Everyone managed on his own.  It was during the war.  Sometimes we had grenades which the soldiers had given us.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like to direct your attention towards the end of 1992.  Can you tell us what, if anything, happened in relation to President Habyarimana towards the end of 1992?
A.	All I can recall is the rally held by President Habyarimana in Ruhengeri in the Ruhengeri stadium.
Q.	Did you attend that rally?
A.	Yes, I was present at the rally.
Q.	Can you tell us what happened at that rally?
A.	Several persons in authority took the floor, such as Ngirumpatse, Robert Kajuga, Casimir Bizimungu.  There were Interahamwe who danced; everyone danced.  It was really a party.  There were many people who came from other regions of the country, such as Kigali and Kibuye.  In brief, many people had gathered together on that day in that location.
Q.	Did you -- you mentioned the presence of the Interahamwe at the rally.  Were they dressed in any particular fashion at that time?
A.	We were in the Interahamwe kitenge uniform.  That was our dress.
Q.	Now, was this a meeting that was open to the public?  Was this restricted to political parties?  What was the theme of the meeting, if you recall?
A.	It was a rally of the MRND party, which had the largest number of members in the country.  Some people were unable to come for fear of possibly being attacked.  They could not come to that meeting, obviously, for that reason.  Otherwise, many people were present at that rally.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse?
A.	I know him by name --
Q.	Have you ever seen Mathieu Ngirumpatse?
A.	-- but as for having seen him, I saw him at that Ruhengeri rally.
Q.	Would you recognise him if you saw him again today?
A.	I saw someone who looks like him there in the front row.  I believe it would be him.  I'm not sure.  I don't know whether it's him, but that person looks like him.  You know, it was ten years ago that I saw him last.  I'm not really sure whether it is indeed him.
Q.	Well, directing your attention to the rally in 1992, do you recall what -- I believe your previous testimony was that Mathieu Ngirumpatse addressed the rally, was it not?
A.	Yes, you're right.
Q.	What was his message at that time?
A.	He spoke of the presidential elections which had been envisaged.  He spoke generally of the MRND.  He said that we needed to join massively the MRND party and that we needed to bring other members which were belonging to other parties and who were supposed to join the MRND.  We used what was known as kubahoza as an operation.  He also spoke of security.  He spoke of vigilance, because the enemy was present.
Q.	And when you say "enemy" --
A.	The enemy was there. 
Q.	When you say "enemy" in that context, can you tell us what you understood that to mean, please?
A.	We understood that to mean Inyenzi-Inkotanyi and anyone who collaborated with them in their operations.  We also understood by that political opponents in other parties, such as the PL, the PSD, the MR -- MDR.  It was said that those people were accomplices of the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi and that they were being used to obtain their objectives; in other words, to destroy the country.
Q.	When you heard the term Inyenzi-Inkotanyi in 1992, and I'm directing your attention to this rally in particular, did you understand that to be a reference to all Tutsi, or was it a more narrow reference?  Tell us what you understood that to mean in 1992. 
A.	First I heard talk of all the Tutsis, babies, all the way up to old people, and then they started talking about Hutus who didn't agree with the president's -- or the MRND's policies, and then I heard of other people, Hutus who were married to Tutsi women, because they had changed camps, so to speak.  But 95 per cent of the time, when I heard "Inkotanyi," I understood Tutsis, whether it be young people or old people.
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse talk about the Interahamwe at that meeting in 1992?
A.	Yes, he spoke of the Interahamwe.  On that day the Interahamwe were in their garb, they were very visible.  He said that they would continue their work, and they had to help the MRND.  He showed that the Interahamwe was the strength of the party, and consequently, we had to support the party and we had to look for all the people who weren't members of the MRND.  We had to support the leaders and bring people who weren't members of the MRND and make them members of the MRND by kubohoza tactics. 
Q.	Did Habyarimana address the rally?
MR. ROACH:
One moment, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Oui, Maître Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Just for the record, I would like it to be noted that the last question was elicited by a leading 
question -- the last response, rather. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to respond, Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Quite frankly, I can't remember the last question.  If it could be read back from the record, or if 
Mr. Roach could be more specific what did I ask that was improper.
MR. ROACH:
My friend, the Prosecutor, asked the witness what was said by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and the witness responded and made, in our opinion, a full response.  But then my friend went on to say, did Ngirumpatse speak about the Interahamwe?  So after asking him what he spoke about, the witness never mentioned Interahamwe.  But then my friend led him to the issue of Interahamwe.  This is my objection.
MR. WEBSTER:
I fail to see the leading nature of that question.  I simply asked the witness, did he discuss the Interahamwe.  The witness can say yes or no and then go on from there.  It was certainly not suggesting an answer to the witness. 
MR. ROACH:
If I may say, the proper way is, "What did he speak about?"  That's not leading.  If you say, "Did he speak about a particular thing," and the answer is "yes," then that's a leading question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I beg to differ on that point, but I think we've gone beyond it.  The witness has made a response.  We can take it from there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber will evaluate that later, during deliberations.  You may proceed. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did Habyarimana, President Habyarimana, address the rally on that day?
A.	He did.  President Habyarimana spoke, but not for long.
Q.	Was there anything in his speech that impressed you?  What was the most significant thing -- message, that he delivered, based on your experience of the event in 1992?
A.	On that day he said that his children had asked him to go see their grandmother, and upon their return, he didn't want to go by without saying -- without greeting us, and he knew there was a celebration.  And it was for that reason that he had come to the stadium.  He didn't want to just go by without greeting those who were present.  He said, "I know what these people are fearing."  And on that day he saw the Interahamwe in their garb and he said, "I've seen what those people fear."  He also said, to the best of my memory, "I will call you and we will come down," and then he said, "I ask you" - 
	"I ask the MRND secretariat at the national level to have dialogue with the businessmen so that they can furnish the Interahamwe dress."  He also said that that dress was very expensive.  He said that that dress -- those clothes cost a lot of money and that, in fact, if you looked at them closely, they weren't more expensive than what we ourselves were wearing.  And so I asked the secretariat to speak with the businessmen, the traders, so that they can furnish the clothing for the Interahamwe so that, after, we can come down. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say, taking from the last portion of your response, "so that after we can come down," can you explain what you understood that to mean in 1992?
A.	When he said, finally, after supplying the uniforms we would come down, we had to accompany him to fight the enemy which had attacked the country.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, could you elaborate on that point a bit more?  In other words, to attack the enemy in the country, tell us exactly what you understood when you heard those words. 
A.	What I can say about that, that the Inkotanyi had attacked Byumba, Mutara and Ruhengeri.  To my understanding, they had taken over part of the country, and that they were going to continue their attacks, and that they were very clever.  So we understood, and I knew that the president was a soldier, that we had to accompany him to the war front to chase out the Inkotanyi so that they go back from where they came.  Another thing:  We were proficient in kubahoza.  We had to look for members of other parties.  We would launch attacks and we would affiliate ourselves with the other youth wings.  

On that day, when he said -- when he made his speech, I heard that.  There were often demonstrations organised by the GDR or the Abakombozi .  So we had to face those people and show the strength of the MRND.
Q.	All right.  Well, Mr. Witness, I believe the translation in French is "il descend".  The way I've usually heard the president's discourse being translated is not "go down" as it's being translated in English, but I appreciate the French translation.  When you talk about going to the war front, is that what you refer to by the description of "going down" or "descending" or "il descend"?  Because a moment ago you talked about sending people to the war front, but you mentioned going down.  Can you distinguish the two for us or confirm that they are the same thing?
A.	To tell you the truth, it's a Kinyarwanda word, kumanaka, which means to descend, to go down, to go in a downwardly direction.  What he meant to say is that we were going to accompany him.  We were in the north, where the war was.  We had to leave a high, high ground and go somewhere where he intended.  I understood that it meant that we were going to fight with the enemy, where the enemy was, or go to find the enemy, go to find all of those people, especially in Kigali town.  

As regards the parties opposed to the MRND, there were many people from the GDR, the Abakombozi.  We had to face all of those people, to show them that the MRND was strong.  To my understanding, he said those things and that is what I understood from what he said.
Q.	And then, Witness, when you talk about the enemy, going to find the enemy or going down to find the enemy, who are you referring to when you say "the enemy" in that context?
A.	To look for the enemy, that's the enemy who had attacked the country in other words the Inkotanyi.  There were Inkotanyi everyone, Inkotanyi at the war front who were fighting in Mutara, Kidaho, or in Butaro.  There were other Inkotanyi or their accomplices.  To my understanding, all of those people had to be sought out, we had to begin with those at the war front, the soldiers, and then the other -- the other ones, the accomplices, in other words.
Q.	Well, when you refer to accomplices, are you referring to persons who were actively engaged in fighting or are you referring to civilians, or are you referring to men, women, children?  Explain to the Chamber who you had in mind or who you understood the authorities had in mind when they said "the enemy" at that time. 
A.	First of all, I had said -- it was said that the enemy was the Tutsi.  The Inkotanyi was the Tutsi.  Second -- and they were the enemy, rather.  The RPF had attacked the country.  They were Inyenzis.  They were soldiers from the RPF.  There were other civilians who helped those soldiers in various activities, be it transporting ammunition, rifles, or just giving them information.  Those who were within the country, and there were others who were on the border, fighting, others who were inside the country. 
Q.	But with respect to going down, did you understand at that time that the enemy included persons who had nothing to do with the fighting and were only --
MR. ROACH:
He is leading the witness.  You're telling him what to say.  So we object to that question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, here we believe that the objection is well-founded.  Can you rephrase your question? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, you began in your response by saying that the enemy was all Tutsi.  You went on to describe the Inkotanyi at the war front and persons who were helping them with ammunition, 
et cetera, et cetera.  My question to you now is a request that you elaborate a bit on what you understood the enemy to mean now, thinking back to your response and thinking back to this meeting in 1992.
A.	When we heard the enemy, first I understood it to be Tutsi.  We were told Tutsis and the RPF Inkotanyi and the Inyenzi had attacked the country, and that the RPF is made up of Tutsis.  Consequently, infants, just to elderly people, are enemies if they're Tutsis.  All of the Hutus married to Tutsi women were changed somehow by their wives.  Also, by "enemy" I understand other members of opposing parties, opponents to the MRND.
Q.	So when you heard the reference from President Habyarimana that he was going to go down or that he was going to "descend" and the word that you used in Kinyarwanda, did you think that he was only talking about the RPF on the battlefront?
MR. ROACH:
One moment please.  Just one moment please. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel Roach, part of your intervention was cut off.  Could you start again?
MR. ROACH:
Yes, yes.  I object to this question because it has been asked and answered. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Your Honour, I'll withdraw that question.  Maybe -- I'd like to have an item displayed to the witness, please.  I have a -- perhaps I'll begin by identifying it for the record.  They are a series of video clips.  These were items that were disclosed to the Defence sometime last week.  What I'm going to attempt to show to the Court and the witness are extracts of a longer tape that was previously disclosed.  One second. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, while Mr. Webster is looking for these materials, I would like to lodge an objection to this, and that I think there's a very serious problem here.  This material which, as you know, we have asked for, for over a year now, was disclosed to -- given to us yesterday morning in six CDs.  We had no notice even that this would be an exhibit.  It was disclosed because you ordered, actually, that we receive copies of any MRND meeting videotapes in the possession of the Prosecution.  Neither my client nor myself have had the time to review these exhibits prior to them being shown to the witness.  And we are very disturbed that a situation like this would arise where things are sprung on, especially something that we've been asking for a long time.  So we object to this exhibit being used today with this witness until we have first had a chance to examine it.  

And it's particularly important if they're going to try to use extracts because we have no idea of what they are extracting and what else is on this material that may be relevant.  So we object to them -- this is a classic problem of lack of disclosure, and we object to this exploitation of our lack of preparation by the Prosecutor's failure to disclose this in a timely fashion.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Robinson. 

Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Your Honour, I associate myself with the remarks of Mr. Robinson.  I, myself, and our team only received these six CDs yesterday morning.  I have not had an opportunity to review them, and I would not be able to make proper response to this, if it's presented. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, may I also --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Roach.  

Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I also support this application.  I fast-tracked through some of these videos.  I haven't been able to listen to them, but it wouldn't do me much good if I did because I assume they're all in Kinyarwanda in any event. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I thought I had clarified this yesterday.  These videos have not been withheld from disclosure --
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Diagne. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I just wanted to tell the Chamber that Karemera's defence is in the exact same situation.  These are CDs that we received yesterday morning during the hearing and we have as of yet not been able to do anything with them.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.  Thank you.  
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, you wish to respond? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I did -- yes, I do, excuse me.  I believe I responded to this question yesterday.  This is not a matter of late disclosure.  These items came into the possession of the Prosecutor for the first time on the 11th of March of this year, some two weeks ago.  That's the first time that we had any awareness of this material because that's when we received it.  We were not in possession of these materials prior to the 11th of March.  That's when the office in Kigali received it and transmitted it to the evidence unit here in Arusha.  

I myself saw these tapes for the first time just last week, and they were disclosed on CMS for delivery to the Defence at that time.  If the Defence did not receive them until this morning or yesterday, that's not something that the Prosecutor is responsible for.  They were all served on CMS sometime last week.  

Furthermore, the text of Habyarimana's speech was previously disclosed to the Defence in another format.  There was another CD-ROM that contained an extract of the speech of Habyarimana which was actually taken from something in the public domain and that was given to the Defence long in advance, that was some months ago.  That particular portion of this meeting was disclosed.  

What I am suggesting to this Court is that it is much more appropriate to use the recently acquired materials than to rely on the CD-ROM that had been disclosed months ago, and the reason for that is simple:  The CD-ROMS that I have that I would like to show to the Court at this time are the actual footage of the meeting where President Habyarimana and Mathieu Ngirumpatse are speaking, so we see the image of these people as they are pronouncing their discourse, whereas the previously disclosed CD-ROM has the voice-over.  It has the words of Habyarimana, but images are not in sync.  The images are not of the meeting that took place in Ruhengeri in 1992.  The images have nothing to do with what is being said on the tape, but that is all we had when the request came in from the Defence and we disclosed what we had at that time.  But what I am proposing to show to the Court now is a more accurate reflection of the events of that rally.  They were disclosed to the Defence.  All of the parties can see them as they're being displayed to the witness.  There is nothing that is going to be changed.  We are displaying to the Court exactly what we received. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
The problem is that Mr. Webster is proposing to use an exhibit here that none of us have seen.  And maybe he received it late and maybe it's not his fault, but nevertheless that's not a proper way for the trial to proceed, that the Defence sees evidence for the first time when the Judges are viewing it.  I would like to propose that if Mr. Webster is willing to show us this -- these materials during a recess sometime before this material is shown to the witness, perhaps in viewing the entire material with 
Mr. Webster, we can agree that it can be used, but it should not be shown in this courtroom without the Defence having seen it first. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to take a break.  That will give the Prosecutor an opportunity to watch the clips with the Defence, and we shall come back to this issue later.  

How much time do you think you'll need, Prosecutor, for this exercise with the Defence? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The extracts themselves are only around 15 minutes long, Your Honour.  An alternative suggestion is to excuse the witness and have the parties look at these extracts right now.  The parties and the Court could look at the exhibits.  It would take no more than 10 or 15 minutes, and then we can bring the witness back into the room. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, we are again dealing with a methodology problem.  Mr. Webster told us that he had the documents since the 11th of March.  Nothing prohibited him from communicating, disclosing that, as soon as he received them on the 11th of March, or at least of the willingness to sort through what is good for him and what is bad for him.  Today, if we only have clips, that does not give us an overall version of what is good for him and what is disturbing for his case.  

Now, just giving us these elements on CD is -- are voluminous.  There are six CDs.  If we have to work on them to have an overall comprehension of what that represents, we should have to spend hundreds of hours.  Webster -- Mr. Webster is using a procedure by disclosing these CDs, things that he had already compiled, to surprise us now on the 30th of March, asking us to quickly go over the excerpts during a break.  I don't think this is sufficient methodology, working technique.  What he had on the 11th of March is only given to us on the 29th of March by surprise.  I think that that is something that cannot be under debate under such circumstances right now.
MR. WEBSTER:
May I just clarify one point?  And that is this, Your Honour:  I did not say that I received these 
CD-ROMs on the 11th of March.  I said that they came into the possession of the Office of the Prosecutor on the 11th of March.  They came into our possession in Kigali through the evidence -- excuse me, through the investigations unit.  They were then transferred to Arusha.  I received these CD-ROMs for the first time sometime last week.  

As soon as I viewed them, I authorised them to be released to the Defence.  That happened within 24 hours of my viewing of these CD-ROMs.  So sometime last week, they were served on CMS.  I don't know how CMS made arrangements to deliver these CD-ROMs to the Defence, but we disclosed them to CMS last week at the earliest opportunity.  So the 11th of March is the date on which the office came into possession of these tapes, not when I personally came into possession of these tapes. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, I'm sure my friend's got many other points to make.  Can't we move on and come back to this point tomorrow and we will then have this afternoon to deal with it and to be able to assess the admissibility, which is the exercise that we have to conduct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have a proposal from Counsel Robinson.  The parties can get together during the break to see if it is possible to look at these cassettes today.  Mr. Prosecutor, in the alternative, can move on to other points and tomorrow we can look at this issue.  Those are the two proposals.  But right now, we are going to observe our morning break and we shall begin -- recommence in 15 minutes, or more, if you need more time for the exercise.  Please let us know, the different parties.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think 15 minutes should be sufficient, Your Honour.  I believe it will not take more than 15 minutes to view the clips.  So if the parties will remain in the room, I will show the clips.  We can still take the evidence on the clips tomorrow, but I will demonstrate or show the parties the portions of the larger tape that I wish to go forward on and then we can move on to something else right after the break. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I don't mean to belabour this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are still listening to the parties.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I think the point is that we want to view the entire clip so we can determine if the excerpts he is using are faithful to this, and I think if it only takes 30 minutes to view the entire thing, I think we could try to do it at the break or we could do it tomorrow but I want to be clear that it's not sufficient to view only what he's picked out; we want to see the whole thing.

MR. WEBSTER:
I think we're on the same wavelength here.  I'm suggesting to you that I will show you the clips now.  We will not use them until tomorrow, but you will see what I have extracted now so that you can go through the six CD-ROMs this evening and see if it meets your -- if you have any objections on that basis.  But to avoid running into this problem tomorrow, I'd like you to see what I have selected right now, and then we can go into something else right after the break.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I believe that we can perhaps go with that solution.  We won't come back to it substantively tomorrow -- today, but you will have the evening and the time to look at the clips to make a determination.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think that Counsel Hooper first asked for the floor, but we have made a decision.  I hope that this is another matter.  

Counsel Hooper first, please.  Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
At the very first status conference which I was with His Honour Judge Williams, it was proposed, and certainly Judge Williams, my understanding was, thought it was a good idea, and that was that before a witness gives evidence -- well before, for the Prosecution, the Prosecution furnish the Court and counsel with a list of exhibits it proposed to place in the hands of the witness, so that we're all on notice and we have time then to consider it, instead of this rather hand-to-mouth exercise.  And it would help all the parties, in my submission, including the Prosecution, to focus perhaps on what they're doing.  I'm grateful.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Without a doubt, but the Prosecutor did say that he only received these materials last week. 

Counsel Diagne, did you have something to raise?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, just a practical matter, Madam President.  We've been asked to look at the six CDs for tonight.  Counsel Weyl said hundreds of hours to look at that.  Perhaps he was just speaking euphemistically.  Nevertheless, it -- the Chamber must know that it's going to be difficult for us to look at six CDs in one evening.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  As we said, we are going to take the break and we will start again in 15 minutes and tomorrow we will get back to this issue of the cassettes.  
Proceedings are adjourned. 
	(Court recessed from 1109H to 1137H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is resumed. 

Mr. Prosecutor, could you please proceed with your examination-in-chief of this witness? 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, we're going to come back to the issue of this meeting in Ruhengeri later in your testimony.  I'm going to go on to another matter now.  

Earlier on in your testimony, you mentioned the Bagogwe.  Can you explain to the Court who or what the Bagogwe are?
A.	The Bagogwe were Tutsis who were living in Kinigi area of Mukingo, Nkuli, Mutura, in the area near the volcanoes in the north. 
Q.	Can you describe your understanding of the relationship between the Tutsi as a group and the Bagogwe as a group? 
A.	The Bagogwe are Tutsis.  There is no difference between the Bagogwe and the Tutsis.
Q.	I'd like to direct your attention towards the early part of 1993.  Can you tell us what, if anything, happened at that time in Mukingo commune in relation to the Bagogwe?
A.	The Bagogwe were being pursued in 1993.  And this was the case since the country was attacked, and this continued right into 1993.  So they were killed in 1993, and some of them were able to escape.  Others fled the country and others went to other regions.  Some of them were killed.  Others survived, but those who survived were killed later in 1994, after President Habyarimana's plane was brought down.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you mentioned the Bagogwe being attacked or killed, who attacked them and who killed them?
A.	They were attacked by the Interahamwe, by state soldiers or government soldiers.  Some were killed by the Interahamwe, whereas others were killed by soldiers.  Those who were attacked by the Interahamwe, some survived, obviously.  At that time some of them did survive.  Otherwise, the attackers were, on the one hand, the Interahamwe, and on the other, soldiers.
Q.	Was there any pattern to these attacks that you were able to discern? 
MR. ROACH:
Just one moment, please.  I should like to caution my friend not to ask the -- yes.  The witness is being presented as a fact witness, and I should caution my friend not to ask the witness for opinion evidence or evidence of some expert nature, such as patterns and making conclusions, but just the witness's own observations. 

MR. WEBSTER:
The witness just described a series of attacks.  He started by talking about attacks at the beginning of 1992 and he went all the way into 1994.  My question to the witness was put to him in that context.  If he cannot identify a pattern, then he can state -- he can say as much.  

May I continue? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, we'll begin again.  You just mentioned attacks against the Bagogwe in 1993 and 1994.  Did you participate in these attacks?
A.	Yes, I was among the attackers.
Q.	Was there anything that motivated these attacks?
A.	We were given instructions to go and attack the Bagogwe because they were Tutsis, and we were told that they were collaborating with the Inkotanyi and that therefore they were seen as being Inkotanyi.  We would therefore attack when we received instructions to do so.  
	(Pages 15 to 28 by Karen Holm-Porter)





















	1145H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Who gave you these instructions?
A.	It was the authorities, including Nzirorera, Kajelijeli, persons such as Baheza, Augustin Bizimungu and Ntirivamunda, Bizabarimana, Nyabusore and many others.  They would hold meetings and would give us instructions by saying, "Today you're going to do this or that."  Sometimes we were instructed to go and attack opponents of the MRND party.  When there were Inkotanyi attacks, we went to look for certain Tutsis, to kill them, because we were told that it was these Tutsis who had collaborated with the Inkotanyi so that they can be able to attain their objectives.  That is how we would go and attack these people.  We would therefore be obeying orders received from those authorities.
Q.	I'd like you to try and confine your answer to the year 1993.  If you can think back to 1993, how often would these -- how often were these meetings with authorities held in 1993?
A.	I wouldn't be able to know how many times they met.  I did not count.  All I know is that frequently, over weekends, these meetings were held.  But each time that they came, there was something that changed, so the meetings were held almost every weekend.
Q.	Where were these meetings held on the --
A.	At the home of Nzirorera's mother.
Q.	Was Nzirorera himself present for these meetings?
A.	Yes, he was present.
Q.	How often was he present?  If you were to take the first half of 1993, was -- I'm talking -- not -- I'm directing your attention to Nzirorera's presence at the meetings, not just the meetings. 
A.	I told you that almost every weekend, Nzirorera would come to his home.
Q.	How long would these meetings last? 
A.	He would come to his mother's house and he would hold meetings for hours.  He would sit in the sitting room and would discuss with those other men that I mentioned.  And at the end of their meeting, he would give us recommendations.  We would submit our problems to him and he would solve them, or promise to do so.  So I cannot therefore say that these meetings lasted so many hours, because he was at home and he could spend as much time there as he wished.
Q.	Well, you, Mr. Witness, for example, how long would you remain at these meetings? 
A.	When Nzirorera came to his home, and these other persons in authority came to his home, we would go to Nzirorera's home.  I, together with my other Interahamwe colleagues, when we got there, they would be inside the house and we wouldn't be able to go into the house and we would remain outside.  And when they came out of the meeting, they would find us outside the house.
Q.	Did Nzirorera himself address you and the others who were outside of the house? 
A.	When he came out of his house, he would ask us what news we had; we, his boys.  Were we okay?  Was everything all right?  Are there no infiltrators amongst us?  And were there no members of our party who had moved over to other parties?  Those were his questions.  So he was asking us what we were doing to ensure that security was maintained, what we were doing in order to counter the actions of the enemy, and whether we were monitoring the activities of the Tutsis, because they were Inkotanyi accomplices.  He would tell us, for instance, if there are other people, people in other parties, whom we could go and make join our party, he was asking whether we were able to go and face the members of other parties, and we needed to go and take their flags and force them to join our party.  Of course, the opponents would see us, the members of the other parties would see us, and they would flee.  That's what we were doing in 1993.  And in 1994, we also carried out other activities.
Q.	I'd like to direct you to the beginning of 1993.  Is there any particular meeting that stood out in your mind? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, I'd like to make an objection, and this is a something that's recurring.  It's that Mr. Webster is providing the dates of these meetings in his question and the witness may not necessarily know when these meetings take place.  I believe that that is a suggestive form of questioning and that the witness should not be provided with the date for a meeting. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think my question was towards the beginning of 1993.  I don't see how I can direct the witness appropriately without giving him some guidance.  I mean, we will be here all day if we have to go into every meeting that he ever attended from 1990 to 1994.  I'm trying to focus the witness on the events of 1993 at this point. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I put the question to you again.  If you can think back to the beginning of 1993, is there any meeting that comes to mind of any particular significance?
A.	All I can say in answer to your question is that in the beginning of 1993, the Inkotanyi attacked Ruhengeri for the second time.  After that Inkotanyi attack, the meetings did not cease.  They continued, and the Bagogwe continued to be pursued.  But since that attack of 1993 is very important -- was very important, meetings were held, I would say, for the formation of Virunga Amahindure.  And other meetings were also held at the residence of Nzirorera's mother, as I had said well earlier.
Q.	Were there any meetings that took place in locations other than Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	As I have said, for instance, a meeting was held at the commune office, bureau communal.  That meeting established Virunga Amahindure Force.  That meeting was therefore not held at Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	When you said a commune office, could you be more precise?  What commune? 
A.	I'm referring to our commune office in Mukingo, after the Inkotanyi attack on Ruhengeri, an attack which was quite important, large in scale.
Q.	We are going to talk about this meeting that took place at the commune -- at the Mukingo commune for a bit, so all of my questions are in regard to this particular meeting. 

Who was present at the meeting, in terms of speaking at the meeting? 
A.	All the people were called to that meeting, the population from Mukingo and Nkuli, the people from the neighbouring area.  Most of those present were from Mukingo.  I saw Préfet Nzabagerageza, Charles; Colonel Ntibitura; Nzirorera; Kajelijeli; Augustin Bizimungu; Bizabarimana, he was a major; and many other leaders.
Q.	All right.  I believe the first part of your response was that all the people were called.  Can you tell me how people were called to this meeting?  I'm asking you to elaborate on your previous response. 
A.	When there was a meeting at the commune, the bourgmestre would publish an announcement, or the communal responsables would communicate to the people that there was a meeting.  At that point in time, the population would be advised that they needed to come and attend the security meeting which would be held at the commune office.  It was therefore Kajelijeli who would send his officers to go and inform the people.
Q.	With respect to this particular meeting, could you estimate how many persons were in attendance? 
A.	The people were very many in attendance at that meeting, and if I were to take a guess, there would be more than 1,000.
Q.	Of the authorities that were present, could you give us the names again of those persons who you recognised as authorities in the commune who were present for the meeting? 
A.	There was the former préfet, Charles Nzabagerageza; Bourgmestre Kajelijeli obviously; the military leaders, such as Augustin Bizimungu, Colonel Ntibitura, Nyabusore; the conseillers of the secteurs, the responsables de cellules.  There was also Nzirorera and many others whose names I don't recall well.
Q.	Did Nzirorera address the meeting? 
A.	Generally speaking, all persons of import took the floor.  He also spoke.
Q.	Do you remember what he said at that time? 
A.	They all spoke of the same subject, the same thing, because they came to tell the people how to maintain security when the Inkotanyi were seriously threatening them.  So they spoke to us of civilian self defence.  They explained to us how we needed to defend our country, and each one spoke of the means we needed to utilise in order to monitor the activities of the Inkotanyi, how to monitor political opponents.  We were going through a very difficult period of time, and Ruhengeri was really under threat from the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Okay.  But tell us, Witness, what you mean by "monitor the" -- "monitor the situation."  Tell us exactly what you understood that to mean. 
A.	I told you that the objective of their arrival was mostly to teach the population how to defend themselves in the framework of civilian self defence.  They told us that they intended to set up a regional army which was going to defend Nkuli and Mukingo communes.  These -- this force was known as Virunga Force Amahindure.  That they were going to take the youths and train them militarily, the youths of Mukingo commune, so that they could be able to maintain security and counter the acts of the Inkotanyi, to ensure that the Inkotanyi no longer enter the country, and for the soldiers also to have support.  They therefore needed to set up a force which was going to protect our region.
Q.	All right.  We will come back to that, but I would like you to explain if the Bagogwe themselves attended this meeting at the commune office. 
A.	At that point in time, the Tutsis were being sought after and they were not able to come to the meeting.
Q.	And why is that? 
A.	I've already said that.  They were being looked for.  They could not come to a place such as that.  Some had gone into hiding.
Q.	Who was looking for them? 
A.	We ourselves, the Interahamwe, we were pursuing them, as well as the authorities of the time.  The soldiers were doing the same, and we were telling ourselves that these were the accomplices of the Inkotanyi, as we had been told, and therefore we needed to hunt them down.
Q.	So, Witness, when you talk about protecting the population or as the authorities were telling you to protect the population, they were not referring to the Bagogwe?  Or I would like you to explain that. 
A.	At that time, the people who had to be protected were good citizens who listened to the government, but there were other citizens who were considered as bad citizens, like Inkotanyi, and they were considered as enemies.  The population therefore had to chase out those bad citizens.
Q.	And when you say "the Inkotanyi," are you including the Bagogwe in the Inkotanyi?  Or could you elaborate on that point, please? 
A.	First, let me explain.  The Bagogwes are Tutsis; Bagogwe because of where they were from, in the north of Rwanda.  That's where they lived.  That name was given to them.  For example, the people in Kigali are called the city dwellers.  The Bagogwes were Tutsis.  They were called Bagogwe because of the place where they lived. 

Now, regarding the word "Inkotanyi," you could hear about Inkotanyi and it was understood as Tutsis who had attacked the country.  Within them, there were Tutsis living within the country and some without, outside the country.  They were supporting the RPF, who was on the war front.  Consequently, Inkotanyis were also Tutsis. 

You add to that group other Hutus, not many of them however, who were opposed to the government, Hutus who were married to Tutsis women.  It was said that they had been changed.  They had changed political views because of their wives.  And for that reason, they were also considered as Inkotanyis.
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, with respect to the civil defence that you referred to earlier, who was to be targeted by the civil defence? 
MR. ROACH:
Just one moment, please.  Just one moment, please.  One moment, please.  My friend is asking an improper question:  Who is to be targeted by?  That's a leading question.  So I object to that question.  Of course, if my friend asks the question, who is to be defended by the defence, the word is "defence" and that's -- that would be understandable but "targeted" is a word that has some suggestion of being one that provokes an answer that my friend wants. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me rephrase the question. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did the civil defence target any particular group of people? 
MR. ROACH:
Same problem.  The problem is the same.  My friend has not rephrased his question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you rephrase your question, without mentioning anything about targeting, Counsel? 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that a force was going to be created after this meeting in Mukingo. 
A.	Yes.  When they spoke about the civil defence, they said that they came together and they had come to talk to us about the civil defence.  It was the question of implementing a regional army which was going to be called the Virunga Force Amahindure.
Q.	Who said is that?  Because you keep mentioning the authorities.  I would like you to be a bit more specific.  Tell us exactly who was saying what in regard to this regional army.
A.	All of those authorities that I mentioned.  For example, Nzabagerageza, Ntibitura, the colonel, Nzirorera, Colonel Bizimungu, military authorities and others.  I can't remember all of their names but there were many of them.  At that time they told us that they had gathered and they wanted to implement some kind of defence system by using a regional army, so they implemented Virunga Force Amahindure. 
Q.	How was that organised? 
A.	After explaining to us what the civil defence was, they told us that they had to train those people, and that force was going to receive military supplies and ammunition and rifles, clothing, and they said that with no delay we would undergo training.  All of those authorities promised us supplies.  No state funds.  They said, "We will give you weapons, ammunition."  Others said, "We will give you military training."  And that's what happened.  It was translated into reality. 
Q.	Did you participate in this training? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	For how long? 
A.	I underwent that training for three months.
Q.	Where did this training take place? 
A.	Some of the training was given at Mukamira military camp.  Other was given at the communal office in Mukingo.
Q.	Who were the instructors?
A.	Young people who had left the army, a warrant officer Karorera, the chief warrant officer from Mukamira.  There was also Gervais Musafiri, a former soldier; Sabindowera (phonetic), who had left the army.  There was François, who was also an instructor, Biminyimana (phonetic).
Q.	With respect to François, would you tell us his last name, please? 
A.	It was Sergeant Dusabimana, François.  He was better known as "Dusabe."  He was Nzirorera's younger brother.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, some of the names are well known.  Others are not.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to ask the witness to spell some of those names. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to take you back through the names of the instructors that you just mentioned.  With respect to the person you identified as Karorero, could you please spell his name, please, and tell us what his role in the training was?
A.	It's Chief Warrant Officer Karorero, he was in charge of all of the training.  Karorero is spelt 
K-A-R-O-R-E-R-O, Karorero.
Q.	You mentioned a certain Musafiri.  Can you tell us a bit more about him and spell his name as well?
A.	Musafiri was a soldier.  His name is spelt M-U-S-A-F-I-R-I; first name Gervais.  He gave training as well, just like the other instructors did.
Q.	You mentioned a certain Dusabe.  Can you tell us a bit more about him and spell his name, please? 
A.	It's Sergeant François Dusabimana, his last name is spelt D-U-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A; first name, François. He, too, gave training.  He was -- gave courses.  He was an instructor.
Q.	Tell us the types of things they trained you to do. 
A.	We were taught how to dismantle a rifle, how to put it back together.  We were taught weapons handling, shooting exercises.  We were trained in close combat without weapons.  We did physical training.  We learned camouflage techniques, military tactics, how to hide from the enemy, different positions when shooting, if you're lying down, shooting in different positions, all kinds of techniques that regular soldiers in the military learn.  We learned all of those.
Q.	Did Juvénal Kajelijeli participate in any of the training? 
A.	No.  He did not give any courses.  He was not a soldier.  But he did come to talk with us and repeat to us how the Tutsis were bad.  He spoke of old or ancient history, and he reminded us of the history of the country when the Hutus and Tutsis lived together, how the Tutsis had colonised the Hutus in the feudal era.  He told us how the enemy was bad.
Q.	When he used the word "enemy," who did you understand that to be?
A.	In our minds, the enemy was the Tutsi and Inkotanyi, people who were attacking the country, and anyone who would support them in their assault of the country.
Q.	How many other persons were being trained when you participated in the training? 
A.	There were many.  More than 600 from Nkuli/Mukingo.  I can't give you tell you how many exactly but there were many.
Q.	How do you distinguish between the Amahindure and the Interahamwe?  Can you tell us what the relationship was between those two?
A.	There is no difference between Amahindure and Interahamwe.  However, Amahindure is a group, a big group, which gathers all the Impuzamugambi, the Interahamwe.  They had to be integrated into that group, into one single force.  It was a way to give us training.  In fact, there were Interahamwe throughout the country.  We had the same label.  But you had to distinguish people from Mukingo, Nkuli, and the others.  You had to be able to distinguish the Interahamwe from Kigali, from Ruhengeri, and we were called the Force Amahindure.  Like there were ninjas in Kigali, but we were called Amahindure Virunga Force.  But within that there were Impuzamugambi and Interahamwe from Nkuli, for example.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, when you say "Impuzamugambi," what are you referring to?
A.	The Impuzamugambi is the youth wing affiliated to the CDR party.
Q.	What was the relationship of your training as the Amahindure and the MRND party? 
A.	The relationship between the two was the following.  All of the Interahamwe, as you understand, underwent training within the Amahindure.  All the Impuzamugambi also were within the Amahindure.  In fact, it was a way to put together all of the Impuzamugambi and the Interahamwe together in one force, to create a strong force.  The visible relationship is that after the training, some groups received many -- much clothing, as Habyarimana said.
Q.	What type of clothing?
A.	We saw people receive Interahamwe uniforms.
Q.	Were these the same types?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel repeat his question, asks the Kinyarwanda booth or the witness.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Were these the same types of clothing that you received back in August of 1992?  Were they the same or was it different? 
A.	Yes.  The Interahamwe had the kitenge uniform.  It's the same uniform throughout the country.  In 1992, we received shirts and even trousers -- or this time around, we received trousers.
Q.	Did you receive any weapons during that period? 
A.	At that time, some did receive weapons, but not immediately after the training.  A few -- a time after the training, arms were distributed.  Some were from Nzirorera's house.  Some were from the camp where the training had been given.  Other weapons were distributed in front of the Mukingo communal office where the soldiers were.  In fact, the weapons came from several different places, but everybody in the end did have a weapon.  Well, almost everyone.
Q.	Did you personally receive a weapon? 
A.	Yes.  We went to Nzirorera's mother's house, Nsabimana gave us two Kalashnikovs.  Nzirorera's younger brother had a Kalashnikov.  Dusabe had a Kalashnikov and a pistol.  ********************* ****************************************************************************************************************.
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera present at the time that you received your weapon? 
A.	***********************************************************************************.
Q.	Based on your observations, did Joseph Nzirorera have anything to do with the delivery of those weapons? 
A.	Yes.  They had promised to give us weapons.  Dusabe was a young man.  He had no money to buy weapons.  He wasn't a military camp commander.  So he couldn't bring weapons out.  Those people had accepted to supply us with weapons.  So the weapons that we picked up from his mother's house were put there by him, or he knows how they got there.
Q.	Were weapons kept in any other locations in Mukingo? 
A.	I said that in Ruhehe hill there was a military position which protected Mukingo.  It's Ruhehe commune.  Some people receive weapons there.  Mukamira camp, where people received training, weapons were also distributed there.  Other people had weapons.  Baheza, Esdras, his son, he had weapons.  And those weapons were in their father's house, which means that he received them from Baheza.
Q.	Can you tell us what, if anything, happened to the Bagogwe in the early part of 1993? 
A.	As I explained before, in 1993, the Bagogwe continued to be pursued, especially after the attack on Ruhengeri.  Some of them were killed, taken by soldiers.  Others were killed by us.  There was a Gasahani, Kabango, Kadereva, a certain Sabini and Biniga; all of these people were killed.  Others fled and sought refuge in Muvano (phonetic).  Others tried to flee to Congo.  Others went to live in Kigali.  They were visibly pursued, and this is well known.
Q.	Was there any relationship between the training that you received and the persons with whom you were trained and the attacks on the Bagogwe? 
A.	You have to understand attacking Bagogwe in the context.  They were enemies.  We were asked to fight the enemy, so we attacked them as enemies.
Q.	How did you attack them?  Tell us what you did. 
A.	We went at night where they were.  It was at about 6 p.m., maybe 6:30 or seven.  Gasahani, Kadereva and Kabango were in their homes.  The others ran.  We stopped them.  We handed them over to the communal authorities.  But it was an order that was given.  When you handed someone over to the communal authorities, you had to bring him away.  We couldn't -- we either had to kill them ourselves or bring them to the community authorities.  But we gave them over to the communal authorities and they were brought away.  Regarding Biniga and Sabini, we took them on a Thursday or Friday, I don't remember the month.  They lived in Gataraga and not in Busogo.  They were supported by -- they were handed over to military authorities.  On that Saturday, they were taken from the communal office to be killed.  They tried to resist, and they were in a vehicle being transported.  They were brought out of the vehicle and they were handed over to the Interahamwe, who took them.  And Sabini was killed with a spear.  He tried to resist.  He was hit with clubs.  And they were shot upon and they died. 

When these Bagogwes were found -- were killed, you had to bury them in a ditch.  You couldn't do it publicly.  It wasn't known by everyone.  You would put them in a grave close to Virunga.
Q.	All right.  Now, Mr. Witness, you said you had received orders to do this.  Who was giving you these orders? 
A.	When we attacked those Bagogwes, after the training we had received, we had already received our uniforms.  And the meetings were always at Nzirorera's.  They said that all the people we suspected, all those people with education, the Tutsis, it's because of them that Ruhengeri was attacked.  Funds had to be -- were collected and given to the Inkotanyi, and we understood the directors of the schools and the teachers were targeted.  An assistant got away from us.  There was a director Megasahani (phonetic).  He was educated.  Kabango.  We took them away.  Sabini was also a teacher.  They lived in Gataka (phonetic).  We began with those people because they said, "Look at such and such a person." 

The meeting had taken place in Kajelijeli's (as translated) mother's house.  There was the responsable of the cellule; Kajelijeli, Ndisetse, Niyoyita, the chairman of the MRND, President Bambonye of the CDR, Baheza.  Baheza, Kajelijeli, Nyabusore were advisers to Nzirorera and they always consulted with him and told him what to be done.  So we attacked all of those people upon the orders of those people.  We couldn't do anything without the orders being given.  And we always had to give a report of what we had done.  Even if he wasn't present we could transmit the report to him, and we would get compensation.  We would be given money with which we could buy beer. 
Q.	Witness, during the period of these attacks, did you ever -- was -- did you ever have a conversation with Joseph Nzirorera himself while these attacks were ongoing? 
A.	I was with other people and they spoke to us, just like we are doing now.  I see before me someone who is speaking to me.  It was the same way.
Q.	Can you remember any specific instances when Nzirorera himself was present while these attacks were being discussed? 
A.	Before the attack, we did speak.  We were asked to pursue people, to chase them down.  I also can say that when Nzirorera was not present, we made proposals to Kajelijeli.  And each time he would come back, he asked us if we did what we had to do.  He asked us if there wasn't any other people that we suspected who could -- who we could attack.  And he asked if we had any concerns or complaints, if we had enough people in our team, et cetera.
Q.	Well, Witness, you referred to "we."  I'd like you to tell us the names of some of the other members of your group. 
A.	We were many in number, but I can mention some names.  There were the main ones,  especially Michel Niyigaba.  He was also in the leadership of our group.  There was Sergeant Dusabimana, François.  He was always included in the missions.  There was also Noel Ndayisabye.  I can mention Kizirungu, Epimarc (phonetic).  There was Barebereho, Théoneste.  There was one 
Rumazimisi, Bakari (phonetic).  There was one Ruyihandagaza (phonetic).  There was 
Jean-Damascène Habimana, who was known generally as Bagabo.  Then there was Hakizimana and one who was known as the director.  And then there was Kagoli (phonetic) and Gatama.  Then there was Théoneste Mwambutsa.  There is Nteziyaremye, Rugumire.  There was Abdul Karim Gato.  Then there was Saidi Gakuru.  There was Phocas Nikwigize (phonetic).  Then there was Gaston Kamanzi and many others.  There were many.  I cannot remember everyone by name, but as and when I recall names, I shall mention them.  There was Kinamba, whom I had forgotten to mention.  There was one girl who was nicknamed CDR.  And many others.
Q.	The names that you have just given us, are these names of Interahamwe or did they have another affiliation? 
A.	Well, these were Interahamwe.  We were often together, when we would go to that place.  When Nzirorera wanted to speak with many people, we would go there in our capacity as important persons in the group.  Niyigaba was always there or Dusabe.  All the persons that I mentioned were Interahamwe.  They were present in all the operations.  We were always together.
Q.	And whether you say "go to that place," what place are you referring to? 
A.	It was the residence of Nzirorera's mother.  Each time Nzirorera came, we were close by or we would look for one another and we would go there.  We would ensure that when he came out of the house, he would find us assembled there as his men.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want to direct your attention to April of 1994.  Can you tell us if you recall the date on which President Habyarimana died? 
A.	He died in the night of the 6th, and the following day was the 7th of April 1994.
Q.	Can you tell us when you became aware of this -- of Habyarimana's death?
A.	We were in bed at night, and when we listened to the radio at around eleven that night, we realised that the radio broadcasts were being continued, and then we heard an announcement which said that the president and his entourage had been killed, or were dead.
Q.	Did there come a time when you left your house that night?
A.	No.  I did not leave my house that night.  I left my house very early the next morning, between 5:30 and 6 a.m., when I was going to the marketplace.
Q.	Tell us what happened at that time, please. 
A.	On that day of 7th April, many Tutsis were killed, many Tutsis were killed.
Q.	Tell us exactly what happened --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to Counsel, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Tell us what happened when you arrived at the marketplace on the morning of the 7th of April.  We will go through it step by step, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Personally, when I went to the marketplace in the morning, I went to a restaurant in order to have a cup of tea.  That's where I normally took my tea.  So when I reached there, I met with my other Interahamwe colleagues.  We discussed the death of President Habyarimana.  We were all very disquieted.  We took our tea, and after that, I saw Michel Niyigaba, who was looking for us.  He told us that we were being looked for.  *******************************************.  We went there and we went to Nzirorera's mother's house, where I found Kajelijeli, Nyabusore and Esdras Baheza and someone known as Nyiramakuba.  They were there and they also were sad.  They told us that Nzirorera spoke to them on the telephone, and they told us that we needed to avenge the death of Habyarimana, come what may. 

We went to look for our colleagues so that we could carry out the tasks which we had been assigned.  But before doing so, we went through Byangabo, Byangabo centre, and Michel said that our colleagues needed to come so that we could go and kill the Tutsis.  He threatened those people so that they could come with us.  Nzirorera's mother followed us and she took back the pistol, because there was a problem with that pistol, because Nzirorera's nephew had shot at a child some days earlier.  That is how Nzirorera's younger brother Dusabe came with that pistol, and Nzirorera's mother did not want him to take that pistol.  So the old lady took the pistol, and then people hesitated as to whether they should go and kill or not.  ***************************************************************** *************************************************.  This is how we looked for a Tutsi who was about 50 metres away.  Dusabe took -- brought him, as he dragged him, and Dusabe and another Interahamwe killed him, to give us an example; in other words, that we should start killing.  That is how we went to a predominantly Tutsi area because Dusabe had told us, "Come, we are going to kill the Tutsis."  So we went up with him.  After Rukara's death, when we reached where he was living, there was his older brother, known as Lucien Rusirare (phonetic), whom we also killed.  So we went to the area which was predominantly inhabited by Tutsis.  We threw grenades and we struck them with clubs.  On that same day, many people were killed.  Children, adults, old women, old men were killed.  So, in brief, we caused devastation throughout the region on that day.
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, we are going to go over that portion of your testimony again but I'm going to ask you to give your answer in smaller bits.  I'd like you to be as expansive and as detailed as you have been, but let's take it a little bit at a time, please. 

You mentioned that there was an area inhabited predominantly by Tutsi.  With respect to that area, were those people always living there?
A.	Yes.  These Tutsis lived -- had lived in that area for a long time, but some of them, like the men, had been killed in the year 1993.  The survivors were those who were killed on that day.  They were killed about 600 metres from the asphalt road, in the direction of the Busogo parish.  That's where they lived.
Q.	Would you be able to estimate how many Tutsi were living in that area before April 6th?  I'm talking about before the attacks of April 6th.  If you're able to. 
A.	Before our attack, the Tutsis who were living in that area were between 300 and 400 Tutsis in number.
Q.	And with respect to Mukingo commune, would you have any idea of how many Tutsis lived in Mukingo up until around April of 1994?  If you know. 
A.	I do not know the figure very well, because I did not carry out any census, but I can say that close by my home, there lived about 300 Tutsis.  Those who perished at the Busogo parish were also very many in number.  They were between 300 and 400 people.  As for those who lived here and there in the neighbourhood, I cannot know their numbers.  But in any case, there were many.  I would estimate their number at maybe 500 or so people.
Q.	Can you tell us how these -- how the attacks were organised that day?  I'm talking about the 7th of April. 
A.	In the morning of the 7th of April, we were somewhat surprised.  We didn't know that President Habyarimana was to die.  We did not believe that the Inkotanyi were going to kill him.  So on the 7th of April, the authorities decided, and we were somewhat surprised.  When we organised the attacks, one group went to the Busogo parish, where about 300 Tutsis lived.  And another group of attackers went to that parish, and another group went to the home of one Muhinda (phonetic), about 300 metres down the road.  This group which went to Muhinda's house -- so there was a group which went to Muhinda's house and then there was another which went to Rudatinya's house.  When we finished our work, those who were at Muhinda's house went up to join the group which was at Rudatinya's house and helped the second group.  At the end of our work, we all went up to another area in which other Tutsis lived.
Q.	Prior to the 7th of April, prior to that morning, had there ever been any discussion of attacking the Tutsis at your meetings at Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	When we were at Nzirorera's house, we were given orders to avenge the death of President Habyarimana because we were told that Nzirorera had telephoned.  Those were the orders we received.  As for the organisation of the attacks, generally speaking, when the group as a whole came together, those who first arrived were sent to one place and the second group was sent to another place.  Let's say 20 people, five of whom would be carrying weapons, would go to one place, and another group would go somewhere else.  It's quite simple.  The only thing is that other Interahamwe came later.
Q.	Okay.  But Mr. Witness, I'm asking you of discussions prior to the 7th of April.  I'm not talking about the 7th of April now.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Counsel, could you please repeat that question? 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Before April 7th, before April 7th, was there any ever -- was there ever any discussion during your meetings at Nzirorera's mother's house where you had discussed anything in relation to attacks against the Tutsi in Mukingo?
A.	Before the 7th of April, we would have the attacks which I spoke about against the Bagogwe, but that was not public because there were other parties who would denounce us.  But we would carry out our activities or we would take people, but this was done in secret.  But after the 7th of April -- or, rather, as of the 7th of April, we were carrying out our activities in the open, publicly.  We didn't have to hide because we were saying that we must avenge the death of the president of the republic, Habyarimana.  But the two activities were similar in that we went looking for Tutsis.
Q.	Had there ever been any discussion prior to the 7th of April, prior to Habyarimana's death, of your group, the Interahamwe, attacking the Tutsi in Mukingo?
MR. ROACH:
One moment, please.  The question was asked and answered. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You had already asked that question, Counsel. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, prior to April 7th, when you would meet with the other Interahamwe at Nzirorera's mother's house, was there any ever discussion -- was there ever any discussion of the war starting again?  
A.	What one spoke about during those meetings in regard to the war -- maybe, no, no, we didn't speak about the war on the 7th of April because we were not informed about that.  What we were told is that at any moment, since the Inkotanyi were wily and cunning, if we were not vigilant, it may so happen that the Inkotanyi had infiltrated one region or another.  Because after a moment, maybe one year or some months, the Inkotanyi would attack.  Therefore, it was necessary for us to be alert so that the Inkotanyi were defeated.  So we needed to be vigilant.  But now, as for the 7th, we were not informed that the president was going to die on the 7th of April.  What we knew was that after the second attack on Ruhengeri, Tutsis -- no one amongst the Tutsis was to be spared.  That's what we were told.  We were told that if Ruhengeri was attacked and it was taken, it would mean that there were Tutsi accomplices.  Therefore, it was necessary to eliminate all the Tutsis.  And that's why they set up a regional army, so that at the time Ruhengeri were to be attacked, this force would be able to protect the population and one would be able to monitor closely the activities of the Tutsis and accomplices so that the area of Ruhengeri was not attacked by the Inkotanyi.  We were so surprised when we thought that the FAR was a large army, but overnight, the Ruhengeri town was taken by the Inkotanyi and that was surprising.  So we were to be vigilant and watch all the Tutsis in our area closely.  We needed to follow them, the activities, closely, and we would need to denounce them, and as we did so, their numbers would go down.
Q.	The attacks that took place, the attacks that you participated -- you participated in these attacks on the 7th of April.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	Yes.  I did participate.
Q.	Who was targeted in your attacks, the attacks that you participated in? 
A.	At that point in time, all Tutsis, from infants to old men, were attacked, and the Tutsis were the first in the line of target, from infants born that day until -- up until the old men, including old men.  The only thing is that they had to be Tutsi.
Q.	Were you given instructions to that effect?
A.	Yes.  I've said so.  I've said so earlier.  We were told that we needed to avenge the death of the president and that no Tutsi should be spared.  And even François Dusabimana, Nzirorera's younger brother, did not speak in veiled terms.  He said, "Come, let's go and kill the Tutsi."  He was the one in charge of the operation, and when we constituted the Amahindure Force, he was the one in charge of the operations.  He told us what to do.  He was the one in charge.
Q.	Did the attacks continue after April 7th? 
A.	Yes.  The attacks continued.  On the 8th we launched an attack on Nkuli.  After having attacked Mukingo, we went on to attack Nkuli.  After the 8th, and the 11th, there were other people who were killed.  They had been taken away by Colonel Bizimungu, and they were four in number.  There were other people who died at the Court of Appeal.  The Mukingo Interahamwe played a role in this.  They were helped by the Interahamwe, the CDR members, and Kigombe commune population.  People were killed, even at roadblocks which had been erected.  There were three roadblocks that we set up in Mukingo.  There was done by the Interahamwe.  They were not only three roadblocks in Mukingo. 
MR. ROACH:
Just a moment, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel? 
MR. ROACH:
This is not so much an objection but some clarification here.  The witness is describing a general situation, and we should like this to be related to what he saw and what he did.  Unless my friend sets the foundation that indicates that this is the witness's own sensible knowledge, what he saw and what he did, it is not proper to have the witness go into a generalised situation. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I'll clarify that on the record, Your Honour. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you to give your responses in very short doses.  So if I ask you a question, respond specifically to that question, and then I'll ask you a follow-up question and we move forward like that.  Okay. 

Directing your attention to the 8th of April, did you participate in any attacks, any further attacks, on the 8th of April? 
A.	Yes.  I participated in an attack on Musumba secteur in Nkuli commune.
Q.	Who was attacked in that place?
A.	It was the Tutsis who had survived the killings on the 7th.  So it was the few survivors of the attack on the 7th of April.
Q.	Did anyone direct you to commence those attacks? 
A.	On the 7th, in the evening of that day, we received instructions from Baheza and Kajelijeli, according to which there were Tutsis who had survived in Nkuli and that we needed to go and support the attackers in Nkuli and we needed to go there and kill them.  So on the 7th, we went to that area on board nine vehicles which we had taken from here and there.  Baheza provided the fuel.  So we left at night.  It was far, far away.  We thought that it was not a good idea to go and carry out the attacks at night, because if they were ever to resist and use spears, at that point we were unable to do anything on the 7th.  So in the morning, on the 8th, we went to go and kill those people.  So I'm referring to the morning of the 8th.  But the orders had been given or issued on the 7th.
Q.	Who gave the orders on the 7th?  That was my question. 
A.	It was Kajelijeli and Baheza.
Q.	Did you get any further instructions on the 8th itself? 
A.	No.  There were no other further instructions.  We went to finish the work which we had not completed the day before.
Q.	Do you know if there was any communication between the authorities in Mukingo and Nzirorera on the 7th or on the 8th? 
A.	What I know is that on the morning of the 7th, I was told that people had spoken with Nzirorera by telephone, and Michel Niyigaba furthermore told me that he himself had spoken with Nzirorera and obviously by telephone and that the latter had asked him not to have anyone spared.
Q.	Was there any further communication between Nzirorera and the authorities in Mukingo that you are aware of, after the 7th of April, going on to the next day?  Let's think only of the 8th and the 9th. 
A.	No.  I don't know anything about that.  If later on they communicated, I don't know, because at a certain point in time, telephone lines were cut down in Mukingo commune.  I don't know whether that happened throughout the country.  What I know is that the instructions received were given on the 7th, concerning activities which were carried out on the 7th and on the 8th.  But I also know that Kajelijeli and Baheza would give reports to Nzirorera on what had happened.
Q.	How do you know that? 
A.	I know that because they themselves would say, "Nzirorera said this to us, Nzirorera told us such and such."  And then Michel Niyigaba assured me that he himself had spoken with Nzirorera.  He had a telephone in his house and there was a telephone at Isaiah Nyabusore's house, and each time they were saying that they were going to phone him and they would communicate.  Their numbers were very well known.  They were not secret numbers.
Q.	Okay.  You just said that Kajelijeli told you that Nzirorera said this or that.  But I'd like you to be a bit more specific.  Tell us what Kajelijeli told you that Nzirorera said, if you remember. 
A.	To begin with, on the morning of the 7th, they said that Nzirorera had told them that Habyarimana had to be avenged.  In other words killing the Tutsis.  Later on, during the attack that we launched on Musumba, they told us that they had talked with Nzirorera and that we needed to continue with our attacks and that no one needed to be spared.  We were told that at Musumba there were people who had resisted and we -- resisted and we needed to go there and to finish them off.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we are drawing your attention to the fact that it is past 1300 hours, and that we need to close this session soon.  So could you come to your -- to the close of your examination for this morning and we will continue tomorrow from nine. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think this is a good place to pause, Your Honour.  I'll start tomorrow and I should be able to complete the direct by the first part of the morning tomorrow. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank the parties.  We are going to adjourn and resume tomorrow at 9 a.m. 

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, do you have something to tell us? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to address one housekeeping matter and it has to do with the exhibits that we'd like to offer tomorrow.  I did display them on the screen during our break.  I don't know how -- whether that was useful for the Defence or not.  What I can do is prepare a list which I can circulate by e-mail this evening and specify where these 11 clips were taken from the six CD-ROMs that were previously disclosed, and I assume that should respond to all of the issues that were raised by the Defence, but I'd like to complete our discussion of that particular issue this afternoon so that we do not have to address it again tomorrow.  So my question to the Defence and to the Court is:  If I provide a list that identifies specifically those portions or where on the six CD-ROMs I have made the extracts for the clips, will that be a satisfactory arrangement for the Defence so that we can start tomorrow without any problems? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, speaking for --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Speaking for myself and Mr. Nzirorera, I think that we will have to look at the entire tapes tonight before we can really give an intelligent answer on whether these clips are satisfactory, but we did seem to be able to review most of the clips during the break.  We still didn't quite finish, but I don't think it's really possible until tomorrow to be definitive on how exactly we wanted to approach the tape. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Diagne?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Madam President, I would also wish to add, because I'm sure you're unaware, but all the CDs are in Kinyarwanda, the six which have been disclosed to us by the Prosecutor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President, to corroborate what has just been told to you, and also to reinforce the conviction that the Chamber may have of our difficulties, we need to inform the Chamber that the work programme of our Kinyarwanda-speaking investigator was denied, and therefore we do not have any person speaking Kinyarwanda during the sessions, and we therefore have no one to help us with documentation in Kinyarwanda. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you want to add something? 
MR. WEBSTER:
For the purposes of clarification, these 11 clips are really being put before the witness for him to identify them.  We are not going into the content of what's being said on all 11 clips.  In terms of the content, we are only going to address ourselves to the very last clip.  For that very last clip, I do have a transcript.  I have it in French, English and Kinyarwanda.  It's an unofficial translation.  It has not come to us from the language section, but it's what was offered in evidence for a previous trial.  It's actually the text for the CD-ROM that had been disclosed to the Defence months ago.  So in terms of the content, all we are going to look at is a bit, the three minute -- I don't even think it's three minutes, actually.  It's less than two minutes of Habyarimana's speech.  But for everything else, we are not going into the content.  We are simply showing it to the witness for him to identify the event, and at a later time, perhaps through another witness, we can go into the content of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech or Bizimungu's speech.  But for tomorrow, it's simply to have this witness identify the event and the tape.  So it's really a very simple exercise, and I'd rather get rid of all of the hiccups now than have to revisit this again tomorrow.  That's the only reason I bring it up.  I've already distributed to the Defence the transcript of that two-minute clip from Habyarimana.  I will do that officially through CMS this afternoon.  I'm going to identify each clip, where it can be found on the six CD-ROMs.  It really is a matter of taking 20 minutes to look at those clips and to see if those clips do any damage to the perception of the event as a whole, if it deforms what went on for the six or seven hours of this meeting, to show 15 minutes of it when you string together 11 clips of around two or three minutes each.  But in any case, that's an issue of weight to be appreciated by the Court.  At this point, we are just trying to admit the item.  The Defence can always admit the six CDs in evidence or the Court can request to have the six CDs admitted in evidence and we can all sit down and watch it for three or four hours, if that's what is required.  I'm really trying to put forward just five or six minutes before the Court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The proposal made by the Prosecutor would seem to us interesting, maybe for the Defence also.  But obviously, if the Defence requires any assistance, for instance, we could place at their disposal a Kinyarwanda interpreter so that they can see all the six CD-ROMs, and afterwards, they will tell us whether they intend to tender the CD-ROMs also.  There you are.  So tomorrow -- well, the Prosecutor will disclose all this information to the Defence and tomorrow we shall resume at nine o'clock as envisaged for that exercise. 

Thank you, and we shall continue with the same witness, I believe.  The session stands adjourned. (Court adjourned at 1315H)
