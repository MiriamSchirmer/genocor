P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open up the proceedings. 
MS. NTILATWA:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Francis Emile Short (sic) and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 22nd May 2006, for continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecution v. Karemera, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  

Please, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I notice that your Prosecution team looks a bit different this morning. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour.  Mr. Morley has returned and is with us this morning but, in other respects, the appearances are the same.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the Defence remains the same.  

Now, with regard to the issues that needed to be clarified, we are in the process of finalising our deliberations on the motion for disclosure of the benefits of the witness, and we expect that that will be delivered during the course of today, probably by the midday luncheon break.  

Now you gentlemen had agreed to give us some information on your discussions on two of the issues; the Serushago statement and the issue of closed sessions.  Is there anything to report?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  First of all, with respect to the issue of closed sessions, I spoke with Mr. Webster and we did agree.  And I will try to state what I understand the agreement is and he can correct me if I am wrong.  But I understand that testimony can be taken from Witness T in open session with the exception of questions concerning his own case in ******** and questions concerning the witness who disclosed to us under Rule 68, who contradict his testimony concerning his own activities in Rwanda.  You may recall that there was a group of 14 witnesses who we were given statements -- ordered by the Trial Chamber to have access to their statements, and then also to be able to interview them.  So that's my understanding, in general, that those would be the parameters of our agreement.  And if that's -- anything else, perhaps Mr. Webster can state it at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As far as the Court was concerned, we felt that -- that the judicial officer, who would be in the proceedings, would be identifying -- given some personal identification.  We thought that should be in closed session.  So we propose the commencement of the testimony in closed session for the purpose of that exercise. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I -- perhaps mister -- I don't know what Mr. Morley's plan is, but normally they have the protected witness information given in closed session also, so perhaps he intends to start his examination in closed session. 
MR. MORLEY:
May it please Your Honours, in respect of T; there is a short section of closed session material which I would invite.  In short, it concerns his personal details, his marriage circumstances, his employment history; a short section on his involvement in the MRND, the reason for it being in closed session is it would identify him if it was in open session, his plea in (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal), his present family circumstances.  The fact that he was -- and I am looking at the moment at the fact that we are in open session -- but his participation in events as they took place from 1991, how he came to be in a position to offer testimony about the details --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I should just remind you that the country is protected information.  The name was mentioned just a minute ago, and I would like to redact it. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  I had not realised that the country was protected information, as to where he is, but certainly other circumstances relating to his family would be.

If I summarise it, there are ten sections relating to his circumstances, which I would invite in closed session.  I anticipate that would be of a duration of about an hour and, thereafter, it would be open session.  And the material which I would propose to elicit from him in closed session is material which will identify him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if -- since what we have agreed to is somewhat in modification of the Trial Chamber's earlier decision by -- I think that it is proper for the Trial Chamber to decide if what we have agreed on is acceptable and can be implemented.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Chamber accepts the arrangements and we agree it should be implemented. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

The next -- there are two disclosure issues; one was mentioned on Friday, and one was discussed over the weekend.  I think your Trial Chamber coordinator was aware of it.  The disclosure issue we discussed on Friday still has not been resolved.  There are four statements of Witness T which were identified in -- were -- reference was made to them in other disclosures which were made, but these particular four have not been disclosed to us and, as I understand it, Mr. Morley is still looking into that and, perhaps, he can give a report on that. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I have been looking for these four PVs.  You may appreciate that, in respect of this witness, there have been a lot of PVs in the other country.  At the moment -- and I looked through a number of disks.  At the moment, I can't find those four PVs.  There was a section of material which was summarised and I had believed that those PVs had been part of that section.  My learned friend, Mr. Robinson, has indicated to me that he may not actually have this summarised section which may be a different problem.  What I would invite is that, as we know that Mr. Robinson's cross-examination is unlikely to start before Friday, because we will not be sitting tomorrow, I am going to try, as Your Honours know, to deal with T with in two days; that would be Monday and Wednesday.  It is my understanding that there is a national holiday elsewhere on Thursday, which means that we won't be sitting with T on Thursday either.  So the material will be found, or I will have an answer as to why we don't have it for tomorrow.  But I cannot find those four PVs amongst very many, at the moment, and I'm a bit puzzled by it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  We will wait on that and get some more information tomorrow.  That is okay.  

If we could just turn to the last problem, which deals with an individual name Joseph Serugendo.  It is our position that Mr. Serugendo has information which is exculpatory to Mr. Nzirorera.  He intersects with Witness T in two very important ways; they were both members of the same national committee, and they were both among the founders of RTLM.  And we believe that the exculpatory information that he possesses is directly relevant to the testimony of Witness T and it should be disclosed to us.  In addition, that's material for the preparation of our Defence under Rule 66(B).  So we have gone back and forth with informal efforts to try to obtain this information and, as I understand, the Prosecution's position, and Mr. Webster can correct me if I am wrong, but is that they don't believe it is exculpatory under Rule 68, and under Rule 66(B), when they reduce Mr. Serugendo's statement to a form in which he has signed an official statement, they would disclose it to us at that point.  And it is our position that whatever information they have obtain from him should be disclosed to us now so it is in time for use with Witness T, otherwise it may be necessary that we ask that Witness T be recalled.  So I'm simply informing the Trial Chamber of that and I'm, again, asking the Prosecution to make the disclosure before Witness T commences.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, on that point, at this stage, we have nothing to disclose.  There is no formal statement from Serugendo.  When we do have one, we will disclose it probably under Rule 66(A).  But, for right now, we have nothing to disclose because nothing has been formalised with him.  But beyond that, Mr. Robinson has already mentioned that he plans on calling this person as a Defence witness.  And if that is the case -- excuse me, and he has also mentioned that he has met the witness and spoken to him and interviewed him.  And if that is the situation, the Prosecutor really is under no obligation to disclose anything.  He has the information that he needs.  He has spoken to the witness.  This witness is coming as a Defence witness, then the Prosecutor has no Rule 66 obligations where his statement is concerned.  So as a practical matter, we have nothing to disclose because there is nothing that has been finalised but, beyond that, Mr. Robinson has already stated to me, at least -- or, at least, in email correspondence that he has met with the witness, so I don't see it as an issue that we have to address at this time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I can just reply to that.  I think also this is a question of law that has now been raised.  Two things:  First of all, I think the Prosecution, when they receive information from an individual which is exculpatory or material to the Defence, they are obligated to provide it, even if it is only received in oral form and not reduced to a written statement, otherwise the Prosecutor could avoid disclosure obligations by not reducing to writing information they received from witnesses that is either exculpatory or material to the Defence.  So the fact that he has not yet signed a formal statement -- I don't believe it relieves the Prosecution of communicating to us information they received from Mr. Serugendo.  

Secondly, I did meet with Mr. Serugendo before he was arrested and got a lot of information from him.  And I do intend to call him as a Defence witness.  That in no way relieves the Prosecution of its Rule 68 obligations or its obligations under Rule 66(B), because the fact what Mr. Serugendo tells them is even of more credibility and of more value than what he has told me.  So I'm entitled to information; the fact that I myself have interviewed a witness does not relieve the Prosecution of its disclosure obligations, and I think that -- that this is -- in light of Mr. Webster's response, what I should do right now is make an oral motion for disclosure of Mr. Serugendo's statements, both under Rule 68 and Rule 66(B), because I see that there are issues that appear to be -- ones that the Trial Chamber should be involved in that, we can't resolve -- should resolve and we can't resolve them informally.  

I would state that Mr. Serugendo was present on the 10th of April 1994 when Mr. Nzirorera directed the Interahamwe committee to go around to the secteurs and try to get them to stop the killings.  I can't think of anything more exculpatory than that.  And the fact that this is not recognised as exculpatory evidence, I think, is a huge mistake and a huge misapplication of Rule 68.  So I would ask the Trial Chamber to order, pursuant to Rule 68 and Rule 66(B), that any information obtained from Mr. Serugendo by the Prosecution be provided to the Defence forthwith.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think everything I have said over the last five minutes responds to Mr. Robinson's motion.  I don't think I have anything to add.  As a practical matter, there is no statement.  We have reviewed -- I have reviewed with members of my office that have spoken to him.  My assessment is that the material is not exculpatory to the extent that there is any information that would be helpful to Mr. Robinson.  He already has that information.  He's used his prior conversations with this witness to make his application to this Trial Chamber, so I stand on my previous submission. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We are going to have to just reserve our ruling on this matter, which you will get later today.  

It is now passed 9:30, and I think it is important that we make our video link up now.  So what we are going to do then -- to ask -- we are going to ask our technicians to find out whether the link is in place.  

For the information of the members of the public, we have decided to commence the testimony in closed session because it is the information which is likely to be elicited during the first hour of the video testimony -- is going to be capable of revealing the identity of the witness.  So we are going to go into closed session for the purpose of commencing our video link testimony with this witness.

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness T, it's right, is it not, that you have a document in front of you, which is marked P. 9, which lists members of the national committee for the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, I have the document before me right now. 
Q.	And it's right, is it not, that all those names have a number in front of them?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	I would like to ask you about what you know of the creation of the Interahamwe.  Can you help us with approximately when the youth movement for the MRND was created?  
A.	As far as I can remember, and considering that when I was introduced to that movement, it seems to me that I attended the third meeting.  So, I will situate the setting up of this movement at the beginning of November 1991.  
Q.	Were all the people listed, 1 to 11 on that document, people you came to know, in time?  
A.	It was only number 10 that I did not know at the time.  But I had known all the others; somehow we would have met, somewhere, because when somebody was someone's friend, he automatically became the friend of the other.  So, friendships developed quite easily, particularly since we had the same objectives.  
Q.	Whose idea was the creation of the youth movement? 
A.	Based on what I know, and on what I experienced, and so, there was a certain Mr. Désiré Murenzi, who was the founder and the person who initiated this movement that become -- became the movement known as Interahamwe of the MRND.  

I'm sorry that I mentioned a name in open session, I did not mean to do that.  
Q.	There's no difficulty about mentioning the name of -- there's no difficulty mentioning the name of Murenzi.  Did Murenzi have an association with a football club in Kigali?  
A.	Murenzi was the general manager of PETRORWANDA, and he was a member of a football team, which was not a professional team.  These were just young people from Kigali who came together and played on Sundays.  And, in fact, it was from the members of the people who were part of this team that the movement, Interahamwe, was born.  That is based on what I saw and what I heard.  
Q.	And, for the record, can you remember the name of the football team?  
A.	The team was known as Urazyi (phonetic) (as interpreted). 
MR. MORLEY: 
If Your Honour will just give me a moment.  

I hope this isn't contentious.  I'm going to spell that, because it's come out in pronunciation differently.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Am I right, Witness, in saying that the spelling for the team would be L-O-I-S-I-R-S? 
A.	Yes, Loisirs, in plural, starting with L. 
Q.	Thank you.  From what you know of the development of the movement, and the creation of its committee, how often would the committee meet from November of 1991? 
A.	The committee met every Wednesday as from 5 p.m., and when the committee met, it was actually to direct meetings of all the members of the Interahamwes who were coming to a meeting.  It does not mean that the committee met on its own.  They met to direct, or chair, Interahamwe meetings that held every Wednesday as from 5 p.m. 
Q.	Where did the meetings take place?  
A.	Initially the meetings were held in a building owned by a businessman called -- would you allow me to say his name in open session?  
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	This was a very big businessman in Kigali known as Vedaste Rubangura.  This was where the meetings were taking place initially, that is, when I started attending.  And at one point we met in a room in the ministry of planning, which was not very far away.  And at the end, I believe, as from 1993, the Interahamwes were meeting in the building owned by Mr. Félicien Kabuga in Muhima.  So those were the various venues, or locations of the meetings of the Interahamwes over that period.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, it is the Judge speaking.  I would just like to comment simply that the information which we would not want you to mention in open session relates to information which could reveal your identity.  So, you are permitted, in the course of your testimony, to answer the questions asked quite freely, except so far as information you give would have the capacity of disclosing who you are.  That's the purpose of the protective measures.  I hope you understand that.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I am grateful to Your Honour's assistance.  And perhaps if the witness might be assisted further.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Thank you for telling us where the meetings took place.  What the learned Judge is inviting you to consider is how you phrase that.  Do you understand?  
A.	Yes, I understand.  Maybe I was slightly distracted at one point.  That is why I make the habit of asking whether I can mention such and such a name.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I sense the witness may not fully understand the direction of Your Honour's mind.  Could I have two sentences in closed session, please, so I can point out to him what the difficulty is.  At the moment, if I utter it, I just compound it, because we are in public session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will go into closed session now for a very short time.

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The Vedaste building, did that building have any association with the MRND?  
A.	This businessman had placed a part of his premises at the disposal of the MRND.  And, from what I understand, this was his own contribution to the good functioning of the MRND.  So, there was this part of his building that was placed at the disposal of the MRND, and this included a room in which the Interahamwes met.  And some of the authorities had offices there.  
Q.	When there was a meeting at the ministry of planning, can you remember what party the minister for planning was a member of at that time?  
A.	This was later.  I think at one point, either Mr. Rubangura took over possession of his building again -- I believe there was some refurbishing work to be done there -- and then provisionally we met in a room belonging to the ministry of planning, and that minister was a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	When there was a meeting at some point at premises which were organised by Félicien Kabuga, was he at that point vice-president of the MRND?  
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, but I did not say that Kabuga organised any meetings; I said that the meetings were held in a part a building owned by Mr. Kabuga.  But Mr. Kabuga did not himself organise any meetings.  I believe this was a misunderstanding. 
Q.	It may be my choice of words were (sic) clumsy, and the translation didn't come out clearly.  But, at the time that you refer to Kabuga, at that time, was he a vice-president of the MRND?  
A.	I do not believe so.  I am not aware that Mr. Kabuga has ever occupied that position in the MRND. 
Q.	All right, well, we'll come back to that a little later.  Turning to the beginnings of the Interahamwe, why was the movement created?  
A.	In a nutshell, this movement was created as the youth wing of the MRND party, and its initial objective was to bring new blood into the MRND, to renovate, or restructure this party within the context of the multiparty system.  This was the objective at the time of the creation of the movement, and that is the principle to which I subscribed, and to which my colleagues subscribed.  
Q.	Had any of the other political parties, in the era of multipartyism, which began in 1991, had any of them formed youth movements of their own before the Interahamwe had been formed? 
A.	If you allow me, Counsel, I will give you a very brief background to the creation of the various youth wings of the parties.  

The MDR party was the first to set up its youth wing, which was known as the JDR.  The PSD and the PL parties followed.  They even held rallies long before the new MRND.  And the Interahamwes were set up a long time after the youth wings of the other respective parties. 
Q.	Whose idea was the name "Interahamwe"?  
A.	I will need to explain this.  During the first meetings when Mr. Murenzi and the group, the members of which have their names on this list before me, they deemed it necessary on account of the importance, the growing importance of the movement, with a large membership, they deemed it necessary for the movement to have its own name, on account of its adherence to the MRND objectives.  So, during a meeting, the idea was mooted, "Hey, guys, listen and think about a name which can be given to our movement, so that next week we will compare notes."  

And indeed, that was what was happening, because the following week, in the course of the discussions, a name was proposed by François Karera, and the name was Interahamwes of the MRND.  That idea was mooted and people adopted it.  So, that is how, from that moment on, the youth wing known as Interahamwe got that name.  So, the idea had been mooted a week before, for people to think about it so that the -- during the following meeting it would be discussed.  And it was an idea which was proposed by Mr. François Karera, member of the MRND, which secured the adherence of everybody.  
Q.	And can you help us with approximately when that was?  We understand the youth movement began in November 1991; by when was it that the name Interahamwe had settled on the movement?  
A.	In early December the name Interahamwe was already known amongst members of the population in Kigali.  December 1991. 
Q.	I'd like to discuss now with you the development of the Interahamwe, during a time frame which is between November 1991 and April of 1992.  Can you help us with this:  Did anybody from the MRND attend, to your knowledge, meetings of the -- of the Interahamwe national committee?  
A.	In all the Wednesday meetings which took place in Mr. Rubangura's room, I regularly saw Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Mr. François Karera, and on two occasions I saw Mr. Enoch Ruhigira, who was the president's directeur du cabinet, and he came to encourage the youths to forge ahead along those lines.  Mr. Édouard Karemera worked in the same building; he had an office in the same building, but he was not involved in those Wednesday meetings, at least, not during the period you just described.  
Q.	During that period, November '91 to April 192, what was Karemera's role within the MRND; can you remember?  
A.	Mr. Édouard Karemera was the secretary general, but I think in an active capacity -- in an acting capacity he was working on the amendment of the constitution of the party.  He was an acting secretary general working on the constitution of the MRND.  I think that is what even earned him the nickname Rukusanya (phonetic), which means the coordinator, so to speak.  But this was at the level of the legal status.  
Q.	Ngirumpatse, between November of '91 and April of '92, what was his role within the MRND; can you remember?  
A.	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse was chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture, in January 1992.  I think, if I'm not mistaken, that he maintained the same positions.  But he held those positions concurrently with the position of minister of justice in Sylvestre Nsanzimana's cabinet, up until April 1992.  
Q.	To your knowledge, what role would Ngirumpatse play during meetings of the Interahamwe national committee on Wednesdays?  
A.	In his capacity as MRND chairman for Kigali-ville préfecture, Mr. Ngirumpatse was the one sort of steering the committee -- the youth wing, which was, in the final analysis, the youth wing of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture.  So, he steered that youth wing through the committee, through party information, through appointments which were arranged with the party with Mr. Habyarimana whenever the committee met him.  So, he steered the committee, he supervised the committee.  
Q.	When you say that he supervised the committee, did he offer any specific assistance with regard to any communication by the Interahamwe and the outside world?  
A.	I didn't quite construe your question, sir.  
Q.	Forgive me, that's hardly surprising.  I was thinking about the question myself.  Did Ngirumpatse help the committee with any written material? 
A.	No.  Mr. Ngirumpatse, being the chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville, youth wing working within Kigali-ville, then it was but normal for the chairman to have some supervisory authority.  But there was no printed matter -- correspondence, as it were.  
Q.	All right, it may be my clumsy questioning.  Can you have a look at what is a trial exhibit, D. NZ05.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Assistance of Mr. Lahaie, please.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you have there a letter which is dated the 25th of March of 1992? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I have a two-page letter. 
Q.	On the first of it, this is a letter emanating from the Interahamwe national committee; is that right? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	If we look at the second page, do we see there, among various signatories, the signature of number 9 on what is P. 9, the list of members? 
A.	Right. 
Q.	Do you know who drafted this letter? 
A.	I know very well who drafted this letter.  But, actually, the letter was jointly drafted, save for the fact that, in any drafting exercise, there is someone who coordinates the work after pooling the viewpoints of everybody.  So, it was rather a coordination of a collective work, getting the signatures of everybody who had the opportunity to express his opinion before signing the letter.  
Q.	Who supervised the drafting of this collective work?  
A.	Number 9 coordinated the draft of this letter. 
Q.	Was there any input from any member of the MRND as distinct from the Interahamwe committee?  
A.	I'm sorry, I am having cramps.  
Actually, the idea to draft this letter came from Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Perhaps I need to elaborate and put it in the background of the events and how we came about drafting this letter, because it is also linked to the forming of the Interahamwe and how the Interahamwe evolved against the backdrop of the multiparty era.  So, with your leave, I will give some explanations which will shed more light and be more comprehensive.  
Q.	Yes, please -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
But I turn to Your Honour.  I'm conscious of the fact that the Witness has been assisting us since half past 10, and he's just mentioned that he has cramps.  What I would invite is he gives this answer to explain the background to Ngirumpatse's suggestion that this letter be written, and then if Your Honours are minded to, we might rise five minutes early.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have no objection to doing that, as long as it doesn't interfere with your overall timetable for examination-in-chief.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Not so far, but I'm sure Your Honours are conscious of the fact that I lost an hour this morning.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, please help us with an answer as to what the background to the letter sent by the Interahamwe committee in March of 1992 was?  
A.	Actually, from the very setting up of the Interahamwe, that movement which had placed itself at the disposal of the MRND, which MRND was being wrongly criticised, as far as I see it, by such parties as the MDR, PLD, and PL, which thought that, through that youth wing, the MRND would make a strong showing on the political scene.  After a period during which that party had been sort of sidelined by the new parties, those parties, for any reason whatsoever, would criticise strongly the MRND.  And, of course, the Interahamwe.  

Now, during the sad events which occurred in Bugasera in connection with parties and fighting, Mr. Justin Mugenzi, Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu, on behalf of the MDR, PL, and PSR parties, in conjunction, went public in the highly mediatised (sic) show to criticise the MRND for being behind the acts of violence in Bugasera, I believe in March 1992.  

So, in the face of this situation, which was unjustly tarnishing the youth wings of the MRND, that is, the Interahamwe, Mr. Mathieu asked us to go public, send out a rejoinder to those people, and that was how that idea for drafting such a document was suggested by Mr. Mathieu.  And, as you can see from the content, which is quite clear in itself, we castigated those baseless behaviours, and the content is very clear.  It was against that backdrop that the Interahamwe had to give justifications.  
I even remember that suggestions were made for us to have a debate broadcast over radio in this connection, but Mr. Mugenzi turned it down, Mr. Twagiramungu, Faustin, turned this down, because the committee had suggested that a radio broadcast debate take place, so that we could tell the general public that the Interahamwes were being unjustly tarnished.  That was the backdrop against the conception and publication of this letter.  The idea of which was sponsored by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and we deemed it relevant enough.  
Q.	And, just for clarity, what is it that had happened in Bugasera that the other parties were accusing the Interahamwe of doing?  
A.	In connection with the partisan recruitment drives, various parties very regularly organised their rallies and campaigns here and there; in sub-préfectures, communes, and préfecture headquarters.  The tone of the language used by certain party leaders were such as to stir violence among the various members of the various parties, rather than calming things down.  And, in Bugasera, Tutsis died.  Members of the Tutsi population died.  

And the PL party had actually made an inflammatory statement just before the acts of violence, by accusing a bourgmestre of Nkezenze (phonetic) commune -- if I remember properly, who was a member of the MRND party -- so Mr. Twagiramungu, who was speaking on behalf of the MDR, PL, and PSR parties, organised a press conference and criticised the acts of violence as being coordinated by the MRND and its youth wings.  It was such discourse which was even coordinated by those opposition party leaders, who would say, for instance, "We are going to annihilate the MRND, we are going to suspend its political programme."  So, these were all unfair accusations.  

And, for this event, I think an investigation was conducted at the behest of the ministry of justice at the time, and the findings of the investigation was that the Interahamwe were in no way connected with the acts of violence.  So, following those media statements and press conferences which were organised to tarnish the image of the Interahamwe -- and, by the same token, the MRND -- it was necessary for this document to be prepared.  
Q.	Thank you.  And who was the minister of justice who exonerated the Interahamwe?  
A.	I do not know whether I was properly construed.  But what I said was that at that time the ministry of justice ordered for an investigation to be conducted so as to know who was responsible.  And the conclusion was that the Interahamwe were in no way involved in that.  That must be located somewhere in the archives of the ministry of justice.  
Q.	Maybe the question wasn't clear.  Who was the minister of justice who, on investigation, concluded the Interahamwe were not to blame for Bugasera?  
A.	At that time Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the minister of justice in the Nsanzimana government. 
Q.	Thank you.
  
MR. MORLEY: 
I see we've got up to 1 o'clock anyway, and I hope that's a convenient moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, it is.  

We are going to take our adjournment now for lunch.  

Mr. Witness, I have to inform you that during this or any other adjournment of your testimony, you remain a witness of the Court, and you are not to discuss the case, or your testimony, with anybody during these adjournments.  Have I made myself clear?  
THE WITNESS: 
Absolutely, Counsel. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, thank you very much.  

We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1300H to 1440H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Morley.  We apologise for the ten-minute delay.  We are ready to resume now.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I am adding up the minutes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Beg your pardon?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I am adding up the minutes, because I am putting them in the bank for Friday morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Registrar, could we have the connection, please.  
MS. NTILATWA:  
Trial Chamber III of the International -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no, I was wondering if there was anything you could do to assist with the connection, to make certain we are connected.  
MS. NTILATWA:  
I am sorry, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness T.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good.  Well, your testimony will resume now, and Counsel Morley will continue examining you.  

Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness T, did the Interahamwe begin to wear a uniform, and if so, what was it of?  
A.	I'm sorry, but are we in open session or in closed session?  
Q.	For your assistance, we're now in open session, and it may be that you're a little unfamiliar with the niceties.  After an adjournment, it may be a little disorientating, but we go straight back into the questioning as if there had been no adjournment at all.  So, we're in open session, and I'm now asking you a question about Interahamwe uniforms.  Do you follow?  
A.	Yes, I follow, Counsel.  So, the Interahamwes' uniform was practically, essentially the party colours that any member of the MRND might wear without -- without any particular distinction as regard -- without any particular uniform as regards the Interahamwe.  But, in general the people -- people came to consider anyone a member of the MRND party to be Interahamwe.  

But we are speaking, I am aware, of the youth wing, the specifically-termed Interahamwe, and the uniform worn at times of large rallies of the MRND party would consist of those colours much like the other parties, whose youth wings at the rallies, or other demonstrations, would wear the uniform which consisted of their political party's colours. 
Q.	Between the period November '91 and April '92, at rallies, did the Interahamwe ever carry any forms of weapons? 
A.	At that time, I would rather -- must, rather, say no.  But some type of very low-scale violence existed between youth wings of the various political parties, because there was reciprocal action and reaction, but I can't speak of ostensible bearing of weapons as such.  
Q.	Did there come a time, at any point, when members of the Interahamwe carried traditional weapons? 
A.	In fact, the bearing of traditional weapons in Rwandan culture -- when one goes anywhere, one might very well carry a traditional weapon, because every citizen possesses such weapons, whether -- if he's a Rwandan, whether he be Tutsi, Hutu, or Twa.  But the bearing of weapons, or the use of weapons, traditional weapons, or even firearms, I would say that's after the month of April 1994. 
Q.	Can you describe the growth of the Interahamwe between November '91 and April '92?  Give us some idea as to how it grew, and at what rate.  
A.	After November, when the Interahamwe were created, there was a massive intake each week, incrementally -- I'm speaking of Kigali town, Kigali urban -- so much so that by the end of December-beginning of January 1992, practically the entire city of Kigali, the MRND Interahamwe, are members of MRND who had been systematically intimidated and brutalised as of the inception of the so-called opposition parties, returned in strength.  So much so that, in February and March, the Interahamwe phenomenon was highly visible, and the opposition parties realised that the MRND that they had evicted had come back, rather, and in strength.  So, the MRND was no longer intimidated, as had been the case, in the months of September, October, and November.  

I don't want to invent figures, but let's say at the April congress, the MRND, through the youth wing Interahamwe phenomenon, was highly preponderant, which didn't suit the opposition parties, who, of course, if I were to evaluate the Interahamwes at MRND youth in April, would be more than 60 per cent of the parties present in Kigali.  So, the MRND had recovered, if you'll excuse my use of the words -- had retaken -- had made a glorious comeback -- a very vital comeback. 
Q.	If you could help, though, with approximate figures.  In November '91 when it started, approximately how many Interahamwe were there, and by April of 1992, approximately how many Interahamwe were there?  
A.	Counsel, frankly speaking, no one can really make an inventory of the various youth wings.  All the more so since there was a tendency to assess the parties on the basis of the youth wings and the other membership.  But, if you take the population of Kigali as being about 300,000, I could very easily claim that the Interahamwe youth plus the MRND membership might have reached 180,000 -- 180,000 in all, without any exaggeration, in September 1992, in spite of the recruitment campaigns by the opposition parties that had come upon the political scene. 
Q.	Were there membership cards for the Interahamwe, which began but didn't continue?  
A.	After having adopted the name of Interahamwe (Kinyarwanda spoken), with the climate that prevailed between the opposition parties and the MRND, the idea developed of producing an MRND youth wing card so as not to be infiltrated by other youth wings.  So, cards were produced, but then wasn't more than a hundred cards actually printed, because it was costly, especially in relation to the sources.  I think at the time the card cost 100 francs, 100 Rwandan francs, a photograph would have to be put on it, and in view of the numerous recruits, we realised that it was impossible to go on, and we abandoned that very quickly.  I'm sure that we did not produce more than a hundred membership cards, who (sic) were, moreover, never required to enter or leave any meetings. 
Q.	We know that between November of 1991 and -- no, at the period November '91 to April '92, President Habyarimana was also the president of the MRND.  At any stage in the period of November '91 to April of 1992, was there any recognition on his part of the growth of the Interahamwe?  
A.	In the course of the month of December, at some of our meetings, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse had made an announcement to the effect that the president of the Republic and founding president of the MRND had heard mention of a youth wing that supported the MRND's aims, and signified his readiness to receive a delegation for -- to converse with them.  It was made clear that for such a meeting, one would require a document essentially consisting of an agenda of the matters to be discussed.  So, it was agreed that ten people or so would be chosen from among the Interahamwe, with as much democratic representivity (sic) as possible -- as possible, representing either préfectures or tendencies.  

So a little reflection group was set up that lay down on paper the essential points that the opposition parties held against the MRND.  In other words, we made an inventory of the MRND's weaknesses and its strengths that should be further strengthened, criticism as to the distribution of ministerial portfolios, and shortcomings of public services that the opposition parties used as major arguments.  In view of the strengthening his policy of balance and equilibrium, he would have to make some changes to fully enjoy our support and head for victory at the elections in which all parties would participate.  

That is the document that was prepared, and in the course of the month of December, on a Saturday afternoon -- I think it was 4 p.m. -- the president received the delegation led by Mr. Désiré Murenzi, who I told you was one of the founders, and the document was read and discussed, and the president was highly satisfied and formally undertook to support this youth wing that backed his party, and promised to follow through on the items in the -- on the agenda -- in the agenda, that was -- and the document was given to him, both the original and a copy.  

And I remember that, at that time, many documents were floating around the streets in Kigali; that was the case for a critique prepared by a group in Byumba, a reflection group in Byumba.  And in order not to be charged with indiscretion, both the original and the copy were given to the president of the Republic, to his great satisfaction.  

And, moreover, it is as of that, that we noted a spectacular recruitment among all young people, because of the unwavering support offered by President Habyarimana.

	1500H
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Thank you for that answer.  I hope you'll forgive me if I invite you to consider how long your answers are.  It was very helpful, but you'll recall I simply asked whether President Habyarimana had offered any recognition of the Interahamwe, and it may be that, when we think about it, your answer may have been a little shorter.  Can I tell you that, representing the Prosecution --
A.	I have taken due note, Counsel. 
Q.	-- representing the Prosecution, as I do, I have undertaken, before the Judges, to lead your evidence in two days.  And it may be that there's a lot for you to tell the Judges.  And I would ask you, please, and it is no criticism of you, to concentrate as best you can on the precise meaning of the question, and you may find that your helpful answers will be a little shorter, and we will be able to get through more material more quickly.  Do you follow me?
A.	I can understand you, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, dealing with the meeting in December of 1991 with President Habyarimana, turning to document P. 9, which lists various Interahamwe committee members, can you list by number those you are aware attended that meeting, please?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Counsel, the French interpreters are asking you to repeat.  The first part of the question, that was lost. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Morley, the interpreters are not happy with the way things are going.  I think there are two issues:  One is the issue of speed, and one is the issue of overlap.  There needs to be a pause between the -- between the question and answer.  
MR. MORLEY:
	Your Honour is right.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Turning to document P. 9, there is a list of Interahamwe committee members by number.  Can you list the numbers of those you are aware were present at the meeting with President Habyarimana in December 1991?
A.	Number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 10, 9, number 6 also.  And there are other members, two or three names whose names do not feature on this document, but who were part of that delegation.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, can you help us with this:  After the reception with President Habyarimana, did the Interahamwe begin to extend into the préfecture beyond Kigali, and if so, where, and how were they recruited?  
A.	In January, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse asked the members of the national committee to reflect on the implantation of the Interahamwe movement in other préfectures.  This is how come, at the end of January or early February, I do not remember the exact date.  Three people went to Gisenyi préfecture and went about setting up.  And Interahamwes are MRND youth wing in Gisenyi préfecture.  And the structures were molded under what was happening in Kigali.  
Q.	Thank you.  Looking again at your document, P. 9, can you give us the numbers of the three people from the committee who went to Gisenyi in January 1992?
A.	There is number 1, number 5 and number 9.  
Q.	By April of 1992, had the Interahamwe extended into the other préfecture in Rwanda?
A.	It was rather in Gisenyi that the movement was formally launched.  A former member of the Interahamwe's MRND in Kigali had the idea of going to his place of origin, that is, Ruhango and gradually launched the movement.  But that movement became visible only during the year 1993.  There was another attempt to implement the request of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Towards the end of March, early April, a delegation went to Butare.  A meeting was held there with the students of the national university of Rwanda, and facilitated by a préfectural representative of the MRND; and this person was also a lecturer at the university.  That idea had to be launched within the student community so as to be able to compete with the PSD youth wing, which had a majority in this préfecture.  So right up to April, those were the attempts made to extend the Interahamwe's MRND youth wing to the other regions. 
Q.	What was the number of the committee member who went to Ruhango?
A.	There was no member of the national committee who went to Ruhango to launch that idea.  It was a member of the Kigali Interahamwe who hailed from the Ruhengeri sub-préfecture, and this was the person who returned to that sub-préfecture to launch the movement.  But no member of the national committee actually went to Ruhango for that purpose. 
Q.	Thank you.  Who was the person from the committee who went to Butare, what number, please?
A.	Number 1, number 6, number 8 and number 9.  
Q.	In April 1992, there was an MRND congress.  By that time, had the Interahamwe been formalised by the creation of statutes or regulations, and if not, why not?
A.	As with the MDR party, for example, which had a youth wing that was registered with recognised legal status, we requested Mr. Ngirumpatse to do the same thing.  He promised to do so, but right up until the month of April, we still did not have any statutes.  In fact, we have never had any legal statutes.  The Interahamwe's MRND movement has never had any statutes.  

As to why, there were several answers to that.  People felt that Mr. Ngirumpatse, who during the provocation of the youth wings of the opposition parties, specifically the JDR, that is the youth wing of the MDA -- the MDR, they were remonstrating with the leaders of the MDR.  And if we wanted to avoid the same problem in case of the shortcomings of some of the members of the Interahamwe, as it had happened with other youth wings, but then it was really not a problem for the committee whether we had a statute or not.  In any case, we were under the authority of the MRND, and there was no particular objection to that situation.  But if you ask me why specifically, I will not be in a position to tell you.  Mr. Ngirumpatse did not give us any reasons for that. 
Q.	A small point of detail, the reception that was held by the president in December 1991 was where, please? 
A.	The reception of the Interahamwes by the president of the Republic took the shape of New Year wishes in 1992.  And the reception was held at Rubero L'Horizon restaurant.  This was an establishment owned by the president of the Republic.  
Q.	Turning now to the congress of April 1992, we're going to deal with a period April 1992 to November 1992.  At the congress in April 1992, what happened to Mathieu Ngirumpatse?
A.	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse was elected national secretary-general during that MRND congress.  And this congress officially adopted the new name, that is, the Revolutionary National Movement for Development and Democracy.  So this was a new name for the party.  And people referred to it as the new MRND.  And so it was during that occasion that Mr. Ngirumpatse was elected national secretary of the new MRND.
Q.	But was there an Interahamwe present at that congress, and, if so, did they play any role in the election of Ngirumpatse as general-secretary of the MRND?
A.	Before that congress, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse had invited the provisional national committee to attend that congress as observers.  Most of the members of the provisional national committee, that is, except two or three of them, did attend that congress.  The Interahamwes were praised by the members of the congress who appreciated the activities of the Interahamwe youth wing within the context of the renewal of the party.  During the elections, as per normal, there were conversations and arrangements, and the Interahamwes were campaigning for Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse because they knew that if any initiatives had been implemented it was thanks to Mr.  Ngirumpatse.  So that is the role that they played in the side lines.  And Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the winner by a very narrow margin against Mr. Édouard Karemera.  I had the feeling that it was thanks to the negotiations that were carried on behind closed doors and in the corridors that Mr. Ngirumpatse scored a very narrow victory against Mr. Édouard Karemera for that position.  
Q.	Looking at the list P. 9, can you, from what you're aware, list the numbers of those national committee members who were at that congress, please?
A.	As far as I can remember, only numbers 4 and 5 were not there.  In any case, I do not remember seeing them during that congress.  All the others 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, they were present.  
Q.	Following the congress of April 1992, we know that there was a letter produced by the Interahamwe dated the 27th May 1992 -- 
MR. MORLEY:
	With Mr. Lahaie's assistance please, it is document 5, marked P. 10.  And I wonder if that could be put in front of you, please.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm making an enquiry.  Are you able to retrieve the electronic copies of these exhibits by the P numbers, or do you need to know the tab number in order to retrieve an electronic copy, because, for myself, I have to know the tab number, which I can find, but I didn't know if you're able to find the document without the tab number? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	I can recall -- 
MR. MORLEY:
	For my learned friend's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mister -- 
MR. MORLEY:
	Morely, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Sorry.  It may help if you have numbers.
MR. MORLEY:
	Well, of course.  For my learned friend's assistance, tab 55.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Witness, do you have that letter in front of you?
A.	Yes, I have that document.  
Q.	One can see, on the face of it, that it is signed by numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; is that right?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Is this a document you are familiar with?
A.	Yes, I'm familiar with that document.
Q.	Who drafted it?
A.	I'm not in a position to give you a precise answer, but clearly there's signatories -- one or two of the signatories.  Because according to the procedure, after receiving the directives of Mr. Ngirumpatse, they would have prepared that letter, once again, within the same context that we talked about earlier to protest against the acts perpetrated by the other parties, the other youth wings, or the national committees against the Interahamwes.  But I cannot tell you, like I did before, that the other document was prepared by number 9 or so.  But I cannot tell you anything specific about this one.  However, it was a document that was made public after it had been drafted.  
Q.	And when you say it was created at the direction of Mr. Ngirumpatse, why did he direct its creation?
A.	When you read the content of that letter, which is protesting against the aggression and provocation of the members of the Interahamwe, by a representative of an opposition party, as well as against public acts against the Interahamwe, it would have been obvious that it would be the Interahamwe who were to contact the authorities to complain.  I do not know whether I've answered your question.  
Q.	At what level of violence was there at this point, we're dealing with May of 1992, between members of the Interahamwe and youth groups in other political parties?
A.	Once more, with your permission, I will briefly give you a background which, in fact, was the same.  The opposition parties had organised large demonstrations against the members of the MRND and specifically against the Interahamwe.  On the 8th of January, they attacked their property as well as on the 15th of January.  And the purpose of these activities was to compel President Habyarimana to appoint a prime minister from one of the opposition parties, and this was done, I believe, on the 16th of April 1992.  They assembled under what they referred to as Democratic Forces for Change, and so they had a prime minister appointed from the opposition in a coalition government in which the MRND was also represented.  But within the context of the recruitment of Interahamwe, there was a policy known as Kubohoza.  That was a policy that was publicly known, and this policy was advocated by the prime minister himself who, at the same time, was a representative of the Democratic Forces for Change.  And after that, violence increased exponentially, that is, in relation to what had been happening before the appointment of the prime minister from the opposition parties.  

If we come back to this letter, Mr. Mugenzi, who was the PL, openly attacked the members of the Interahamwe based on that principle, Kubohoza, and he was claiming that he wanted to free them.  And, as you will understand, there was a serious strong reaction from the Interahamwes themselves.  

So, the letter is protesting against the appointment of a prime minister who was an advocate of that same policy; that is why all these correspondences which were not followed up -- were not followed up and, therefore, the violence amongst the youth wings of the various parties continued their acts of violence, each claiming that they had been provoked and were defending themselves.  And they were supported by their various leaders who intervened, with each of the leaders supporting their youth wings.  So it was against this background that this letter was prepared.  

I do not know what the follow-up was, but it seems that the signatories did not expect any effective reaction to that letter.  That is the reason why, at one point, people said they had been left to their own devices and, therefore, they had to resort to self-defence.  That is how I understand it.  There was a cycle of violence, and each group was accusing the other of provoking that violence.  That is what I can say about that, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  The one thing you haven't told us is what the policy of Kubohoza meant.  Please, explain to us what that policy was.
A.	With the consecration of multiparty politics, the opposition party's taking up the languages by the RPF who considered that the members of the MRND are under the yoke of Habyarimana, and the MRND, all those who shared the same point of view as that of the RPF, passed on its message of freeing the Rwandan population still under the yoke of the MRND.  And, in Kinyarwanda, Kubohoza means to help to untie someone who has been tied up against his will.  It's a sort of euphemism, but also, on the face of it, Kubohoza was unfortunately carried out with brutality and against the will of those who were supposedly tied up -- bound up.  So, once more, multiparty politics had got off to a bad start.  It was badly led by the steering committees.  
MR. MORLEY:
	It may be that there's no dispute about this, Your Honours, but distilling that answer -- 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, when you talk about Kubohoza meaning, with some brutality, untying people from the MRND, are you describing there some of the opposition parties would force other people to join them?
A.	Quite.  And that policy was advocated - was, sort of -- treasure the opposition parties among the Democratic Forces for Change had found who, at any given time, finding themselves in the face of the MRND -- in a face-to-face struggle with the MRND, could not overcome it, so resorted to the policy of Kubohoza led by the -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	There's some name that escaped the interpreter - 
THE WITNESS:
-- against the PSD or whichever party was preponderant in one area or another.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think the witness should be invited to repeat this because there was a cut in the transmission and the word escaped us.  Anyhow, he's continuing.  
THE WITNESS:
	-- the Democratic Forces of Change, and violence ensued and developed on the basis of that brutality which went as far as to expropriate and even destroy the property of those who were candidates to be freed for Kubohoza; in other words, the parties were trying to establish themselves, either in their regional fiefdom -- and violence led to violence.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	With the advent of the Kubohoza policy on the part of other parties and the ensuing increase in violence between the Interahamwe and other youth wings, at this point in time, did the Interahamwe begin to carry weapons, whether they're traditional or otherwise?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That is correct.  Hostilities were engaged.  There was open hostility between the youth wings of the various parties, and it is as of that time that the youth wings started to bear arms in the internal combat between the parties, but more particularly between the opposition parties and the Interahamwe -- MRND Interahamwe.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Could the witness be asked to stop moving the papers around next to the microphone?  Or maybe the microphone should be switched off.  Sorry.  
MR. MORLEY:
	I can advise the witness of that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you for that helpful answer.  Whilst you were talking, you were picking up pieces of paper.  And you may like to know that the rustling of the paper sometimes interrupts what you are saying.  So what we'd ask you politely is, if you can, to leave the pieces of paper alone.  Does that make sense? 
A.	Agreed.  I have understood.  
Q.	Turning, please, to tab 48 with Mr. Lahaie's assistance.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Is it already exhibited?  
MR. MORLEY:
	I can't find it amongst the exhibits. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Okay.
MR. MORLEY:
	But I'm sure Mr. Robinson will know all about it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Yes, it is P. 2.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
	Thank you.  I don't know why I couldn't find that as P. 2.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Tab 48, or otherwise P. 2, do you have that document in front of you, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I've got it, but it seems to me that it is the same paper that I had before, or perhaps I'm mistaken.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Yes, excuse me.  
Q.	All right.  If we look at this, it is a press release signed by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and looking at the document, does it concern, basically, the argument with the other parties which have been the subject of the Interahamwe letter of the 27th of May that we looked at a moment ago?
A.	Allow me to look through this a bit and I shall give you an answer forthwith.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Morley, I think we will take our mid-afternoon break at four o'clock.  
MR. MORLEY:
	Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
	Counsel, allow me to ask you to repeat so that I can answer your question very precisely.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	On the face of the document, looking at its contents, it appears to be a complaint about problems created by other political parties towards the Interahamwe.  And if you look at the dates within it, it is referring to events of May in 1992.  The question is simply:  As a press release -- is this press release, signed by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse on behalf of the MRND, similar material as the sort of complaints which had been directed by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse to be written -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Listen to the question -- to be written by the Interahamwe in the letter of the 27th of May.  It is about the same subject or not?
A.	Before answering your question, I had just received the rest of the page that was missing.  I do not see a date on this press communique, but the complaint.  And the Interahamwe, that is, the national committee of the Interahamwe, is a faithful repetition, perhaps more succinct, but the tenor is the same as that in the press communique signed by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, which brings us back to what I was saying.  

Announcements made, or communiqués, or correspondence emanating from the Interahamwe national committee were inspired, maybe not a hundred per cent, but the content, the tenor, the purpose, the aim is the same, so this communiqué, I think, preceded the letter of complaint addressed to the prime minister.  But, in fact, the complaint -- and the press communiqué's a, sort of, balance sheet.  It's a summing up, really, of everything that had happened until the month of May when officially over the radio -- Radio Rwanda, Mr. Mugenzi -- Justin Mugenzi of the PL had, in a public rally in Gikongoro, declared, in fact, the content of the press communiqué in Kinyarwanda, which essentially stated that, henceforth, the parties that were part of the Democratic Forces of Change declared to the Rwandan population that they will postpone their party's programme and, first of all, combat to eradicate the MRND party and its Interahamwe youth wing, which -- moreover, which showed -- translated that identity of opinion, the views with the RPF which in -- in the interior was a programme to destabilise the Interahamwe, which is what is made public hereafter official recognition of the -- those who had driven the violence -- ordered the violence, such as Justin Mugenzi.  

This really sums up the fact that the youth wings were on a war footing through the statement of Mugenzi and the Interahamwe reaction that said, "Well, look here, henceforth, it is our right -- inalienable right to defend ourselves by any means whatsoever."  
Q.	Thank you for that answer, which was quite long.  Now, it's important -- I know how difficult it is to give evidence, and one understands, Mr. Witness, that you have considerable knowledge about political matters in Rwanda in the 1990s.  You may recall the question I asked you was whether the press release was on basically the same subject as the Interahamwe letter of the 27th of May.  And if you think about it, it may be -- and I hope I'm not trespassing, Your Honour, on an inappropriate comment -- but, Mr. Witness, it may be, if you think about, the answer was simply, "yes".  One has to be conscious of the amount of time.  Please try and tailor your answers, notwithstanding the difficulties of giving evidence, to the precise question.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	I will in future be careful about that, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, can we just talk about the RPF for a moment?  It's a matter of record.  Is it not true that on the 1st of October of 1990 there was an RPF incursion into northern Rwanda and that set the scene for a conflict between the RPF and the Rwandan government which went on for about four years?
A.	Yes, I can confirm what you've just said, Counsel. 
Q.	All right.  So, against that background, there being a conflict between the RPF and the Rwandan government, there was the era of the multipartyism and there was the conflict you have described between the youth movements in the different political parties.  What I would like to ask you is, as 1992 progressed, what perception began to emerge -- can you comment -- on the relationship between those who were Tutsi within Rwanda and the insurgent RPF?
A.	Well, in the course of 1992, as hostilities certainly were resumed by the RPF, in spite of the ceasefire, a sort of latent civil war began to develop, and the Tutsi were seen -- at least, some Tutsi who claimed to be members of the PL, were seen to be enemy accomplices.  And the cohabitation between Tutsi and Hutu began to deteriorate and drift into violence such as that which occurred in Bugesera and other parts of Rwanda. 
Q.	Thank you.  But was there an RPF attack in Byumba in June of 1992?
A.	It must have been early June, the 5th or the 6th of June 1992 that the RPF attacked Byumba town, in spite of an agreement that had just been concluded between the Democratic Forces for Change and an RPF representative that had just been signed in Brussels. 
Q.	Now, we've talked about the violence between the parties recorded in the Interahamwe letter of the 27th of May 1992.  We have now an RPF attack on Byumba on the 5th of June of 1992.  What was the reaction amongst the youth groups, including the Interahamwe, toward the Tutsi as the months progressed after the 5th of June 1992?
A.	The Interahamwe's reaction was such was that it was as if the RPF and the Democratic Forces for Change had just provided themselves the proof that they were hand in hand, that they were accomplices.  Whether it be the Tutsi who were in those parties or the Hutu membership, the generalisation -- there was an amalgamation, and that's when they started saying they would come back, the accomplices, as much as the RPF and its allies.  So this is when everything was lumped together against the Tutsi and some of the youth of the MDR started to drift away from Faustin Twagiramungu's orientation.  He did say over the radio that the RPF attack was no problem, in spite of the collateral damage suffered by the population, the displacement of the population.  And Tutsis were then progressively seen, and unjustly in many cases, as the same as the RPF.  
MR. MORLEY:
	I see the time, but can I just -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Sure.  
MR. MORLEY:
	-- as it were, distill that answer, I hope uncontroversially.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	From what you said, are you describing hat there were negotiations in Brussels with the RPF hosted by the MDR prime minister; the MDR prime minister was not particularly trusted by the MRND; there was a perception within the MRND and Interahamwe that, perhaps, the MDR prime minister was too close to the RPF and, consequently, there was a perception that some Tutsi and other members of opposition parties were working together?  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have to object to that question.  Mr. Twagiramungu was not the MDR president, so Mr. Morley is confusing the issue to a point where it's unable for the witness to give a comprehensible answer to that.  
MR. MORLEY:
	All I'm trying to do is to still in a, I hope, short sentence with seven clauses, the perception which emerged after the RPF attack on the 5th of June when at the time there were negotiations taking place in Brussels.  

	Now, my understanding of what the witness said a moment ago at some length, and maybe I'm wrong, but the summary I offered is pretty much what he was trying to say.  If I'm wrong about that then, of course, my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, can complain, but if the only thing I got wrong is whether Mr. Twagiramungu was the president of the MDR at the time, that's perhaps a detail which is not as important as the general picture, which is, there was a growing perception that members of opposition parties were too close to the RPF, that's all.  That is all I'm trying to establish. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	I think the witness had used the phrase "prime minister".  
MR. MORLEY:
	Yes, I thought I had used the phrase "prime minister" and I didn't think I had suggested that Twagiramungu was the president of the MDR.  But it is just - and I'm alive to my learned friend's sensitivities, but the thrust of what I am summarising has got nothing to do with whether Mr. Twagiramungu was the president of the MDR.  It has to do with the growing perception that there was two -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	We've heard both the evidence and your summaries, so I don't think you need to worry too much about it.  
MR. MORLEY:
	Well, I won't worry about it any more.  And Your Honour sees the time.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes. 
MR. MORLEY:
	How much time do I have before we start again?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Well, we always say 15 minutes.  We'd like to try to keep it at that. 
MR. MORLEY:
	Very well.  Twenty past 4:00 then.  Thank you. 
	(Court recessed from 1605H to 1634H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	(Inaudible)
MR. MORLEY:
	With Your Honour's leave, keeping my eye on the clock, I wonder if I might have had another 14 minutes' kitty for Friday?  

	Do we have our link to where the witness is?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	(Microphone not activated)  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, we were talking about a degree of suspicion which arose about some political opposition growing too close to the RPF.  Can I ask you, please, to look at tab 56, document 6, with the assistance of Mr. Lahaie.  

	Witness, do you have the document I have referred to?
A.	Yes, counsel.  
Q.	Do we see here a document dated the 26th of June of 1992 which, on its face, is signed by Mathieu Ngirumpatse as the national secretary of the MRND?  And it is a declaration by the MRND on certain present problems politically within Rwanda.

	Do you agree with the way I've described the document?  

	Witness, there's no need for you to read every line in the document.  Do you agree that it seems to be a document from the MRND signed by Ngirumpatse, dated 26th June 1992, and appears to be a declaration about the political situation in Rwanda? 
A.	I have skimmed through that document and I can see that it gives a summary of the problems that had to be resolved by that government and that the general view was that the government was, instead, preoccupied with other things.  I did not have the time to read all four pages.  I do not know whether you think that is necessary or not. 
Q.	It may not be, Witness.  You see, we have the document.  In time, the Learned Judges will read it carefully to themselves, but all I want to establish is, on the face of it, this is a document which, on the second page, makes references to problems with internal security, at paragraph 1.
A.	Yes, I have that page, counsel.  
Q.	It refers to unhappy events in the second paragraph in Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, Kibuye, Byumba and Mukamira.  Second paragraph, page 2, you should be able to see those references straight away.  

	Witness, I'm puzzled as to how you seem to be lost.  Are you on the second page in the second paragraph which begins "en effet"?
A.	Yes, counsel.  
Q.	And do you agree that it refers to unhappiness in Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, Kibuye, Byumba and Mukamira?
A.	Yes, I've read that paragraph.  
Q.	And then if we look further down the page, under what's called "Section 2", there's reference to the negotiations to restore peace in Rwanda with the RPF.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Excuse me, Mr. President.
THE WITNESS:
	(No interpretation) 
MR. ROBINSON:
	I'm sorry, Witness T, for the interruption.  Mr. President, I just want to interpose an objection here and ask what -- exactly what we're doing because I think this is a waste of time.  If he's just simply asking the witness if he sees something in the text, I think he is critise -- and Mr. Webster criticised me for doing that.  And there doesn't seem to be any point if the exhibit is going to be in evidence to have the witness simply recognise something in the text without there being a follow-up question that there is something within the witness's own knowledge.  

	Secondly, I note that Mr. Morley has spent five days with this witness.  And I don't understand why the witness is now reading documents for the first time in Court, taking all of our time.  This is my own problem that I have with witnesses reading documents, but I feel it is due to the fact that I'm not allowed to meet the witness, but here the witness has been met for five days and he's still reading documents, so I feel like we're wasting time here.  And I want to call that to your attention.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
	Well, the witness is clearly rather cautious.  And my learned friend will see the point of showing the witness the document which Your Honour's can read, in any event, in the next question -- the question after the next question.  You will see the point.  It's no great matter of significance, but it helps to fill in the blanks with regard to the specific involvement of Defendants in this case.  
	If I may, with Your Honour's leave, turn the witness's attention to page 3 of the document, fourth paragraph.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Ngirumpatse writes there about the dangers of the government working too closely with the RPF; that's right, isn't it?
A.	If I have understood your question well, you would like to know whether the government referred to in this document actually did work in collaboration with the RPF.  And if that is the question, then I do confirm because that was the source of all the problems described in the document as well as the security aspects that have been analysed so far.  So I am confirming, if that was your question.  
Q.	I'm grateful for the response, but the question is simply to establish on the record that Ngirumpatse was writing on the 26th of June about a concern about the government being in too close a relationship with the enemy.  Now, we can see that on page 3, fourth paragraph.  I'm simply asking you to confirm that there is that in the document and then I'll ask you another question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Mr. President, I'm going to give you the opportunity to invoke what I believe are correct applications of time standards and that is to sustain an objection when a question is irrelevant.  And he's asking him simply what is contained in the document.  And I think that is an irrelevant question.  I ask you to rule on my objection.  
MR. MORLEY: 
	It is not irrelevant based on the question which follows.  It is simply foundation for the next question.  It's the background to the next question.  On the face of the document, the witness should simply be saying "yes" to each of my questions, and then I will simply ask him about Ngirumpatse's interests and concerns about what was going on in Rwanda.  And it is apparent on the face of the document that he was very well involved in the political events in Rwanda in June of 1992 and concerned about internal security falling apart -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Morley, we've heard enough.  The witness is permitted to answer.  
MR. MORLEY:
	Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Well, perhaps I'll get straight to the question which I want to ask:  We can see what the document says.  On the face of it, Mr. Ngirumpatse is writing about concerns about internal security and about the government being too close to the RPF.  We can see that on the document.  How involved was Mr. Ngirumpatse in political events in 1992 in Rwanda?
A.	The degree of involvement is related to the post of national secretary that was occupied by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And in relation to the party throughout the national territory, this party was, in fact, criticised and the hostilities of the RPF were directed against that party.  So, in my opinion, in his capacity as secretary-general of the party -- and that party actually was represented in the government, so whatever he said had the weight that it deserved.  
Q.	What was the state of relations between the Hutu and the Tutsi come November of 1992, as a general observation, as you observed it, and your knowledge of the development of the Interahamwe?  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Excuse me, Mr. President.  If I could just intervene.  As we've now left this document, I think it's very important that the document be in evidence.  I want to offer it as D. NZ109.  
MR. MORLEY:
	My learned friend is always quick on his feet and I admire him.  I was going to invite the document to be exhibited in a few moments.  And it is intriguing that Mr. Robinson leaps to his feet and takes over the witness and calls the exhibit his own.  It is proposed to go in.  And if it helps him, I'll do it now.  May the document be admitted as a Prosecution exhibit, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes, it is 25, Mr. Issa.  Admitted as P. 25. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 25 admitted) 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	All right.  November -- we know that there were a series of rallies in November 1992.  My first question is:  By November of 1992, there having been a conflict with the RPF since October 1990, the then conflict between the various political parties as to how to proceed, conflict amongst themselves over the Kubohoza policy, what was the general attitude by November of 1992 as you perceived it, as someone who knew about the Interahamwe and about the MRND toward the Tutsi?
A.	Whether it was in October or November, there was a radicalisation that had not been previously seen between the Hutus and the Tutsis and this radicalisation intensified because the Arusha agreements were not being implemented or were not being concluded.  There was a government that was paralysed and who seemed to be collaborating more with the RPF than with the government.  So as the end of the year of 1992 approached, there seemed to be now a complete deterioration of Hutu-Tutsi relationships, and this had been good before, but that relationship deteriorated dramatically towards the end of 1992, early 1993.  That is what I can say was happening in Rwanda during that period.  
Q.	There was a rally in Ruhengeri attended by President Habyarimana and other members of the MRND on the 15th of November of 1992.  Were you there?
A.	Yes, I attended that rally, counsel.  
Q.	Is it right that there were political elections due shortly after November of 1992 and there was interest on the part of the MRND in being elected?
A.	I did not quite understand your question.  Please kindly repeat.  
Q.	I'll come at the question a different way.  We know that President Habyarimana talked at that rally about the Interahamwe.  We have transcripts of what he said.  Can you remember, basically, what President Habyarimana said about his Interahamwe at that rally?
A.	What President Habyarimana said about the Interahamwes and I believe it was during that rally in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November as the potential or automatic candidate of the MRND in the elections that were planned, and this was by virtue of his position as president.  After his election during the congress in 1992, he talked about the youth wing of the MRND, the driving force of the party, and he said that when the time for the campaign for the presidential election came he would surround himself with the youth wing, the Interahamwes with their beautiful uniforms.  And this was a way of saying that the party was proud of that youth wing.  That is the message that I was able to get on that subject. 
	(Pages 41 to 55 by Roxane Meena) 





























	1700H 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Were the Interahamwe in their beautiful uniforms in the presence of the president carrying any forms of weapons?  
A.	No, they were wearing their uniforms, but I do not think that they were carrying weapons while the president was there with them in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	May I just ask of the interpreters what word they are using for the word "weapons" in French, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	In French the witness was using "arm". 
MR. MORLEY:
	I see.  Well, I'm going to come at the question from a different angle then, please.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	In the presence of the president at the rally in November of 1992, did the Interahamwe have any traditional arms with them?  
A.	It is true that the Interahamwe possessed some arms, some traditional arms.  Others had firearms, explosives, but your question was whether they carried them in front of the president in Ruhengeri, in the presence of the president.  Did I correctly understand you?  
Q.	By November of 1992, did the Interahamwe carry arms?  Now I'm conscious of the fact that the word "weapons" has been translated in French into the word "arms", and I'm not sure whether you're interpreting that as meaning firearms.  I'm asking, by 1992, in November, the Interahamwe, were they carrying weapons of any description when they were at rallies?  
A.	In November 1992, the Interahamwe had possessed arms, traditional arms and firearms, but I think the argument is around the word "bore", "to bear" arms that we diverge because what I understand you to mean is whether they were actually bearing these arms in the presence of the president at that rally.  Because at that time they were -- they did possess both traditional and modern arms, if I can express myself like that.  My difficulty, perhaps, is the question as to whether they bore them in the presence of the president at that rally.  Maybe there's a double meaning there in French or whatever.  
Q.	Thank you.  From where did the Interahamwe get their modern arms, and what sort of modern arms are you talking about?  
A.	When I speak of modern arms, it is in relation to traditional Rwandan weapons.  I'm talking about grenades, pistols, revolvers, guns -- I mean, rifles that some Interahamwe bore in the course of incidents of violence with the various youth wings.  So there was another aspect to your question:  Where did they obtain those weapons?  Well, as regards the explosives, the grenades, at that time they were sold in the marketplace.  There were guns.  Some would say they -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	The witness is all broken up.  Sorry, he would have to repeat that.  He's all broken up.  I think maybe he's speaking too loudly or too near the microphone or something.  He'll have to repeat that.  
MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You were telling us before --  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
	We're having serious problems.  The signal is all cut up.  The translation can't -- the one -- one sentence out of two is missing.  I'm following here, and one word out of two is inaudible in the French transcript.  So something must be done to keep the signal steady so that both the interpreters and the court stenographers can transcribe and interpret correctly the totality of what is being said.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes, the English interpreter had just made the identical comment.  And I was just relying on Mr. Morley to communicate it to the witness and to the technicians at the other location.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, we didn't get all of your last answer because there was a problem with the transmission.  Why were grenades available in the marketplace?  
A.	Grenades for sale on the market resulted from the insecurity that we were talking about, and that was mentioned in the document.  There were soldiers -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	-- something, something --
THE WITNESS:
	-- who each carried 10 or 15 grenades, and I'm sure that some of them, the grenades came from soldiers who had deserted.  That is the only explanation I can provide.  And those grenades were for sale, 100 or 200 Rwandan francs, as well as pistols, rifles.  Some people said it was the RPF.  Others said it was the soldiers who, when deserting the front line, sold them on the -- sold it on the local market.  That is specifically what I can tell you about weapons in 1992. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And what sort of traditional weapons would be carried?  Can you please describe those?  
A.	Machetes, spears or lances, bows and arrows, hatchets.  But things you can carry in broad daylight.  That's what I mean by traditional weapons.  I am making a distinction between bearing and possess, that they would bear those weapons in the course of incidents of violence, but they did not bear them in rallies or demonstrations.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Witness is breaking up again.  
THE WITNESS:
	We're coming back to that double meaning of the word "bearing", to bear arms or to possess in general terms.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	All right.  Don't worry yourself about double meanings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Morley, could you find out from the witness whether there is a problem with his distance from the microphone?  
MR. MORLEY:
	I can certainly ask him to come closer to the microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.  
MR. MORLEY:
	I'm just wondering whether that problem referred to by the helpful interpreters is something of what we had a little earlier this morning.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, can you come a little closer to the microphone?  We've lost some of what you've been saying in transmission.  
A.	I've got the microphone now closer to me.  I don't know if you can hear me better.  
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Still on the subject of arms, traditional or modern, you told us that these things would be carried at conflicts.  In the course of 1992, were you aware of whether any of these conflicts in which the Interahamwe were carrying some form of arms led to any deaths?  
A.	In many cases, the gendarmerie or the investigators for the prosecutor reported that there were deaths.  These were bloody skirmishes, not only in Kigali but throughout Rwanda at that time.  Moreover -- but I'm afraid to digress.  At that time, when the democratic forces for change and the RPF signed their agreement in Brussels, it was Whitsuntide.  There were bloody skirmishes, unprecedented in Kigali, where the Interahamwe and the MRND claimed that the RPF had decided to chase the Interahamwe out of Kigali and the Interahamwe resisted by way of self defence.  That is an example of the bloody skirmishes.  And I'd be very surprised if there weren't any deaths on the occasion of that Whitsuntide weekend. 
Q.	Do you know of any Interahamwe being prosecuted for violence or any deaths at any time, whether in 1992 or thereafter? 
A.	In general, the Interahamwe, for the vast majority of them, when they were arrested by the judicial police, there were interventions to have them released, just as -- but to a lesser extent.  The MDR or PSD youth wings, when they were picked up either by the gendarmerie or by the judicial police, the officials of the various political parties would intervene to have the delinquents who had been arrested, if I can use that term "delinquent" -- I don't wish to insult anyone.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	"To have them released", I think was the end of the sentence. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Who was the principal lawyer helping in the MRND, those who were Interahamwe who had been arrested? 
A.	Édouard Karemera, who defended the interests of the MRND.  And I know that he would officially intervene on the party's behalf to have Interahamwe who were picked up, released -- the ones who were picked up in the course of various skirmishes, at any rate, within Kigali.  That's what I can say.  
Q.	The Interahamwe had begun in November of 1991 as a youth movement recruited initially from a football club.  By November 1992, what had this youth movement turned into?  Was it still just a bunch of well-minded youngsters, or how would you describe it?  
A.	My personal analysis, from what I observed, is that in the face of the context and the unfolding of events, the Interahamwe of the MRND progressively slid -- there was a drift and they had completely forgotten their original purpose.  And I think I can say the same for the other youth wings of the parties.  
Q.	But what had they become?  We start as a youth movement; by November of 1992, you've described how some of them possessed traditional weapons, grenades, pistols, rifles.  What sort of organisation was the Interahamwe by November 1992?  
A.	Well, clearly, the movement, after having been taken over by the party, was used in a way contrary to its initial purpose and had become a militia force, and the same can be said of the other party's youth wings.  But that was not the question.  
Q.	No, it wasn't.  And the Interahamwe having become a militia force, at the Ruhengeri rally of 1992, we know, because we have seen a video of that rally and parts of it, there was some dancing and there was also a presentation by the Interahamwe in which someone was chased.  Can you remember the dancing and can you remember a presentation by the Interahamwe in which someone was chased?  
A.	In fact, I did come to understand, and according to my recollection of the Ruhengeri rally, a local animation group, political cheerleading group, local to Ruhengeri, danced in front of Habyarimana a traditional warrior dance, miming chasing of the enemy.  The name of the dance is Urusengo.  Urusengo.  It is typical of an area of Ruhengeri known as Mu Gahunga --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	I think the witness said.
THE WITNESS:
	-- which is an area known for having traditional warriors from time immemorial, and they came to show this traditional warrior's dance to President Habyarimana, the president of the MRND, to show that "We are in tandem with the Rwandan army against the enemy".  That's how I interpreted it and that's how I interpret that dance, Urusengo.  And it may be the Interahamwe joined in with the political cheerleading group, the animation group, to symbolise that chasing of the enemy to his ultimate redoubt. 
MR. MORLEY:
Q.	That's an interesting way of putting it, "the ultimate redoubt".  Well, what do you mean by that, "he chased the enemy to the ultimate redoubt"?  Can you explain in simpler language?  
A.	What I mean by that is that the RPF was in conflict, armed conflict, against Rwanda, against the Rwandan people, against the inhabitants of Rwanda and against the MRND, at the time when they attacked, invaded the country.  So from that traditional dance, it's a mini-theatre, mini piece of theatre, if you like, the answer to the RPF, the accomplices and anyone else that supports them.  
Q.	I don't want to labour the point, but you use the expression "the demonstration was of how -- somebody who was the enemy would be chased to their ultimate redoubt."  Now, it may be that that is a French translation into English which has misconstrued what you meant.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	In French he used the expression "dernier retranchement".
MR. MORLEY:
	Well, that doesn't help me.  I'm afraid I don't know what a "retranchement" is.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Well, it's a large sort of -- trenches.  "Trenches" comes from retranchements.   That's why I translated "ultimate redoubt". 
MR. MORLEY:
	I mean no criticism of the ever-helpful translator, but I'm trying to get the witness to speak in words of one syllable.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What would happen, according to the demonstration, if the Interahamwe caught an enemy?  
A.	In fact, by that dance, that little scene, it clearly means we stand beside the Rwandan army, we are against the enemy, we are not for their -- the enemy's accomplices, whom we must chase, without granting any quarter.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	The witness repeats:  "Jusque son dernier retranchement," "to his ultimate redoubt".  Sorry.  Without -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	The witness adds, "without deviating".  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Well, I mean, there's ways of using language.  If you're giving no quarter to an enemy you chase to their ultimate redoubt, can you say, in one word, what you're going to do to them?  
A.	Well, you bring them down.  I don't understand, actually.  The RPF is at war with Rwanda.  The RPF grants no quarter; they kill, while the Interahamwe are determined to do the same thing to the enemy and its accomplices and anyone who supports the enemy.  I don't think I can be clearer than that.  
Q.	Finally, no.  Who were the accomplices that the Interahamwe would do the same to as the RPF did?  Who were the accomplices of the RPF?  
A.	The RPF accomplices within Rwanda were principally the PL party, which states clearly that it's in favour of the RPF, a faction of the party that supports Mr. Twagiramungu, who's officially stated that he's for the RPF, is seen as the enemy, an accomplice of the enemy as such, some Tutsi who, unfortunately -- well, people lumped things together.  I'm not speaking of all the Tutsi, but some had expressed their support for the RPF.  That was the enemy in question.  

We suspected the enemy, and the enemy came to state its position, mainly Tutsi with the RPF, mainly Tutsi and Hutu who support the PSD and the MDR, and more specifically, from the month of June, after the meeting between the RPF and the democratic forces for change and, of course, once the RPF had resumed hostilities in regions such as Byumba and elsewhere.  
Q.	We know from transcripts of what was said at the rally on the 15th of November in 1992 that number 1 on the list pledged support of the Interahamwe to the president.  And the president referred to descending, during the election campaign, with his Interahamwe.  Can you help us with what the reaction in the country was to the description of descending with the Interahamwe, who you've told us had been increasingly armed with traditional weapons and grenades and rifles and pistols?  
A.	In fact, no later than that very evening of the 15th of November, the opposition very quickly picked up what the president had said and deformed it, saying, "Here, Habyarimana recognises officially that with his militia he will go down."  They denigrated his message as opposition parties.  One can understand that.  But that's how the message was picked up and denigrated by the political opposition, who felt that they were being castigated as enemy accomplices.
MR. MORLEY:
	With the assistance of Mr. Lahaie, tab 62, please, document number 8, if we could put that in front of the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you have a document in front of you dated the 17th of November of 1992, so two days after the Ruhengeri rally, signed by the prime minister, which runs to four pages?  May I invite a little housekeeping?  I have a feeling all the documents you've had put in front of you are still there.  
MR. MORLEY:
	And may I invite that Mr. Lahaie removes documents, apart from P. 9, from the witness as he has completed using them?  Because at our end here in Arusha there's quite a cacophony of rustling.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, do you now have in front of you, but without any other paperwork, a letter?  
A.	I have it before me, Counsel. 
Q.	That's very helpful.  Now, again, you don't need to read this letter.  We can read it for ourselves, but in keeping the chronology of events, it's plain, is it not, that this is a letter from the prime minister, who was in the MDR, to the president -- that's President Habyarimana -- complaining about what he had been saying at the Ruhengeri rally about his Interahamwe on the 15th of November of 1992?  
MR. MORLEY:
	I'm not sure if what I asked was translated, as I see the witness sitting very attentively, apparently waiting for the next question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Looking at the document, on the face of it, it's right, is it not, that this is a letter from the prime minister to President Habyarimana, complaining about that which had been said at the Ruhengeri rally in November of '92?  You can see it from the first paragraph.  
A.	Would you permit me to read the letter this time around?  I had understood that I was not supposed to read the letter, that it was going to be read.
MR. MORLEY:
	I'm trying to do this as quickly as I can, Your Honour.  It's not the witness's fault.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes, but Mr. Morley, this letter has been put to the witness already.  So maybe you can move straight to the question.  He should be familiar with its contents.  
MR. MORLEY:
	Well, yes, and it's very simple.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	This letter shows there was disquiet on the part of the other parties about what had been said at Ruhengeri in 199 -- in November 1992; that's right, isn't it?  We can see it on its face.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Mr. President, I'm going to object to the leading nature of this question and also to the fact that how can the witness be asked to comment on the letter without being given an opportunity to read it?  
MR. MORLEY:
	And then Mr. Robinson will stand up and say we're wasting time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Actually, that's true, because this should have been done in the five days that Mr. Morley prepared the witness.  If he's going to use exhibits with the witness, he should go over it with him so the witness is familiar with them and we don't sit here while the witness reads.  But the witness is not a parrot to simply say whatever Mr. Morley wants him to say.  He should read the documents before he comments on them.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
	First of all, it wasn't five days, it was three, for the assistance of my learned friend.  And secondly, I hope I don't put it inelegantly, but there are certain questions to which the witness can parrot.  There is simply an observation being made that here is an example of complaint being made arising out of what happened in Ruhengeri.  All he has to do is say "yes".  And insofar as he wants to read the whole document, it's not necessary in the course of the core proceeding now.  So what I would do, with Your Honour's leave, is simply turn back to the witness and tell him he can quickly look over the letter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Morley, it has to do with what your question was.  The last question you asked was just for confirmation of the content of the material.  So what's your question?  Because that really will determine whether he needs to read it. 
MR. MORLEY:
	No, Your Honour is right.  And the answer to the question I had anticipated was simply "yes", but instead the witness has come back and said he'd like to read the whole document.  And all I am saying to the witness is without having to study the document, you can see, can you not, from looking at it, that it is a letter of complaint about what had been said in Ruhengeri in November 1992?  It's getting late in the day, I think. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Well, he's certainly had enough time to read it by now.  
MR. MORLEY:
	Your Honour, yes.  And I'm not expecting this to be controversial.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, look at the document.  You don't have to study it.  It's obvious it's a letter of complaint.  
A.	Yes, absolutely.  
Q.	Thank you.  And it concerns -- it concerns what had been said in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November, two days before? 
A.	This letter reflects the complaints and the reactions that I have told you about because the opposition parties immediately complained on that very evening, and so this letter reflects those protests against the utterances made by President Habyarimana, not only with regard with what he said about the Interahamwes but he was also being castigated about what he had to say about the Arusha Accords because he had referred to them as just useless pieces of paper.  So it reflects the reactions on that evening of the 15th.  
Q.	All right, thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
	Now, my understanding -- and as Your Honour knows I'm often wrong -- is that tab 62 is not an exhibit, but my learned friend Mr. Robinson is mostly right, and will be able to contradict me.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Mr. Morley is correct, it's not an exhibit. 
MR. MORLEY:
	And I would invite that it becomes an exhibit.  I think we're up to P. 26.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Admitted, P. 26.  
(Exhibit No. P. 26 admitted) 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	We know that there was a speech made by a man called Mugesera on the 22nd of November of 1992 at a place called Kabaya near Gisenyi.  Now, were you at that speech, or did you hear about it later on the radio, or do you have no knowledge about it?  
A.	I did not attend that rally at Kabaya, but I heard about this very controversial speech that is supposed to have been made by Mugesera in Kabaya.  It was reported over the radio, but I was not in attendance. 
Q.	Now, we know that this was a rally of the MRND at préfecture level near Gisenyi.  Can you help us with what you recall principally was the point Mugesera was making that you heard on the radio?  
A.	In a nutshell, that speech by Mugesera was a call to murder Tutsis, who were supposed to be thrown into the Nyabarongo river.  And that was the opinion of everyone. 
Q.	Now, when you say that was the opinion of everyone, I don't want to misunderstand you.  What do you mean, it was the opinion of everyone that the Tutsis should be thrown in the Nyabarongo river, or that was the opinion of what -- that was everyone's opinion as to what he meant?  
A.	Counsel, I have said that this speech, which was a call to the murder of Tutsis, shocked everyone, so it was condemned.  And such things were not supposed to be said in public rallies or in public places, and that is what I meant.  I believe that an arrest warrant was issued 
against Mugesera, and that is why he fled the country.  
Q.	Thank you.  If we turn, please, to document 9, with Mr. Lahaie's assistance, D. NZ60, we see there the arrest warrant.  Have you got the document?  
A.	Yes, I have the document, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, there's an arrest warrant.  Was Mugesera ever arrested, and if not, why not?  
A.	Based on what I know, Mr. -- or, rather, that Mr. Mugesera had accomplices who assisted him to flee after the arrest warrant had been issued against him. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
	Mr. President, I believe there was the sound problem again.  We did not hear the answer.  
THE WITNESS:
	I will now repeat the answer.  I said that Mr. Mugesera was not arrested.  He managed to flee, thanks to the complicity of senior officers of the Rwandan Armed Forces who, based on what I learned, helped him to flee the country and thereby escape prosecution. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	In the period between April of 1992 and the Mugesera speech of November 1992, can you give us some idea of any other rallies that you attended in that period, of the MRND?  
A.	As soon as I joined the MRND, that is, after the multiparty system was instituted and specifically ever since I was introduced to the Interahamwe, I attended many rallies.  I was in Kibungo; I was in Byumba; I was in Rwamagana; Gisenyi; Gikongoro.  I attended the rally of the 15th of November in Ruhengeri.  Insofar as it was possible for me, I attended MRND meetings regularly. 
Q.	And at the rallies that took place in 1992 in Kibungo, Byumba, Gikongoro, Rwamagana, and Gisenyi, was there an Interahamwe presence? 
A.	Yes.  Each time the MRND party organised its rallies in préfecture headquarters, in some 
	sub-préfectures as well, the role of the MRND, among other things, was to accompany the MRND everywhere that they had a message to deliver.  That was part of the role of the Interahamwe youth wing.  Most of the Interahamwes received the message from the party when they were going to organise rallies.  
Q.	During the period April 1992 to November 1992, to your knowledge, how did the Interahamwe committee function?  How often did it meet?  Who were the principal personalities within the committee, to your knowledge?  Can you help with those two questions?  
A.	The main actor was, of course, the president, based on what we can see, that is, with regard to the structure of the committee.  So the role of the president was the most important role. 
Q.	When you say "president", are you referring to President Habyarimana or number 1? 
A.	I do not know whether I quite understood your question.  I believe you were referring to the main personality, that is, within the MRND structure.  Perhaps I misunderstood you.  
Q.	That's helpful.  It's just that when you refer to officers, there's always the danger that people will get confused about which officer is being referred to.  So when you refer to the president, is it right that you're referring to number 1 on the list, P. 9?  
A.	I have said I do not quite understand your question.  Perhaps there was some aspects that I did not understand.  Are you referring to the Interahamwe set-up or are you referring to some other thing?  
Q.	The principal personality on the committee you have told us was the president.  Now, by "the president," am I right in understanding you mean the person named as number 1 on P 9, the list of names?  
A.	Yes, that is the person at number 1 on the list. 
Q.	Did Ngirumpatse remain a presence at committee meetings during the period April to November 1992?  
A.	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse has always been the leader of the committee of the Interahamwe movement as the main representative of the party.  So Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, was present.  He was the one who gave directives on what was to be done, what was the information that had to be disseminated, when would the next meeting hold, when would the next activities be organised.  So he was the direct superior of the committee.  So, you had the president of the MRND, the secretary general.  But the person who gave instructions and directives to the Interahamwe committee, as far as I'm concerned, was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  But, Mr. President, the sound is really, really bad now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Morley, it's just about 6 o'clock. 
MR. MORLEY:
	I'd be grateful.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.  This might be a convenient time to take the adjournment.  

	Mr. Witness, we take the adjournment, and the video link will not be in operation tomorrow, and your testimony will resume on Wednesday.  I remind you of what I said earlier today, that during breaks in your testimony, adjournments of this nature, you remain under your oath and you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody at all.  

I trust that between now and Wednesday the technicians in both locations -- 
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you for reminding me, but I am aware of the importance and the need to respect any pledge that is given under oath, and so I will honour my word.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you very much for that reassurance.  And I was just maybe saying something which is also necessary, but requesting that the technicians at both locations work together to improve the quality of our transmission on Wednesday.  We can take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1758H)
