MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everyone.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Before the proceedings are resumed, let's have the appearances of the parties.  

Prosecution, please.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Good morning, Your Honours.  The Prosecution is as before.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Apart from -- in addition to Mr. Nzabonimana 
this morning, the Defence team is represented by Nathalie Leblanc and myself, Philippe Larochelle.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Yes.  We may continue from where we left off yesterday.  And we need to be advised whether we should stay in open session or whether we should go back to closed session.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
We'd respectfully request for us to return into closed session, because we are talking of trials and judicial proceedings where the witness was.  And I think it could be easily -- she could be 
easily identified from that information.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, could you kindly arrange for us to go into closed session.  Thank you.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, My Lord, Learned President. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 48] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

	(Court recessed from 1333H to 1500H)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

But we recall that there are some documents that the Prosecution want to be entered in evidence before we take the next witness.  

Could we start with those documents, Prosecution Counsel?  
MR. MAWERE: 
Good afternoon, Madam President.  

Good afternoon, Your Honours.  

I have shown the Defence the documents we intend to produce and they've indicated they have no objection.  May I hand over the documents and the explanatory notes to the Bench? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  

Thank you. 

Is that so, Defence Counsel? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, indeed, no objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Maybe, Learned Counsel, you introduce the documents one by one and we enter them into the record, because we do not have enough copies for all the Judges, and Defence counsel must also follow the proceedings.  
MR. MAWERE: 
The first set of documents will be the two statements by Witness T59; the original being in French, accompanied by an uncertified English translation.  The first statement is dated 15 November 2009, and the second statement is dated 19 April 2010.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel, the original documents are in which language? 
MR. MAWERE: 
The originals are in French, and there is an uncertified English translation for the two statements.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The statements of Witness T59, the one dated 15th November 2009, together with its unofficial translation, is entered into evidence as exhibit -- Registry. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Exhibit P. 25. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Exhibit P. 5. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Exhibit P. 25.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
P. 25.
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Two-five, P. 25.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Registry.
(Exhibit No. P. 25 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
The second statement by Witness T59, dated 19th April 2010, in French, with its unofficial translation in English, is entered as Exhibit P. 26.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
These documents should be under seal, as they contain the personal particulars of this witness.
(Exhibit No. P. 26 admitted, under seal) 
MR. MAWERE: 
The next document is the statement of Laurent Uwayisenga, which is in Kinyarwanda, with an uncertified English translation accompanying it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Is it dated, Counsel? 
MR. MAWERE: 
Yes, the date is not clear.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  And -- 
MR. MAWERE: 
In fact, it -- the -- it is -- they are arranged in that order on the copies that I've given, that have been handed to the Bench. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel, and the portions that have been used of this statement, are they clearly indicated on the original copy? 
MR. MAWERE: 
We did not do those markings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, you have to do those markings, because it makes the work of the Bench much easier if you do.  It takes us less time to look for these matters, and we have a lot of matters to look into. 
MR. MAWERE: 
Noted, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  If you could defer that one.  Until you have done that one, you can go on to the next one. 
MR. MAWERE: 
The next one will be the ********** case file for **********************************.  The relevant portions on that document are where there is a -- there are some blue stickers, on the English version.  Again, that document is in Kinyarwanda, accompanied with an uncertified English translation.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  

The ********* case file for ******************************** and its English -- its translation, in English, is entered as Exhibit P. 27.  

Registry, please -- the copies -- and mark them as we go along; otherwise, we have to go through it all over again.
(Exhibit No. P. 27 admitted, under seal) 
MR. MAWERE: 
The next document will be *************************************** confession, in Kinyarwanda, with an uncertified English translation.  

May I request Registry to come and get the marked portion of that statement, in Kinyarwanda?  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
And the English translation? 

MR. MAWERE: 
Now, with the English translation on this, I will mark it, but during the trial it was also read into record.  The Kinyarwanda version was read into record, because the Defence had indicated there were some slight errors on the translation.  So, the certified translation is as it is from the Prosecution, which should be read in conjunction with what was interpreted into the record.  I will mark the Prosecutor's version also.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Prosecution.  

The confession of ************************************, as marked, and its English translation are entered as Exhibit P. 28 -- Registry? 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President, P. 28.
(Exhibit No. P. 28 admitted, under seal) 
MR. MAWERE: 
May Registry get the marked copies for the Bench?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Sorry, Madam President, because we may have got lost.  The documents which we've taken from Mr. Prosecutor are a bit many.  Maybe it is better marking it first, and then we will continue accordingly.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Do you have the statement of 15th November 2009 of Witness T59, with the English translation? 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Let me enquire from Mr.  Prosecutor, Madam President, please? 
MR. MAWERE: 
P. 25, Your Honours, is the statement dated 15th November 2009? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that's what the record indicates.  

P. 26, is the 19th April 2010 statement by the same witness; the French and English translation together -- 
MR. MAWERE: 
This one. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
-- P. 26.  The *************** file for ********************** is P. 27.  And the confession and the English translation for the same person, *********************, is P. 28.  
Yes.  And, Learned Counsel, if you can hand them in one by one so that this confusion does not arise.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Yes.  Madam President, the first was the -- this is an explanatory note which explains the exhibits, which accompanies the exhibits.  It does not get an exhibit number.  The next exhibit --
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
It is an explanatory note for which exhibit? 
MR. MAWERE: 
It explains the four exhibits.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
It accompanies all of them? 
MR. MAWERE: 
Yes, Madam.  Then the last exhibit, which I've since marked for Uwayisenga -- 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Excuse me, Madam President, now this explanatory note, we should have to know under which category that it is.  Is it an exhibit or what?  We have to file it in our file now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
In fact, the proper thing to do would have been to have the copy accompany each of these exhibits --
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
-- so that each exhibit is entered with its copy of the explanatory note, even if it is the same one, Learned Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE: 
We take note.  We will provide copies of the same cover note because it explains for the four of them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
So each exhibit, P. 25, P. 26, P. 27 and P. 28, is entered with a copy of the explanatory note.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Noted, Madam President.  
MR. MAWERE: 
We will now go back to the last exhibit for Uwayisenga.  It is in Kinyarwanda.  The portion is marked.  And the uncertified English translation is also marked on the relevant portion.  This one.  This is the copy.  Registry advises me that will be P. 29.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the statement of Uwayisenga, together with the -- it has an English translation? 
MR. MAWERE: 
Yes, Your Honour, an uncertified English translation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay, the explanatory note, together with Uwayisenga's statement, as marked, and the accompanying unofficial translation are entered as one exhibit, P. 29.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Noted, Madam President. 
(Exhibit No. P. 29 admitted, under seal) 
MR. MAWERE: 
That will be all, Madam President.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Could we now have the next witness brought in the courtroom, Registry, after the curtains have been drawn?  

Counsel, who is this witness, once again? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Witness T33 -- T3-3.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, could you administer the oath to the witness, please? 
(Declaration made by Witness T33 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we are about to begin your testimony, and it is standard procedure in the Tribunal to give you a briefing about how -- how the proceedings will be conducted.  So, kindly switch off your microphone.  If you leave it -- if you leave it open, and there is another one which is open, it interferes with the smooth translation of your testimony.  So, remember to switch it on when you are going to speak and switch it off when you have finished.  

The Defence team, which is seated on your left hand, will ask you questions first, to lead your evidence in chief.  

The Prosecution will, in turn, ask you questions in cross-examination.  The Prosecution is seated on your left -- on your right, in front of the translation booths.  

The Judges may ask you questions any time to clarify any matter, for the better understanding of your testimony.  Answer all questions put to you by any party, and answer briefly and clearly.  Don't undertake long narratives without a break.  Long narratives are difficult to translate, they're difficult to follow and they make life very difficult for the listeners as well.  

If you have not understood a question, you may ask for it to be repeated or clarified.  

We conduct these proceedings in both open and closed sessions.  Open sessions are attended by -- may be attended by the public.  You, therefore, need to be careful what you state while we are in open session, like we are now, because you may reveal your identity if you're not careful about what you say.  When we are in closed session, feel free to give any information including that which may identify you.  These are the matters that we wanted to bring to your attention to make your stay comfortable and to speed up your testimony, Witness.  

We would now like to know whether you have understood what we have said.  
THE WITNESS: 
I have understood, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel.  
WITNESS T33, 
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:  
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good day, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, you should have before you a sheet of paper which carries various information concerning your identity.  Do you have that document? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Can you read that document? 
A.	Yes, I can do that. 
Q.	So this document states your first name; your surname; the names of your parents; your place of birth; your place of residence in 1994; your occupation at that time; your current occupation; and your current place of residence.  
A.	I can see that. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:   
I saw the Prosecutor rising. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	I showed you the document a while ago; is the information therein contained accurate? 
A.	Yes, the information is correct.  
Q.	Very well, we would now request that you sign the document, so that it can be placed on record.  
(Pages 49 to 56 by Eleanor Bastian)




























1530H 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Could you please show the document to the Prosecutor, as well as to the Judges?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, this would be exhibit number?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
D. 10 (Microphone not activated)...  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel, do you want this entered as Defence exhibit?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes, indeed. 
MS. MAPOSA:
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification sheet for Witness T33 is entered on record as Exhibit D. 10, under seal.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Exhibit No. D. 10 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we are in open session.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well, Madam President.  The questions I intend to ask are similar to the ones I put to Witness T19, whom we saw yesterday and the day before yesterday.  So I think those questions will require that we go into closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could we move into closed session, please.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 58 to 73] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
