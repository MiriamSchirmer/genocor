testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	How are you?  
A.	As usual, ups and downs, tired every now and then, but I will do my best.  I will attempt to do my best.  
Q.	Yes, you have to do your best.  You must do your best.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	As usual -- and I am sure you have heard this said over and over again -- we are both speaking in French, so I need to observe a break, a pause, and you, too, need to observe a break so that the interpreters can properly translate your statements, and so that the court reporters can also keep a proper record of our proceedings, and so that we may not be lost in our exchanges.  

Now, you have your personal identification sheet before you.  I will ask you to look carefully at your full names and the spellings thereof, Matthieu, I believe, for your first name has the two Ts in place.  You were born on the 12th of December 1939 in Rulindo, Tare commune, Kigali préfecture, in Rwanda.  Your father's name is Murembya, Anastase, and your mother, Bungurubwenge, Clémence.  I am sorry if I do not pronounce that name properly.  

In 1994 your occupation was lawyer and chairman of the MRND.  Currently you are in detention, and your address in Rwanda is provided, as well as your current address, which is the UNDF in Arusha.  

Is that all accurate, Witness?  
A.	Yes, the information is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	Please date the document and append your signature to it.  
A.	Done.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Issa, please kindly assist.  Would you recover that document which I believe should bear exhibit number D. NG194.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG194 admitted) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, we have looked through your civil status document briefly, but I would like you to describe to the Court your place of birth -- your area, or region of birth.  
A.	As it is written on the document, I am -- I was born in Rulindo, which is about some 38 kilometres to the north of Kigali.  There is a big parish in the area, and it is in that parish that I practically grew up until I entered secondary school.  
Q.	What is peculiar about Rulindo area?  What is the composition of the population, and what is the social status, or level of the people of that area?  
A.	The ethnic composition of the area is such that all ethnic groups are represented.  It is a fairly developed area because it has in its neighbourhood a major parish which was created in 1908.  So many people studied there.  It is a well-developed area, so to speak, where there was no discrimination within the people or within the population of that area.  
Q.	The Hutu/Tutsi/Twa ethnic representation, was it balanced or was it disproportionate?  
A.	I believe that if one were to look at the region or area as a whole, we would find that there was some imbalance in certain areas and the situation was different in other regions.  Otherwise it was about 80/90, 10 to 15 per cent, and then 5 per cent.  That is going for Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa respectively.  And this would represent the national distribution, more or less. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, can you tell us about your parents, your father?  What was he involved in, what were his activities, and what did he represent to you, that is, in your mind?  
A.	My father was one of the first persons to contact the Catholic missionaries when they arrived in our area.  And, of course, his father, my grandfather, who was a clan chief, was not satisfied with this at all because he did not want his son to change his religion.  In any event, my father went to study with the missionaries, he was baptised as a Catholic, and he became a teacher.  He even had the opportunity to be sent as a missionary to neighbouring areas.  And that is how, in my family, at the time we went to primary school we were already able to read and write and pray and practice our catechism.  So, in a nutshell, we were a lot more advanced or developed than the other inhabitants.  
Q.	What was the profile of your mother?  Was it similar?  
A.	Yes.  She trained with her husband at the missionary schools.  When they got married -- you may want to know that we were a large family of 15, and my mother was a housewife who took care exclusively of that large family.  
Q.	You have just stated that you were 15 children in that home, brothers and sisters.  Did you all have the same mother?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	How many brothers and sisters do you still have alive today?  
A.	Today, only my junior sister and myself.  All the others are no longer alive.  
Q.	Could you tell the Court the circumstances in which they died?  Did any of your brothers die during the events that this Court is focussing on?  
A.	Yes, I lost some family members.  I lost a brother and I lost some nephews.  In fact, one of them was actually mentioned by a witness here to have been killed at a roadblock in Cyangugu préfecture.  Another relative was killed by the RPF in my native area, a nephew.  So I lost many relatives, and even some whom I do not know.  And they died either at refugee camps or lost in the Zairean forests.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, about your parents, still.  Can you explain to the Court the socio-cultural status of your family in Rwanda from the time of your youth and subsequently?  That is, what was the socio-cultural status of your family in Rwanda?  
A.	If I were to start with my parents, I would say that they had a status -- a high status, because they were -- because my father was a teacher and they had relations with the missionaries.  At the time they were therefore in a position to access all ethnic groups and social categories or -- without any problems.  And that is how we were educated to accept other people, to have good contact with other people, and to be able to understand other people.  I saw my father interact with peoples from all levels of social strata, and my mother as well, without any difficulties, without any problems.  
Q.	If we were to proceed along the same lines, are you in a position to tell us the values that were handed down to you by your parents?  
A.	I would say that they handed us -- they handed down to us two types of values:  Traditional values and religious values.  On the traditional front, they taught us to be courageous, to be straightforward, to be honest, to be people of integrity.  On the religious level, they taught us to love our neighbour, to help our neighbour as need be, and also to serve people when they ask for service, and even when they do not.  So these were the values inculcated in us by our parents.  And I believe that there is really no difference between myself, my brothers, and my sisters in that connection.  

Another value which we learnt from our father was the arts.  My father was a musician, he played a traditional instrument, and quite often in the evenings he would play on that instrument and we would sing and dance together.  And that is how my entire family became a family of musicians.  All of us were good musicians.  And from these artistic values, we were able to develop an ease with which to contact -- or, to have contact with people.  Because, as you know, music is not an individualistic activity.  It enabled us to have contact with other people, to have understanding of other peoples, and to facilitate life for other people.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, do you believe that by the choices you made as an individual, that you upheld those qualities that you received from your parents -- courage, integrity, respect for one another, assistance to other persons?  Did you uphold those values?  
A.	Counsel, it is very difficult to self-appraise, so to speak.  But now that I am somewhat obliged to answer your question and to assess myself, I believe that I did my level best to uphold those values.  For example, through the development of a number of associations, either individually or collectively, I was involved in civil associations and various charities which testify to the fact that I tried to apply those principles which I learned from my parents and through my educational background.  
Q.	Witness, could you briefly tell the Court your academic background?  You have already stated that because your parents were teachers, you learned to read and write quite early.  Now, would you please give us the main outline of your academic background and tell us where you studied.  
A.	My primary education was in Rulindo, in my native area, and I attended primary school until 1953.  Then I went to secondary school in 1954 in Rwanda, in a minor seminary which I attended for two years.  It was in Kabgayi, K-A-B-A-Y-I (sic), for Kabgayi.  K-A-B-G-A-Y-I.  I spent two years at that secondary school.  

Then I went on to study the humanities at the Saint Paul college in Bukavu, and that was in the Belgian Congo at the time, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.  I completed my humanities studies in 1960, and then registered at the Bujumbura university on a Belgian state scholarship.  That was the time for independence for various countries.  But things rapidly deteriorated in the Great Lakes area at that time paradoxically, as is the case today, and so I had to quickly return to Rwanda, suspending my university education.  

Then, later on, much, much later on, I registered at the Strasbourg university faculty of law in 1982 on a Belgian scholarship, and I went on to obtain a PhD from the university after three years of study:  One year of studies, then there were the examinations, which I passed, and then I went on to write and defend my thesis in 1985.  

That, in broad strokes, is my academic background.  
Q.	You mentioned a thesis.  What was the topic of your thesis?  What area did you cover?  
A.	My thesis was on the dowry system in Rwandan law.  But most of the subject matter was a comparative study of dowry in Africa, Rwanda, and Europe.  That is the area I covered in my thesis.  
Q.	In dealing with that topic, did you have the opportunity to study the various practices of various ethnic groups in Rwanda?  Rather, let me rephrase my question.  Or -- I'll stop there.  
A.	Well, the truth of the matter is that they are not different.  Customary law in Rwanda is practically the same.  What changes is the dowry itself.  It could be cows, it could be goats, or it could be other materials.  In any event, in general terms, it is usually cows that are paid as dowry, and irrespective of the social economic status of the individual.  
Q.	What grade were you given for your thesis? 
A.	I was graded as very good, or excellent.  
Q.	In 1960, you said that you obtained a scholarship to study in Burundi.  What was that for?  To study law?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, counsel and the witness are going too fast and the interpreters are not able to follow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  The interpreters have asked that you slow down a bit.  They are having difficulty in following.  
THE WITNESS:
I have taken good note, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Excusez-moi.  Let me repeat the question.  

You obtained a scholarship to study in Burundi.  What area of studies did you attend?  
A.	I registered in the faculty of law, and I attended school for about eight months.  Then I returned to Rwanda and I continued to train under Belgian magistrates at the prosecutor's office in Butare in Rwanda.  B-U-T-A-R-E for Butare.  

So I went through those studies and that training under Belgian magistrates for about one year before becoming a deputy state prosecutor in 1962.  So we might return to that aspect of my professional background, if need be.  
Q.	Are you telling the Court, then, that you had practical training prior to joining the prosecutor's office, and that you therefore did not have any diploma, as such, at the very beginning of your studies?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	I will slow down.  

Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, let us now turn to your professional background.  This Trial Chamber has heard many witnesses talk about your various occupations.  Now I would like you, yourself, to tell the Court your exact professional background.  You have already mentioned that, forced to return from Burundi, you went to train at the prosecutor's office.  How did things develop from there, as you were thrust into professional life in that manner?  
A.	After my training or internship, on the 22nd of June 1962, I was appointed third deputy prosecutor -- third deputy state prosecutor.  And I was very young at the time; I was the youngest member on the prosecutor's team.  So there were four deputies and one prosecutor who was much more senior.  So I was appointed deputy state prosecutor level 3, and I served in Butare.  

Shortly thereafter, I was transferred to Nyanza -- N-Y-A-N-Z-A for Nyanza.  In Nyanza my duty was to work to ensure that the prosecutor's office was transferred from Butare at that Nyanza.  That assignment I did over a period of about six months.  

One of the recommendations I made at the time was to ensure that the queen -- the widow of King Mutara, who died in 1959 -- Mutara is spelled M-U-T-A-R-A.  At that time his widow was still living in the palace.  Instructions had been issued to me to ensure that she was protected and was sheltered from any manner of injustice.  I believe that I succeeded in that task, because she was transferred from Butare to a residence provided by the government.  I also believe that she truly appreciated what I did, because when I returned to Butare subsequently, she came to my house to greet me and to extend her sympathy and condolences to me when I lost my sister, who was a nun in Butare.  

In 1964 I was transferred to Kigali to head the prosecutor's office.  In '65 I was in Switzerland on training in the Swiss federal courts.  So I was not in Rwanda.  Then I returned to Rwanda and went back to Kigali.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I am going to ask you questions so that we should be able to make progress -- so that we should not have a monologue by you, monologue regarding this period.  I would like to come back a little regarding the request for the -- for protection by the queen.  Can you say who the queen was?  
A.	The queen was Tutsi.  She -- well, she was Tutsi.  The queen was Tutsi.  She was the -- the widow of King Mutara III who died in Bujumbura in 1959.  
Q.	And why was it necessary to protect her?  
A.	1962/1963 was the post-revolutionary period.  Even though we had become independent, there were still, nevertheless, attacks, attacks by the monarchists who came from outside the country.  Periodically there were still disturbances, unrests, inside the country.  The prosecutor who gave me these instructions told me that he received instructions from the president himself, and the purpose of this was to draw my attention to the importance of that mission.  He told me that that woman had not committed any offence, that she was not involved in politics, and that under no circumstances did she have to be a victim of any political event.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  How many years did you spend in the prosecutor's office, and what were the rungs, or promotions conferred on you?  
A.	I indicated that, upon my appointment in 1962, I was the last on the list, I was third class.  In 1965 I was promoted senior assistant prosecutor, deputy prosecutor.  And this placed me third in the hierarchy.  In 1968, three years later, I was promoted first deputy prosecutor.  I was therefore assistant to the prosecutor-general, and I was the only person in that position throughout the country.  And in that capacity I had other duties.  I was head of the Kigali prosecutor's office, and also that of Butare.  But I was also inspector of the prosecutor's office throughout the republic.  I was vice president of the disciplinary body for the country.  

So these are the rungs or the positions that I occupied while I was in the office of the prosecutor.  I was first assistant to the prosecutor. 
Q.	At what -- in what year did you leave the prosecutor's office? 
A.	Officially in January 1974.  But in reality I was given a new appointment in November 1973.  I was appointed ambassador of the Republic of Rwanda to Ethiopia.  
Q.	During your activities in the prosecutor's office, did you have Tutsi colleagues who were also magistrates, or were the magistrates in the prosecutor's office only Hutu?  
A.	No, they were not only Hutu.  I will begin with the head, the boss.  Our boss was Tutsi.  The prosecutor of the republic, Tharcisse Gatwa, was Tutsi.  G-A-T-W-A, Gatwa, Tharcisse, was Tutsi.  There were assistant prosecutors who were Tutsi.  There were secretaries, or even inspectors, IPJs, who were Tutsi.  So you did not only have Hutus working in the prosecutor's office.  
Q.	What were the relations between you and your fellow magistrates?  Was there any discriminations amongst you -- discrimination on the basis of ethnicity?  
A.	No, that was not the case.  What I can say regarding that period -- because this is relevant to the case.  What I can say is that a group of assistant prosecutors -- Hutu assistant prosecutors, I must specify -- wrote a letter saying that they did not want a Tutsi prosecutor.  But, as one of the witnesses had the opportunity of explaining before this Court, I did not associate myself with that initiative.  

Of course, for reasons that are obvious, the revolution was not directed against the Tutsi, but rather against a system.  The revolution was not directed against who had progressive ideas, people who wanted a change of system or regime.  The revolution was not directed against individuals, but rather against the system.  But, unfortunately, in the history of mankind, you cannot separate history from human beings, because some people take advantage of systems, and they become -- and some become beneficiaries of systems or victims of systems.  

But there was no discrimination.  And, to be more precise and more complete, all senior staff -- or, all four of them, all four of those Hutus who were dismissed, none of them remain in the office of the prosecutor.  The president of the republic -- the first president of the republic, Grégoire Kayibanda -- I believe this is a name the Court is familiar with -- was very severe with those Hutus.  So those people who took that initiative were all relieved of their positions.  

So, once more, this is evidence that there was no discrimination.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, during the years you spent at the office of the prosecutor, did you receive instructions for the purpose of treating in a different manner cases involving Tutsis?  Did you have to be particularly severe against the Tutsi?  How did you perform your duties at the time?  
A.	No, there was no -- that was not the case.  Even if I had received such instructions, I would not have followed them.  First of all, I had assistants who were Tutsi.  I should have started with them.  But that was not my understanding of the duties of a legal and judicial officer -- a legal officer in the office of the prosecutor.  I never received any such instructions.  First of all, who could have given me any such instructions, because, to begin with, my boss was Tutsi.  
Q.	Wasn't there any special note that could have been handed to you for the purpose of asking you to carry out tasks that no one would have wanted the Tutsis to carry out?  
A.	No.  Because the administration -- administration is administration.  I often told the minister of justice that I was not under his orders, I was under the orders of the prosecutor of the republic.  And I told him that if he had instructions to give me, it was for the office of -- it was for the prosecutor of the republic to receive such instructions and then forward -- make them known to me.  I never served as a screen between the prosecutor and political authorities.  
Q.	When -- or, rather, for the period you were in the office of the prosecutor, did that period coincide with the presidency of Kayibanda and also with the presidency of Juvénal Habyarimana?  Would you say -- or, have the same comments about the same president -- or, rather, the two presidents?  
A.	Yes.  I did not stay for a long time in the office of the prosecutor during the presidency of President Habyarimana.  But it was even easier with him because he knew me, he knew my character.  He was older than me by two years.  He went to the same schools that I went to; therefore, we knew one another.  He knew my reactions, he knew my character.  I think he would never have tried to do that, to give me such instructions.  He knew that.  
Q.	Can you be clearer?  Would he have tried to give you instructions, or he would not have tried at all? 
A.	So, he did not at all try to give me such instructions.  
Q.	When you were in the office of the prosecutor, this is a position where you can observe society.  Am I correct?  
A.	Yes, you are correct.  
Q.	In your capacity as a legal officer in the office of the prosecutor, did you initiate any cases against the Tutsi exclusively, or were -- the cases you initiated depend only on what people did, without targeting any group in particular?  
A.	I think this is -- this is clear.  The Hutus make up 80 per cent of the population, so it's not possible to practice any discrimination.  If people have to be prosecuted, you are compelled to prosecute people from any ethnic group, depending on the offences that they are charged with.  It was impossible to prosecute only 14 or 15 per cent of the population and not prosecute 80-85 per cent of the population.  Therefore that hypothesis or that scenario should be ruled out.  
Q.	During the years you spent in the office of the prosecutor, did you have the opportunity of working on an amnesty law, and to apply such law?  
A.	Yes.  Initially on the basis of a decree, the provisional government, in 1961, had decreed a general amnesty, particularly to enable the refugees to return, to enable the refugees to participate in the referendum, the referendum of 1961 regarding the monarchy.  

Now, in the commission that was set up, I sat in that committee, I was a member of that committee.  That commission continued working, even after 1962.  I remained a member of that commission, the amnesty commission.  The purpose of the commission was to see whether, in the cases before us, there was no obstacle for -- in the way of anyone to enjoy the amnesty provisions.  In other words, the -- our purpose was to see who could be granted the benefits of the amnesty law and who could not.  
Q.	To the best of your recollection, do you remember the number of cases that you dealt with?  
A.	About 4,000.  But I should also add that in 1991, in the committee, and regarding the issue of immigrants -- for now I cannot explain this because, in any case, the Judges -- the Judges are now familiar with what -- with what this is all about.  

I was at the origin of the amnesty law of 1991, and that law had been passed by parliament.  And as minister of justice in 1991/1992, I had the opportunity of implementing that law.  Therefore, I have lengthy experience of such matters.  

The amnesty law of 1991 was intended to foster the return of refugees.  As you know, this was a period when we were in war.  And, above all, the purpose of the law was also to foster negotiations and reconciliation.  There were many people who had been arrested, who were convicted, but who were amnestied, and this was at the peak of the war.  And this is to show you our good faith, our good faith at the time, our good faith during negotiations in the accords, and regarding the possibility of national reconciliation.  We still believed in national reconciliation.  
Q.	The amnesty law of 1991, in what context was it passed?  You told us that the first law was passed after the revolution.  And the one you are referred to, at the time when you were minister of justice, can you clearly tell the Court the causes -- or, why was it necessary to pass an amnesty law?  
A.	Yes.  At the time referred to, people had been arrested.  In fact, the law sought to achieve two objectives.  There were people who had been arrested during the attack, the attack perpetrated by the RPF, the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  But there were also other Rwandans who had participated in previous attacks, the attacks of 1960 to 1967.  And those Rwandans wanted to return.  

Since the president was to go to -- or, attend a conference in Dar es Salaam when he talked about the possibility of allowing refugees to return, I raised the issue.  I raised the -- I said that -- that people would talk about -- people had been convicted and who could not return.  So I suggested that an amnesty law be passed so as to enable all these people to feel comfortable to return.  

It wasn't easy for me as a member of the commission, because there were members of the commission who were -- who objected to that amnesty law.  But the argument I put forward was that -- well, I told them, if we are in a commission, if we're members of a commission, the president is the refugee.  We are going to put the idea to the president and we will see what his reaction is.  

And when the report was brought before the president, he immediately gave his assent, or agreement.  And it worked.  The president gave instructions to the appropriate minister to submit the bill to parliament.  And parliament passed the amnesty law.  
Q.	Did you follow the implementation of that law, and do you know the number of people who -- to whom that amnesty law of 1971 was applied?  
A.	It's difficult, because I left the ministry too early, three months after the passing of the law.  So when the law was being implemented, I had left the ministry.  Therefore I cannot specify the number of people to whom the law was applied.  I did no longer follow up the matter.  
Q.	Very well.  You also told this Court that you were appointed ambassador in 1973.  Can you describe what the position of ambassador entails?  Why did you leave the office of the prosecutor for the ministry of foreign affairs?  
A.	That is a difficult question, because it was the leader or the chiefs who decided.  But I can guess why.  From 1967 to 1972, I was a member -- I had been a member twice per year of the Rwandan delegation that attended the OAU talks.  So twice a year, over a period of five years, I had to attend those OAU talks.  So they presumed -- my bosses presumed, probably -- they never explained to me why.  But I believe they presumed that I had acquired a -- sufficient experience to represent Rwanda at the OAU, the Organisation of African Unity, and also in Ethiopia.  I also covered Sudan at the same time.  

So it was not as sudden as one may think, I think.  In Addis Ababa, I had become familiar with Addis Ababa and the negotiations or the discussions there, familiar with matters relating to decolonisation, the independence of African countries.  In fact, I had become very acquainted with such matters.  I believe, therefore, that was the reason I was transferred to Addis Ababa as -- as ambassador.  But I started by being reluctant.  It wasn't easy.  But, in the final analysis, I accepted, because one has to be disciplined.  
Q.	I was going to -- well, some people would think that that change of ministry -- some people would think that that change of ministry was a promotion.  But it wasn't a favour -- granted you a favour for you to go abroad in order to become ambassador.  And what was the regime in power at the time? 
A.	This was the Habyarimana regime.  So it was not necessarily a favour.  My change of ministry was not a favour.  It was rather an appreciation of the work that I had done.  And I believe the work I had done in the prosecutor's office was laudable.  It was, rather, an appreciation of the work that I had done.  It wasn't a favour at all.  

There is no position I occupied -- and bear this in mind.  I never asked any -- I never asked to occupy any post in my professional career.  I was simply appointed without me taking any initiative to be appointed to any position whatsoever.  I must add that in many cases I was surprised whenever I was appointed.  
Q.	How long did you stay in Ethiopia as ambassador, and what are the other positions that you occupied subsequently?  
A.	I spent five years in Ethiopia, from 1974 to 1979.  Thereafter I was transferred to Germany.  And in Germany I had a lot of work to do.  I had a huge territory to cover, because I covered Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Geneva, and the Vienna institutions.  So my position there was much more demanding in terms of work.  The Scandinavian countries were taken away from the ambassador of Rwanda to Germany.  I didn't have to cover Scandinavian countries.  But, prior to my arrival, those countries were covered by the Rwandan ambassador in Germany.  
Q.	When one is not familiar with the task of ambassador, one imagines that the ambassador spends their time in cocktails and parties.  Can you explain to the Court the concrete achievements that you made during your tenure as ambassador?  Concrete achievements in the interest of Rwanda.  
A.	I will begin with Ethiopia, because what I'm going to say I think is also an achievement.  When I went to bid farewell to the president of the republic, that is President Juvénal Habyarimana, he gave me just one instruction.  He told me that the new regime was to ensure -- or, sought unity and peace among all Rwandans.  And he asked me, therefore, to make an effort to bring together all ethnic groups in -- of Rwanda, invite them to receptions, give them the necessary documents they need.  

And when I arrived in Ethiopia, there were Rwandan refugees who were working at the Organisation of African Unity.  And I gave them passports, and I included them under the Rwandan quota.  One of them declined the offer because he told me he had Burundian nationality.  
From Ethiopia I also covered Sudan.  There was a Rwandan refugee who was working at the BADEA, that is the Arabic bank, or the Arab bank for the development of Africa.  I gave him a passport.  I believe his name was Rutimirwa, Alexis, something like that.  This is a name which is well known here.  I cannot say more about it.  That person also received a passport from me.  

But, also, in that bank, I negotiated credit of $5 million for the construction of the electricity plant of Mukungwa.  Mukungwa is M-U-K-U-N-G-W-A.  Mukungwa.  This was a loan I negotiated and which the -- we were granted, and the loan was used for building that plant.  

Finally -- or, rather, I also finalised negotiations -- negotiations regarding an air link between Ethiopia and Rwanda, that is, Ethiopian Airlines flights could now land in Kigali.  In fact, I boarded the inaugural flight.  

In Germany, I had the opportunity of negotiating the twinning between Rhenanie-Palatinat -- the twinning of towns between Rwandan and German towns.  And that twinning involved many projects.  

We also had the road project.  Germany had given us a grant to build or construct a Kigali-Ruhengeri-Cyanika road at the border with Uganda.  Cyanika is spelt as follows:  C-Y-A-N-I-K-A.  There were difficulties, because the -- the aid was linked, had ties.  We had to use Western enterprises.  But the least expensive was asking us as much as twice we had received.  And my goal, therefore, was to persuade the German government to allow the Chinese to build the road.  This was in the 1980s, this was still the period of the Cold War, so my task was not easy, but we succeeded.  The German government accepted or acceded to my request.  
Q.	As you went about performing all these duties, did you act only on behalf of the Tutsis, or did you feel that you were serving the entire Rwandan nation in all its components?  
A.	I think the answer to your question is obvious.  When roads are built, everybody drives on them.  When planes fly, all people can travel on them.  So my service was to the Rwandan nation.  It has never crossed my mind that ethnicity should be the reason for realising these achievements.  It was all for the sake of my country.  
Q.	The embassies at which you served in Ethiopia and in Germany, were the doors to those embassies open to all Rwandans -- to all Rwandans?  How did things happen?  Did you have any associations?  How did you receive the Rwandans abroad?  Can you describe this to the Court.  
A.	Rwandans were not only free to come to our house, they were also invited to receptions that we organised.  And you may recall that this was during the era of the one-party system, and they were all, therefore, members of that unit of the party.  There were Tutsi students who had travelled to Germany either on a Rwandan or German scholarship.  And I have two names that I can mention:  One Masabo, who made a lot of noise within the RPF at some point.  But he was a student from Byumba who left the country on a government scholarship.  

And there are still a number of Rwandans who came to our home or to the embassy to have a chat or to raise a problem or two.  So I had no difficulty with all ethnic groups.  I have never had any difficulty working with all Rwandans.  And I believe that they, too, irrespective of their ethnicity, did not have any problems working with me.  
Q.	During the years when you served in the prosecutor's office and in various embassies, did you enrich yourself?  Did you draw any material benefits from your positions?  
A.	No.  Quite sincerely, no.  You see, the Rwandan salaries were what they were worth in terms of being a product of the available resources within the country -- within the country.  And you may want to know that I wouldn't have kept my positions for such a long time if I had dabbled with state funds, or if I had plunged my hands into state funds.  What I did, however, was done through various bank transactions.  I never enriched myself, not at all, on state funds.  

And everybody would tell you that by the time we fled and crossed the body -- the border, rather, I had nothing in my pockets.  And you may want to know that providence is real.  Providence exists.  Sometimes I wonder how my family and I actually survived through all those situations.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, were you involved in any matters relating to the academic training of Rwandans?  If your answer is yes, please would you expatiate for the benefit of the Trial Chamber.  
A.	Not extensively, but I was a thesis director at the military academy for students who opted to write their thesis in the area of law, politics, international relations, and what have you.  I also delivered conferences on geopolitics.  I had also been -- I had had the opportunity to deliver a conference to senior officials of the Rwandan armed forces, and I unfortunately did not have the opportunity to pursue that endeavour because of the unfortunate events that subsequently unfolded.  But, yes, I was involved in academic activities.  
Q.	Did you direct theses for students from the military academy from all ethnic backgrounds? 
A.	Yes, contrary to what general opinion may hold, there were Tutsi students at the Rwandan military academy.  
Q.	Although you did not serve in that position for a long time, do you have an idea of how many theses you directed?  
A.	About six.  About six of them.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I believe that you do recall the testimony of Napoléon Mbonyunkiza, to the extent that you developed an alphabet which helped him to read and understand the Rwandan alphabet.  Did you write an alphabet of the Rwandan language? 
A.	Well, I think that he actually referred to a grammar book.  But I am not an expert in grammar.  I am not a grammarian.  What happened, however, is that I am a composer of Rwandan music and poetry.  And there were a number of lyrics that were composed for music, but which ended up being compiled into the anthology of Rwandan poetry and published for study in the last years of secondary education in Rwanda.  And this anthology was used by students at that level.  So civil servants of the pedagogic services in the ministry often came to me to ask for the explanation, either of some terms or some expressions.  

And that is why the school manuals, or documents, did bear my name.  And may I say, exclusively in connection to that collection of Rwandan poetry.  Not grammar.  So I think that it isn't -- I find it rather interesting that he studied these things, that he may even have read them, and -- allusion to my mother (sic) and what have you.  This is all part of that anthology of Rwandan poems.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, you have just referred to poetry and poems that were studied by students at the end of their secondary education.  Do you have any titles of such poems, and do you know what the content of those poems were?  Did those poems bear any extremist ideas?  
A.	No, not at all.  Certainly not.  One of the poems I'm referring to is the poem in honour of the Tutsi bishop of Nyundo, N-Y-U-N-D-O.  And I believe that poem has been entered into evidence during this trial, if I recollect properly.  

What was interesting in that poem, actually, was the music.  Because I had composed this music for the bishop, whom I believed to have been a man who had done a lot for Rwanda.  He was Tutsi.  He died several years ago now.  And what I did was to compose this music in honour of his bravery.  Therefore, this song could not have been based on segregation, given that it was in honour of a Tutsi.  

The second poem I can talk about, or some music which I composed for a friend who was getting married.  As tradition required, I went about highlighting the physical and moral qualities of his wife who was Tutsi, who is still alive, and who is in Kigali today.  So I could not have been the author of any discriminatory writings on -- to the benefit of a Tutsi.  

The third is "imibavu", which is translated into "perfect" (sic).  Perfect actually was a poem that should have been developed into some music which I composed, but for lack of time, for lack of inspiration and what have you, I didn't finalise that music.  However, the poem was good enough to be published for pedagogic reasons.  In any event, that particular poem did not refer to any specific individual, but it referred to perfection.  

And so, what I'm saying is that all my compositions did not tend towards segregation.  Not at all.  

And, by the way, let me add that -- I have another point.  And this is in relation to the choir.  And we will be talking about the choir.  It would have been totally out of place to bring any such lyrics or music into a choir that was composed of all ethnic groups.  The choir members would never have entertained such a suggestion.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Now, let us look at your involvement in civil society.  You have just described to the Court your educational background, your professional life, and now I want to ask you whether you were involved in civil society.  And, if yes, how.  
A.	I was involved in civil society activities through various associations.  It is true that I did not act single-handedly, but I was responsible for the creation of a number of associations.  You may want to know that to create an association, one needs to be socially credible and to have some social weight in order to be able to promote the activities of the association.  

The first association was the chorale de Kigali, or the choir, the Kigali choir, which is still in place.  It was created in 1969 when I returned from Switzerland.  Then I went on, in the same year, to create the Kiyovu sports club.  And this was to regenerate the Rwandan football which had gone into slumber since 1959.  So various club presidents went on to create other clubs after the sports club.  And that is how I was ultimately elected to the position of chairman of all sports clubs at the national level.  
Q.	Well, I'm sorry to -- to return to a question which I had intended to put to you a while ago.  Now, you have stated that you were indeed involved in civil society activities.  My question to you, then, is:  Was that involvement in civil society such that it dealt with all strata of Rwandan society, or did you choose to promote Tutsis -- or, Hutus as against Tutsi in these associations?  What I am saying is, were all ethnic groups of society involved in your associations?  
A.	Well, members of the association -- the associations came from various strata of society.  Now -- but we also have to note that there is an issue of skills and competence here.  If you had to play the guitar or the piano or what have you, what mattered was that you had the skill to do so, and not the colour of your skin or the look of your face.  So whether it be in the area of sports or in music, or in other associations which we will talk about, let me say that I never promoted any activities along ethnic lines.  

But let me dare say that this was not without consequences for me.  It created some problems for me.  But no one dared to challenge it because they knew that I was convinced about what I was doing.  So for some extremists it may have been necessary to down tone a number of issues and highlight some.  But I was open.  I was open minded, and I was open about almost everything.  
Q.	The UNICEF asked you to set up an association.  Can you talk about that to the Court, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Yes.  Following the Bamako declaration, as it is referred to, a declaration which preceded the United Nations convention on the child (sic), the idea to pool together artists and intellectuals of Africa or the entire world to promote associations for the protection of children was mooted.  

The UNICEF representative, who was Turkish, I believe, came to me in my office and asked me whether I was able to bring together my friends, artists and writers and what have you, within an association for the promotion of children.  So I told him that it is very difficult to bring intellectuals, musicians, writers, and poets together, because these people are ordinarily independent minded, and they are a very difficult group to try and bring together, and it is quite difficult to bring them together in one forum.  But, quite paradoxically, I accepted to attempt to do what he had asked for.  

And, again, quite paradoxically, it just worked out rather miraculously.  They were all enthusiastic about the idea; they agreed to convene a general assembly.  The UNICEF representative was present and delivered a speech.  I made a speech myself on the topic.  And it was during that assembly that the committee was set up, and I was elected to chair that committee.  

And, again, once more, let me spare you the question.  It was an entire mix of people.  Professor Nkusi, for example -- N-K-U-S-I -- was -- who was an RPF minister, was a member of the association.  He is still in that association.  Mfizi, among others -- Mfizi, who wrote The Zero Network, the Prosecutor is familiar with that material, he was a member of that association.  So it was a mix of various people.  There was no separation, there was no discrimination.  
Q.	What activities did that association undertake for the benefit of the child, or of children, and how did that unfold?  
A.	What we did was to organise shows and collect a gate fee for abandoned children, for orphans, for children living with single mothers, that is, without husbands, for orphans (sic).  Our major project was to promote the rights of the child.  But unfortunately the war came and disrupted everything, and we had to abandon our projects, given that we didn't have access to the entire territory.  
Q.	Did you have, among your projects, a scholarship-granting initiative?  How were the beneficiaries selected?  Were they all Hutu children only?  
A.	Well, we had not yet reached that practical application phase, but it is true that such a fund was in place.  But we had no intention to engage in such segregation.  Let me say that the war brought on a number of problems which we were not familiar with, which we had not experienced in our country.  University professors who were Tutsi, or those who were opposed to Habyarimana in one way or another, if all these people came into the association, the issue of discrimination and what have you would really not have existed.  It was subsequently that these problems arose.  Our association was a reflection of the Rwandan society as it was, but was subsequently used to channel accusations against other persons as a cover, so to speak.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, almost all the witnesses who have appeared before this Trial Chamber, be they Mr. Webster's witnesses, that is, witnesses for the Prosecutor, or your own witnesses, that is, witnesses for the Defence, all these witnesses made mention of your choir.  You had started to talk about it a short while ago, but I stopped you because I wanted us to talk about it now.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I see that it is 10:30.  Maybe this is a break time.  We can start singing when we resume after the break.  Is that okay, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1059H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Ms. Hounkpatin.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, when we broke up we had not completed the -- a matter we were addressing, this related to the choir.  I would like to recall that all witnesses, be they Prosecution or Defence witnesses, testified to your choir before this Court.  I believe that it's very important for you, yourself, the person who created this choir, a choir which is admired by many people, I would like you to talk about the choir in your own words.  

You told this Court that your family is a family of musicians.  What are the musical instruments played in your family, or by your family members?  
A.	Thank you.  I did not attend a music school.  In secondary school, in college, I had a teacher, a music teacher who came from the Malines music school.  He realised that I liked music a great deal, so he went further into music classes and that is how I came to acquire some musical skills.  Otherwise I took some courses in the piano, some piano -- or, organ courses, rather.  I'm not a pianist but an organist.  
Q.	Witness, don't contradict what the witnesses said here.  Do you play the organ very well?  If that is the case, yes, there is no shame in being good at the organ.  
A.	There were people in Kigali who were better than myself; that is all I mean.  I was not the best in the choir group in that regard.  Perhaps as regards composition of music, yes, and as for directing a choir, yes.  But in other respects of music, there were other people who were much better than me.  That is what I want to tell this Court.  
Q.	In the last words you have spoken, do I take it that your parents were humble people, people of integrity?  
A.	Yes, maybe.  
Q.	Now, let's talk about the choir.  In which year did you create the choir, and who were the musicians with you at the time, and why did you create that choir?  
A.	It must have been in 1965 with a few musicians, including some -- in fact, for the benefit of the Judges, most of whom were Tutsi.  And we met to sing together just like that.  Not necessarily Christian music, but music in general.  Mozart, Verdi, Beethoven, and what have you.  So subsequently decided to concretise the initiative by meeting regularly and creating an association.  This is what we did in 1965 or thereabouts.  

And those were difficult years, may I say.  For the benefit of the Trial Chamber, let me say that this was the post-revolutionary era, at which time it was not easy to undertake any initiatives given the attacks from without and the reprisals from within.  However, we held on to our ideas and things worked, and contrary to what others thought, Tutsis and Hutus cohabited -- did cohabit freely without any problems.  And so we went on subsequently to apply for legal status, and we were granted legal status.  
Q.	If I understood you properly, the choir was a not-for-business undertaking?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Apart from singing, what other activities did that choir engage in?  
A.	Many people felt that we only played Christian music, so to speak, or religious music.  Yes, indeed, that is the kind of music that may have been played for religious activities.  But we also contributed to the development of the country, because we also had a modern orchestra within the choir which played all types of music, and which performed at weddings or at other feasts and festivities, such as Masses and funerals and what have you.  So whoever organised an -- activities of that nature was free to invite us, and we would perform.  And so those who had the time were able to visit the poor and the sick, and give some gifts whenever possible.  

You see, the product, or the receipts from all my compositions were paid into the funds of the choir.  It was a lot of money, but all of that went into the coffers of the choir.  So while we performed in this way, we also were able to assist members of the choir who were unemployed, who had some special needs, and who didn't have the required resources.  So these are the other types of activities the choir was involved in.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, it would appear, therefore, that the choir was an important activity.  So I would like to ask you whether, because of your professional or civil activities, you at some point may have suspended your involvement in the choir, or did you continue to be actively involved at all times in the choir?  
A.	I was involved in the choir practically at all times.  Whenever I was absent, there were no problems, technically speaking.  There were other organ players in the choir.  One of my senior brothers played the organ very well.  There were other members who could teach the choir members new songs.  There were others who could also lead the choir.  

What I can say is that I was always present -- or, I always participated in the activities of the choir, in a constant manner, except when I was involved in some other important business.  
Q.	Did your choir rehearsals take place on a particular day of the week?  Please tell the Court.  
A.	Our choir practice or rehearsals took place on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday, three times a week.  That is the rhythm that must be maintained if one has to perform at acceptable levels.  Three times per week.  
Q.	In addition to singing, you mentioned that along with other members of the association, you were able to assist some people.  My question to you then is:  Did you ever go to visit any needy persons?  And if you did, were they only Hutu?  
A.	Well, a short while ago I told the Trial Chamber that the Hutu/Tutsi problem is a problem that was reinvented and aggravated to meet the goals of the war.  Let me repeat that point to the Trial Chamber:  We assisted or helped people without distinction simply, quite often, because a member of the choir brought to our attention one problem or the other.  Our group was a mixed group, it was not an exclusively Tutsi or Hutu group.  So we assisted persons from all ethnic groups.  

Let me say that there was a young man in the choir who performed very well when it came to music, but was unemployed, and therefore did not have an income.  I personally often gave him money from my own pocket to assist him.  And he was Tutsi.  He was not Hutu.  
Q.	Can you describe to the Court your feelings -- or, how you felt when you led the Mass during the Pope's visit to Kigali?  
A.	The Pope is not only a religious figure of authority, he is a state figure of authority.  And when the Pope comes to any country, people are mobilised.  I, and other Rwandans, were mobilised.  
Q.	Please kindly speak into the microphone so that we can hear you clearly.  
A.	All right.  What I was saying is that the Pope is not only a religious figure of authority, he is a state figure of authority.  And in countries which are not Catholic, there is also a general mobilisation.  Now, as for us, I composed one or two songs for the Pope when he visited our country.  It was indeed an honour for us, and we felt that all Rwandan people were in one great spirit of communion to welcome the Pope.  And therefore we are pulled together and contributed to -- towards the welcoming of the Pope to our country.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Well, we discussed, in general terms, your involvement in civil society, in various associations, and I did not ask you to mention all the associations which you created or chaired or sponsored.  This might take a lot of time.  But allow me to ask you what became of all those associations after the genocide in Rwanda.  And do you have any information as to whether those associations were dissolved?  Please tell the Court.  
A.	Yes, I do have information that I can share.  The sports club is still functioning, the choir as well.  The Turengere Abana association, the Haguruka association, those two are still operating.  I was a member of the Rotary Club.  I wasn't a founder of the International Rotary Club.  It is still operating.  It is an international club which is still in place.  I was the chairman of the German/Rwanda friendship association, and I believe that the association is still in place and functioning.  

Now, what has disappeared is the Rwandan academy of culture.  I was a member of the Rwandan academy of culture which no longer exists.  But I was a member of the traditional music jury, which is still in place.  That jury was also mixed in nature.  

Allow me to tell the Court, one of the members -- that -- let me tell the Court that *************** was a member of the -- a member of the **********************************.  He was a member.  
Q.	Please tell the Court, briefly, what vision you had when you created these associations and were so involved in their activities in your country.  What is it that you sought to achieve?  
A.	I like a dynamic youth, to start with.  A dynamic youth that is creative, and that participates in the social life, the economic life of the country.  A youth that is dynamic.  So my idea was to have a dynamic youth, because they were the main members of the associations.  I was also always interested in the promotion of culture, which is what I did through these associations.  

I also desired, in my heart, to come to the assistance of those who are neglected by society -- maybe not all societies, but, generally speaking, women and children are often neglected.  The Turengere Abana association was created to address that vision.  Habragama (sic), the other association, rather, was created for the defence of the interests of women.  So my concern has always been to take care of those who are neglected.  

If one were to talk about the protection of women, let me say that we had a legal office for assistance to women, and that office is still in place.  Such assistance was granted when women were suffering, when they were abandoned, when they did not have money because their husbands did not bring the salary home.  So we tried to help them to deal with those problems.  So my vision, my concern, was to see a dynamic youth, to protect and take care of those who may have been needy and in a difficult situation.  

But a third reason is that I like to feel at home with other people.  This might not be very significant, but although we know that artists generally are lonely people, it is also true that they like to be in the company of others.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, it has been your testimony that most of the associations that you created are still functioning.  Are you aware of any changes in the constitution or statutes of any of these associations, or are they still operating under the same guiding principles?  
A.	Nothing has changed.  The ministry of justice grants legal personality to all these associations, and makes them legal entities.  Now, what may change within the various associations is the people, the men and women who are members and who lead the said associations.  So my answer to your question is that nothing has changed as to the substance of the purposes of the association, simply because nothing had to be changed.  
Q.	The question, the follow-up question to you would have been to find out from you whether, if anything had changed, it would -- or, rather, if anything had changed, would the post-genocide regime still have maintained those associations in place? 
A.	Well, I believe that if the regime had been bothered by any of the purposes of the associations, they would simply have dissolved those associations.  So the idea is that any humanist or truly honest person would not be bothered by the purposes and objectives of these associations.  Look as hard as you may, you would not find any such evidence.  And I do not think in any -- in any event, that they wanted to go down that road.  

And let me tell you, furthermore, that most of the members of the associations are still alive.  They are there.  They are within the country.  And it is not those who went abroad who are in these associations.  It is those who remained in Rwanda who are indeed running these associations, even today.  
Q.	Now, let us revisit, briefly, your professional background, and let me ask you whether you ever were called upon to take charge of a state corporation at any time whatsoever.  And if this were the case, would you tell the Court at what time.  
A.	Well, we need to go back to the time I returned to Rwanda from Strasbourg, at which time my new career began.  I returned to the country in October after defending my thesis -- October 1985.  Then in February 1986 I was appointed adviser to the president for external affairs, or diplomatic adviser to the president of the republic.  I do not think that I need to explain the nature of this assignment.  Simply put, I was the president's adviser in matters pertaining to foreign policy, and I needed to make sure that missions being sent abroad were made up of persons who met all the necessary criteria in order to be consistent.  

So, in March 1990, or thereabouts, I had spent four years in that position.  In March 1990, I was appointed general manager of SONARWA, national corporation for insurance in Rwanda.  
Q.	Why were you appointed to that position?  
A.	Well, Mr. President, Your Honours, now I have to play WikiLeaks.  I have no choice.  I have to tell.  Now, he told me, beginning as if it were a joke, he asked me what I intended to do.  So I told him that I was busy, that I had work.  So he told me that I did not have any job because he was going to sack me.  So I told him, "Mr. President, I do not know what I'm going to do.  I will think about it."  So he told me, "I will dismiss you from the presidency (sic), but I will appoint you to SONARWA, because I have realised that that corporation is not being properly managed."  There was poor management of human resources and financial resources.  So he instructed me to restore order into that corporation.  And that was my assignment.  
Q.	How did you restore order?  
A.	I started by introducing discipline.  Allow me, also, to say that I dismissed a number of persons who tended to be corrupt.  You know that it is easy for corruption to obtain in an insurance company.  Somebody might decide to plunge his vehicle into a valley and claim insurance payments.  So I looked into all of that, and within a year or so I was able to introduce some discipline and clear up the deficit, financial deficit of the insurance company.  
Q.	Some witnesses appearing before this Court have testified that while you were the general manager of that corporation, you hired people who did not deserve -- or, persons who did not deserve to be hired.  You who acted in these matters, could you tell the Court why it may have been that you hired people who were not eligible for hiring?  
A.	Well, I did not hire or employ many people, because I did not dismiss many people from SONARWA.  I hired a lawyer and economist, and these were university graduates.  One was Tutsi, and the other was Hutu.  So I think that these are strictly false accusations.  What I did was to dismiss those who were corrupt and who were sent out to inspect various accidents.  

And to claim that I hired people who did not deserve to be, I wonder whether the witness who made such allegations is qualified to make such an assessment?  As far as I know, I hired those who deserved to be hired without any discrimination, and because they were all properly qualified persons who had trained or attended the national university of Rwanda.  Those who are honest will tell you that I did not employ on the basis of discrimination.  What matters was the competence of the staff.  In SONARWA, the issue of proportions did not arise because there were more or less an equal number of Tutsis and Hutus employed in that corporation.  

Let me repeat to this Trial Chamber that these issues of discrimination were part of the war strategy.  I did not see any evidence of discrimination in SONARWA.  But unfortunately I don't have a list of persons to tell you who was Tutsi and who was Hutu.  All I can say is that there was a balance in the employment of Hutus and Tutsis at SONARWA.  These accusations are therefore baseless.

BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Maybe I did not put my question properly.  What I wanted to elicit from you is the hiring of the Kayibanda son -- the Kayibanda son? 
A.	Now I see.  I did not employ him.  He was already employed by SONARWA when I already got there.  So I assigned some duties to him because he was a young man, a boy who was a man of great integrity and honesty.  He was poised.  He did his job properly, and so I gave him more duties, more responsibilities.  And, of course, when you get more duties and responsibility you get some financial benefit.  So the point is that I did not hire him myself.  And this might have displaced some people.  But in any way, I promoted someone who deserved to be.  And, unfortunately, on the 7th of April he was assassinated in Remera by the RPF. 
Q.	A while ago I asked you whether you derived any material benefits from the positions in the public service that you occupied.  Now I'm asking you the same question regarding the management of SONARWA.  And I think if you were the head of another corporation other than SONARWA, did you derive any personal benefits from those positions you held in various corporations? 
A.	First of all, we should make a distinction -- draw a distinction between SORWAL and SONARWA.  At SORWAL -- SORWAL is -- was a corporation for the manufacture of matches.  I was not the head of that corporation.  I was chairman of the board of directors, and that is different.  You have an allowance when you attend a board meeting, and that is all.  There is no other benefit.  

But, I had been appointed to chair that board because of specific reason -- reason.  Namely, there was a conflict between a Swedish expatriate and the general manager who was Rwandan.  My role entrusted to me by the government is that -- and, well, that is what the minister of finance told me.  My role was to find a solution to that conflict because that conflict undermined the smooth functioning of the corporation.  

I studied the matter.  I brought the issue to members of the board of directors.  I tried to reconcile the two persons.  And the reconciliation effort didn't work and the board of directors preferred -- or, we believed that in the board of directors, which was made up of Belgians, Swedish and other people.  In fact, the board of directors thought that it was the Swedish who wanted to have more power than he deserved.  So it was decided that he be repatriated, and he was replaced by someone else who was more disposed to cooperating with the Rwandan general manager.  

As concerns SONARWA -- well, to conclude on SORWAL, there was no other benefit.  We did not have access to the funds.  We could not give instructions for the disbursement of funds.  Nothing at all.  When we chaired board meetings we had an attendance allowance, and that is all.  

At SONARWA, I was better paid than other people and I believe this is the practice in all corporations, but salaries in Rwanda were fairly even.  There were not major differences in the salaries of various staff.  I was launched, however.  I had a house, but other civil servants were also launched.  I had a vehicle -- a service vehicle.  I had a state vehicle at the office of the -- from the office of the president.  That is all.  

Apart from my salary, which was higher than the salary I had in the office of the president, there was no other advantage or benefit.  Furthermore, you would see that later on, by accepting to be minister of justice, I should underscore that it was not for material benefits.  In fact, when I became minister of justice my salary dropped by 50 per cent.  

Nevertheless, I accepted that position because this was in the interest of the nation.  I accepted to become minister of justice.  I have never attached any importance to monetary advantages.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Where were you in 1990 -- on the 1st of October 1990?  
A.	I was in Kigali, at SONARWA.  I was general manager of SONARWA.  
Q.	Alongside that official position, what other activity did you carry out, an activity which was very important at the time referred to? 
A.	I was a member of the special commission that had to deal with the issue of Rwandan immigrants.  But let me talk about the origin of that commission.  In 1988 I was an adviser at the office of the president.  I had accompanied the president to Kampala.  The president went to Semuto, S-E-M-U-T-O, Semuto.  And there at Semuto he made a speech on refugees.  But President Museveni, during an official visit, had also raised the issue of Rwandan refugees.  He even pronounced a sentence which was surprising at the time referred to.  He told President Habyarimana that if he did not find a solution to the problem of Rwandan refugees, he, Museveni, was going to find such a solution.  No one understood what he meant at that time, but I believe that what he meant is much clearer now in everyone's mind.  

So, the president and I held a joint meeting with the Rwandan delegation -- Ugandan delegation, and the two heads of state during a tête-à-tête decided to create a joint commission to discuss the refugee problems and find a solution thereto. 

Consequently, by a presidential or executive order of February 1989, the president of the republic set up a commission that had to deal with the problem of Rwandan immigrants or refugees.  In fact, this time the committee didn't have to deal only with the refugees -- the Rwandan refugees in Uganda or political refugees, but all immigrants including those who had gone out of the country for economic reasons because they too faced problems in neighbouring countries.  

And that is how I was appointed member of that commission ex-officio as an adviser for external affairs.  But when I was transferred to SONARWA the president refused to take those other duties away from me.  He said that I should remain a member of the commission.  He said that members of the commission were many, but they carry out other duties, that they remain members of the commission, and that I should also remain a member of the commission.  

Another thing I want to point out is that in that commission there were Tutsis as well as Hutus.  It was a joint commission, a mixed commission.  I would like to draw the attention of the Court to that fact; namely, that the individuals who were members of that commission were -- or, the Tutsis who were members of that -- or, the members of that commission were also Tutsi.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, if I'm insisting on the term "Tutsi" it's not for the purposes of discrimination, but it's simply because that is part of the case against me, that is, the issue of discrimination and that is why I am revisiting the issue so that it should be clearly -- clearly understood that some charges were created just to have a basis for the Prosecution case.  

Museveni was Tutsi.  He was very solid in the RPF.  The other person was M-T-A-H-A-A ---
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, we're sorry.  Could the witness take that spelling again?  We didn't follow that piece of evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, Mr. Witness, the interpreters did not get the spelling of the second person's name.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
And perhaps his last -- the last piece of his evidence, Mr. President.  We're sorry, we missed it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  They would also like you to repeat the last bit of your evidence.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Vous êtes allé trop vite.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel speaking to the witness:
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	You were too fast.  Please, go a little bit more slowly, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	I'm sorry. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  
The second name is N-T-A-M-A-S-H.  Sorry.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
I take that over again.  

N-T-A-S-H-A-M-A-G-E (sic).  Ntashamaje, Antoine.  He had been minister of institutional relations, but at the time referred to he was president of state council or something like that.  That is, the supreme court.  He was president of that court.  He was also a member of the commission.  So the commission I referred to was a commission where the two ethnic groups were represented. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Can you tell the Court whether all these individuals were designated by the president?  In other words, they were not people who were designated by other organs of state? 
A.	No, it was the president himself who appointed or designated members of the commission.  He did so by presidential order. 
Q.	How many people did he designate, to the best of your recollection?  
A.	Perhaps about 15.  It would be necessary for me to look at the list.  I do remember the list.  But we were perhaps 10, 15 -- somewhere between 10 and 15.  
Q.	And you are saying that all the ethnic groups were represented in the commission? 
A.	Yes, just as I just testified. 
Q.	Can you explain to the Court how the commission functioned, how it met?  At what pace and the matters that it dealt with?  At what frequency it met? 
A.	Thank you.  That commission comprised the minister of foreign affairs, the minister of home affairs or the interior, and I believe it was the minister of the interior, home affairs, who chaired the commission.  In his absence it was another minister.  

The mission of that commission was to find -- because that is clearly written.  It was to find solutions to the issue of Rwandan refugees.  The commission had to make every effort to find ways of making neighbouring states to either integrate the refugees or to carry out the necessary negotiations so that Rwandans, whatever be their ethnic origin, should be able to return to Rwanda if they so wished, or to be integrated in their host country.  

The commission, of course, had other missions.  But maybe that would be too lengthy -- or, perhaps on another occasion I could give you a list of the missions.  But in the main, the commission's principal role was to find a solution to the refugee problem, not only as regards African countries but also refugees throughout the world.  Rwandan refugees throughout the world in other countries other than African countries. 
Q.	Did the OAU, the organisation of African countries, and the UNHCR, did these two bodies intervene at any point in time in the deliberations of this commission? 
A.	Yes, the two organisations intervened.  First of all, they had been informed of the creation of that commission.  They had been informed through appropriate channels in the ministry of foreign affairs and also through embassies.  

Secondly, these two organisations were always invited to our meetings.  And during the last meeting of the 30th of July 1990, we agreed -- or, rather, we shared the work amongst us.  The Rwandan government had to make available land to receive or host the refugees, facilitates to receive the refugees.  The UNHCR had to be responsible for the registration of those who wanted to return, and the OAU had to sensitise various states to cooperate in the context of this project.  

The UNHCR started registering refugees in camps located in Uganda.  UNHCR was immediately threatened by RPF members because the RPF existed already, that is, as of July 1990.  

The RPF told UNHCR that if they continued registering refugees who wished to return they were going to have problems, and that UNHCR should immediately put an end to that registration exercise.  They were told that the refugees were not just going to return like that.  

The second operation -- in the context of a second operation, it was requested that a delegation of Rwandan refugees from Uganda should come to Rwanda on the 28th of September in order to see the country and familiarise themselves with areas identified by the government of Rwanda.  That delegation never came.  You know what happened on the 1st of October.  I'm saying on the 28th of September 1990 the delegation had to come, and from that date on, to the 1st of October 1990, the RPF launched its attack, and that explains why the RPF threatened the UNHCR to put an end to the registration of refugees who wanted to return. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, you have described the members of that commission that came from -- or, sent by Rwanda, the OAU and the UNHCR and so on.  But you have not told the Court who represented the refugees from Uganda or refugees in other countries that -- where they had found refugees -- refuge.  You have also not talked about how the list of those refugees was drawn up. 
A.	It was the Rwandan (sic) delegation of refugees that had to play the middle person.  They had accepted to send a delegation of refugees during negotiations.  The Rwandan (sic) delegation accepted that responsibility.  It was the Ugandan delegation that played the main -- the intermediary, because the commission was between two states and two international organisations.  But Uganda had the responsibility.  Uganda had the responsibility of making these conclusions known to the refugees.  
Q.	What happened to the conclusions and proposals made by the commission after the 1st of October 1990? 
A.	I think as far as the RPF was concerned, that was the end.  They didn't want to come to Rwanda peacefully but through military means.  We tried to define corridors through which refugees could enter Rwanda.  The RPF closed those corridors.  And no one showed up.  The first refugees started to show up in 1992, when the whole area cleared by RPF combatants became empty.  And that is when refugees from Uganda started settling in a clandestine manner.  
Q.	I would like to raise a point of clarification, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  In the discussions between the commission and Uganda, was the RPF represented? 
A.	No, that is what I am saying.  The RPF was not a known entity at the time referred to.  The RPF became known during the attack.  What we knew at the time referred to was refugees represented by UNHCR.  In fact, there were no political -- political demands.  These refugees only wanted to return.  There were no political demands from the refugees in Uganda at the time.  I do not know whether my explanation is satisfactory. 
Q.	I think I understand what you want to say.  I'm going to summarise it in one question:  The Rwandan commission, the OAU, the UNHCR were misled or deceived by Uganda.  
A.	I'm afraid that is the answer.  I believe so.  I -- I'm afraid Uganda played a double role, they accepted to come and discuss, to play the role of intermediary, but at the same time they played another role on a different agenda.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, you mentioned the RPF in our discussions.  I am going to come -- take you back much further in order to talk about the origin of the RPF.  

How old were you in 1959? 
A.	Twenty years.  I was 20 years old. 
Q.	Where were you during the events that shook Rwanda at the time referred to? 
A.	Those events started in November 1959.  I was in Grade 13, the last year of high school.  But as you know, the school year stretches over two years.  So that was '59-'60.  I was in the last year of high school in the College Saint Paul in Bukavu. 
Q.	Here before this Court we followed the testimony of ****************, who is a member of the ***************-- his testimony regarding these events.  Can you tell us regarding the period in question, what the situation was, the situation between the Hutu and Tutsi communities?  What was the social situation as a whole regarding the two ethnic groups? 
A.	I think there were many problems.  There were many problems between the various communities, particularly between the Hutu and Tutsi communities.  I'll give you an example.  There were 45 chieftaincies, 45 provinces that were referred to as chieftaincies.  There were 45 chieftaincies.  And all of these 45 chieftaincies were headed by Tutsis, only Tutsis.  

Tutsis themselves were complaining.  They were saying that among those 45 chieftaincies, three-quarters of them were headed by the royal family.  So discontent, contrary to what uninformed people think, discontent was not only on the Hutu side but also amongst the Tutsis.  The Tutsis complained that the majority of these chieftaincies were headed by the royal family.  

There were 559 sub-chiefs at the time, that is, in 1959.  Only three of these sub-chiefs, that is, out of 559, only three of those sub-chiefs were Hutus.  

In magistracy, that is, in the courts under the chieftaincies and the Mwami courts, the Mwami courts that played the role of sort of supreme court, there was no Hutu at all.  All the magistrates were Tutsi.  I do not know any one of them who was Hutu.  

In fact, at 20 years I was old enough.  I used to go on holiday.  So I'm not aware of any Hutu who was a magistrate.  I believe all of them were Tutsi.  

Now, the situation or the deterioration did not start all of a sudden.  Hutu intellectuals wrote a manifesto.  They made demands.  They introduced -- or, made demands to the king.  They made demands addressed to the Belgians and the United Nations.  

In fact, Belgium was in charge of the trusteeship under the authority of the United Nations.  But I believe that what happened later on -- well, I was not there, I read it.  Now, the response was so negative because it was said that between the Hutus and Tutsis they did not enjoy any fraternity, any brother relations, that they had nothing in common since there was no brotherhood amongst them.  I think this is what the royal family said, and this -- it was this reckless attitude which made most of the people think that there was no dialogue possible between the Hutus and Tutsis.  But, in spite of that, it was not the ordinary people which triggered the unrest or problems.  Perhaps we'll see that later on. 
Q.	What change did that revolution lead to, that is, in the political landscape of Rwanda?  What change did that revolution lead to? 
A.	First of all, one would be tempted to say that the republic came into being, but that does not reflect historical reality.  As a matter of fact -- well, the leaders of the revolution were not only Hutus.  There were also Tutsi revolutionaries who came together under the party called RADER, Rassemblement democratique rwandais.  R-A-D-E-R.  

In that movement, the RADER, there were even princes who did not approve of keeping in place or keeping alive the monarchy.  So, they opted for a constitutional monarchy.  And perhaps because of their stubbornness, if I may use that word, it was because of the obstinacy of the monarchy's entourage that people became more radical and the republic was then created in 1961. 

What was referred to as a coup d'état of Gitarama -- Gitamara, G-I-T-A-R-A-M-A -- the coup d'état of 28th January 1961.  But that republic was not recognised and that is the reason why the United Nations decided, through a resolution, the number of which I forget, that there will be a referendum on 27 September 1961, so that the people of Rwanda should decide whether they want to continue under a monarchy or under a republic.  

Now, the results of the referendum showed that the people of Rwanda wanted a republic, and that is how we became independent on -- in July -- on the 1st of July 1962.  A republic was already a recognised entity under the United Nations. 
Q.	Thank you.  I would like you now to talk to the Court about Inyenzis.  When did this word appear in the Rwanda vocabulary?  And what does it represent within this historical context?  "Inyenzi", what does it stand for? 
A.	From 1960, practically speaking, the monarchists who had sought refuge abroad had formed armed groups which attacked Rwanda from various angles, often at the same time.  At that time, following the independence of the Congo, they had an alliance with Congolese rebels to fight together, because they referred to their fight as a struggle against colonialism.  And this continued up until 1968, which was a rather extended period of war.  Those persons referred to themselves as the Inyenzi.  I don't know whether I should repeat what Mr. Sow already elaborately presented to the Court here.  

What I am saying is that the word "Inyenzi" is not a pejorative word or name.  It is actually a name that was adopted by that group which, in effect, is an abbreviation of a longer sentence, "Ingangurarugo ziyemeje kuba ingenzi", meaning "combatants who had decided to be the best".  That is the loose translation of that expression. "Inyenzi", therefore, is the abbreviation of that sentence, in Kinyarwanda.  I cannot spell out all of that.  But, I think that we can provide the sentence for the court reporters as need be.  

The word "Inyenzi", therefore, is not a pejorative word.  It was not a word or name given by the Rwandan government.  It was adopted by the monarchists themselves.  And I say monarchists.  Mr. President, once more, in order to be clear on the facts.  The monarchist party, that is, the national union of Rwanda was not only made up of Tutsis.  The president was a Hutu.  The vice president was a cousin to the president and there was one Rebero.  R-E-B-E-R-O for Rebero.  And there were members of parliament from the UNAR.  And I know at least two of them who were also party to those arrangements in the context of that war.  That is why I referred to these people as monarchists, not as Tutsis.  Because it would be incorrect to think that the monarchy was made up only of Tutsis.  

There were other people who supported the monarchy and fought for it. 
Q.	Flowing from what you have just said, I would like to know from you whether the 1959 revolution was based on ethnicity or could it be said that it was a revolution against all the injustices that were perpetrated at that time? 
A.	Initially, it was not ethnic based, because I have already told you that even among the princes of the monarchy there were people who had gone to school and studied, and many of them supported the revolution.  Let me take those who attended missionary schools, which were not recognised by the Belgian government, and therefore did not have certificates.  They had gone to school, they had studied philosophy, they could speak French and what have you.  But they did not access to public employment because the system was rather limiting in the use of such persons.  

So what I can say is that I know many children of chiefs who replaced their parents in this 
close-knit system to which access was very difficult.  What I'm saying, therefore, is that the revolution was not ethnic based as such, although some may mistakenly have perceived it to be.  I have already told you that in the monarchists' party there were also Hutu leaders and it was not an exclusively Tutsi party. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, was the 1959 revolution a genocide of the Tutsi? 
A.	No.  I have already told you that Hutu of the high society were also members of the UNAR, but there were also ordinary citizens who were overwhelmed by various myths.  You see, at the time, Rwandans were convinced that without the monarch, cows will no longer produce milk but would produce blood.  And so people were ignorantly misled by those myths.  I have also said the revolution targeted a system, and may I say that there is somebody who benefited from it although he may forget and refer to it as genocide.  You see, it is the revolution that actually opened the door for Kagame to become president.  You see, to be king one had to be of the Abanyiginya clan.  One had to be --
Q.	I am sorry, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Please, would you spell the word which you just mentioned.  
A.	Abanyiginya.  A-B-A-N-Y-I-G-I-N-Y-A, Abanyiginya. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
And, Mr. President, if the witness could kindly repeat his answer.  The interpreters lost him.
THE WITNESS: 
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I thought the interpreters were requesting you to repeat? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, before I clarify these matters I would like to know at what time we break for the day.  Is it at 12:30?  I just want to very politely draw your attention to the fact that I am, unfortunately, tiring out because of the circumstances you are familiar with.  If we're going to sit till 1 p.m. I will make the necessary effort, but I just wanted to know, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, we had scheduled to sit until 1 o'clock.  So, let's see how it goes.  If it's necessary we will break early but we would like to stick to our schedule, if possible. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I would like right now to request that we stop at 12:30 for today -- at least for today, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's proceed now.  Let's.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, I would like you first of all to spell out Abanyiginya, and then kindly repeat your answer to the question, because I know I interrupted you.  And if you may, please, this is the question:  Was the 1959 revolution tantamount to a genocide of the Tutsi?  And that is the question you were answering.  
A.	Thank you.  The revolution did not target an ethnic group, it targeted a system.  That is what I was saying.  One of the beneficiaries of the revolution, although he refers to it as a "genocide", and pursuant to the customary law in Rwanda at the time, President Paul Kagame had no possibility of ever becoming head of state.  It is thanks to the revolution that the doors have been opened to him.  According to royal mythology one had to be an Abanyiginya, spelt A-B-A-N-Y-I-G-I-N-Y-A, that was the only clan, under customary law, which had access to the monarchy or to become king.  

Now, in addition to that there were other myths; namely, that one had to be born with some seeds in one's hand.  And those who were the guardians of the esoteric, dynastic and royal code had to check at birth whether such a baby came with those seeds in his -- or, in his hand.  Now, these are myths that were destroyed by the revolution.  You see, the king's brothers who did not go abroad, who remained in Rwanda, died simple, ordinary deaths in their beds at home.  You see, a prince came here to testify and told you how he fled the country.  These are some of the things that happened at that time. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, a short while ago you told us that you had been minister of justice and that if we were to go back to 1980 and look at the transformations that occurred in Rwanda, we may observe a number of things.  I would therefore like to ask you what happened subsequent to the La Baule conference.  Did you attend that conference?  Did you follow up what happened, particularly given that you were very attentive to all that transpired in your country; what happened at that time? 
A.	President Habyarimana, president of the republic at the time, even before 1990 -- in 1989, I believe -- had decided to transform the political structures of the country.  In order to do so and prior to the RPF attack -- and my point here being that democratisation was not precipitated by the RPF attack since the decision had been taken way before then -- he created what has been referred to as the synthesis commission which was chaired by Édouard Karemera, my friend.  I was a member of that committee, and I was a member of the subcommittee that drafted the constitution on behalf of the commission. 
Q.	What position did you hold in that committee -- or, in what capacity were you a member of this commission? 
A.	Well, the truth is that nobody knew in what capacity they were members of that commission.  It was simply an appointment by the head of state intuitu personae, to the extent that the commission was made up of persons from all walks of life, including a bishop, a nun, Hutus and Tutsis and Twas and trade unionists and all manner of people from all walks of life.  

The commission was set up at the time by the president as he wished, bringing together various categories of persons.  Now, after the amendment of the constitution several members of that commission became members of opposition parties, parties opposed to the president.  So you can see that in order to further demonstrate his goodwill he decided to create a commission for restructuring, the commission for restructuring, which was charged with reviewing the status of the party, given that the new constitution had ushered in a multiparty era.  

My understanding at the time, therefore, was that the single-party era was over and the restructuring commission had to delete any reference to the single party and any areas where the state and the single party may be mistaken for the one or the other.  I became and remained a member of the MRND new format.  The structure had changed completely.  The modus operandi had changed completely and we had a brand new party created by the restructuring commission.  I was not a member of the restructuring commission because apparently they did not want any interference between the two commissions; namely, the synthesis or the summary commission and restructuring commission.  I do not know how the restructuring commission functioned because I was not a member thereof, but I am aware of the results of its deliberations. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, throughout this second part of our hearing today, we have been attempting to lay the historic background for the causes of the Rwandan tragedy.  You have just mentioned the 1959 revolution, and now you have referred to the significant changes that were introduced by President Habyarimana to move the country forward towards multiparty politics.  That brings a question to my mind relating to one of the skeletons that the accusation is holding out against you.  And this is a speech which you are alleged to have delivered.  We will return to that speech subsequently, but at this juncture I would like you to say a word or two on the speech of 16th January 1994.  Prosecution witnesses have referred to statements that you allegedly made in that speech calling for the elimination of Tutsis.  

Now, against the background of what you have just said, can you briefly clarify your position vis-à-vis this interpretation that I have reminded you of? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, this speech does exist.  I know that Witness AWD testified that during that speech of 16th of January I allegedly said that the Tutsis should be exterminated.  I am not bothered by his testimony because the statement -- or, rather, the speech is available.  It exists.  And when the time will come we will deal with the speech.  
Now, in relation to that speech, I said that I did not want the events of 1959 to reoccur.  Maybe that was a visionary or prophetic statement.  People did not heed my call, and they went on into exile.  Well, you know what happened.  There is a UN report which was published stating that these people had been exterminated.  But this is what I attempted to avoid, to stop these people from going into exile.  How can you support the extermination of Tutsis and yet encourage that which happened in 1959?  From simple logic I think things hold together.  And if that were to be something that was said in any speech then we would find the speech and find the information.  That is the answer I can provide.  
Q.	Now, one question, which I did not put to you before now because it was not necessary, is the following:  We have talked about your professional background, your social background, and then in 1990-1991 you became politically active, so to speak.  Question:  Why before that time there was no political involvement on your part?  Why did it happen at that time? 
A.	That is true.  But it is also true that I had not experienced such an interesting period when it comes to the destiny of my people and of my country.  I had not experienced such a dangerous situation either.  You see, multiparty politics was being introduced at this time of the onset of the war.  So, my concern was to work with my compatriots for the achievement of democracy within the context of peace, mutual understanding and dialogue.  I did not want any confrontation whatsoever to take place.  By nature and by training and by belief I do not like confrontation.  I do not like confrontation because it often does not lead to anything.  However, dialogue always leads to something very interesting.  It is for these reasons that I became politically involved, because I believed that working with the other Rwandans at that time we had to work together, as a matter of necessity, in order to go through these changes.  And my hope was that negotiations will take place and conclude in a mutual understanding with our brothers and sisters who were abroad.  

It was my conviction that through such dialogue we would end up having peace.  And those were my motivations and motives.  Otherwise, I could simply, as previously was the case, keep away from politics.  But you see, throughout my testimony we may be able to see subsequently that by staying out and by being absent maybe things would have deteriorated, and may I say that because I stayed on and because I became involved maybe there was some improvement in the area of dialogue between political parties and service to others.  And in my heart I am convinced that I did a good thing.  
Q.	One last question.  When you decided to become politically active, what specific action did you undertake?  Did you remain within the MRND?  Did you become a member of the MRND? 
A.	Well, I just referred to that.  I just told the Trial Chamber that the MRND which you are referring to no longer existed because it did not have status, it did not own any property.  You see, my brother, Édouard Karemera, negotiated for the setting up of the multiparty government on the 16th of April 1992.  What he did was that the property of the former MRND was handed back -- or, handed over to the state at the same time.  And when we started the new MRND we started from scratch without any property, with a new constitution and new structures that were set up entirely different from the MRND as it was known under the single party.  The new MRND had a steering committee and new structures that were different from the former MRND.  Article 7 of the 1978 constitution had been amended and the political landscape was opened so that all and sundry could create their own political parties.  That is why the one-party MRND system was no longer in place.  It was no longer legally existent.  It did not have any status and it did not own any property. 
Q.	Could you give the date of the death of the one-party MRND?  I know I somehow provoked you by asking these questions, these issues.  
A.	It was on the 10th of June 1991.  At that time the new constitution of the new party was introduced and signed on the 5th of July 1991.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, we are not sure we got the date correctly. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, as interpreters just said, could you just repeat the date, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  The constitution was amended on the 10th of June 1991.  And the statutes of the MRND were signed by the members of the MRND on the 5th of July -- July 1991.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	When you became politically active, which position did you occupy in the new MRND in 1991 and how did that happen? 
A.	I did not take up any position.  When negotiations with opposition parties concluded, the ministry of justice, which was my portfolio, was handed over to the Liberal Party.  It is only at the congress of 28th April 1992 that I was elected national secretary.  Prior to that date I was the chairman of the MRND in the Kigali-ville préfecture.  Those are the positions that I occupied but there was no salary for that position, except for that of national secretary.  Although subsequently the president and vice president positions were services provided free of charge.  
Q.	You -- or rather, when did you become president of MRND of Kigali town?  
A.	I believe that was in 1971 (sic), but I do not remember the precise date. 
Q.	Were you elected to that position? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you repeat the date, please, the day.  I'm not sure if what you said was properly translated as terms of the date when you became president of MRND in Kigali town. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I did not specify the date.  I gave the year because the date I do not remember.  The year is 1991.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  It had been previously stated to be 1971.  That is what I was trying to clarify.  
THE WITNESS: 
If the error was mine I apologise. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Says the witness.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel's microphone. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Can you answer the question whether you were elected to that position or whether you were designated; tell us what happened? 
A.	Initially, I think it was some kind of coordination but I was elected by the préfectoral committee to that position.  In fact, it was an elective position; the position of a chairman of a party of the préfecture was an elective position.  So I was elected to that post. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, can I request you to call the proceedings or bring the proceedings to an end for this morning? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You know, Ms. Hounkpatin, I don't know if it is just a question of style, you haven't given a reason why we should bring it to an end now.  Are we supposed to assume that something -- that your health was deteriorated that your -- or, whatever.  We have a schedule to sit until 1 o'clock.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, perhaps I did not understand you clearly earlier on.  Indeed, I had noted that the end of proceedings was at 1 o'clock.  But, however, I did state that for health reasons, for reasons of tiredness, in fact, since this morning I have been having a fever.  I expressed a wish that we should stop at 12:30.  I understood you said yes.  Perhaps this is a misinterpretation of what you said. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
What I said was that we would proceed and see how things went.  I've understood that you were going to try to sit until 1 o'clock, but if your health deteriorated you would have explained that to us and we could have decided to respond to that.  You didn't -- you just assumed that you would stop when you wanted to.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I do not want to stop when I wish.  I brought an application before you.  I sought that we stop the proceedings at this point in time because since this morning I've been having a fever and I am unable to continue.  If you want to consider my application, I would appreciate that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take into account the state of the proceedings and we certainly would not want the testimony of the accused to be visited under adverse circumstances, so we will take the adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1239H)
