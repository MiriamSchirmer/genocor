MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you start the proceedings, please.  
MR. DIALLO:  
I thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, comprised of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is sitting today, Thursday, 20 May 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al.,

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I apologise for my lateness.  When I entered the courtroom I didn't even realise the Court was on the bench.  My apologies.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:

MR. PRESIDENT:
We welcome you to the Tribunal and to our case proceedings.
JOSEPH NZIRORERA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Nzirorera.
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson.  
Q.	Yesterday we were speaking of events in the fourth quarter of 1991, and I would like you to look at document number 11 in our bundle of exhibits.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, am I the only one hearing something in my ear?  I'm hearing some screeching.  But are you hearing that also?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm hearing it too.  

Mr. Registrar, can you assist us.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, you can put your headphones on.  

So directing your attention to exhibit number 11, do you recognise that document? 
A.	Yes, I recognise the document. 
Q.	Can you tell us what it is.
A.	Yes.  This document is a letter from the minister of the interior and communal development at the time, and that was Mr. Faustin Munyazesa.  
Q.	And what is the topic of this letter? 
A.	This letter was forwarding a memorandum entitled:  "Memorandum on the Alleged Massacres of the Bagogwe."  It is dated 15 November 1991. 
Q.	And did this memorandum speak about the events which surrounded the RPF attack in January 1991 and some attacks against Bagogwe which followed? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, this letter or this memorandum refers to the RPF attack in Ruhengeri town on 23 January 1991 and the consequences of that attack on the Bagogwes, who belong to the Tutsi ethnicity, as well as the reprisals that were committed by the local population as a result of that attack. 
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber where the Bagogwe lived primarily in relation to Mukingo commune.  
A.	Yes.  The Bagogwes were -- or are a subgroup of the Tutsi ethnic group.  They were -- or they settled in the préfectures of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri and more particularly as regards the Ruhengeri préfecture in the neighbouring communes, the communes that are near the national park of Virunga, the 
volcanic national park.  So this subgroup of the Tutsi ethnicity -- and the Tutsis are supposed to be nomads.  So this subgroup of the Tutsis laid in that area, and some of them could be found in the Ruhengeri préfecture in Nkuli commune, Mukingo commune, Kinigi and Muhumba communes.  

So it is in these areas that some Bagogwes who were in Ruhengeri préfecture could be found.  Of course there were others in Gisenyi préfecture, but I am limiting myself to the Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	What did this report conclude with respect to the events in 1991 in that area? 
A.	In this report, which was forwarded by the minister, the then minister of the interior, it is stated that following the RPF attack, some reprisals were carried out against the Tutsis of the Bagogwe subgroup.  But the report or the memorandum criticises the manner in which the media handled this problem, how they used this problem to demonise the Rwandan government.  

	The memorandum also talks about the local press and mentions in particular some newspapers that were supporters of the RPF.  The memorandum also mentions some foreign publications, in particular, publications in Belgium.  

Thus, the minister of the interior stated first of all that there was an exaggeration of the figures, that through the local and international media it was alleged that there were about one million Tutsis of the Bagogwe ethnic or sub-ethnic group who had been killed, and it is the theory adopted by the Prosecution before this Tribunal.  

The minister of the interior also stated that according to his investigations and the report he received, in Gisenyi and Ruhengeri préfectures there were, at the very most, 144 people killed.  The minister further states that -- that those reports went as far as mentioning certain people who simply went into exile because they had run away from the war; that the report even mentioned those who were still alive as having been killed.  

The report -- or the minister criticised the fact that these newspapers or the informers of the international community simply thought of demonising the Rwandan government without bothering to remember that it was the RPF which was responsible, which caused that situation.  

The report -- or memorandum also highlights the fact that Rwandan authorities were sort of indicted for not having done anything to punish the perpetrators of the killings.  He stated that, nevertheless, in the Ngororero sous-préfecture to which it made reference, the bourgmestre -- or, rather, the sous-préfet of Ngororero sub-préfecture -- Ngororero is N-G-O-R-O-R-E-R-O -- was arrested as well as the bourgmestre and that investigations were underway.  

The minister of interior also stated in this memorandum that the sous-préfet even died in 
prison -- of course he died from natural causes; he was not killed -- and that Rwandan authorities made every effort to calm the situation and that he personally went to the scene.  He added that later on the minister himself, in his capacity as minister of the interior, and the then minister at the presidency in charge of security went to the scene in an attempt to discourage that situation.  

He concluded by stating that as a matter of fact, NGOs which informed the international community or the media are biased and that they sought to -- that while seeking to demonise the 
Rwandan government, they did not say anything about the person who was -- or the people who were the origin of that situation and the responsibility of those who violated the ceasefire that had been agreed.

So this is a summary of this document, which is quite lengthy.  I would also like to add that in this document it is stated -- or, rather, the number of people, the total number of people who died in the 
two préfectures is mentioned.  The document also mentions the number of people in exile.  It even gives the names of people who were mentioned in some reports as having died, even though they were still alive.  

So, Mr. President, Your Honours, this is a summary of this document of 15 November 1991.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that this be admitted as D. NZ813.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ813 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	At the time of these events in early 1991, did the Interahamwe exist? 
A.	No.  In January 1991 there were -- the Interahamwe did not exist.  We were still in a 
single-party system. 
Q.	Now, after the multiparty system came into being in July of 1991, did the political parties begin to create youth wings? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was the first party to create a youth wing? 
A.	It is the MDR that was first to create a youth wing, and that youth wing was called JDR Inkuba.  Inkuba is spelt as follows:  N-I-K-U-B-A (sic).  JDR Inkuba.  Inkuba is a Kinyarwanda word which in French translates as thunder -- or foudré in French, thunder in English.  
Q.	Did any other political parties create youth wings?  
A.	Yes.  The other political parties also created youth wings.  This was the case in particular of the 
PSD party.  This party created its youth wing, and that youth wing was called Abakombozi.  Abakombozi is spelt as follows:  A-B-A-K-O-M-B-O-Z-I.  And the PL also created a youth wing.  That youth wing was called the youth wing of the Parti libéral, the Liberal Party. 
Q.	Now, we've had testimony from a number of witnesses that the MRND Interahamwe began in November 1991.  Did you have anything to do with that? 
A.	In November 1991 I was still a member of government.  And as I told you, I had lost my post as a member of the central committee of the MRND the month of May.  Therefore, according to what I learnt, I heard that the Interahamwe were created in November 1991, but I was not involved in that creation.  

But it should also be said that we know and we acknowledge that the MRND youth wing was not even a creation of the MRND party.  It was the initiative of young people themselves, the young people of the MRND party.  It was a private initiative that was taken by a certain Désiré Murenzi.  So it is not the party that decided that a youth wing called "Interahamwe" be created, but it is the young people themselves, young people who were members of the MRND party and who hailed from the 
préfecture of Kigali, who took that initiative to organise themselves as a youth wing in order to help the party. 
Q.	Now, at the end of 1991 was a government appointed led by Prime Minister Sylvestre Nsanzimana? 
A.	Yes.  After the creation of political parties, there was a prime minister who was designated in the month of October 1991.  That prime minister had the mandate of consulting political parties in order to form a new government.  And there was a government that was formed on the 30th of December 1991.  I was not a member of that government. 
Q.	So as of the end of 1991, you were no longer a minister? 
A.	That's correct.  I left the government on 30 December 1991.  Therefore, from May 1991 I was no longer a member of the central committee of the MRND, and from 30 December 1991 I was not a member of the government either.  I remained as an ordinary member of parliament at the CND, the so-called national development committee, the parliament. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time in early 1992 when elections were held for the préfectoral committee of the MRND?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Interpreters in the French booth did not follow counsel's question.  Could counsel repeat, please.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I'm going to ask the question again.  In early 1992 were there elections held for préfectoral committees of the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  The MRND started a democratic process to elect members of its various organs.  I told you that already in May 1991 the chairmen of the MRND various préfectures were elected, and the purpose of this was to organise the MRND congress.  
	But in the month of February 1992 the MRND initiated a democratisation process through which people will be elected to the various organs of the party.  And it was in that month of February 1992 that once more I submitted my candidature to be elected as a member of the préfectoral committee of Ruhengeri. 
Q.	And were you elected? 
A.	Yes, I was elected.  I think you can find a list of all members of the préfectoral committee from all the préfectures of the country in the document dated February 1992, which document was forwarded by the national secretary of the MRND at the time referred to.  That was Mr. Édouard Karemera.  The document was transmitted to the chairmen of the MRND, and that was in February 1992.  I therefore confirm that I was indeed elected a member of the préfectoral committee of Ruhengeri. 
Q.	How many members were there of that committee? 
A.	Twenty. 
Q.	And were you elected to a position of an officer of that committee? 
A.	Yes.  I was the vice-chairman of the committee, the vice-chairman of the 
Ruhengeri préfectoral committee.  The chairman was Casimir Bizimungu. 
Q.	What was the reaction of the opposition to the Nsanzimana government at the beginning of 1992? 
A.	Opposition political parties, as I told you yesterday, around the month of September set up a consultation forum.  In that forum they had to exchange views in order to adopt a common position against the MRND and against President Habyarimana.  It is also in that context that you should understand that they set up the youth wings of their respective political parties.  

When President Habyarimana designated the prime minister, Sylvestre Nsanzimana -- I hope the spelling is known.  It is N-S-A-N -- or, rather, N -- S-I-M-A-N-A (sic), Nsanzimana, Sylvestre -- the president, Habyarimana, asked him to contact all opposition political parties to form a 
coalition government that would bring together the main political parties.  This would make it possible to have a party in which various parties -- or, rather, a government in which various parties were represented.  But these parties raised the bar.  There were no elections that would have made it possible to know their weight within the population.  

First of all, they challenged the designation or appointment of the prime minister because they thought it was their post, that it was for them to have that post.  They wanted to have the lion's share in the cabinet.  

So, as you can see, Nsanzimana had been appointed, but they put spokes in his wheels.  And they organised demonstrations, violent demonstrations, in order to destabilise the 
Nsanzimana government.  Those demonstrations started as early as January 1992.  
Q.	And at that time you were a private citizen? 
A.	Yes.  As I told you, from 30 December 1991, I was no longer engaged in politics.  I was on retirement,  so I was an ordinary citizen.  Of course, I was still a member of parliament.  
Q.	And how did you spend your time during 1992? 
A.	When I left the government and when I stopped being a member of the central committee and in particular from January 1992 -- first of all, when you were a minister in Rwanda at the time, you were given an official residence.  So when I was dismissed from the government I had to move from the government residence given to me.  I tried to find a house elsewhere.  At the same time I undertook the construction of my private residence, which I designed and I supervised the construction thereof.  
Q.	Does that occupy most of your time on a daily basis, the supervision of the construction of your residence? 
A.	I would check -- I would say that when I left politics I thought I could reorganise myself to carry out my private business.  First of all, I decided to construct my house as soon as possible in order to avoid paying rents every month.  In addition to that, I also started reorganising my private business, to develop my business.  I told you that my wife was involved in business.  I tried to assist her.  And that was my main concern.  I sought to forget politics, and I thought that I had to reorganise myself for the development of my private business.  Therefore, I didn't lack what to do.  I left aside what was politics. 
Q.	Now, I'd like to direct your attention to document 12 in our bundle of exhibits pertaining to the events in Bugesera in March of 1992.  Do you recognise that document? 
A.	Yes, I recognise it. 
Q.	What is it? 
A.	It is a letter dated 18 March 1992.  The minister of interior, Mr. Faustin Munyaseza, addressed this letter to the prime minister.  And the letter talks about security problems which existed at the time in Bugesera.  So he was giving him an account of the meeting which was held in the 
ministry of the interior and which dealt on these security matters, the security problems which occurred in Bugesera during that period of 1992. 
Q.	And what was your understanding of what had happened in Bugesera? 
A.	In Bugesera there were problems, security problems.  Those security problems were caused, first of all, by the situation created by what was referred to as infiltrations of RPF elements, RPF elements from Burundi.  The Bugesera region shares a border with Burundi.  At some point in time these security problems became worse as mines and explosives were laid in that area.  

Later on there was a meeting held in Bugesera, a meeting of the Parti libéral, the PL party.  That meeting was held in early March 1992.  The PL party held a rally, and during that rally there were speeches made.  Violent utterances were made against the bourgmestre of that commune.  During that period political parties became agitated.  There were confrontations, interethnic confrontations.  So the meeting was held in order to see how to calm that situation to restore peace in that region.  
Q.	Now, according to the report of the minister of interior, was there some suggestion of 
civil or self-defence as one way to try to deal with this problem? 
A.	Yes.  The measures envisaged -- you can read or see them on page 3, 1.5.  You would see there that there was a recommendation regarding the organisation of the people's defence.  So 1.5 on page 3 states that the system of patrols and roadblocks for controls should be reactivated and maintained in all cellules, as was the practice at the beginning of the war.  The préfet of Kigali had to contact or liaise with security services involved in matters of security.  It is for this reason that I was telling you -- or, rather, repeating that the self-defence or civil defence programme was a matter that was dealt with by the government administrative authorities and not political parties. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that document number 12 in my bundle of exhibits be admitted as D. NZ814.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ814 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, to your knowledge did the Interahamwe have anything to do with the Bugesera events? 
A.	To my knowledge -- well, I do not know.  I am not aware of that. 
Q.	Well, did you have anything to do with the Interahamwe in March of 1992? 
A.	No.  As I have already told you, I did not have anything to do with the Interahamwe at that time.  
By the way, the Interahamwe movement as such, I only became aware of its existence specifically in April 1992.  So I do not know whether it was because I was somewhat retired from politics at that time, but the point is that I was not very aware of the activities of the Interahamwe at that time. 
Q.	Did you ever attend a fund-raising event for the Interahamwe at the Rebero hotel? 
A.	No.  I never attended any fund-raising activity for the Interahamwe at Hotel Rebero.  But I know that hotel very well and I often went there. 
Q.	In April of 1992 was a coalition government formed? 
A.	Yes.  I know that there was a protocol of the 7th of April 1992, a protocol agreement for the formation of the coalition government.  That protocol was negotiated by various political parties, and I believe that Mr. Karemera is in a better position to provide details.  But at that time I was abroad.  And I know that the government was sworn in on the 16th of April 1992 with Dismas Nsengiyaremye serving as 
prime minister.  Nsengiyaremye is a name that is well known in the court. 
Q.	Were you a member of that government? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, what about President Habyarimana?  In April of 1992 did he leave his post with the Rwandan army? 
A.	Yes.  President Habyarimana was under pressure, as people said that he should not maintain his position as chief of the army, that he should rather opt for politics.  So he resigned from the army -- well, what I can say is that he retired from the army. 
Q.	And at that time in April 1992, did he remain the president of the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  In April 1992 Habyarimana was the president of the MRND, while Édouard Karemera was the national secretary.  And during that very month of April, Karemera was replaced by 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse in the position of national secretary of the MRND party. 
Q.	Did you attend the congress of 28 April 1992 of the MRND? 
A.	Yes, I attended that congress. 
Q.	And at that congress we've had evidence that there was a resolution passed about the Interahamwe.  What was your understanding of that resolution? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  As is the case in all congresses, there is always a progress report on the activities of the party.  The issue of the Interahamwe arose, and the MRND had already adopted its statutes on the 
5th of July 1991 in which there was provision under articles 61 and 62 for the possibility of organisations to be created which would be integrated or affiliated to the MRND.  

The provisions of the statutes are very clear, namely, that organisations may be formed or constituted within the MRND.  That is the first principle.  The second principle is that once such organisations are created within the party, they are free to prepare their own rules and regulations, and that once such organisations have been set up, they are free to determine the modalities for collaboration with the MRND, subject to the submission of their rules and regulations to the national committee of the MRND for approval.  That is the interpretation that must be given to articles 61 and 62 of the MRND statutes.  

So at the end of the congress people talked about the Interahamwe phenomenon.  A draft resolution was circulated to the participants, and each préfectoral committee was supposed to come to a decision on that draft.  At the end of the day the format that was agreed to appears under item 4 of the resolutions.  You see, the Interahamwe youth organisation had been created in PVK Kigali at the behest exclusively of some young persons.  The idea therefore was that the provisional steering committee they had set up did not represent much, and that is why the MRND felt that the committee, the steering committee, ought to have been more representative and voted into office by the youth themselves, who were the owners of the movement.  

It is in that connection that the recommendation was made to extend the activities of the organisation to communes and préfectures, even those outside Kigali-ville préfecture.  That is all I can say for now.  But if you want any further details, I am ready to read out the provisions of the statutes to you.  But I am sure that we will have to deal with those things when we get to the Prosecutor's cross-examination. 
Q.	After the congress of April 1992, did the members of the Ruhengeri préfecture committee, of which you were one of 20, take any decision or have any discussion about whether there should be Interahamwe formed in Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	First of all, let me say that while being a member of the Ruhengeri committee and vice-president of the congress, I must say that I did not attend many of the préfectoral committee meetings in Ruhengeri in 1992.  And even in 1993 I clearly attended a few meetings but not many of the 
préfectoral committee meetings.  

But I know that there was never any decision taken to introduce the Interahamwe into 
Ruhengeri préfecture.  The meeting referred to by Nahimana I did not attend because I was travelling abroad often, and during that time I was more concerned with organising my own personal businesses.  And it was my understanding that during the single-party system the party had benefitted enormously from my services.  And when I was dropped out of the central committee and of government, I came to the conclusion that my services were no longer needed, so I had to focus all my energies elsewhere.  So that is all I can say.  

But in any event, although -- and because I was a member of the préfectoral committee in Ruhengeri, I can confirm to you that there never was any decision taken at that level to extend or implement that congress resolution in Ruhengeri.  The statutes were very clear, and we always acted cautiously. 
Q.	Do you know Esdras Baheza? 
A.	Yes, I know Baheza.  He was a trader at the Byangabo centre.  I know him very well. 
Q.	What do you say to the testimony of Witness HH who claimed that he was president of Interahamwe in Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	That is absolutely incorrect. 
Q.	Was Mr. Baheza part of youth? 
A.	No.  No.  Baheza was a businessman.  He was an elderly businessman, and he took care of his businesses.  I do not even know who Witness HH may have conceived this gentleman to be.  Maybe he never even saw him.  I believe that Witness HH does not know Baheza. 
Q.	Now, during 1992 through July of 1993 when you became MRND secretary general, can you tell us approximately how many times you went to Mukingo commune? 
A.	Which period are you referring to, '92 to '93?  
Q.	Yes, from January 1992 to July 1993 when you became MRND secretary general.
A.	Well, yes.  I must tell you that when I left government I was more involved in running my own businesses, and I had more businesses in Kigali than in Ruhengeri.  That is one point.  Secondly, the war had broken out.  And whenever a ceasefire was breached, Ruhengeri was between a  
rock and a hard place.  That was the case on the 23rd of January 1991.  And you also want to know that there were some problems that arose in 1992.  I therefore had to try to go to Ruhengeri every now and then.  But contrary to what some Prosecution witnesses have claimed, the frequency with which I went to Ruhengeri préfecture, particularly in Mukingo commune, was significantly low, particularly for reasons of security.  
So it was possible that I went to Ruhengeri at some very specific times to attend to some specific functions, a meeting of the préfectoral committee, for example, if it did hold at a time when I was in the country.  I could also have gone to attend a family ceremony, such as a wedding or a death ceremony.  It is on those occasions then that I felt urged to go to Ruhengeri.  It also could have happened that the ESTB school needed my services, particularly when parents had to deal with one issue or the other.  That was also an opportunity to go.  

However, I am not able to give you the exact dates, but I think that if we are able to identify the specific events we may say that on such and such a day I was there.  My statement to the Trial Chamber, however, is that the number of trips I made to Ruhengeri at that time were significantly reduced.  In fact, I locked my house in that commune and returned to Kigali where I stayed and where the bulk of my businesses were operating.  And you know that to start one's own businesses is not an easy task.  I have also told you that I was also building a house for myself. 
Q.	Did you ever hold any meetings of authorities at your mother's house in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Never.  Why?  Why would I do so in my mother's house?  I had my own house.  Well, some people who are said to have attended such meetings lived in Kigali, so if I wanted to hold any meetings, I would have held them in Kigali.  So please don't pay any attention to those stories. 
Q.	Did you ever hold any meetings with Michel Niyagaba, Alexis Rukundo or any of the young people in Mukingo commune who have been labeled as Interahamwe? 
A.	Never.  Mr. Robinson, I think that everything becomes possible when one is in prison.  You see, now there is a claim that I held meetings with those people.  Maybe they were not even able to see me at the time.  Witness GB even testified that we shared some champagne together.  Well, I can only accept all what they can say because I'm in prison.  They can say whatever they want to say.  But I wonder how they would have met me, those people. 
Q.	Did you ever ask anybody to take down the flags of any political parties in Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	Never.  Why would I do so?  What for?  Political parties flew their flags in Kigali. 
Q.	Did you ever order any of these young people to attack an individual named Makoni? 
A.	I do not even know Makoni. 
Q.	Did you ever distribute MRND uniforms to these young people in Mukingo? 
A.	No, I never distributed any uniforms.  And by the way, for now I do not know what they mean by uniforms.  You see, the MRND had some fabrics and some distinctive insignia of the party, which all militants were free to wear, both the MRND and other political parties.  So when reference is made to a uniform, what is the definition?  I can understand that the military would have a uniform.  
School children would have a uniform as an attire which must be worn on a daily basis in order to identify with one group or the other.  

So, first of all, I am not aware of the use of any uniform as such by the MRND.  However, I know that the MRND had distinguishing or distinctive insignia or signs.  These included the 
kitenge multi-coloured fabric.  It also included wristwatches and ties and scarves and caps.  And any member of the party was free to acquire any of those insignia from any of the shops where those materials were sold.  And for the fabric, one was free to purchase the fabric and design them to fit their own styles.  I think we received here in evidence a kitenge attire or a uniform, or should I call it a kitenge fabric, of a two- or three-year-old child.  Could we then say that such a two-year-old child was an Interahamwe?  

So you saw on the video cassette of the MRND meeting or rally in Ruhengeri on the 
15th of November -- you saw Madam Habyarimana wearing that kitenge attire.  Now, can you say that Madam Habyarimana was an Interahamwe?  My mother also wore the kitenge fabric, and I myself could also wear the kitenge fabric during various rallies.  Was I an Interahamwe?  Were they all Interahamwe?  Well, for its own purposes the opposition claimed that all MRND members or supporters were Interahamwe.  

So it cannot be said that I went to the marketplace and gathered all those rascals and distributed materials to them.  That is untrue.  I never did any such thing.  If a witness has come here and made such representations, it is pure fabrication.  If I had wanted to train any Interahamwe and distribute fabrics to them, I could have gone to the ESTB school where there were some three to four hundred students and distributed those fabrics to them and converted all of them into a school of Interahamwes.  

They were more intelligent than those rascals who were at the marketplace loading vehicles and begging for money here and there.  So I was not there to sustain rascals and hoodlums.  Thank you. 
Q.	Did you have anything to do with any bank account of the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Never.  And I think that the witness who was heard recently and who was the manager of that bank provided all the necessary explanations.  Never. 
Q.	Do you know the building known as Isimbi? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Who was the owner of that building? 
A.	Yes.  The Isimbi building was not really a building as such.  It was an old store at the Byangabo centre, the Byangabo centre, which was an old trading centre.  And that building was bought by my brother-in-law.  He acquired that property in order to conduct his business in it.  My brother-in-law was also a member of the association which created the school.  He acquired that building, and I do not know how people came to say that the building belonged to Nzirorera.  Maybe it is because of the principle of joint property.  But I believe that I did not need that old store for any of my businesses.  

In any event, I have never set foot in that building.  I saw it as I went by on the road.  The house or the building was located on the other side of the tarmac road opposite my mother's house.  And whenever I went by I saw on that building the sign "Isimbi" where initially there was a pharmacy, I was informed.  And then later on during the multiparty era it would appear that the responsable of the cellule requested that an MRND flag be hoisted there.  And you may want to know that during the multiparty era 
political parties were competing and hoisting their flags at various locations.  You can even see that here in Arusha.  You can see the CCM flags and colours on a number of buildings in the city of Arusha.  And that was only fair play.  And so that is all I know.  

Anything else that has been narrated here as regards military training and headquarters of the Interahamwe and what have you, I know nothing about those things.  The fact of the matter is that the building belonged to my brother-in-law, whose name is Vincent Hagumeneza, H-A-G-U-M-E-N-E-Z-A, Hagumeneza, Vincent.  He is the one who had acquired that building.  He was a civil servant working at ELECTROGAZ.  Later on he worked at the Rwandan office for tourism and national parks in Gisenyi at the Méridien hotel. 
Q.	Did you ever give the Isimbi building to the youth of Mukingo for their use? 
A.	I'm not aware of the origin of that matter because I did not take action in that direction.  First of all, the house did not belong to me.  Even though it was my brother-in-law's house, that did not mean that I could use it as I please.  

Secondly, that never happened.  Whether it served as a bar and whether the bar was open to the public, in a bar nobody is excluded.  Anyone who has money can buy a drink.  That's one thing.  

Secondly, that all of this should revolve around Nzirorera, I do not know what happened there.  Talking about training, I do not see how people could say that the Interahamwe went to train in a house, in a shop, in a marketplace.  In the market can military training be carried out?  Common sense shows military training cannot be provided in a market, and especially in a store measuring 
3 metres by 3 metres. 
Q.	Try to keep answers briefer because I simply asked you if you had given the building Isimbi to that youth.  My next question is whether you were aware of any military training -- 
A.	No.  No.  
Q.	Now my next question is whether you are aware of any military training that took place for the youth of Mukingo commune.  
A.	I'm not aware of that. 
Q.	Were you aware of any distribution of weapons to the youth of Mukingo commune? 
A.	I'm not aware of that. 
Q.	Were you ever aware of any lists of Tutsis being compiled in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I'm not aware of that. 
Q.	Were you aware of the existence of any Interahamwe organisation in Mukingo commune? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you have any discussions with Mr. Niyoyita, the president of the MRND in Mukingo, about forming any kind of Interahamwe there? 
A.	Niyoyita came to Kigali one day.  He met me in my house.  He spoke to me about that problem.  I told him that it was necessary to wait for the organisation to adopt their constitutional statute.  That is all I told him. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, returning to the events of 1992 after the Nsengiyaremye government was installed, was there a practice of Kubohoza that you became aware of? 
A.	The Kubohoza practice was in place and it was the MDR party which initiated it.  The prime minister, Nsengiyaremye, was the architect thereof. 
Q.	How did that practice affect the MRND? 
A.	The Kubohoza practice not only affected the MRND but did in the entire country because, as you can understand, first of all that practice was accompanied by acts of violence.  The practice consisted of sending out authorities from their offices and replacing them with other people who were linked to the opposition, so the sitting authorities were forcibly taken out of their offices when they did not want to support the opposition.  

That practice was also very harmful because it attacked development activities.  The coffee plantations were destroyed, coffee plantations which had been developed within the context of 
community development work during the era of the MRND as a single party.  They destroyed 
young forests and torched them.  They destroyed anti-erosion gutters.  

So these were acts of violence which, according to what was said, sought to discourage the MRND, to discourage MRND members in order to enable opposition parties to have their leeway to find every opportunity to carry out their activities.  That was the summary.  But if you want, I can continue. 
Q.	I want to ask you specifically about a meeting of the PL party in Gikongoro on the 24th of May 1992.  Are you familiar with that meeting and what was said about the MRND at that time? 
A.	The rally was broadcast on the radio.  The speeches were broadcast on the radio.  The PL held that meeting in Gikongoro, and one of the speakers who at the time was chairman of the PL party, Mr. Justin Mugenzi, appealed to his colleagues of FDC to suspend any other activity of their party and attack the MRND as well as President Habyarimana and the Interahamwe.  That was the thrust of the speech. 
Q.	Now, we have heard evidence about an MRND march and rally on the 28th of May 1992, 
Pentecostal weekend, which ended in front of the prime minister's office in Kigali.  Were you present for that?  
A.	No, I was not present. 
Q.	Now, during this period we've also had evidence that there were clashes between the youth wings of the different parties, including the PL, MRND and MDR.  Were you aware of those clashes that were going on in Kigali? 
A.	Yes.  I heard about that later on, because on that day I was outside, I was in the suburbs of Kigali.  I left very early in the morning.  Later on when I sought to return I was not able to enter Kigali and had to stay outside Kigali town.  But I learnt that there were clashes between the youth wings of various parties.

1015H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, on the 3rd of June 1992, we've had evidence that there was an agreement made between the FDC -- the Forces of Democratic Change, the opposition parties and the RPF.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	Yes, I'm aware of that.  In fact, the coalition government formed on the 16th of April, in hiding, sent its representatives to Brussels.  But they took only three parties; they were the MDR, the PL and the PSD.  They sent them to meet the RPF in Brussels from 29 May to the 3rd of June 1992, and it was on the 
3rd of June that the communiqué was signed.  And I believe that communiqué has been tendered into evidence before this Chamber.  

I also believe that, at some point in time, we were able to have access to some manuscripts produced by the chairman of the PL party, the Parti Libéral, manuscripts in which he undertook to destroy all Rwandan services of security in the central administration of the communes, the army, and so on.  That was the purpose of the Brussels meeting.  
Q.	And two days later, on the 5th of June 1992, did the RPF attack Rwanda once again? 
A.	Yes.  On 5 June 1992, after the Brussels meeting, whilst their allies had asked them to observe the ceasefire, not to solve the problem through war, the RPF surprised them and attacked Byumba town, which it took on 5 June 1992.  
Q.	Now, I'd like you to look first at exhibit number 13 in our packet of materials.  Do you recognise that? 
A.	Yes.  I'm familiar with this document.  
Q.	Can you tell us what it is.  
A.	Yes.  This document is a document of 18 February 1994.  
Q.	Number 13 in our bundle? 
A.	I'm sorry.  I had heard number 30.  Yes, I have document number 13.  
Q.	What is that document? 
A.	This document is a telegram from the minister of the interior, Mr. Munyaseza, a telegram or cable addressed to all préfets of the various préfectures, and he copied the president of the republic, the prime minister and all the ministers.  

Therefore, in considering the security situation and the information which emerged, a ceasefire was put in place.  A number of measures were also taken.  In particular, identification cards and other documents required had to be checked rigorously.  

So the purpose of this telegram was to draw attention to the insecurity which was increasing in the country.  And it was requested that checks or controls be reinforced.  And as you can see, it is 
dated -- the document is dated 22 May 1992.  This means that they certainly had information.  
And later on, on the 5th of June, the RPF actually attacked and took Byumba town.  That is all I would like to highlight in this document.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that this document number 13 in my bundle be admitted as D. NZ815.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ815 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Nzirorera, can you look at number 15 in our bundle.  Do you recognise that? 
A.	Yes.  I found this document in the bundle of documents disclosed by the Prosecution.  
Q.	And can you tell us, approximately, what the date of this document is.  Although the date isn't appearing on the document itself, from the contents, can you make some kind of estimate as to when this document may have been written? 
A.	In fact, the date is not legible on the document.  But looking at the content of -- of the said document, we see that firearms were distributed to certain communes of the Ruhengeri préfecture, firearms as well as ammunition.  This document also shows that there were four communes:  The Kinigi commune, Nkumba, Kidaho and Butaro.  We also see that the dates are in the year of 1992, from the months 
of -- in the months of March, April and May.  

The document is signed by the préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture, Mr. Silvestre Bariyanga.  And the document is copied for purposes of information to the commander of the operational sector of Ruhengeri. 

What should also be noted is that these communes were part of the Ruhengeri communes that were the subject of fighting between Rwanda and the RPF.  All these communes share a border with Uganda.  

Later on, as you know, the first commune to be seized by the RPF was the Butaro commune, amongst others.  That is all I can say.  These weapons were distributed as part of the self-defence programme of the population.  The arms and ammunition were distributed as part of that programme.  

I would also like to recall that the civil defence programme was a programme run by the government and the administration and not by the MRND party.  You can see from this document that the MRND is not even informed about this distribution.  I thank you.  
Q.	As a member of the préfectoral committee of Ruhengeri in 1992, did you have any information that this distribution was taking place, or were you consulted? 
A.	No.  We were not -- never consulted as members of the préfectoral committee.  All that the 
préfectoral committee could do -- or all that the party could do was to take note of a situation, which was getting worse, and to make recommendations; we could only limit ourselves to this kind of recommendation.  Therefore, I was not consulted by the préfet.  In what capacity would I have been consulted by him? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'd ask that this letter, which is number 15 in my bundle, be admitted as D. NZ816.
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no objection.  I think this is already in evidence as a Prosecution exhibit.  I've been trying to locate the number, and I haven't done so yet.  So my suggestion is that we simply reserve giving it a number because I'm sure that we've -- we've entered it into evidence.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	If you can look at item 14 in our packet of exhibits.  This document includes a memorandum of decisions taken at the cabinet meeting held on the 9th of June 1992 after the RPF attack.  And I'd like to direct your attention to the point number 4, which in English, at least, is on the top of 
page -- continues on the top of page 2, and ask you whether or not this also dealt with the issue of self-defence and, if so, what decision was taken by the cabinet after the RPF attack in June 1992. 
A.	With this document -- or, rather, this document illustrates our theory -- our position according to which the civil defence programme was a matter that fell under the government, and not a matter that fell under a political party or political parties.  

Here on the 9th of June, there was a cabinet meeting chaired by a prime minister, an opposition 
prime minister -- an MDR member, that is, Mr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  Following the RPF attack of 5 June 1992, there was a cabinet meeting.  The meeting was held after designating new chiefs of staff who had to replace the commander-in-chief, Habyarimana.  And the document recommended to the population -- to the administration -- administrative authorities to organise a self-defence programme of the population in areas that were in the combat zone.  

This was a decision taken by the cabinet.  It was not a decision taken by the MRND or any other political party.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'd ask that this document be admitted as D. NZ816.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ816 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Nzirorera, was there a ceasefire agreed to by -- on the 12th of July 1992? 
A.	Yes.  In July 1992, there was a ceasefire.  The ceasefire marked the beginning of negotiations between the government of Rwanda and the RPF.  That was precisely on 12th July 1992.  And the negotiations took place here, in Arusha.  
Q.	And was a protocol agreement on the rule of law entered into in August of 1992? 
A.	When the negotiations started, there were protocol agreements that were signed as the negotiations moved forward.  So, indeed, a protocol was signed on the rule of law.  
Q.	And who conducted those negotiations on behalf of the government of Rwanda? 
A.	On behalf of the government of Rwanda, the delegation was led by the minister of foreign affairs and cooperation.  That was Mr. Boniface Ngulinzira.  Ngulinzira is spelt as follows, N-G-U-L-I-N-Z-I-R-A, Boniface.  
Q.	And what political party did he belong to? 
A.	He was a member of the MDR party.  
Q.	And what part -- or what role did the MRND party play in the Arusha negotiations? 
A.	The MRND also sent its representatives.  
Q.	Now, did the RPF violate the ceasefire at the end of September 1992? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And, nevertheless, did the Arusha negotiations continue? 
A.	Yes.  The negotiations continued in spite of that.  
Q.	Did the MRND support those negotiations? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	We have in evidence a protocol agreement on the sharing of power, the first part that was entered into on the 30th of October 1992.  Do you recall what was the nature of the power-sharing agreement that was reached in October 1992? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, the Arusha Accords comprised all these protocols.  And amongst the protocols there was, indeed, what was referred to as the protocol of the sharing of power, because as you would understand with the constitution of 1988 and then the constitution of 1991, the Rwandan regime was a semi-presidential regime.  In other words, the political powers were practically concentrated in the president of the republic.  

So as concerns the constitution of 1978 -- and even with the constitution of 1991, the regime in Rwanda was semi-presidential.  The -- the president had powers even if the government was led by the 
prime minister -- by the prime minister.  

So during these negotiations, an attempt was made to strike a balance and to see what the president's prerogatives would be and what the prerogatives of the government or prime minister would be.  An attempt was made to share these prerogatives amongst the various institutions.  

Therefore, it is in this regard that you have the power-sharing agreement, part one.  And later on you had another agreement on the sharing of power, part two.  That agreement was signed in January 1993.  
Q.	And why was the MRND willing to share power with the RPF? 
A.	The MRND, first of all, had committed itself to a democratisation process.  The MRND had become a party just like any other party on the Rwandan political scene.  And from the month of April, the 
16 April 1992, it was not the -- the RND -- rather, the MRND party did not hold power alone.  

So when it is said that President Habyarimana was a dictator and that he was the one who led everything in 1992, I would say that was not true because government business was led by a prime minister.  

Therefore, from April 1992, President Habyarimana did not practic -- did not manage anything, practically anything.  It was the government that was in charge of government business.  
Q.	Now, we've had evidence from a Witness ZF that you were a member of an organisation called the Friends of the Alliance, the Dragons, the Abakozi.  Is that true? 
A.	I heard that from Witness ZF.  
Q.	Is it true? 
A.	It's not true.  
Q.	ZF also testified that there were a series of meetings held in Gisenyi at the Butotori camp at which you were in attendance with other authorities to discuss the extermination of the Tutsi.  Is that true? 
A.	It's a lie.  
Q.	Did you ever attend any meetings at Butotori camp? 
A.	Never.  
Q.	Witness AWE, a conseiller from Kigali, testified that a series of meetings were held in 1992 and early 1993 among leaders of the MRND and the conseillers of Kigali, some at the Rubangura building, some at the Kabuga building, and that you were in attendance at those meetings.  Is that true? 
A.	No.  That's not true.  
Q.	And during the -- at the end of 1992, in November, we have evidence of a meeting that took place in Ruhengeri préfecture at which President Habyarimana spoke.  Did you attend that meeting? 
A.	No.  I was in Brussels.  
Q.	And did you attend the meeting in Kabaya at which Leon Mugesera on the 22nd of November 1992 made his speech? 
A.	No, I was not present.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

We take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1035H to 1133H)  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I can clear something up before we move on.  I'd made reference to a document that Mr. Robinson wanted to enter into evidence, and it is something that the Prosecution had circulated previously and we had discussed it in the Chamber, but I don't think it was ever admitted in evidence.  

I did indicate to CMS a few weeks ago that it had been attached to another document as P. 375 and that it should be removed.  I'm not sure if that has happened yet.  But Mr. Robinson should give it an independent number because it actually has not been officially made a part of our record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  That's document 15 in our bundle, which was a letter concerning distribution of some weapons in Ruhengeri.  And we would ask that it be marked as D. NZ817 and admitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ817 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, on the 8th of February 1993, where were you? 
A.	I was in Kigali.  
Q.	On that day the RPF attacked Rwanda once again.  What results -- what resulted from that attack? 
A.	Yes.  On the 8th of February 1993, the RPF attacked Rwanda in violation of the ceasefire agreement of 12th July 1992 in much the same way as it had done in October 1992.  That attack was very spectacular because it enabled the RPF to come as close as 30 kilometres from Kigali; it also increased the number of refugees -- or war-displaced persons from about 350,000 at the beginning to about 1 million displaced persons in various makeshift camps around Kigali town -- some 20 -- or some 10 to 20 kilometres away from Kigali.  So that was the main consequence of that attack.  

The second consequence was that many atrocities were committed in Ruhengeri town where the RPF and its soldiers caused significant destruction and many killings in Ruhengeri.  They went through the homes of civil servants and exterminated their families.  I will stop at that.  But they also shut down the Kigali-Ruhengeri road.  
Q.	I'd like you to look at number 16 in our bundle of exhibits.  
A.	Yes, I have it.  
Q.	Can you tell us what that is.  
A.	As you can see for yourself, it is a letter of 25 February 1993 signed by the 
bureau of the Ruhengeri préfectoral committee to which I belonged.  And you can find my name on page 4 of the document.  

We addressed this letter to the heads of diplomatic and conseiller missions and two representatives of international organisations calling on them to assist Rwanda and the Rwandan government to call the RPF to reason, in asking it to abandon its belligerent policy regarding the killings and abuses -- or excesses it committed in Ruhengeri.  We mentioned a number of names of persons who had been killed.  We also talked about people who had been displaced or taken away by the RPF to unknown destinations.  

Then we went on to suggest recommendations to ensure that justice is extended to all the victims of the war that had been initiated by the RPF.  

As you can see for yourself, towards the end of that document, the last paragraph on page 4, we, members of the préfectoral committee -- of the bureau of the préfectoral committee in Ruhengeri proposed that, to the extent possible, the addressees of the letter, namely, the international community, should intervene to facilitate the creation of an international tribunal to try the perpetrators of cruelty and the authors of the war in Rwanda.  

In doing so, I did not know that I was going to end up here.  But our idea at the time was to ensure that all those who were taking advantage of the war, who engaged in excesses, abuses and killings, that all those persons should be brought to book.  That was our intention.  I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that this document, number 16 in our bundle, be admitted as D. NZ818.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ818 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So you had no idea on the 25th of February 1992, when you called for the establishment of an international tribunal to investigate and prosecute those responsible for crimes in Rwanda, that you yourself would some day be accused before such a Tribunal, did you? 
A.	No, not at all.  I had no such idea.  
Q.	And that's what happens when you lose a war, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  There is a Latin saying, vae victus, which means too bad for the vanquished -- or, rather, woe to the vanquished.
Q.	Have any of the perpetrators of these crimes that you described in Ruhengeri in 1993 ever been brought to justice?  
A.	No.  I do not know any of them, at least not from the RPF.  
Q.	Was there a ceasefire agreement signed in March of 1993 after the RPF had broken the previous one? 
A.	Yes.  After that we tried to bring back the parties to the negotiating table.  And on the 16th of March 1993, a ceasefire agreement was agreed to in Dar es Salaam.

1145H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, at the end of March of 1993, did President Habyarimana resign as president of the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  On 30 March 1993 President Habyarimana resigned from the position of president of the MRND party. 
Q.	Why did he resign? 
A.	Well, there was pressure from here and there requesting that the president focus on the activities of the presidency and that he had resigned from the position of -- from his position in the army and should also resign from his position in the party in order to demonstrate that he was above the fray and that he was neutral.  That is how President Habyarimana, relying on his belief in peace and unity, 
relied -- rather, resigned from his pres -- position as president of the party. 
Q.	And what measures were taken to choose his successor? 
A.	The MRND organised a congress in July, on the 3rd and 4th of July 1993, with a view to electing a 
new committee, a new steering committee, and a new president to replace President Habyarimana at the head of the MRND. 
Q.	Now, at this time you were still a private citizen and a member of the préfectoral committee of Ruhengeri.  During 1992 and up till this congress in -- beginning of July 1993, had you attended any MRND rallies? 
A.	Yes; very few.  And as I already told you this morning, I was a member of the Ruhengeri 
préfectoral committee in February 1992.  But in April 1992 I ran for a position at the national committee of the MRND, pursuant to the provisions of our constitution.  And that committee met every three months. 
Q.	And what about rallies that were held in stadiums or public places?  Did you attend any of those during the period from -- beginning of 1992 until the MRND congress in July of 1993? 
A.	No.  I did not attend most of those rallies. 
Q.	Was there a rally in January of 1993 in Ruhengeri at the Busengo sous-préfecture that you attended? 
A.	Yes.  It was in Ruhengeri préfecture.  I attended that rally in Ruhengeri préfecture, which was my native préfecture.  And the rally took place in January 1993.  I believe that it was the last rally in Ruhengeri because after the last attack by the RPF on the 8th of February 1993, no other rally was organised in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Did you take the floor at the Busengo MRND rally? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And what did you say? 
A.	Each speaker was given a topic, and we all attempted to make the people to understand the purpose and the stakes of the Arusha Accords.  We told them that, in spite of the prevailing situation, people should not give up; they should not despair, because what mattered was for peace to return to Rwanda.  In general terms, therefore, that was the main theme in those war times that we put forward in trying to explain to the population why the negotiations were taking place. 
Q.	Did anyone call for the extermination of Tutsi? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you ever attend a rally in Gatwaro stadium in Kibuye in June of 1993? 
A.	No.  I never went to Kibuye in July (sic) 1993. 
Q.	No.  The question was whether you attended a rally in June of 1993.

I said that I never went to Kibuye.  So I didn't attend any rally in Kibuye. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And you heard the testimony of Witness BDW who claimed that you attended that rally, you gave a speech, you said that people in Mukingo were already training, and you encouraged the people of Kibuye to do the same.  Is there any truth to that whatsoever? 
A.	That is untrue.  That is a lie. 
Q.	Now, on the 9th of June 1993, was there an agreement on refugees that was reached by the Rwandan government? 
A.	Yes.  I know that there were a number of successive agreements or accords within the context of the Arusha negotiations.  But let us simply state that on the 9th of June 1993 I was abroad.  But I know also that there was an agreement on the repatriation of refugees. 
Q.	Now, what made you decide to run for secretary general of the MRND? 
A.	From 1992 to June 1993 -- I think that after leaving the position of member of the central committee of the old MRND and after leaving the government on the 30th of December 1991, 1992 to 1993 were years of introspection for me.  I had joined the MRND party.  And I felt that since the institutions had been democratised, I felt that I could still be of service to my people.  I was consulted by a number of people who asked me whether I was ready to be a candidate.  

It is true that in 1992 I did not have such a liking for politics anymore.  But at the end of the day, I decided to join in and compete against other people.  And it was a personal decision on my part to -- to compete in the elections. 
Q.	Now, at the congress in 3 and 4 July 1993, was Mathieu Ngirumpatse elected president, Édouard Karemera, Ferdinand Kabagema elected vice-president, and yourself elected 
national secretary? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.
Q.	And after that date did you start going to work on a daily basis at the MRND headquarters?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And where were those headquarters? 
A.	When I took up that office, I was replacing Mathieu Ngirumpatse as national secretary since he had become president.  At that time the offices of the national secretariat of the MRND were located in Mr. Kabuga's building, K-A-B-U-G-A for Kabuga.  It was a big building -- a big building which Mr. Kabuga had made available to the MRND party to use for its offices.  

The single-party MRND had a building known as the headquarters of the MRND.  But when those buildings were ceded to the government, that building became the prime minister's office.  And that is how we moved to Kabuga's building. 

Then in September 1993 Mr. Kabuga needed to use his building.  And so we moved to Kimihurura and occupied a building which the party rented from General Augustin Ndindiliyimana. 
Q.	What was your salary as secretary general of the MRND? 
A.	The national secretary at the time of the single party had a salary slightly higher than that of a minister.  But when I became national secretary, since the MRND had financial difficulties, initially, I told them that I preferred not to receive such a salary and that they could use that money to pay salaries for the others, civil servants, because, in order to finance itself, the MRND had to seek contributions from its members.  And one of the first conditions I gave was that I would become national secretary of the MRND and that for a certain period, in any case, until we left -- until I left, I told them that I was not going to receive that salary and that that salary should enable the party to solve other problems that it faced. 
Q.	Now, what about the president and the two vice-presidents?  Were they full time at MRND, or did they have their own occupations? 
A.	Everyone had their own concerns or activities, and the constitution or -- according to the constitution of the party, it was the national secretary who managed the day-to-day business of the party under the chairmanship -- under the authority of the chairman of the party.  So everyone had his specific duties, and we met whenever it was necessary in party meetings. 
Q.	So was Mathieu and Karemera primarily running their law offices during that period? 
A.	Mathieu was the chairman of the party, but he has his law practice.  Karemera was the vice-chairman of the party, and he had his law practice.  I was the national secretary of the party, but I also had my own private business.  Similarly, Kabagema, who was the second vice-chairman, also had administrative duties in the administration. 
Q.	How many employees, full-time employees, did you have there at the MRND office working under you in Kimihurura? 
A.	When the party was reformed and when its property was ceded to the state, the party was facing a budget problem.  Therefore, the budget of the secretariat -- the national secretary was reduced.  In fact, we maintained, therefore, only a minimum number of staff, in any case, not more than ten people. 
Q.	Well, can you give us an idea of what you were doing every day as MRND national secretary.  What were -- how did -- was your time occupied? 
A.	I was in charge of day-to-day running of the party.  In particular, I prepared meetings -- meetings of the political bureau.  I followed up the work of the party's committees.  I also monitored the administration of the staff, the staff of the national secretariat.  

In general, when there were meetings, I would talk with the chairman or the vice-chairman regarding the -- convening a bureau of the -- a meeting of the political bureau, would also prepare the agenda of that bureau.  I also followed up the day-to-day business of the party.  

I would say, for example, that every week -- this is only an example that I'm giving to the Court.  Every week each political party had ten minutes -- ten minutes of airtime to air their party propaganda.  I followed what was said in the media.  I followed what our representatives said over the radio and whether it reflected the objectives of our party.  

So this was the daily work which I had to do.  That work is described in article 56 or perhaps 55 (sic) of the party's constitution.  It is article 55 of the party's -- sorry -- article 57 of the party's constitution. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us -- 
A.	Articles 57 and 58 state as follows:  "The activities of the national secretariat, the -- or duties of the national secretariat, which duties are performed under supervision of the national chairman of the MRND.  I would name those duties.  The national secretary is -- carries out the secretariat duties of the national congress.  He sees to the implementation of the declarations and resolutions of the congress.  He sees to the vitality, the cohesion, and the efficiency of the party.  He will ensure the proper management of the finances of the party.  He supervises the activities of 
préfectoral and communal organs.  He resolves disputes amongst the lower organs of the party and ensures good relations between the organs of the party and the national -- and the administration."  

So these are the duties of the national secretary, which duties he performs under the supervision of the national chairman.  This is contained in articles -- 58 of the party's constitution. 
Q.	After becoming national secretary of the MRND, did you have any contact with the Interahamwe? 
A.	The Interahamwe were -- that is, the Interahamwe za MRND, they were members of the MRND party.  They had a national committee, a provisional national committee.  It is that national committee which, through its chairman or president, could contact the MRND, because when we wanted to organise rallies, for example, and if they -- they -- if the Interahamwes were involved, and if they had to provide entertainment during such rallies, they had to be in contact or talk with the national chairman.  Therefore, as members of the party, we had contact with the provi -- provisional committee of the Interahamwe, in particular through its president, Kajuga. 
Q.	Now, was a protocol -- second additional protocol between the parties participating in the 
interim government -- in the -- in the government itself signed on the 16th of July 1993? 
A.	It was not the second.  First, there was a protocol of 7 April 1992.  There was an additional protocol on 16 April 1993 which extended the term of office by three months, the term of office of Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye in order to enable him -- stay in office until the signing of the Arusha Accords.  But it happened that on 16 July 1993 the Arusha Accords had not yet been signed.  And the term of office of the prime minister, Nsengiyaremye, expired.  

Then there was a second additional protocol on 16 July 1993.  That protocol enabled the prime minister, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana, to become prime minister. 
Q.	And did the MRND sign that protocol? 
A.	Yes.  We signed it. 
Q.	Now, did you become aware of a congress held on the 23rd and 24th of July 1993 called the Kabusunzu congress -- Kabusunzu congress?
A.	Yes.  The Kabusunzu congress was a congress of the MDR party.  That congress practically marked the split of the MDR party into factions.  There was a faction referred to as the Twagiramungu faction and another faction comprising three other members of the bureau who were opposed to Twagiramungu's policy.  

It is that Kabusunzu congress which decided to exclude Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu from the chair of the MDR party as well as other influential members of that party.  These other influential members include Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Anastase Gasana.  So I am aware of that congress which was held on the 23rd and 24th of July 1993. 
Q.	And did the MRND take any sides in the split in the MDR party? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  Before we get to that, would you mind eliciting who the -- the opposants (sic) were.  He mentioned three other persons that were opposed to Twagiramungu.  If we could put that on the record through this witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  The following were opposed to Twagiramungu in this matter.  Froduald Karamira.  Karamira, K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A.  Karamira -- mira.  Sorry.  There was also Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-R-E-M-Y-E (sic).  Nsengiyaremye was the first vice-chairman.  Karamira was the second vice-chairman.  

And there was another person, Murego, Leonard (sic), M-U-M-E-R-E-G-O (sic).  He was the 
executive secretary of the MDR party.  All these three people challenged the chairman of their party.  That chairman was Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu.  

And during the said congress, they sought the suspension of Twagiramungu from his position alongside three other people who were members of the political bureau.  And those three other people were Agathe Uwilingiyimana, Anastase Gasana, and there was another minister, Mbonimpa -- Mbonimpa, I believe.  Mbonimpa, M-B-O-N-M -- I take that again.  M-B-O-N-I-M-P-A.  

So this is one of the conclusions or resolutions of this MDR congress which took place in Kabusunzu.  That congress practically marked the beginning of divisions within the party. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did the MRND have anything to do with or take sides among those two divisions which had split? 
A.	No. The MRND, first of all, had no role to play in that congress.  It was an internal matter, a matter of rivalry between the members of that party.  
Q.	Now, turning to the PL party, I'd like you to look at document number 18 in our bundle of exhibits, which is a letter of the 31st of August 1993 from the first vice-president of that party, Landouald Ndasingwa.  Do you have that letter? 
A.	Yes; the letter of 31 August 1993.  Yes, I have it. 
Q.	And is this evidence of a split in the PL party as well? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, the vice-president of the party, the PL party, Mr. Landouald Ndasingwa -- Ndasingwa is spelt as follows:  N-D-A-S-I-N-G-W-A.  Landouald Ndasingwa, who was a vice-president of this party, warned or cautioned the president of the party, namely, Justin Mugenzi, and following meetings which had to be held to ensure that this party was represented with -- within the transition 
institutions -- accused Mr. Mugenzi of being a manipulator.  

Therefore, there were problems, problems that came into being within this party from that date.  From that date we realised that the party was going through serious problems.  And those problems intensified or got worse as we moved closer to the setting up of the transition institutions.  

This letter speaks very much for itself.  You can see in it that clearly there was a problem between the leaders of this party.  One of them was the president, the other one was the vice-president.  One of them was a Hutu and the other one a Tutsi. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that the letter from Mr. Ndasingwa, document 18 in our bundle of exhibits, be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ819. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I have no objection.  But the document that I have received from Mr. Robinson actually is two documents stapled together with two different sets of K numbers.  Both are in French, but the first one is missing a couple of pages, and the second one is actually complete and is more legible.  So my suggestion is that we detach the two and only admit the second one that begins at K0335522.  But other than that, I have no objection. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I agree. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted accordingly.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ819 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, during the testimony of Ferdinand Nahimana we made reference to an interview that Landouald Ndasingwa gave to RTLM.  It's in evidence as D. NZ785.  It's also number 19 in our 
packet of exhibits.  As part of the split in the liberal party, did Mr. Ndasingwa indicate the responsibility that the PL had and, in particular, Justin Mugenzi, for the events in Bugesera? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, in this document dated 31 August (sic) 1993, Mr. Landouald Ndasingwa gives a long or lengthy interview on RTLM radio.  In that interview he accuses the president of his party.  That was Justin Mugenzi.  He accuses him of having been the person responsible for the events that caused bloodshed in Bugesera in March 1992.  He doesn't hide that.  He says it.  And he says that he himself participated in that rally.  

He adds that one cannot talk of those events without involving or implicating his party through its chairman, the chairman of the Parti libéral.  There are passages which are mentioned in the document.  Last time we mentioned only one of such passages, but I can mention others now. 
Q.	Okay.  If you could briefly mention them.  
A.	I am thinking in particular of certain paragraphs.  To begin with, on page 1 Mr. Landouald in his reply, in answer to the first question, first of all, thanks the RTLM, which he considers to be a democratic radio because it gives the opportunity to all political parties to express themselves.  He says that it is laudable for the RTLM to allow all political parties to express themselves, that this is in harmony with a culture of democracy, as the one we are involved in at present.  

When you look at this document, in its last paragraph Landouald Ndasingwa says the following:  "I was also dismayed by the fact that these political manoeuvres were exploited to mock the victims of the Bugesera area, giving the impression that the popular meeting that Mugenzi held in this area was forgotten and that that meeting was the catalyst of the atrocities and that the justice meted out by Mr. Mbonampeka was not able to punish the culprits.  Even those presumed to be responsible and who were arrested were immediately released."  

I would refer to another short paragraph.  This is on page 3 in the middle of that page.  "It would appear that Mr. Mugenzi was not happy with the people who were elected to represent the PL party in parliament.  You would forgive me for repeating this.  He was apparently not happy with the 
members of parliament elected because the Tutsi are more represented." 
I am also going to read to you the -- part of page 4 and the beginning of page 5.  In the question on page 4, Landouald is asked the following:  "They said that you showed a desire -- or, rather, that you were a candidate to the post of president of the national transition assembly.  They even said that you are thirsty; is that true?"  Here is Landouald's answer:  "I'm going to tell you frankly that I desire to accede to that post."  I will stop there.  

Now, I will move on to page 6, the middle of that page.  There is another question which was put to Minister Ndasingwa.  The question was as follows:  "Your Honourable Minister, as you yourself said, the RTLM is a radio that speaks the truth.  The question we are going to ask you is what the man in the streets asked himself.  The divisions that are rife within the PL, are they in -- are they related to material -- personal material interests, or are they inherent in your respective ethnic groups?" 

Here is Landouald's answer.  Quote:  "I have already said that for a long time Rwandans have never entertained ethnic hatred.  We must say it and repeat it.  Quarrels amongst Rwandans are created by their leaders.  It would be wrong to say that Hutus and Tutsis harbour inherent or deep-seated hatred."  

On page 8 a question is put to Landouald:  "You said a while ago that the meeting or, rather, the rally chaired by Mugenzi in the Bugesera area was the catalyst of the hostilities which occurred there.  Can you be more elaborate?"  Answer:  "Yes.  I am going to explain.  As a matter of fact, even Radio Rwanda said that Mugenzi's speech during that rally was fiery and provoking.  That was brought to the attention of all Rwandans.  I personally attended that mass rally.  He is not supposed to question a local leader and drag him in mud before his people without bothering about the negative repercussions that his -- or such an act could lead to."  

Lastly, I will move to the last paragraph I would like to mention.  Landouald was asked the following question:  "You are aware of what is happening within political parties, be it the PL, the PSD, or the MDR.  At present it could be said that a party within which such problems do not exist is the MRND.  But I am not sure.  That is its own business.  

"Now, I will ask you a question in your capacity as minister.  Ikinani.  (Note by the reporter:  That was the name President Habyarimana gave himself, and it meant inflexible or invincible.)"  Question:  "Is he really invisible or inflexible?"  Answer:  "In my opinion he has accepted the introduction of democracy.  He has authorised the creation of political parties.  I would not say that he did so willingly.  He must have had criteria that guided him.  Perhaps those criteria include our willingness and commitment to foster the democratic process.  

"In short, he has liberalised the right of creating associations.  In fact, he has even carried out his duty of signing the Arusha Accords.  But the problem is that the founders of political parties were not able to follow and they gave in to the demons of discord.  

"I would even say that dictatorship, of which we accuse President Habyarimana, has now shifted camps and come to our camp.  The president of the republic has been dispossessed of all power, to the benefit of the government.  I do not see what else we could ask of him.  If we do not take that 
olive branch which he has extended to us, I will tell you, frankly, I will not be able to continue mistreating somebody who is inoffensive."  

Lastly -- and this is the last question -- he said -- he says, "In this regard someone told me" -- it's Landouald speaking now -- "someone told me that opposition political parties had, as a primary objective, the destabilisation of President Habyarimana.  They showed this desire in their rally.  They show it -- they showed it through the insults and other excesses."  I would stop there, Mr. President. 
Q.	And, Mr. Nzirorera, were there any splits in the MRND party in 1993 or 1994? 
A.	No. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take our luncheon recess at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We'll take our luncheon recess now.
(Court recessed at 1236H) 
(Pages 24 to 32 by Tanya West)
















(Court resumed at 1403H) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  Before we resume with Mr. Nzirorera's testimony, I have an oral motion I want to make.  And I apologise for doing this without notice to anyone, but it is something -- just came to my attention -- I think it needs to be dealt with today -- that is, that one of my witnesses who are travelling over the weekend, who is known as Witness 40 in these proceedings -- I have just received that -- from the Prosecution today, some disclosure indicating that he is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the Rwandan government.  

He was added to my list pursuant to a decision by the Chamber that allowed me to vary the witness list, and, therefore, he was not among those who was included in the Trial Chamber's decision on Joseph Nzirorera's motion for certificate of safe conduct that was decided on the
17th of February 2009.  

And I would ask at this time that the Trial Chamber also issue a certificate of safe conduct for 
Witness 40 so that he doesn't have any problems during his travel to or stay in Arusha in connection with this testimony.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does anybody have any submissions?  Any other submissions in this?  Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour.  I believe that the issue was litigated when we -- when the Chamber decided the previous motion that Mr. Robinson has mentioned.  And I don't think that this case is any different from those -- the other ones.  So I assume the Chamber will rule -- rule in a consistent manner. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Robinson, do you have immediate access to the date of the previous order?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  It's the 17th of February 2009. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

We will consider and address it during the course of the afternoon. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, good afternoon. 
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	I want to turn now to the events of October of 1993.  We have evidence that on the 21st of October the president of Burundi, Ndadaye, was assassinated.  How did that affect the situation in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  The assassination of President Ndadaye of Burundi had a negative impact on events in Rwanda.  In fact, Ndadaye had been elected in June 1993, and he was the very first Hutu president who was elected democratically in Burundi.  And four months later, in October, 21st of October precisely, he was arrested and assassinated in an atrocious manner by the Bru -- or the mono-ethnic Tutsi army of Burundi.  And the -- as such, the democratisation process in Burundi was undermined.  

Taking into consideration the similarity of the ethnic components in Rwanda and Burundi, and at a time when negotiations were going on regarding the Arusha Accords, especially as concerns the setting up of some institutions, Rwandan citizens thought that it was very difficult to trust people who you were mocking at results obtained from the ballot box.  And that is how the situation was construed in Rwanda, and all Rwandans deplored what had just happened in Burundi and to the people of Burundi. 
Q.	Now, we've heard about a rally that was held in Kigali at Nyamirambo stadium on the
	23rd of October 1993.  Did you attend that rally? 
A.	No.  When President Ndadaye was assassinated on the 1st -- 21st of October, and in the course of the days that followed, I was abroad.  I was in Belgium. 
Q.	Do you know whether or not the MRND had anything to do with organising that rally? 
A.	I was later on informed that that rally had actually taken place on the 23rd of October 1993.  And at the initiative of the MDR party, a call was made. 
Q.	Now, we've had evidence from Witness XBM that sometime in October 1993 there was an MRND rally in Umuganda stadium in Gisenyi.  Did you attend any such rally? 
A.	I am unaware of that rally, and I did not take part in it, that is, if it ever existed. 
Q.	He also testified that military figures like Colonel Bagosora participated in that rally.  Is that possible? 
A.	To my knowledge, soldiers did not take part in rallies organised by political parties.  So even if it did indeed take place, soldiers -- I do not think that soldiers could have participated and even spoken on the occasion.  So I think that that is pure fabrication. 
Q.	Now, on the 7th of November 1993, did the MRND hold a rally at Nyamirambo stadium? 
A.	Yes.  On the 7th of November 1993, there was an MRND rally at the Nyamirambo regional stadium, and I took part in it. 
Q.	We have in evidence the video of that rally.  But can you tell us briefly what was the purpose of holding that meeting. 
A.	In fact, that meeting was held within the framework of the competition between political parties engaged in a democratisation process.  And this was in November 1993.  We were moving towards the setting up of broad-based transitional institutions.  And you know that the period of transition was estimated to last 22 months and after that period elections had to be organised.  It is, therefore, in that context that the MRND rally was organised at the Nyamirambo stadium to explain to the militants what the party was doing in anticipation of that entire process that had begun. 
Q.	Did anyone call for the extermination of the Tutsi, either directly or indirectly, during that meeting? 
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	Did the MRND have as its programme or goal the extermination of the Tutsi? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Were elections organised for the demilitarised zone in November of 1993? 
A.	Yes.  There were elections in the demilitarised zone, and the elections were organised under the auspices of UNAMIR.  And the MRND party won the elections by a considerable margin. 
Q.	And when we talk about the demilitarised zone, what préfecture are we talking about? 
A.	The demilitarised zone was located in two prefectures: Ruhengeri and Byumba.  The zone was outlined after the RPF attack of the 8th of February 1993, just after the Dar es Salaam ceasefire declaration on the 7th of March 1993.  

	I told you this morning that at what point in -- at one point in time the RPF had made significant advances in the conquest of territory from the Rwandan government, and it was decided that the RPF should go back to the positions it was occupying before the 8th of February 1993.  And whatever area had been taken over as a result of that attack in Ruhengeri and Byumba, those zones were going to be declared demilitarised zones and the zones were placed under the control of UNAMIR. 

As to the elections which were held there, the elections were held there because those zones also needed an administration, because there was none.  And that is what happened.  So when I -- when I talk about elections in the demilitarised zone, it's with regard to the concerned communes in Byumba and Ruhengeri préfectures.  And in Ruhengeri préfecture, there were five communes:  Nkumba, Kidaho, Butaro, Nyamugali and Cyeru.  And these communes made up what was referred to as Kirambo sous-préfecture in Ruhengeri préfecture.  

I do not know if I have to spell the names of the communes.  I can do that very fast.  Nkumba is N-K-U-M-B-A.  Kidaho is K-I-D-A-H-O.  Butaro is B-U-T-A-R-O.  Cyeru, C-Y-E-R-U.  And Nyamugali is spelt N-Y-A-M-U-G-A-R-I (sic).  

So those were the five communes that made up the demilitarised zone, and also the
Kirambo sous-préfecture. 

Kirambo is spelt K-I-R-A-M-B-O.  Kirambo sous-préfecture in Ruhengeri préfecture.  So I have only listed the areas in Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	Did the RPF field candidates in those elections? 
A.	Yes.  Even though the zone had been declared a demilitarised zone, the RPF had taken over the zone and carried out a campaign there and put forth candidates, just like all the other political parties. 
Q.	And how did you feel when the MRND won in those areas?  What did that make you think about the prospects of the MRND in future elections? 
A.	It is not the MDR or RPF which won the elections.  It was the MRND. 
Q.	Okay.  I think we had a translation error, so I'll put my question to you again.  
MR. ROBINSON:  
And if the translators can try to pay attention on the difference between MRND and MDR.  It seems to be a recurring problem.  And I realise it's easy to make that confusion, but it would be a significant error in our transcript if that error is not corrected.  So please pay attention to that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	So my question is whether or not -- how you felt when the MRND won those elections and what did you think of the MRND's prospects for future elections based on that? 
A.	In fact, despite the fact that MRND had not carried out a campaign in that area and still won the elections by a considerable margin, we were confident and reassured that upon expiry of the transition period as provided for in the Arusha Accords the MRND party could easily win the elections.  We were confident.  Because that was a test, a sampling which made it possible for us to make a -- a sort of assessment. 
Q.	And what happened to those victorious candidates? 
A.	A few days after they were elected they were all killed. 
Q.	And who killed them? 
A.	The RPF.  But it should also be said -- and I'm sure we will certainly come back to this, because at
	one point in time the Prosecutor talked about a -- a certain allegation.  The MRND was accused of having assassinated its own, or killed its own militants.  And when we asked for the investigations, the findings were not published.  But in final analysis it was proven that it was the RPF that carried out that attack. 
Q.	I'd like you to look at document number 20 in our bundle of exhibits.  Do you recognise that? 
A.	Yes.  I am familiar with that document, as well as other documents that are associated to this one, which were produced by UNAMIR.  So these are the names of people who were murdered at that time, and amongst them there are people of the MRND party who had been elected. 
Q.	And this letter is signed by Joseph Mushyandi and Ferdinand Nahimana; correct? 
A.	Yes.  At that time Ferdinand Nahimana and Joseph Mushyandi were part of a human rights 
defence association.  And you must have followed Ferdinand Nahimana's testimony here, and he said that he went to the scene immediately following that carnage. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that document number 20 be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ820. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ820 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Nzirorera, we've also had evidence from Witness ZF that near the end of 1993 there was a meeting held at the Méridien hotel in Gisenyi of the Interahamwe and it was said that you were present; is that true? 
A.	That is false. 
Q.	Did you ever meet any Interahamwe in Gisenyi? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, what was the situation in Gisenyi préfecture with respect to a man named
	Bernard Munyagishari? 
A.	Yes.  At some point Bernard Munyagishari, who was previously working at the ministry of youth, with the restructuring of the MRND into a new MRND, Munyagishari was sent by the national secretariat of the MRND to work as an assistant to the secretariat of the MRND in Gisenyi préfecture.  And I am speaking here under the control of Mr. Karemera, Édouard, who was the national secretary at the time. 

It is only later on that we heard mention that Munyagishari had become an Interahamwe in Gisenyi.  But I did not know Bernard Munyagishari personally and I -- I still don't know him.  It is said that he was the chairman of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi.  But I do not know the Interahamwe committee in Gisenyi.  When I was appointed national secretary, I did not have the opportunity to visit even the
MRND préfectoral committees in the various préfectures.  

With the signing of the Arusha Accords on the 4th of August, we focused our attention more on the activities in Kigali.  So in my capacity as a national secretary, I did not even have the opportunity to visit or to tour the préfectures, even if it were only to meet the préfectoral committees at the various préfectoral levels. 

So I do not have any knowledge of that person, any extraordinary knowledge of that person.  And I never met him in 1993, and I didn't meet him in 1994 either.  I saw him once in June 1994, when we were about to leave.  But I don't know him.  I don't know him at all. 
Q.	Now, during December of 1993, was it understood and agreed that a battalion of RPF would come to Kigali and be housed at the CND? 
A.	Yes, pursuant to the application of the Arusha Accords and following the Kinihira meeting, it was agreed that the RPF would send a battalion to Kigali for purposes of providing protection to its officers.  That battalion arrived and was lodged at the CND building in Kigali.  And as I have told you before, that was close to my residence. 
Q.	And as part of that, was there supposed to be an installation or swearing-in of the members of the transitional institutions, including RPF representatives? 
A.	Well, in fact, on 10 December 1993, there was a meeting in Kinihira at which some scheduling was determined and which had to be respected.  The recommendation was for the transitional institutions to be set up before the end of 1993, before the 31st of December, to be more specific.  That was the agreement, and it was in that context that the RPF battalion arrived in Kigali a few days before the deployment of the UNAMIR. 
Q.	I would like to direct your attention to item number 21 in our packet of exhibits, which is a communiqué issued on the 27th of December 1993.  Do you recognise that? 
A.	Yes.  I do recognise that document, because I was one of the signatories thereto, along with the other members of the other political parties. 
Q.	And what was the purpose of this communiqué? 
A.	As I told you a short while ago, following the Kinihira meeting, the scheduling for the setting up of the transitional institutions was to be organised, and the recommendation was for that exercise to take place before the 31st of December 1993.  

It is on that basis that the president of the republic, President Habyarimana, called on all the 
political parties to join him in assessing or determining the possibility of setting up the -- all those transitional institutions.  

So we attended that meeting.  Some parties were present.  And you can see on the list those who attended for the MRND and those who attended from the -- for the MDR, as well as those who attended for the PL.  And, unfortunately, some political parties such as the PSD and the PDC were absent.  

The prime minister designate for the broad-based transitional government, Faustin Twagiramungu, was also conspicuously absent.  But only Madam Prime Minister Agathe was present.  

So that was taken note of, and those in attendance at the meeting recommended that those
political parties which were experiencing problems should try to solve their problems.  And so the meeting recommended that, as far as possible, they should comply with the rules pertaining to disputes or that they should seek political compromise. 

That is what we did, and that is how we signed that communiqué -- communiqué calling on all parties experiencing any problems to resolve them as quickly as possible, and also on those who were absent to abstain from behaving in that manner.  That is the essence of that communiqué of the
27th of December 1993. 

MR. ROBINSON:  
Mr. President, I'd ask that that be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ821, number 21 in my bundle. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no objection to the admission of the communiqué.  But what we have as document number 21 is actually four different documents stapled together.  It is hard to understand where one starts and the other -- where one stops and the other starts and where this is all coming from.  

To me, it seems that the most appropriate thing is just to admit the last four pages, which is a text of the communiqué, if Mr. Robinson could tell us where it is from, because subsequently that's what he seeks to -- to offer.  But I think if we look at this at a later time we are not going to understand what -- what's really going on between the four different things that are stapled together here. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I think we can just admit the last four pages.  And that is -- actually was an exhibit in the trial of André Ntagerura. 

So may -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We admit the last four pages, as requested. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ821 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we have another problem.  
MR. ROBINSON:  
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Now, we have not been able to be certain that we've identified Witness 40.  Would it be possible for
us -- for you to send a note, a handwritten note.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 

Yes.  If the registrar can collect this from me, I'll -- I've written down the name of Witness 40. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, I want to now talk about a party known as the CDR.  Can you tell us approximately when the CDR was formed. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

But with the leave of the Trial Chamber, I would like to say that I do not understand how the previous document was handled.  You see, we have the original document bearing our signatures and then there is a summary from Radio Rwanda.  So what has been admitted?  Is it only the document bearing our signatures?  I would like to understand what has just transpired.

1445H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	That's correct.  I can explain it to you further after the break, but that's what's been admitted.
A.	Yes.  I understood, Counsel.  Thank you.  I've understood.

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	So back to my question.  Can you tell me when the CDR was formed.
A.	The CDR was created in February 1992. 
Q.	Who were the founders of the CDR party? 
A.	The founders were members of the CDR including their leader, one Bucyana, Martin.  Bucyana is spelled B-U-C-Y-A-N-A, Bucyana, Martin.  He was the president of that party.  And there were other members of the party who got together to create that party in February 1992. 
Q.	What was the platform of that party as you understood it? 
A.	I think that the CDR party -- well, I was not a member of that party, but I know that the CDR party wanted to enter the race like all other political parties.  Its platform, its ideology, are outlined in its manifesto, the manifesto of that party.  

I think that if one wanted to fully understand that platform, one would need to refer to the manifesto and constitution of that party which must have been admitted into evidence in this trial. 
Q.	It's said that the CDR was an extremist Hutu party; is that correct? 
A.	Well, I cannot answer you.  Only those who refer to the CDR as an extremist party can answer that question.  What I know is that the CDR party was very outspoken in respect of the relations between Hutus and Tutsis.  The CDR spoke loud and clear what other political parties did not dare mention.  

It is in that vein that -- regarding the Hutu/Tutsi relations and the Arusha negotiations, the position of the CDR was that it was the Hutus and the Tutsis who were to be seated around the negotiating table to sort out the conflict and differences between themselves and that, in any event, in matters of the management of the country, these two ethnic groups had to be linked by a social contract.

That was the stated position of the CDR which argued that the Arusha negotiations were begun on the wrong premise, because a political party had been left out of the initial negotiations because the issue of the Hutu/Tutsi relations had not been dealt with properly.

So I think that this was their position.  It was a position and a statement that led some to brand it the way it was branded because it simply said publicly what others could not say.  So I do not think that the best way of dealing with those issues was to abstain from talking about Tutsis or Hutus because some didn't like it.
Now, I don't know whether this amounts to being an extremist party.  It is only those who claim that it was an extremist party who can defend that position before the Court.  Allow me to add that the basic instruments of a party would generally reflect its ideology.  And that is why I would refer you to the constitution and the statutes -- or the platform of that party for that discovery.  That's all I have to say. 
Q.	Was the CDR among the parties with whom the MRND made an alliance in November of 1992? 
A.	In November 1992, the MRND signed an alliance with four other political parties, and that alliance was known as the ARD, Alliance for the Reinforcement of Democracy, the idea being to counter somewhat the FDC, the Democratic Forces for Change.  

So these four other political parties included the CDR which a few months later, four or five months later, quit the alliance and stormed out of the alliance because they claimed not to be satisfied with the positions of the MRND at the Arusha negotiations. 
Q.	And thereafter, what was the relationship between the CDR and the MRND after February of 1993 when CDR divorced from the alliance? 
A.	First of all, allow me to state that right from the beginning the CDR was an independent party, independent of the MRND.  Let me also say that the CDR never held back any sharp criticisms against the MRND and President Habyarimana.  That is very clear.  There is documentation to substantiate that position.

So the relationship with the CDR was the same as those we had with other political parties.  They didn't sustain any privileged relationship with the MRND.  It was the position of the MRND to respect the Desiderata of any political party which wanted to engage in politics in Rwanda. 
Q.	Now, was the CDR part of the -- was it envisioned to be part of the transitional government? 
A.	After the signing of the Arusha Accords -- well, let us, first of all, say that the CDR, like all other political parties, ordinarily would have been party to one of the organs such as the 
transitional national assembly where the other political parties were represented by members of parliament.  But the CDR expressed a number of concerns and reservations about the Arusha Accords and, therefore, abstained from signing the code of ethics of August 1992 -- '93 rather.

However, a few months after, it reconsidered the issue but wanted to take up its seat at the 
transitional national assembly. 
Q.	Now, I'd like you to look at three documents together in our bundle of exhibits, 
numbers 23, 24, and 25.  Number 23 is already in evidence as D. K55.

And can you tell us if these three documents reflect efforts made by the CDR party on the 
29th of December 1993 to sign the code of conduct and have a place in the transitional assembly.
A.	Yes.  As you can see for yourself, these documents were issued towards the end of 1993, that is, on the 29th and the 30th of December.  Following the Kinihira meeting, the idea was for the institutions to be set up on the 31st of December at the latest.  On the 29th of December 1993, the CDR sent a letter to the minister of foreign affairs and cooperation couched in these words.  That is 
	letter K008-8860.  

"It states as follows:  I have the honour to inform you that the CDR party has decided to sign the 
code of political ethics with a view to acceding to representation within the transitional national assembly pursuant to articles 61 and 80 of the protocol agreement on power-sharing signed on the 9th of January 1993.

"I, therefore, urge you to kindly consider that the reservations expressed by the CDR party in his letter of 16 August 1993 are henceforth null and void.  The CDR, therefore, prays you to facilitate its proceeding to conduct the necessary formalities in respect of such a signature."

So that is the letter of 9 December 1993.  The minister of foreign affairs on the same day replied to that letter by forwarding a mail to the constitutional court in which he notified the said president of the desire of the CDR to sign the code of ethics in order to take up its position in the transitional 
national assembly.

The minister of foreign affairs in the same letter also expressed a number of reservations and also decided to forward a copy of the code of ethics to the president of the constitutional council.

However, the CDR did not stop there.  It also referred the matter, through a letter of 30 December 1993, to the president of the constitutional court.  In that letter the CDR expressed a desire to sign the 
code of ethics and wrote the following letter:  

"I have the honour to bring to your attention that by a letter of 29 December 1993, see attached copy, the CDR party notified the minister of foreign affairs and cooperation that it is ready to sign the code of political ethics referred to in the Arusha Peace Accords signed in Arusha on the 4th of August 1993."

At the same time the minister of foreign affairs and cooperation was requested to facilitate all formalities relating to such a signing by the CDR.  It emerges from the discussion I had with the minister -- the director of cabinet of the minister of foreign affairs and cooperation on the 30th December 1993 that, "It is within your ambit to establish and to determine the formalities for signing such a document by the CDR since the documents have been forwarded formally to you.

"I, therefore, pray you to kindly allow the CDR to sign the document within the time frames allowed under article 61 of the protocol agreement on power-sharing signed on the 9th of January 1993."  Signed by Bucyana, Martin, president of the CDR.

Well, these statements or this material simply puts an end to all the allegations by the Prosecutor whereby President Habyarimana and the MRND manoeuvred to get the CDR to accede or access the transitional institutions at the last minute, thereby depicting the bad faith of President Habyarimana and of the MRND in an attempt to institute the transitional institutions.

The position is that the CDR learned that the institutions were going to be set up on the 
31st of December 1993 and it took its own initiative -- it was by its own initiative that it requested to take up its position.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may document number 24, the letter of the ministry of foreign affairs, be admitted as 
	D. NZ822 and number 25, the CDR letter of the 30th of December, be admitted as D. NZ823. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ822 admitted)
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ823 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, on the 5th of January 1994, were you at the CND for the installation of the 
	transitional instructions? 
A.	Yes, I was present. 
Q.	Were you supposed to be sworn in as a member of parliament on that day? 
A.	Yes.  I was one of those who was supposed to be sworn in on that day. 
Q.	Now, we've heard evidence that President Habyarimana was sworn in in the morning but that the remainder of the individuals could not be sworn in in the afternoon.  Can you tell us why that swearing-in did not take place in the afternoon as had been hoped. 
A.	I'll do so very briefly.  In fact, it is true that in the morning of the 5th of January 1994, we received an invitation to go to the ceremony.  And on that morning -- or in that morning, the president of the republic was sworn in in front of the president of the constitutional court, members of the diplomatic corps.  

And towards the end of the morning, he announced that we were going to take a break and that we would reconvene in the afternoon as from 3 p.m. and the president was going to get members of 
the parliament and members of the broad-based transitional government sworn in.
As scheduled, the president arrived at 3 p.m.  Members of the diplomatic corps were there.  The representative of the UN Secretary General was there.  Even Karemera, Mathieu, and myself were there along with members of other political parties.

Conspicuously absent were the RPF.  The representative of the RPF was not there; whereas, they were in the CND building where the ceremony was taking place.  The prime minister designate of the broad-based transitional government, Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu, was not there.  He boycotted the ceremony.

The prime minister in office, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana, also decided not to attend the ceremony.  And the president of the constitutional court, Mr. Joseph Kavaruganda, K-A-V-A-R-U-G-A-N-D-A, also refused to attend the ceremony.

And in the face of this situation, President Habyarimana took due note of it and informed members of the diplomatic corps that there was nothing else he could do and that immediately when those people were available, he was ready to come back to get them sworn in as had been planned.

When he was questioned later by the president of the constitutional court, Mr. Joseph Kavaruganda, in answer to a question as to why he didn't show up, said that during the break he had received a letter from Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana asking him not to show up at that ceremony.

We have the letter from the prime minister.  We have the video recording of that day and the answers which were given.  That is the situation as we lived through it, and that is the reality.  Mr. President, 
I thank you. 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe prevent anyone from reaching the CND on the 5th of January 1994? 
A.	Never, and they were in no position to do so. 
Q.	Did you yourself issue a communiqué on the 6th of January 1994 concerning the events?
A.	Yes.  The MRND, the political bureau of the MRND, held a meeting on that day to take note of what had happened on the 5th of January 1994.  And we prepared a communiqué which I read on the airwaves of Radio Rwanda denouncing the conduct of certain officials. 
Q.	We have that in evidence as Exhibit D. NZ507.

Now, with respect to the 8th of January 1994, was there a demonstration on that day organised by the MRND?  
A.	Not at all.  I do not know where that is taken from.  There was no such event on the 
5th of January 1994. 
Q.	My question dealt with the 8th of January.  So I'm not sure if that was a translation error or your error.  But I was asking you about the 8th of January 1994.  Was there a demonstration on that day in connection with the swearing-in of the transitional government?
A.	In fact, on the 8th of January 1994, as has been underscored in General Augustin Ndindiliyimana's document, he explained exactly what happened.  Since he was head of the gendarmerie and in charge of internal security, he is aware of what happened on that day.  

But first of all, let me inform the Chamber that on the 8th of January there was no demonstration regarding the swearing-in.  We received no invitation to be at the swearing-in ceremony on that 
8th of January.  If we had, we would have gone there, but we did not.

Secondly, it would appear that it was rumoured that the ceremony would take place but that 
members of factions other than the Twagiramungu faction of the MDR learned that Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana would have wanted to organise a ceremony, but this was rumoured.

And those people rushed to the 5th of July -- junction between the Hôtel Méridien and other places.  And on that day other people might have been gathered there, but we do not know what happened for people to say that it was MRND which organised that demonstration.

And General Ndindiliyimana concluded in his document that in reality at midday all those -- or the purported people who were protesting left the area because there was no ceremony at that time.

They were informed that no ceremony was scheduled, and people left.  So up till this day, I do not know.  Perhaps somebody might have some information, but we do not know where this whole idea of a ceremony to set up the institutions on the 8th of January.

In any case, those of us of the MRND received no invitation to that ceremony.  So we were wondering whether the people wanted to set up transitional institutions without the MRND, and we did not understand the situation.  And up till today, it seems to us to be a mystery.  

We hear about the demonstration on the 8th of January.  We hear about the ceremony for the installation or the setting up of the transitional institutions, but we did not have any invitation.  That is all I can tell you, Mr. Robinson.  And I did not at all move from my house.  I stayed home.

1515H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, did you issue a communiqué on the 10th of January 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	That communiqué is item 28 in our bundle of materials and it's also been admitted as Exhibit P. 292.  Can you tell us what was the message contained in that communiqué? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, as to the contents of that communiqué, it was talking about the demonstrations in question on the 8th of January 1994 and the comments that were made in that regard.  MRND was disassociating itself with all the comments that had been made regarding that day.  

We reacted after a meeting of the political bureau and we thought that we had to react because the MRND did not organise any demonstration, and we also availed ourselves of that opportunity to talk about all the unhealthy propaganda with a view -- or propaganda that said that the MRND wanted to undermine the setting up of transitional institutions.  And we denounced everything that was said by the various political party leaders against MRND.

Since I am still talking, let me take this opportunity to say to the Prosecutor, who said that we were accusing the RPF of crimes, that we were -- we had commented -- the mere allegation that when we sent out this communiqué saying that the RPF had the intention of killing our MRND members, it is because we had evidence in that regard.  The RPF had assassinated or murdered MRND members who had been elected in the demilitarised zone.  

If the Prosecutor does not want to accept that, he has the right to do so.  But he cannot say that we were accusing the RPF of crimes that we had committed.  And I followed -- when he was cross-examining one of our witnesses, he was saying that where there is RPF, they could replace it with MRND, or where there is RPF, you can put the Rwandan armed forces.  That I do not agree with.  And we said that from the evidence available to us, the RPF had a diabolical plan, and later on when Gatabazi was killed they immediately accused the MRND.  

Later the reality is different.  When Emmanuel Gapyisi was murdered, the RPF and its allies immediately accused the MRND, but today the reality is different.  So I had to make this comment at all costs, that the whole business of accusing people of crimes that people committed themselves is not the business of MRND, but RPF.

And, unfortunately, the Prosecutor cannot dare to take the necessary steps to prosecute them. 
Q.	Several of these -- 

MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  Just for the clarity of the record, I believe Mr. Robinson identified it as P. 292, but according to my records that document is P. 294.  And we mistakenly put it in evidence again through the cross-examination of Booh-Booh as P. 434.  So just to make sure we're referring to the same document, P. 294 is the démenti of the 10th January 1994, and it's also identified as P. 434. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President, although I'm looking at a copy that has a stamp of the registrar indicating 
P. 292.  But we can perhaps check that after the Court adjourns and make sure that we have it correct. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In any event, Mr. Nzirorera, some of these people you criticised in this communiqué on the 
	7th of April 1994, did you have anything to do with their deaths? 
A.	Let me, first of all, say no.  I am not at all linked to the deaths of these people.  And I would quite simply like to tell you that on the 7th of April indeed there are people who were killed on the government side, but there are other people whose names have not been mentioned and who died in the RPF zone.  

I will definitely have the opportunity to come back to this certainly during the cross-examination so that things can be very clear.  That said, I had nothing to do with the killing of these people on the 7th April.  What we were involved in was a political comeback.  They had talked about us.  We reacted.  But in politics that is allowed. 
Q.	Now, did you know a person by the name of Turatsinze?  
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	How did you know him? 
A.	When I was elected national secretary of the MRND, I found Mr. Turatsinze there as a driver.  He was a driver there.  That is how I knew him. 
Q.	And did he remain employed at MRND? 
A.	No, Turatsinze was an ordinary driver.  He knew nothing.  He was arrogant, high-handed and he pretended to be a spy, that he was going to get information from the opposition.  I considered that he was a trickster, and I put an end to his contract or terminated his contract at the 
	secretariat of the MRND. 
Q.	When did you do that? 
A.	I dismissed him towards the end of 1993 in October or November.  I don't have the exact date, but it was when we were -- we had moved into our new offices in Kimihurura.  We got there in 
	September 1993 and I believe I dismissed Turatsinze towards the end of the year, in 
	October or November.  In any case within two months he had left. 
Q.	Was it easy to dismiss him? 
A.	You see, when I got to the national secretariat, I found, first of all, that there were very few employees compared to the ministry where I came from, a ministry like the ministry of public works which had over 200 drivers.  I had never met a driver who was trying to behave as an important personality.  A driver is a driver.  So I -- when I talked and he was trying to argue, I just terminated his contract. 
Q.	Did you have some discussion with Mathieu Ngirumpatse and other people about that? 
A.	I took the decision to dismiss him and I dismissed him, and of course Mathieu was informed. 
Q.	And did you have any dispute with anyone else at MRND over the dismissal of Turatsinze? 
A.	Some people thought that Turatsinze was an important man.  It appeared, or seemed, that for him to have a job with the MRND, he had been recommended by the former minister of the interior, Mr. Faustin Munyaseza, and that he was the one who had recommended him to Mathieu Ngirumpatse for the national secretariat.  But I -- he met me in the government and I did not expect any consequences from dismissing -- or for dismissing a driver.  He was not the first driver I was dismissing. 
Q.	And how was it that Turatsinze seemed to continue to be associated with the MRND after you dismissed him? 
A.	I sent or dismissed Turatsinze from the national secretariat of the MRND.  Let us understand each other.  I dismissed him from the national secretariat.  I withdrew the vehicle from him.  He had a small antechamber where he had put some material.  I asked that that place should be locked up and the keys kept.  

So I strictly forbade him from stepping foot on the premises of the MRND.  That was my decision.  But I could not have sent him from the MRND as a political party.  He could not come to the 
national secretariat.  He was no longer paid.  He could not drive any vehicle.  And my power was limited to the fact that I said that Mr. Turatsinze should not step foot on the premises of the national secretariat.  But I could not send him away from the party.  I had no authority to do so. 
Q.	We have heard evidence from Frank Claeys and seen reports from UNAMIR that sometime around the 12th of January, or perhaps one or two days later, he took two UNAMIR officers to the 
	Kimihurura headquarters of the MRND and showed them a bunch of weapons.  How was he able to do that? 
A.	First of all, I only got to know about that when I got here.  Secondly, if indeed that visit took place, it did take place in the night and I was not there, because if I had been there, it would have been something else.  

And on the 12th of January 1994, I believe Mr. Booh-Booh said so, we had a discussion with Mr. Booh-Booh and Dallaire.  He told us that the Interahamwe might be hiding or receiving weapons.  I was with Mathieu at the UNAMIR headquarters.  We told Mr. Booh-Booh and Mr. Dallaire that we were not informed of that.  

And to all intents and purposes, we told them that they were free to also contact the 
Interahamwe committee and put the question to them.  That is what we told them, that they could carry out their investigations and, if there is anything, they could notify us.  

Since then we had been notified of nothing.  The only thing we had in the form of a notification was when we realised that there were telegrams that had been sent.  But that is all we said to UNAMIR, that UNAMIR could carry out any investigation if it wanted to do so.  

So that visit, if it took place -- I was not at the headquarters of the MRND and I doubt that that took place during the day -- it took place in the night.  And I know that as far as I'm concerned 
there was -- there were no weapons stored at the headquarters of the MRND.  How that happened -- in fact we were not told how those weapons were brought, how Turatsinze showed all that.  We have been in prison here since 1998.  Turatsinze was still alive.  He was not brought here to say what happened.  So that is all I can say. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to deal with my request for a safe conduct order and then take our recess?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think we should give you a written order, and it will be filed before the end of business today.  The application is being granted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  

And are you sitting tomorrow or on Monday?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, let me enquire once more.  

Ms. Hounkpatin, do you have any further thoughts?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I maintain my position.  

So far as tomorrow is concerned, Mr. Ngirumpatse cannot continue to be physically present during the session tomorrow and it would be better for us, Mr. President, to continue on Monday. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, I think we ought to enquire whether Mr. Ngirumpatse would consent to the proceedings being continued in his absence tomorrow.  We will accept your statement that he is not able to attend the court tomorrow. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I did not understand the interpretation very well.  I -- but I understand that you're asking if we can sit in his absence.  Is that the case?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We accept that he's not able to attend tomorrow.  We accept your word.  And we'll -- but we think we ought to enquire whether he would consent to us sitting tomorrow for the completion of Mr. Nzirorera's testimony in his absence. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I think that the presence of Mr. Ngirumpatse during his comrade of misfortune, Mr. Nzirorera, is important.  But I would not -- I would not dare to say anything.  If you would like us to say something, we would be requesting for a five- to ten-minute adjournment so that the 
three accused people can see what they can do.  And at the end of that discussion if it is possible for Mathieu to give his consent, then that would be the proposal I would be making to the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  We accept your proposal, and what we would do is take the adjournment now, and when you communicate through us to the registrar, he will notify everybody else when we will resume. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I'm obliged, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We take our adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1540H)
