P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday the 14th of June 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the   Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Robinson, I gather there is something you want to ask?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, there is.  Thank you, Mr. President, and good morning. Mr. President.  On the 17th of June the Trial Chamber issued a ordonnance complementaire, complimentary order, which I understand to be a complimentary order regarding the deposit of submissions by a state.  And in the decision there was an annex, which I understood contained two items as a confidential annex, one being the identity of the state; and the second being a description of the documents that were requested.  And in discussions with the Trial Chamber coordinator, and the CMS Trial Chamber coordinator, I requested to have a copy of that confidential annex so I could see what the documents were that were being requested.  And I was told that that confidential annex was confidential, not only to the public, but confidential to the parties.  

And I'm making a motion at this time that the confidential annex be disclosed to the parties, because I believe that we have a right to see what the documents are that are being requested.  And as far as the identity of the state that the witness is being kept in, certainly that is no secret from the parties since each of us had a representative there at the time the witness gave his testimony.  So I believe that the confidential annex should be made available to the parties; and I make that motion at this time. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Properly, it should be with supplementary annex, supplementary order. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, the Prosecution takes no position on this issue.  The Court is fully apprised of the facts and circumstances and can make a decision on the motion without a contribution from us.  I think we've stated our position in the various motions on the protective measures for that particular witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we made our decision because it was in accordance with the previous decisions which had been made -- that had been made.  And the confidentiality was a necessary incident of consistency with our previous orders; that was the basis of it.  We won't rule immediately on the earlier motion.

Witness, your testimony will continue now.  I remind you, you are still on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony begun last week.  

Mr. Robinson will continue his examination.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS BTH
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning.  How are you? 
A.	Good morning.  I'm fine, thank you. 
Q.	I want to direct your attention to the gacaca document that I put in front of you yesterday, and I want to go over with you some portions of it that pertain to your case.  If you turn to the page where it says page 13 of 23, do you have that? 
A.	In this document I see somewhere it is written 13 and it also says page 10.  I don't know which I should follow. 
Q.	Okay, I think you are on the right page.  On the top it says page 13 of 23, and in the middle of that there is also a page 10.  So I think you are on the right page.  And the next page after that, if you turn it -- if you turn that page, the next page has no number.  And the following page after that says page 14 of 23.  Now, the page with no number has been printed out.  It is a copy of pages 14 and 15, but because the printing from the internet did not capture all of the words, I printed out separately on the page in between 13 and 14 the portion that refers to you.  So you have the page now that has no number that is in between 13 and 14?  
A.	Yes, I have, indeed, noticed -- I had removed them, actually, from the bundle so as not to err.  I had removed them from the bundle I had received. 
Q.	Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Now, what I'm going to do is have us read from that page that has no number where it talks about you, and then where there are two paragraphs, the second paragraph and the third paragraph, I'm going to read those.  And then we are going to discuss that concerning the gacaca proceedings.  So, the first sentence it says (French spoken) and then it gives the name, which is your name but I won't repeat that here? 

MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, can we have a question before we start reading through the documentation?  I'm not sure where we are going with this. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
The question is going to be; does this accurately reflect what you said at the gacaca proceedings on the 11th of May?

So, I'm going to ask my legal assistant to read this, because I think my French will be very poorly understood.  So, I'm going to ask my legal assistant to read the paragraph beginning with           (French spoken), and then the first paragraph under 1.3 Audition des temoins.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, I'm sorry but part of this page is smudged, so we will have to do it strictly from what is read out.  
MR. NTAWUMENYUMUNSI:
"The Accused, also admitted -- acknowledged, confessed that before he was put on the list of accused drawn up by the cellule gacaca court, at the time of the proceeding sitting, he acknowledged the acts of which he was accused and acknowledged having been an accomplice of the militiamen because he was******************************.  Moreover, all of the testimony provided at the proceeding                sitting -- proceeding session, corroborated his confession.  

Hearing of the witnesses:  Each witness is invited to take an oath before speaking.  The testimony of ******************************************************************************************************************* **********************************************confirmed the confession of the Accused.  As to" -- and there follows the name of the witness, "he reconfirms that he ************************************************** ************************************the assailants during the genocide." 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, does that accurately recount what was said at your gacaca proceedings? 
A.	This is the minutes, but it is not a complete transcript of everything that was said at the hearing.  I think the person that prepared this report, the minutes only, committed to paper the main points as to the tenor of what the various speakers said, as to the testimony of the various witnesses.  And you will have noted that I did not speak.  However, it says that at the preceding session I had spoken.  

And in reading this document, I did not see what I had said at the preceding session -- preceding sitting. Consequently, I note that certain items of information were put forward at that sitting, at that hearing, but it is not the entirety of what was said at the hearing. 
Q.	Okay, thank you, Witness BTH.  That is understood.  And insofar as it is reporting what was said, is it reporting it accurately? 
A.	I shall say the following; this is not a full report.  Consequently, what is here is an extract of what was said on that date, but everything has not been reported upon. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much, Witness BTH? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, at this time I would offer the gacaca notes of the Avocats sans frontières of Belgium as Exhibit D. NZ144. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ144 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just for the clarity of the record, we are admitting the whole report of around 20 pages, not just that one page?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I was going to admit the whole report, but if there is a problem we can limit it.
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, that is fine. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness -- yes, do you have something to say? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, I can hear you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak.  I should like to point something out, something to be put on the record.  The report confirms that that hearing was held on the **************2005, but, in fact, it was the second day of the hearing of my appearance before the gacaca court, but doesn't   cover -- but this report does not cover the first day.  If my name is mentioned here, it is in respect of the procedure -- parts of the procedure concerning someone else, a colleague of mine.  I -- a week earlier, about the*************, is when I had the opportunity to speak before the gacaca courts.  So this report is on the second occasion.  So counsel for Nzirorera is submitting an incomplete report.  And if he has the report on the first day he should also enter that if he wants to cross-exam me on one point or another.  

So I merely wish to emphasise that this is -- these are the minutes of my second appearance.  It is, therefore, incomplete.  In point of fact, everything was said at the hearing concerning**************, but it concerned**********************************************.  So they don't go into sufficient details in the charges against me.  In fact, these were the proceedings concerning someone else.  But -- so the minutes of the hearing concerning me, myself personally, are not available. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you, Witness BTH, for that explanation.  Unfortunately, although we have gone to great lengths to try to obtain the complete records on your case in Rwanda, the Rwanda government has not complied with our request.  And, in fact, I only found this document by searching for your name on the internet and came up with this particular document.  But, apparently, the Avocats sans frontières were not at your first hearing, or if they were they did not write up something.  So this is the only record available.  So, I -- we are doing the best we can, and if we are able to obtain more information about what happened in your gacaca case, I'm hoping that the Trial Chamber will allow me to bring you back and we can go into those at a later time.

Now, on this -- it was on the ***********that you received your -- it was on the **************that you received your sentence of seven years, correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you have told us in your direct examination that after you received this sentence, there was a party who appealed against it; is that correct? 
A.	In fact, it was a joint trial, we were three accused.  And this -- the party referred to here appealed.  And the reason for the appeal are there.  He said that it was necessary to study, in detail, the charges against********, you will see that on page 15.  That person was asking that there be a detailed study of ****************'s testimony.  So that tribunal's decision concerned three people, and the person concerned asked for a review concerning**************.  And I was also condemned to general labour, but as far as I am concerned, I think it was unfair because I already spent seven years in detention. 
Q.	And in any event, the appeal that was lodged by that individual was rejected by the Rwanda courts; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, the appeal was rejected.  They appealed, and at the appropriate time we appeared before the Court; and it was considered that the appeal was rejected. 
Q.	So, looking at your case from beginning to end, your strategy of making a confession, pleading guilty, testifying as to the responsibility of others, was successful in the sense that you were able to be, not only provisionally released in January 2003, but you received a sentence that did not involve your having to return to prison, correct? 
A.	The law in force was followed, so I am among those who benefited from the laws in force.  I think that throughout the proceedings it was a matter of applying the laws that were in force. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, I have an enquiry that I would like to make of the interpreters booth.  

Was the word "strategy" accurately translated in the Kinyarwanda that this witness heard, because I was about to object to Mr. Robinson's question, but I thought that the witness would focus on the language that was used in this question.  And I would like to find out if in translating it in Kinyarwanda there was close attention to the subtlety of Mr. Robinson's question?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the Kinyarwanda booth has any need to have the question repeated, they can indicate; otherwise, I will go on to my next question.  Okay, seeing no indication -- 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, I want to ask you about your friend Michel Niyigaba.  So, Michel Niyigaba also was involved in the events of 7th and 8th of April, as you testified, and also was an officer of the Interahamwe since 1991 or 1992 as you testified.  And he is still in prison right now; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, he is incarcerated. 
Q.	And unlike you, he has not accused Mr. Nzirorera of having ordered the killings in Mukingo, correct? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry; can I have an offer of proof for that particular question?  That particular witness was the subject of repeated requests for disclosure from Mr. Robinson.  And I recall reading a statement from that witness where the contrary was asserted, so if Mr. Robinson has other information, perhaps he can place it at our disposal, or rephrase the question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I will rephrase the question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q	Witness BTH, to your knowledge Michel Niyigaba has never testified here at this Tribunal on behalf of the Prosecution; is that correct?  
A.	He has his own reasons.  I know he testified for Kajelijeli's defence.  He has his own reasons to do so.  I don't think we should make a big fuss about it.  If you want to know why, you can know why, because his reasons are well known. 
Q.	Now, I want to turn to some questions about Mukingo commune.  Can you, first of all, tell us how long it takes to get from Kigali to Ruhengeri town on the tarmac road? 
A.	Approximately two hours. 
Q.	And after you reach Ruhengeri town, about how many kilometres is it to the Byangabo centre in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Approximately 15 kilometres, one, five. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately how many kilometres it is from one end of Mukingo commune to the other along the tarmacked road? 
A.	I don't know because I never measured it; but I would say it is approximately 10 kilometres. 
Q.	Can you tell us, approximately -- in April of 1994, approximately, what was the population of Mukingo commune? 
A.	I really don't know, I never undertook any census.  And I was never told what was the number of inhabitants in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Can you give us some approximation, maybe, whether we are speaking of thousands of people, tens of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of people? 
A.	I really don't know.  I never heard any mention made of how many inhabitants there were in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Well, for example, you told us there was about 3,000 people gathered on one occasion when the population was called to a meeting.  About what portion of the population was that? 
A.	I really can't give you a percentage because I don't know how many inhabitants, what was the population of the commune.  I can't compare.  I have no point of comparison.  It was a large commune, extending right up to the volcanoes, to the edge of the forest, and bordering Kinigi and Nyakinama commune and Nkuli commune.  So, I did not seek to know and it never came -- such information never came to my attention. 
Q.	As of the 6th of April 1994, do you know approximately how many Tutsi resided in Mukingo commune? 
A.	No, I don't know how many Tutsi there were.  I never counted them, they never undertook any census.  But what I do know is that the Hutu were the majority in relation to the number of Tutsi that inhabited the commune. 
Q.	Well, you told us that it was your job to monitor the Tutsi, to make lists of Tutsi.  You can give us no idea of how many Tutsi there were in Mukingo commune?
A.	Not every one was listed.  We drew up lists of five or ten people, but we did not make a census of all of the Tutsi; the state, however, knew how many Tutsi there were.  If you turn to the responsable, they will tell you how many Hutu and how many Tutsi and how many Twa, because they were regularly counting them. 
Q.	And how many Tutsi were on your list? 
A.	I explained, on our list there were five or ten people on the basis of our research; otherwise, it was not a list -- an entire -- a complete list.  I would see lists of three names or five names, that sort of thing. 
Q.	Can you give us an estimation of how many Tutsi were killed on Busogo secteur on the 7th of April? 
A.	Somewhere between 3- and 400. 
Q.	Now, during the attack of February 1993, was the RPF in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Where I lived in Mukingo commune, I did not see any RPF soldiers, troops.  I don't think they went beyond Ruhengeri town.  Where I was in Mukingo commune, I did not see any RPF troops. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if my document number 17 can be shown to the witness?  This is a two-page excerpt from a book authored by Abdul Ruzibiza, entitled "Rwanda, the Secret History." 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I may make a suggestion so that we don't have to waste time with this in re-direct, I have gone back to that book and I have copied two additional pages so that we have the entire passage where the author is addressing Ruhengeri.  And I would like to offer Mr. Robinson this copy, which has the cover page of the book, and five pages instead of the two pages that he reproduced in his bundle. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
And if you could let us know the question before the material is read into the record, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
The question is going to be, "Were you aware of these facts?"  
 
Mr. President, what I propose to do is, again, have my legal assistant read a portion of one paragraph on page 188, beginning with -- it is the second full paragraph, J02, Moses Rubimbura.  I will have my legal assistant read that slowly right now. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, I would, for the record, object to that particular question.  The witness's response two minutes ago was quite clear, that he saw no troops in his area.  If what Mr. Robinson is trying to establish is that in his area there were troops, then reading something from another document would be appropriate.  But I have read through that portion of the book, and I don't see where a contradiction is coming.  And it seems to me that this is just a means of putting information on the record when there is no foundation for it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I asked the witness if the RPF was in Mukingo commune.  He gave his answer, he said he wasn't aware of that, at least, in his area.  Now, I'm going to have him read a statement from an RPF officer that says they were in Mukingo commune.  And I'm going to ask him if having heard that if he has any -- if that either refreshes his recollection, or he has any comment on that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is permitted. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  

So if my legal assistant would now begin reading.  Thank you. 
MR. NTAWUMENYUMUNSI:
"J02 Moses Rubimbura and J02 Munyambo, of Charley mobile, also took part in the operation.  The Charley mobile unit, directed under the command of S O Cyiza."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There is a problem, says the Kinyarwanda interpreter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I'm sorry.  Yes, Mr. Witness, I can hear you. 

THE WITNESS:
I cannot find my place in the text, the text which is being read to me. 
MR. NTAWUMENYUMUNSI:
Page 188.  Let me start again.  Page 188, from the middle of the page, "J02 Moses Rubimbura and J02 Munyambo of Charley mobile also took part in the operation.  The Charley mobile unit, commanded by S O Cyiza was along old France.  It was partly in Kigombe commune, partly in Nkumba commune, and all along the Kinigi -- Kinigi communes.  It was repulsed from this town of Ruhengeri, following the unexpected defeat in Nyamagumba, Muhoza and elsewhere.  Not only because word got out about the attack, but also because its leader S O Cyiza and some commanding officers were busy looting the town and massacring the population." 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, having heard that excerpt from a book from someone who is an officer of the RPF, does that refresh your recollection or would you like to make any comment on whether or not the RPF was in Mukingo during the attack of 1993? 
A.	I was not responsible for monitoring Mukingo commune.  I can confirm that during the Inkotanyi attack, and right up to the day we fled, I never saw Inkotanyi in Mukingo from 1991, 1992, 1993.  I repeat, I never saw Inkotanyi in the place where I was.  The Inkotanyi never reached the place where I was.  If they went and engaged in looting somewhere in Mukingo, I was not there so that I cannot confirm if they actually went to the commune, whereas I did not see them.  I can only say -- talk about what I saw. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document, the one that Mr. Webster has provided, be marked as  ID. NZ27.  I'm actually willing to have the document admitted as an exhibit if Mr. Webster consents, but if there is no consent then I will ask that it be marked as identification. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
At this point we might as well admit it; what difference does it make?  The entire content that I find objectionable has already been read into the record so it makes much more sense to put the whole portion in --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
On the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Gentlemen, as far as I understand it, what is put to a witness is not evidence in the trial.  The witness's answer is evidence.  Now, this is cross-examination, and the witness is entitled to have matters put to him for his comment.  That is a very normal and proper procedure.  Now the content of what is read to the witness is not evidence.  
Now, in that context, do you wish to rephrase your response to Mr. Robinson?  See we would not normally admit it into evidence at this stage.  It would normally be marked for identification, because what is read is not evidence. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Perhaps, I could rephrase my statement, Your Honour, for all practical purposes, I don't see a difference between admitting this document or relying on the passage that was read.  So, in the      effort -- in the interest of completeness, it makes more sense to admit Mr. Robinson's exhibit, because what I find offending about the question is already part of the record; whether the Court considers it as evidence or not, it is there.  So it makes much more sense to have a context to consider that paragraph.  So, for the completeness of the record, I have no opposition to the entire portion of that book being admitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document is marked for identification. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is ID. NZ27, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is not admitted into evidence, it is marked for identification.
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ27 marked for identification)  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct, and that is why I gave you the ID number as oppose to the other number. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Now, Witness BTH, I want to ask you some questions about the governance of Mukingo commune.  Can you tell us how many secteurs there were in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I do not know all of the secteurs, but I do know Busogo, Gataraga, Rwinsovu secteurs, Manjari, these are the secteurs I can recall. 
Q.	And there are two secteur Manjari I and II; is that correct? 
A.	I am well aware that Manjari I and Manjari II were there.  I do not know if these are cellules or secteur, however, I am aware of their existence. 
Q.	And each of those secteurs had a conseiller, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did each cellule have a responsable? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then there was the bourgmestre, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us, approximately, when Juvenal Kajelijeli was first bourgmestre of Mukingo commune? 
A.	I no longer remember.  I do know that he took over from one Alphonse Bihira, but I'm not certain.  It was prior to the post 90s, I think. 
Q.	And when the multiparty system came in in 1991 was Mr. Kajelijeli the bourgmestre? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when he stopped being bourgmestre? 
A.	It must have been in 1992 or 1993; I don't clearly recall.  It was during the time of the advent of multiparty politics. 
Q.	And who replaced Kajelijeli as bourgmestre in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Emmanuel Harerimana. 
Q.	And you told us that Harerimana died on the 8th of April 1994.  Who replaced him as bourgmestre? 
A.	He was replaced by Semahane, who was deputy bourgmestre.  Thereafter a bourgmestre was appointed properly and this was Kajelijeli.  Semahane was there in an interim capacity, he was acting bourgmestre.  And then it is Kajelijeli who took over as bourgmestre. 
Q.	Semahane is number 85 on the spelling list.  Do you know when Kajelijeli was appointed bourgmestre for the second time?
A.	On that score, I also do not recall the dates, but it must have been in the month of May.  This is merely an estimate; it is, I believe, the month of May. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BTH? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to document number 18, which is in my exhibit packet, which is an excerpt from the Kajelijeli Trial Chamber judgement.  And in particular -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, I'm objecting to this line of questioning.  I've reviewed Mr. Robinson's document.  It is an excerpt of the Kajelijeli judgement and that Trial Chamber did look at the matter of Kajelijeli's reappointment.  But the date of the appointment was not an issue in the same way as it is in this trial.  And if Mr. Robinson wants to make a finding of that Trial Chamber applicable to these proceedings, then he should file a motion for judicial notice of previously adjudicated facts.  

So, it would be improper at this stage to introduce the judgement from Kajelijeli, or to raise it, or bring this Trial Chamber's attention to one paragraph in that judgement for purposes of cross-examining this witness. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I actually didn't get a chance to complete my submission, and so I will complete that now.  

If you notice at paragraph 268 under the title "Findings", its says that:  "The Chamber notes that it is not contested -- that it is not uncontested that the Accused served as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune from 1988 to 1993.  The Chamber finds that the Accused was removed from office in February 1993, and that following the death of bourgmestre Harerimana on 8 April 1994, the Accused was appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune for a second time on 26th June 1994."  

As to those two sentences that I have just read to you, it is my request, pursuant to Rule 94(B), that the Trial Chamber takes judicial notice of those facts as the facts which were adjudicated by the             Trial Chamber in the Kajelijeli case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what are you doing here?  Are you cross-examining the witness, or are you making a motion?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Right now, I am making a motion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but why do you need to do that motion now?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Because the dates have now become relevant to the trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you can't expect us to respond to an application for judicial notice of this matter. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you are cross-examining the witness, that is one thing, we are now dealing with the witness's evidence.  What we take judicial notice of is not relevant to your cross-examination at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I was going to see if the witness was able to accurately provide us with the dates of Mr. Kajelijeli -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is different.  If the witness is giving testimony, you could question him about what his recollection is.  What we take judicial notice of is a matter of law, which is not necessarily linked to this witness's testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, what has happened is the witness has given testimony about these events.  It now appears that his testimony is not accurate.  So, now I am to the point where I want you to take judicial notice -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson --

MR. ROBINSON:
You don't have to decide at this moment, but it has just arisen.  I have made the motion.  You can decide it at a later time. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The speed of the speakers.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
The occasion has now arisen in which I need to ask you to take judicial notice.  You can make your own timetable for making that decision, but as far as my prospective is that this is the occasion in which the need for judicial notice has now arisen in the trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take note of your motion.  You can proceed with your cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I realise the Court is not going to decide the motion now, but to put things in context, I would like to offer the following observation, which is that the date of Kajelijeli's re-appointment as bourgmestre was not an issue in the Kajelijeli trial.  The fact of his reappointment was an issue.  So,  Mr. Robinson's -- in Mr. Robinson's reading of the paragraph I think the Court alludes to that, but I just want that to be clear for this Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we also don't think it is appropriate for an application at this stage to be made         openly -- orally.  I mean, if you really want it to be taken seriously, it should be in a written motion. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I will file a written motion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, I now want to ask you some questions about the préfet of Ruhengeri.  Were you aware that an individual by the name of Protais Zigiranyirazo was the préfet of Ruhengeri at one time? 
A.	Yes, I am aware of this. 
Q.	Can you tell us; approximately, when it was that he was no longer préfet? 
A.	I do not know. 
Q.	Do you know who replaced him as préfet? 
A.	I know that after his departure, there were, at least, three préfets, Nzabagerageza, Bariyanga and Bazel, but I do not know the chronological order. 
Q.	Do you know, approximately, when it was that Préfet Charles Nzabagerageza no longer served as préfet, when did his term end; do you know?  
A.	I do not know; I do not remember.  I would like to tell you on this matter, but when you ask me to provide approximate dates; you must recall that I cannot remember all of this.  It happened a long time ago.  We did not take notes as the events unfolded.  And when you ask me a question you always asked me to give an approximate period.  And in this vein I tell you such and such an event took place at such and such a date.  With regard to the situation of the various préfets, I'm not in a position to give you the dates because I did not take notes.  I did not pay attention to the various points in time. 
Q.	Do you know who was the préfet of Ruhengeri at the time of the attack in February 1993? 
A.	I do not remember anymore, but I know that Bariyanga was préfet.  And the day after the death of President Habyarimana, he also died.  But I do not know the date he was appointed préfet.  I just know that during the era of multiparty politics, Ruhengeri préfecture went through a lot of préfets. 
Q.	Now, with respect to the MRND, you have testified that the president of the MRND at the commune level was Jean Damascéne Niyoyita, number 63 on the spelling list; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, he was president of the MRND in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	And were there any other officers of the MRND in Mukingo commune prior to -- or at the time of      1992 to 1994? 
A.	I did not quite understand your question.  Would you kindly rephrase it?  
Q.	Were there any other officers of the MRND at the commune level, such as a vice president, secretary or treasurer? 
A.	We realised -- or rather, we reported to Nzirorera.  In the framework of the party, all problems were put to Nzirorera.  We did not have to account to -- to be accountable to the communal authorities, because orders were issued to us by the person who was a top official in the MRND at national level.  I know that when membership cards were distributed, it was the responsable of the cellule and cellule members who drew up lists in a register and who distributed cards against the signatures of those receiving membership cards. 
Q.	Do you know of any officers of the MRND in Mukingo commune besides President Niyoyita? 
A.	I have already told you that the person we were most concerned with was Nzirorera.  I just knew that Niyoyita was the president of the MRND in Mukingo that was enough for me. 
Q.	And Mr. Niyoyita was employed as the inspector of schools in Mukingo commune, correct? 
A.	Yes, you are correct. 
Q.	And his office was adjacent to the Mukingo commune building, correct? 
A.	I have just given explanations on that -- or, rather, I will give explanation on that.  The inspector's office was in the Mukingo communal office, which was marked as such; whereas, the MRND was in the CCDFP office building.  As a matter of fact, you could say there were two offices, one for the MRND and one which was used by this person in his capacity as a school inspector. 
Q.	Witness BTH, I suggest to you that the MRND office for Mukingo commune was actually located in the Isimbi building, where the MRND flag flew.  And that the office at the commune was the office that     Mr. Niyoyita worked out of in connection with his duties? 
A.	No, that is a web of lies, it is not what you are saying.  I know very well the MRND Mukingo office was located at the Mukingo commune, whereas the Isimbi building was the Interahamwe building.  We had keys to that office, which is to say that we did not have to hold Niyoyita's keys; Niyoyita, who was president of the MRND in Mukingo commune.  Nzirorera had given us the keys and, therefore, we had no business opening the office of the communal president's office.  So, don't try and twist this for the Chamber, distracting it.  

Niyoyita had his office, the communal office.  And ours was at the Isimbi building which had been provided to us by Nzirorera.  This I know, because I was there; you were not. 
Q.	Well the Trial Chamber will have the benefit of hearing from Mr. Niyoyita on this, and then they can make their determination at the end of the case.  In any event, turning to the préfecture level, can you tell us who was the president of the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture from 1992 to 1994? 
A.	Casimir Bizimungu was president of the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture, but I do not know the date of his appointment to that post.  But I do know that in 1994, he was president of the MRND in     Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	Now, in Mukingo commune, Mr. Nzirorera had a large family; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know how many children his father had? 
A.	No, I do not know their names -- their number.  I could give you the names of the children that I do know.  He had many children.  He was a polygamist, so that there is no way I could know all of his children; however, I do know a few.  If you ask me to give the names of the children that I do know, I could answer. 
Q.	And so, it is true, is it not, that Mr. Nzirorera had many brothers, nephews, cousins, and other relatives in Mukingo commune? 
A.	You are right; he had a very large family in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Now, with respect to the MRND in the formation of the youth wing, it has been your testimony that that youth wing was first formed in November 1991; is that correct? 
A.	In fact, I gave an estimate. 
Q.	And the estimate was around November 1991, correct? 
A.	Yes, but you must understand that that was an estimate. 
Q.	That is understood.  And you told us that a meeting was convened by Juvénal Kajelijeli for the youth to meet at the Mukingo communal office; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was the office of Juvénal Kajelijeli in the MRND; what position did he hold in the MRND? 
A.	All I knew is that Kajelijeli was an influential member of the MRND.  I did not try to enquire as to the post he occupied.  He was the go between between us and Nzirorera; whenever Nzirorera had something to say to us, he would use him.  And if we had a matter to report to him, we would go through him.  I knew that he was involved, and consulted during the reform process of the party.  So, not just anyone could have been invited to participate in the reform. 
Q.	And it is your testimony that it was bourgmestre Kajelijeli rather than the president of the MRND in the commune who convened the meeting of the new MRND youth wing? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French interpreters are asking if the counsel can repeat the question.  
THE WITNESS:
It is Kajelijeli who was bourgmestre at the time, so I don't see what -- where the problem lies. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Bone of contention. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, I have been asked to repeat my question, so it may be redundant for you.  But you are telling us that it was the bourgmestre, and not the president of the MRND in the commune who convened the meeting of the MRND youth wing; is that correct? 
A.	I told you that the meeting was convened by Kajelijeli, who was bourgmestre at the time. 
Q.	And were there any other authorities present at this meeting? 
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	Was Mr. Niyoyita present? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	Now, following this meeting, it is my understanding from your testimony that the youth elected officers of the MRND youth wing for Mukingo commune; is that correct? 
A.	You are correct. 
Q.	And was that election held during the meeting convened by Kajelijeli, or at some later time? 
A.	It was during the meeting convened by Kajelijeli. 
Q.	And during that meeting, the officers that were elected were president, vice president, secretary and treasurer, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did there come a time when the person who had been elected president requested to step down from that position, resulting in the election of a new president? 
A.	Yes, he did it.  He made the request because he said he was too busy.  He had other duties to attend to and could, therefore, not cumulate the two posts.  His request was received, granted and elections were held. 
Q.	And how long after the first meeting did that occur? 
A.	Between a month and four months. 
Q.	How many youth had attended the meeting at the Mukingo communal office, convened by  Bourgmestre Kajelijeli? 
A.	There were about 60 people, I reckon, once again. 
Q.	Now, was a person by the name of Hakizimana elected to a position in the Interahamwe, that is, H-A-K-I-Z-I-M-A-N-A? 
A.	I know he was present, but I do not remember the post to which he was elected anymore.  However, I do know that he was present.  But I know that he was a member of the committee.  I believe I even mentioned him in my testimony in this court. 
Q.	Yes, you did.  And, I believe, you told us that he lived in the house of Alphonse Ntirivamunda, which is number 67 on the spelling list.  
A.	Yes, that is the one. 
Q.	And what was his role with the Interahamwe during the period of 1991 through 1994? 
A.	He was a resident mostly of Kigali, at Ntirivamunda's house.  And from time to time he would come into our area.  But I knew him as a person interested in the activities of the Interahamwe, but we were not able to make out exactly what role he played in the Interahamwe. 
Q.	I believe you testified in your direct examination that he would go to see Mr. Nyabusore for instructions; is that correct?  And Nyabusore is number 68 on the spelling list.
A.	Yes, that is what I am saying.  I said, he would go to see Nyabusore and pick up the phone to speak to whoever he had to speak to.  When I saw him, he was holding a type -- a typed document.  And when the officials would pass through there, he would give them the document so that they could make use of it.  Therefore, I think he must have been tasked to carry out that mission, maybe he was found to be more competent than us.  I recall that he would give the document to the diplomats who would address the leaders by telephone, and give or get instructions.  So, that is the role he would play.  It is not for me to answer as to what he did.  You might want to enquire from other people what he did.  I know that he wore the Interahamwe uniform just like us. 
Q.	And did he ever transmit instructions concerning the killing or extermination of Tutsi? 
A.	No, when the massacres began, he was not in our locality, he was in Kigali.  He would come to our locality when there were demonstrations, or when he wanted to go to the Munyapenta (phonetic) family. 
Q.	Well, you have told us that there were instructions to attack Tutsi from time to time given to the Interahamwe from 1992.  Was Mr. Hakizimana involved in either the transmission of those instructions, or the receipt of those instructions or was he in a position where he would be aware of those instructions? 
A.	As I said, he spent most of his time in Kigali.  He would come to our locality when invited.  And when he came, he would speak to Nyabusore.  I never said that Hakizimana would give us instructions.  I told you that it was Nzirorera who gave us instructions. 
Q.	And to your knowledge, did Mr. Nzirorera ever transmit any instructions by telephone, or otherwise, through Hakizimana? 
A.	Yes, he gave him instructions at our demonstration.  He spoke to him. 
Q.	And did those instructions involve the Tutsi in any way? 
A.	No, that is not what I said.  I told you that we demonstrated because the editorial of                    President Habyarimana was no longer being broadcast on radio, so once again -- that once again, it would be broadcast on the radio. 
Q.	Was there a person by the name of Bernard Ntabahwana, that`s N-T-A-B-A-H-W-A-N-A, also known as Suku (phonetic), ever affiliated with the Interahamwe or the Amahindure in Mukingo? 
A.	I do not know that person. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm about to show another exhibit and I see the time, would you like to take your break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take a recess.  We will take the mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1110H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can continue now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  And if the witness could be shown document number 20 in my list of exhibits; that is a two-page excerpt from RTLM radio, and has K-number K0210812 and 13, and it is in Kinyarwanda. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what has just been placed in front of you is an excerpt from a broadcast on RTLM on the 10th of June 1994.  And at the bottom of the first page, the radio announcer, Bernard Hategekimana, Mukingo, that`s H-A-T-E-G-E-K-I-M-A-N-A, is speaking.  And he continues on to the second page.  And there is a paragraph that begins with the word Uhbwo (phonetic), it is the third paragraph on the second page.  And in that paragraph, he speaks of Mukingo and Nkuli commune, and the Amahindure.  So what I would like you to do is to read that paragraph out loud, and then I am going to ask you a question about it.  And if you could read slowly, so that the translation can be done. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Can we know the question before the paragraph is actually read?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  The question will be, "Can you tell us what was the relationship between this individual,     Bernard Ntabahwana, also known as Suku (phonetic) and the Amahindure. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness, can you read the paragraph please? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Isn't this the person that the witness claims not to have known?  

MR. ROBINSON: 
That is correct. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, can you read the paragraph out loud, please? 
A.	Yes.  "It is true.  I should like to tell you, I would like to tell all of the Rwandans, as you see the       locals -- local inhabitants fled.  Some fled because they lived where combat was raging; some of them arrived in Ruhengeri and -- but, they did not stay with their arms crossed.  I arrived in Mukingo, where there is one Bernard Ntabahwana who launched a project to assist the population.  The project is known as Amahindure.  They all contributed.  They all gave a certain amount of money to support the youth and buy weapons.  So as you see, that was a good idea that is how I and Gatano went about it.  We said, "We have intellectuals who must use their intelligence to solve the problems we are facing."  There are certain places, such as Kacyiru where the fighting was fierce.  And that people have preferred to flee than to face the war.  We invite them to try and do something to face up to the war." 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness BTH? 
A.	And follow, therefore, that example. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness BTH.  Now, this person that is being associated with the Amahindure, Bernard Ntabahwana Suku (phonetic), it says Kuku here, but I suggest to you it is Suku (phonetic), I'm told also was known by another name called Sebunyatsi, S-E-B-U-N-Y-A-T-S-I.  Do you know of a connection between this individual and the Amahindure in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I know nothing about it because, as I have already told you, I don't remember that person.  Perhaps he who has spoken to you about him can give me some information so that I could remember -- try to remember him. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time, I would offer the two pages from RTLM, that was Exhibit D. NZ145. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
May I enquire on what basis it is being offered into evidence?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  It is being offered as a broadcast of RTLM on the 10th of June 1994.  And like the other speeches that have been offered and accepted as evidence, it is being offered as -- authenticated by the fact that it is among the documents provided to us by the Prosecution that they received from the authorities of the government of Rwanda representing broadcasts which occurred during this time. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I would object.  I don't see how this is relevant for the cross-examination of this witness. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, directing myself to the relevant objection --  

MR. PRESIDENT:
That is what is concerning us.  The issue is, it has no probative value at this stage; the witness has not acknowledged it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is the problem.  So I don't see how we can admit it into evidence. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, the probative value, or the relevance of it is the fact that on the 10th of June 1994 RTLM was identifying an individual --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but then -- if it -- if it is going to be put in for the truth of its content, this witness cannot do it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, that is correct.  But that is two different -- two different issues.  One is foundation, and one is relevance.  And I'm understanding the Prosecution is not objecting to foundation, as they have not objected to the other speeches from the broadcast of these stations.  

As far as relevance goes, I think it is relevant, whether you would -- what weight you give to it, at this point, we can't determine, but it seems that --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, but it is quite clear, our position on this, Mr. Robinson.  We will permit you to put questions to the witness for the purpose of eliciting his answers, which is, what is the evidence.  In this case, his answer does not permit the introduction of the document.  So, if you want the document marked for identification, we can do that.  And if you can find somebody (inaudible) to put it in, it is just that it has absolutely no probative value at this stage, because this witness's answer has not acknowledged it.  He has not acknowledged the content of it.  And if you want it to be put in for the truth of it, to contradict it, it has to be put in by a witness who can do it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  We can mark it for identification as ID. NZ28.
 (Exhibit ID. NZ28 marked for identification)
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to clarify for the record, Mr. Robinson made a comment that the Prosecution has not objected to past speeches.  That's not accurate.  We've made a number of objections.  They have been overruled and on that basis, we don't constantly object simply to preserve the record.  But I don't want there to be a presumption that the speeches that are coming into evidence are coming in with our consent.  It is simply -- that's the way the evidence has developed thus far.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, it is my understanding that from your direct testimony, that you claim that after the meeting with the bourgmestre in which the youth wing of the MRND was convened, and the officers were elected that there was a meeting with Mr. Nzirorera.  Can you tell us approximately how long after the meeting convened by Kajelijeli, did you meet with Nzirorera? 
A.	I no longer recall, but I know that after the meeting we met Nzirorera.  I have always told you that these are approximations.  Not -- I didn't take written notes; moreover, we didn't know that the regime in place at the time would be vanquished by the RPF.  So, we were not concerned with taking notes because we didn't know that we would be questioned as to everything that occurred.  But I tell you, yet again, that after the meeting called by Kajelijeli, we elected a committee; at the meeting, we elected a committee that was subsequently the committee that was introduced to Nzirorera. 
Q.	At the time of the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera, was Michel Niyigaba the president or the vice president of the Intera -- of the youth wing? 
A.	Vice president, he was vice president. 
Q.	And can you tell us where the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera took place? 
A.	The meeting was held at his mother's house. 
Q.	And can you tell us what other authorities, besides Mr. Nzirorera, were present? 
A.	I no longer recall who was there, everyone, but I know that Niyoyita was there, Jean Damascene, Augustin Bizimungu, Nyabusore, Kajelijeli, and many others.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Including another name that escaped the interpreter.  But the witness goes on:  
THE WITNESS:
I no longer recall everyone who was there. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
The interpreters missed one of the names. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The first one. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	The first name that you gave.  So I -- the ones I received was Niyoyita, Augustin Bizimungu, Nyabusore and Kajelijeli.  Can you repeat the other name that you mentioned?  
A.	Ndisetse, Ndisetse.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And that is number 61 on the spelling list. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, can you tell us what was the position of Augustin Bizimungu at the time of this meeting? 
A.	I think he was the ops commander for Ruhengeri military area.  He was commander at Mukamira camp.  And, subsequently, he was ops commander for Ruhengeri military area.  And then, subsequently, chief of general staff of the army.  At that time, I think he was ops commander for Ruhengeri military area. 
Q.	Was he a native of Mukingo commune? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was he --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Oh sorry, Counsel.  Could you repeat the question, one of the booths is asking if you could repeat that last question.  Sorry. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, I need to repeat the question to you for the translation.  Was he a native of Mukingo commune? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was he an officer, or even a member of the MRND? 
A.	I really don't know; but I saw him often moving around with MRND party members.  And he cooperated with them, collaborated with them, worked with them.  He was with Nzirorera.  And I know that he was very close to all of the activities, and supported the Interahamwe as I told you. 
Q.	Are you aware that in the multiparty system, it was not allowed for a military officer to be a member of a political party? 
A.	But, Counsel, I never said he was a member of any political party.  I merely said that I saw him often in the company of MRND party members, and that he supported MRND party activities, such as, the Interahamwe's activities, for example.  But I never saw him wearing MRND uniform; I always saw him in military uniform.  So, I never said that he was a member of any political party, and I know very well that the soldiers were not permitted to be members of political parties. 
(Pages 1 to 22 by Donna M. Lewis)











1130H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And what did you understand the purpose of his being present when the youth wing of the MRND was introduced? 
A.	You can put that question to Nzirorera, but as far as I know, he came to support all the MRND activities and join the local authorities in hunting down the RPF accomplices; that is to say, the Tutsis.  So he came to show his approval, to manifest and show his approval of everything that was going on.  

The Tutsi were being slaughtered, and I know many of them were slaughtered at Mukamira camp, which he -- of which he was the commanding officer and of which he was informed -- aware, because the meetings planning the massacres took place in his presence and he approved and supported them. 
Q.	Did there come a time after this meeting that you received a membership card in the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, I was given that card. 
Q.	And approximately how long after your meeting where the officers were introduced to Mr. Nzirorera and others did you receive that card? 
A.	It was quite some time after, after we received the uniforms. 
Q.	Was it before the formation of the Amahindure? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the membership card that you received, did it have a photograph? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was there a signature of an MRND or Interahamwe official on the card? 
A.	On the card there was the signature of the MRND -- the MRND official.  Other cards bore the signature of whoever was in charge of the Interahamwe.  It depended on where the card -- the card was issued. 
Q.	And speaking of your card, whose signature was on it? 
A.	That man sitting behind you, Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	And in what capacity had he signed the card? 
A.	All I know is that he signed it.  As to the rest of it, you can ask him.  I know that he was president of the party. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if the witness could be shown Exhibit P. 1. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what has been placed before you are Exhibits P. 1A and B, which is the front and back of a card.  The front has the word "Interahamwe za MRND" on it, and the back, the name of the person and their location and a place for a photograph.  Now, can you tell us was your card identical to this one?  
A.	No.  I told you it depended on the place of issue of the card. 
Q.	How did your card differ from this one? 
A.	My card was a larger sheet than this one and the sheet could be folded into two.  And there was nothing on the back. 
Q.	And did your card have a place for the signature of the president, as this card does? 
A.	I remember there was a stamp, the MRND seal, and so I think it is the same thing as this one. 
Q.	And it's -- on your card Mathieu Ngirumpatse signed and it was indicated as the president of the MRND; is that correct? 
A.	I do not remember if mention was made of that as president of the MRND.  I can add that it is his signature, though I must remind you that he was also secretary general of the party.  I do not remember if he signed on someone else's order.  All I know is that it is his signature. 
Q.	Witness BTH, I want to read to you portions of the testimony that you gave on the 5th of April 2004 in this case.  And I'm going to read to you from page 33 of that transcript.  You were asked whether -- and this is on line 15, and it was a question by the lawyer for Mr. Ngirumpatse at the time, Mr. Roach.  

"Witness, are you certain with the testimony you are giving now, that is, that on your card issued to you in 1992, that Dr. Ngirumpatse was indicated as the president of the MRND?"  

And your answer was:  "I have already answered that question." 

Mr. Roach said, "No, you didn't answer that question.  You said his name was on your card.  I'm asking you if you are certain." 

And the President of the Tribunal said, "Could you please answer the question, Mr. Witness?"  

And your answer was:  "Yes, I said that I was certain." 

So, when you testified in 2004, you were certain that Mathieu Ngirumpatse's signature was on this card and indicated that he was the chairman of the MRND.  Subsequently, Mr. Roach asked -- after you gave that answer, Mr. Roach asked you a series of questions in which he indicated that in 1992 it was President Habyarimana who was the president of the MRND and that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was secretary general.  And I suggest to you that, coming here today, you have changed your testimony because you realise that your testimony that you gave at this trial earlier was not the truth, and it was impossible for Mathieu Ngirumpatse to have signed an Interahamwe card as president of the MRND, since he wasn't president of the MRND at that time.  
MR. WEBSTER:
First of all, if I could ask Mr. Robinson to remind me of the page again; and then second of all, I would object to the form of the question.  

First of all, the question was very long.  I would suggest that it be broken down a bit.  And then within the question itself is an acknowledgement that the witness corrected himself or was corrected during the course of his first cross-examination back in 2004.  So to suggest to the witness that he is lying now is inappropriate.  
MR. ROBINSON:
For Mr. Webster's information, the page is 33.  And I could put the question again to the witness.  I'll try to simplify it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, I'm suggesting to you that you testified under oath at this trial in 2004, that your Interahamwe card was signed by Mathieu Ngirumpatse in his capacity as president of the MRND, and that it was pointed out to you that that testimony was inaccurate, because at the time Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not the president of the MRND.  And so you have come here today to change your testimony, to tell us now that it could have possibly been in some other capacity that Mr. Ngirumpatse signed this card.  What do you have to say about that?  
A.	This is what I'm saying:  When you realise that you are mistaken and that I was right in mentioning -- I do not even remember Mr. Roach asking me the question.  If he did, I have forgotten.  But now I am saying there was a date and signature belonging to the president.  There was no mention of president of the Interahamwe or of the MRND.  So I'm saying his signature was there, but that I do not remember if this was a signature by order, although I have always maintained he was at one time president of the MRND and also secretary general of the party.  So if I've added something, it is because I have recalled it.  It is quite possible that yesterday or the day before yesterday I omitted some information, but what matters is that it is he who signed, who appended his signature to that document.  
Q.	And I put it to you, Witness BTH, that Mathieu Ngirumpatse never signed an Interahamwe card.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	When he appended his signature to the card, you were not there.  He and we know -- we, who received the cards -- I can confirm this and I'm not the only one.  The Interahamwes in our area had the same cards, and these cards bore his signature.  I think that there will be some Interahamwes here to testify for the Defence, but you ought to ask them that question. 
Q.	Yes, we'll do that.  Now, do you have any membership -- do you know of anyone who still has an Interahamwe membership card in Mukingo?  
A.	Even if there was such a person, I do not think that he would give it to you.  He would wonder why you want that card, because currently in Rwanda, people there are not members of the Interahamwe or the MRND.  It is not a question you could easily put to anybody, and I'm not in a position to say for certain whether any of the members kept their documents.  No one has ever asked me to produce those documents.  But I really have no idea.  You may want to ask other people, who may have them. 
Q.	Do you still have your Interahamwe card?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately when it was that the youth wing of the MRND was named Interahamwe in Mukingo?  
A.	I do not know the exact period.  I can give you a time frame.  I think it was in mid-1992.  It is just a period, but I do not know the -- or have, rather, the exact date. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time in 1992 when the Interahamwe of Mukingo received some training? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And approximately what part of 1992 did this take place?  
A.	Towards the end of the year. 
Q.	And can you tell us how you learned about the fact that Interahamwe would be given military training? 
A.	I was also present at the training. 
Q.	But how were you informed that training would take place? 
A.	But I was an Interahamwe.  How could I not have known?  We talked about it.  We discussed it as a committee within our committee. 
Q.	And whose initiative was it for the training of Interahamwe in Mukingo, and how did you learn about that initiative?  
A.	It was Sergeant Dusabimana, François, who told us that the training would be taking place, and with the assistance of Musafiri, Gervaise, they did supervise said training. 
Q.	And can you tell us how long that training lasted? 
A.	Less than a month.  I think it was probably two weeks.  The training was not long. 
Q.	Where did the training take place? 
A.	At the place called Isimbi rya Busogo. 
Q.	And was that the building that was located in Byangabo centre on the road between Ruhengeri and Gisenyi? 
A.	Yes, it is the building that Nzirorera had granted to the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe would receive and undergo training there.
Q.	About how many people were trained? 
A.	In any event, they were less than 20. 
Q.	Now, isn't it a fact that when you testified at the trial of Casimir Bizimungu on the 12th of October 2004, at page 7, you testified that there were about 50 people trained? 
A.	I do not remember if that is what I said.  If I said it, I was mistaken.  The actual number of Interahamwe was 50.  It is true those 50 Interahamwe -- that uniforms were distributed.  But it would be less than that. 
Q.	Did the training take place inside the building or outside?  
A.	The building was in a compound, at the rear of the compound that the training took place. 
Q.	Was there an effort to keep this training secret, or was the training done openly? 
A.	Listen, when something happens in the rear of a compound, in the backyard of a compound, it is something secret.  It is not a training or something that could have happened out there on the road.  However, I can confirm that there were people aware of the training.  Such people exist.  Among those living in Mukingo, you will definitely find people who can confirm that the training took place. 
Q.	And what kind of training was it?  What were you trained to do?  
A.	We were taught how to dismantle a firearm and assemble it again, how to load a weapon, how to pull out the stopper from a grenade, a lot of things which we were taught at the site of the training. 
Q.	And what were you told was the purpose of the Interahamwe learning these skills? 
A.	The Interahamwe took part in various attacks.  They were very well aware that when the need arose to use grenades or firearms, the Interahamwe would have to be able to master such weapons, because when attacks were conducted against the Tutsis or other members of various parts -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says witness -- "parties", rather.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were you told that the purpose of the training was to learn how to attack Tutsis or to defend the population against the RPF?  
A.	But as for the security of the population, this was not a responsibility of the Interahamwe.  It is the soldiers.  If you were to say that, that would be a way of misleading people. 
Q.	So then is it your testimony that you were told that the purpose of this training from 1992 was so that the Interahamwe could attack the Tutsis? 
A.	All this was done to combat the enemy, to prevent the enemy from invading our region and to seek out the enemy.  That was the objective of it all.  You must remember -- you may recall that at that time there were major operations in the context of kubohoza.  If you want me to give you further details, tell me.  
Q.	Well, I'm finding your answer a little ambiguous because it's one thing to defend against the enemy and it's another thing to go and attack Tutsi.  So which was it that you were actually being trained to do, as far as you were told? 
A.	There are two things:  Maybe you need me to explain what was referred to as the enemy or the kubohoza operation.  First of all, we had to attack the enemy.  Secondly, there was the kubohoza operation.  
Q.	Why don't you tell us your understanding of the kubohoza operation?  
A.	At the time, there were parties opposed to the MRND; namely, the MDR, the PSD, the PL, and others.  Moreover, these parties had youth wings:  The MDR, the Abakombozi, and so on and so forth.  So kubohoza meant go to force the members of other parties to join the MRND by forcing them if they did not want to.  

So you have been told about fighting with the various youth wings.  There was perpetual confrontation between the youth wings.  There was a need to attack other parties and bring down their flags of other parties.  When they refused or put up resistance, they were beaten.  All this happened. 
Q.	Witness BTH, we've heard testimony at this trial from two officers of the national committee of the Interahamwe who stated that the military training did not begin until 1993, after the RPF attack.  Can you explain to us why the Interahamwe in Mukingo was trained in 1992?  
A.	Amahindure Virunga force received training in 1993, but as far as we were concerned, we had already received training.  Maybe you can seek clarification from Mr. Nzirorera.  I even said that the Interahamwe in Mukingo were very strong.  It is because they had been trained well ahead of the others, because they were, or had participated in various operations that had taken place here and there.  This had started a long time before.  It is true that the public training began in 1993.  In my case, I am referring to our locality.  

Well ahead of the 1993 training, we had received preliminary training.  By that, I think you will understand how important the Nzirorera -- Nzirorera's Interahamwe in Mukingo were. 
Q.	Do you know of any other locality in Rwanda in which Interahamwe were trained in 1992, other than Mukingo?  
A.	I have heard of it.  I am certain you will find some other Rwandan to tell you about this training.  I have heard of it in other areas. 
Q.	And what other areas were receiving Interahamwe -- in what other areas were the Interahamwe receiving military training in 1992, according to you?  
A.	I know no more.  I know that the Interahamwe underwent training.  At one point there was even talk of a movement of Interahamwe.  It was said they had gone to be trained in Israel.  
Q.	And in what localities were the Interahamwe from who had received military training in 1992, as far as you know? 
A.	I am not in a position to confirm the areas.  I am telling you about what I was told.  It was said that there were Interahamwes undergoing training and that some of them had even gone to Israel.  All I am telling you, mostly, is what I witnessed personally. 
Q.	Do you know the name of any other Interahamwe outside of Mukingo who was trained in 1992? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you give us that name, please? 
A.	Hamuri Bizimana. 
Q.	And from what commune is he? 
A.	He came from Kigombe commune, but at the time he was living in Kigali.  William, son of Sebitabo, he also lived in Kigali.  However, he came from Mukingo in our area, but he lived in Kigali and that is where he underwent training. 
Q.	And it's your testimony that both of these people underwent training in 1992 as members of Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, I want to turn to the meetings that you say were held at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house, and I believe that you testified that these meetings were held almost every weekend from 1991 to April of 1994; is that correct? 
A.	The meetings were held during that period and almost every weekend. 
Q.	And Mr. Nzirorera himself was present almost every weekend, correct?  
A.	The meetings were held in his presence.  When he was not present, the meetings were not held. 
Q.	And between January and April 1994, those meetings continued to be held almost every weekend? 
A.	I did not quite understand the question.  What year are you referring to, Counsel?  I did not quite understand the question.  
Q.	I was asking you between January and April 1994, did those meetings take place almost every weekend?  
A.	With reference to the first three months of 1994, the meetings were held, but I did not say it was every weekend.  It is highly possible that some meetings took place -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, the interpreter didn't understand the last part of the witness's answer. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, could you repeat your answer?  It wasn't understood by the interpreters.  
A.	I think you asked me if the first three months of 1994, whether meetings were held.  I told you the meetings went on, but that it was not every weekend.  There may have been two, three or even four meetings, but they were not held every single weekend.  However, it is important to note that they were held during that period.  
Q.	And did you see Mr. Nzirorera at each of the meetings when he would come back on the weekends between January and April 1994?  
A.	Each time Mr. Nzirorera came to his place -- his mother's place in Mukingo, I would see him when I was there. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately how many times you saw him from January to April 1994?  
A.	About twice.  I don't remember exactly, but let's say at least twice, because each time he came, I didn't make a note, so that one day I could tell you exactly how many times I saw him.  But I know that it was more than once. 
Q.	And when was the last time you saw him in Mukingo commune prior to the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I can't recall.  I can't remember the date or the month or -- I tell you, I didn't make a written note.  If I had then -- had I done, I might be able to recall, but I don't. 
Q.	Now, the meetings took place at the house of Nzirorera's mother near Byangabo centre, not the house of Mr. Nzirorera himself, which was closer to Nkuli commune, correct? 
A.	I testify as to what I saw.  If meetings were held at his own home, well, somebody must know because people live there, around there.  I tell you what I saw, what was going on where I lived.  The only meeting -- the meeting that I mentioned was the one where he gave us the Interahamwe uniforms. 
Q.	And so all of the meetings that you've talked about that occurred on the weekends, you're talking about the location of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's residence, correct? 
A.	Yes, I did speak of a meeting which I attended.  We have to add the meeting held at his residence where he issued -- distributed the Interahamwe uniforms. 
Q.	Now, I understand that, but I'm speaking of the weekend meetings that were held by the authorities that you've described taking place on almost every weekend.  I just want to have you be clear about where is the location where those meetings took place.  
A.	The meetings were held at Nzirorera's mother's house, but there was one meeting at his own house on which occasion he gave out Interahamwe uniforms. 
Q.	And at the regular weekend meetings at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house, when those meetings broke up, you would be informed of decisions of -- that had been taken or information to be given to Interahamwe, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you were there in the compound of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house to receive that information, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And as far as you could observe, the meeting was finished when the people came out to the compound, correct? 
A.	People were present while the meeting was being held and after the meeting, the decisions reached at the meeting were -- were communicated to them.  
Q.	And you're not aware that these meetings were adjourned and then continued at Mr. Nzirorera's own residence, are you? 
A.	No, that's not what I said. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, if the witness can be shown Exhibit 19 -- or document 19 in my exhibits.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, I have compiled a list of people who you have said regularly attended the meetings at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house, and what I would like you to do is carefully look at this list and tell me whether indeed these are the people who, according to you, attended these meetings.  And if we need to subtract or add someone from this list, we can do that.  So is this an accurate list of persons who, according to you, regularly attended meetings at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house?  
A.	The last one on the list is Nzirorera.  Well, it's in fact their house.  Dusabimana, François - François Dusabimana was Nzirorera's younger brother, so I can't say he came to the meeting because it was at his mother's home.  But in respect of the other people on the list, well, yes, they did attend the meeting -- meetings. 
Q.	And most of the time Dusabimana also attended the meeting, correct? 
A.	It was his mother's home, her residence.  He had the right to be there.  He knew everything that went on there and he had the right to be there -- to be present there.  He was a child of the family.  No one could prevent him from being at his family home.  So I wanted to make it clear that he knew everything that was going on and would give orders, instructions, and if he did so, it meant that he had received those instructions from someone else.  And he also told us of the decisions reached at those meetings. 
Q.	When I put his name on the list, I was relying on your testimony that you had given at the trial of General Bizimungu on the 30th of January 2006, at page 68, in which you had said that, "Most of the time, Sergeant Dusabimana was attending the meeting.  He was inside the house and he would come and recount to us what was being said during the meeting."  So was that testimony accurate?  
A.	Yes, that is what I said and I confirm it.  He was inside the house, and from time to time he'd come out and speak of one thing or another, and yet again, I wish to make it clear that it was his mother's home.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer this list as Exhibit D. NZ145.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ145 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, I put it to you that Mr. Nzirorera contends that these meetings you have referred to never took place, that Mr. Kajelijeli has testified that the meetings you referred to never took place, that General Bizimungu, Colonel Setako, Michel Bakunakundi, Alphonse Ntirivamunda, Jean Baptiste Nyabisore, Jean Damascène Niyoyita, Esdras Baheza, Assiel Ndisetse and Dominique Gatsimbanyi have all been interviewed by our Defence team and each one of them has indicated that there were no such meetings.  As to Lieutenant Hazigenyeza, Bambonye and François Dusabimana, we believe they're deceased and have been unable to contact them.  Do you have any comment on what I've just said? 
A.	Here is what I have to say regarding what you have just said.  As concerns Nzirorera, Bizimungu, Kajelijeli, Setako, I know that here they have been accused and have not pleaded guilty, so they can't say that what they are accused of occurred.  And as to the other people, they can't testify for the Prosecution -- for the Prosecution against their friends.  

I merely wish to tell you that you can certainly find other people who will tell you that these meetings took place, those meetings did -- that those meetings did take place.  And as to the Accused, I have never heard them acknowledge that one or another thing that they are accused of took place.  

Don't tell me that the Interahamwe from Mukingo bought their own uniforms.  I'll give you a piece of proof:  Once Nzirorera came to tell us that he'd seen a PSD flag in Ruhengeri, in an area called "Yaounde", and asked us why we had not removed that flag.  He gave us the order to go and remove the flag.  And we asked him whether we're supposed to go by foot.  And he had a brother-in-law, someone who had married his sister and who lived at a place called Ikora, and asked him how many millions does your vehicle cost?  And told him to hand over the vehicle to us so that we could go and remove the flag.  

And he told them that if, per chance, the vehicle was damaged, he would reimburse him.  And when we returned from that place where we had removed the flag, he gave us 20,000 francs to go and buy -- and we went and bought beer.  

And August, when he returned from the ESTB where he chaired a meeting of the teachers, I remember that on that occasion the director, who was a white man, was sacked.  And a Rwandan, named Nyagaragaza (phonetic), I think, was appointed director.  And that's when he gave us the MRND uniform, and subsequently he went home.  He was accompanied by some of his colleagues here.  And whatever Nzirorera is saying is merely delaying tactics.  He's trying to defend himself, in fact.  

You also spoke of Augustin Bizimungu.  Do you think that he would ever accept that Interahamwe would block the roads?  Before being chief of general staff of the army, he was the ops commander of Ruhengeri military zone.  How could Interahamwe block the roads if he had not given his approval?  

Hasengineza -- Hasengineza transported the Tutsi that they took either to Mukamira camp or a valley --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I missed the name -- 
THE WITNESS:
...how could Augustin Bizimungu, who commanded the camp, not know that?  He was both ops commander and commander of Mukamira camp.  

So all those people that you named, in fact, committed those acts.  How can Gatsimbanyi refuse, whereas he was convicted?  Why was he convicted?  Because -- he was convicted because he was involved in the genocide.  He can't come and testify for the Prosecution against his friend.  His wife is Nzirorera's sister.  How can he possibly accuse him?  So those people cannot confess, but the people from there can testify.  I know they wouldn't all accept to testify and tell the truth, but some of them, nonetheless, certainly are and that includes me.  And I'll stop there for now.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness, for your comment, and when the Trial Chamber hears from the 11 people, they will have to decide whom to believe.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, would you like to take our recess?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we'll take the recess now and we will go for lunch. 
(Court recessed from 1228H to 1414H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  I have a matter to raise with the Trial Chamber at this time.  It's a motion pursuant to Rule 54 to request that the Trial Chamber compel Witness XBM to submit to an interview with me, or, in the alternative, to exclude his testimony.  

The Trial Chamber may be aware that on the 30th of May 2006, pursuant to the protection order issued by the Trial Chamber, the witness victim section asked Witness XBM whether or not he was willing to meet with me, and presented him a form to that effect, which he signed and indicated he was willing to meet with me in the presence of the Prosecutor.  

That meeting took place today at 12:30 in the witness room right next to this courtroom, and during the meeting I began by thanking the witness for being willing to meet with me, and saying that I was hoping that if he answered my questions, his time on the witness stand would be shorter.  And Mr. Webster immediately intervened and said that he was going to contradict me because he didn't believe that that would be the case.  And I told him that I didn't think he had any place to be intervening; he was only to be present as a spectator to my meeting with the witness.  But, nevertheless, he insisted and so he told the witness that he did not agree, that he didn't think his time on the witness stand would be any shorter, and he wanted the witness to understand that.  And Mr. Webster then went on to tell the witness that he didn't have to meet with the Defence counsel, that it was totally his decision, and that he was not required by the Tribunal to meet with the Defence counsel.  And, thereafter, I tried to ask the witness some questions.  Mr. Webster intervened again.  

The upshot of it was the witness said that he only wanted to answer the Prosecutor's question in a private meeting and would only answer the questions of the Defence lawyer in court.  And when I attempted to ask him why he would only want to speak to the Prosecutor and not to the Defence, Mr. Webster refused to allow him to answer that question.  And so I was never able to get any substantive information from the witness.  

So, it's our position that the conduct of Mr. Webster interfered with our right to meet with the witness, as the witness is not the party -- not the property of either party.  And, as a result of that, our right to a fair trial has been compromised, and we're asking as a remedy for the Trial Chamber to now compel the witness to submit to an interview by me, and it can be in the presence of the Prosecutor, and to -- in the alternative, if that remedy is not invoked, then to exclude the testimony of Witness XBM.  Thank you.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Well, Your Honour, it shouldn't surprise you to hear from me that I have a very different recollection of what transpired in that meeting.  I don't know if the Court wants me to give my version of what happened because it's going to descend into a situation that Mr. Robinson says one thing and I say another.  But I see -- when I listen to Mr. Robinson's account, I wonder if we were in the same place at the same time because that's clearly not how I remember it.  But I did take the precaution of writing to Sylvie Becky, who is the head of WVSS.  

There were two WVSS witness support assistants who were present during the meeting.  They can provide the Chamber with an independent account of what transpired.  I don't know if they're in the waiting room now.  But suffice it to say that the witness, of his own, explained to all of us, number one, that he didn't realise he was going to be meeting with Peter Robinson, that he thought he was going to be meeting with the attorney for Karemera.  I explained to him that the case was entitled Prosecutor v. Karemera et al; there were three defendants on the case, Nzirorera being one of them; that he could speak with the Defence as much as he wanted, on any issue that he wanted to.  

One of the witness's responses to the series of exchanges was that he did not like the way Mr. Robinson asked questions of him, that those types of questions should be put to him in the courtroom, where he would answer them.  And my perception was that the witness was reacting to the aggressive way in which Mr. Robinson posed his questions.  So, I did not intervene at all to prevent the witness from answering any questions.  

With respect to the first question that Mr. Robinson asked the witness, or the statement that Mr. Robinson made the witness -- made to the witness, was patently false.  Mr. Robinson knows me.  We've been working together for several years.  I know him.  This was not the first time that we interviewed -- that I was present for an interview with a witness at his request.  Every time we have met with a witness, Mr. Robinson starts with the same litany of explanations to the witness, to encourage them to speak to him without reserve.  Every time he has done that in the past, I've corrected him.  The witnesses have made a choice either to continue with the interview or to terminate the interview.  

This is not the first time this has happened.  Mr. Robinson knows what to expect when he tells the witness, quite falsely, that if the witness answers his questions now, that his testimony in court would be shorter.  I, as a responsible prosecutor, simply correct that statement and indicate to the witness that he can speak as long as he wants on any topic, but his discussions in the meeting will not necessarily mean a shorter direct and cross-examination.  So on that point, that is my clarification.  But the two WVSS support assistants should be available, and the Trial Chamber can make its own independent enquiry of the witness and of the two independent parties that were present for the entire conversation.  
As for the remedy suggested by Mr. Robinson, it's wholly inappropriate.  The whole notion of having these Defence interviews of Prosecution witnesses is flawed at its inception, as far as we're concerned.  While the Trial Chamber has relied on a decision from the ICTY for the proposition that the Defence has a right to question Prosecution witnesses, we have jurisprudence from our own Tribunal, and here I refer the Court to a decision of 12 March 2001 in the prosecution of Juvénal Kajelijeli, where Trial Chamber II ruled that it was not necessary for Prosecution witnesses even to be given the opportunity to say whether they wanted to meet with the Defence or not.  So I would advise the Trial Chamber to revisit this issue globally.  It goes far beyond this one witness, XBM.  It's going to spill over to our consideration of Witness BTH because the allegations of -- the counter-allegations between Mr. Robinson and the witness that this Court heard yesterday are going to be continued during my re-direct examination.  And all of this could be avoided if this Chamber ordered the prophylactic measure of not allowing the Defence to cross the line in terms of speaking to Prosecution witnesses. 

We listen to countless motions on disclosure.  Mr. Robinson has the indictment, the pre-trial brief, the witness statements, volumes of Rule 68 materials.  What is to be achieved by having Mr. Robinson interview the witnesses or force this Court to compel their presence for an interview with him and the interests of justice?  How do the two work hand in hand?  This is not an issue of equality of arms.  This is actually a very -- this Chamber -- or the posture that we've adopted to allow these interviews in the first place is causing more problems than its worth.  

Now, perhaps I've strayed a bit from this application because the Chamber has not invited me to speak on the issue globally, but with respect to this particular witness, I did nothing improper.  If the Court wants to have an independent account of what transpired, it can make enquiries of the witness and of the two WVSS support personnel who were present for the entire meeting.  And, in any case, the idea, the suggestion that there should be a subpoena or a preclusion of the witness's testimony is clearly far beyond what is required to address this situation.  

The witness can testify, he can be cross-examined, and the Court can put questions to the witnesses if there seems to be an issue of uncertainty as to the factual -- to the account of what actually transpired early this afternoon.  I would urge the Court to deny the motion and for us to continue with the proceedings at hand.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, not to belabour the point, but I would ask you to hold an evidentiary hearing and hear the account so you can make factual findings to what actually occurred, since there is a dispute between myself and Mr. Webster, and there are independent witnesses.  But I think you could see from Mr. Webster's attitude about the decision to allow Defence witnesses, how he views these meetings and how he approaches it.  And he himself has acknowledged that he intervened when his presence at the meeting was purely to be there to see -- to observe and to be an observer, not a participant.  
So, I'm asking that you take whatever steps are necessary to come to a determination on the facts and that you give us the remedy that we're entitled to, to rectify that.  Thank you.

1430H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the first place, we find the idea of holding an evidentiary hearing completely inappropriate to determine which of two lawyers who are appearing before us is telling the truth on a collateral matter; anything that would embarrass the Court to have to address that issue.  Now we also think that that issue is not necessary for the conduct of our trial.  The order that we made was that the Defence would have an opportunity to speak with the witnesses if the witness agreed.  

Now what we have understood was that the witness did agree on conditions that the meeting did take place and during the meeting a problem developed.  We don't think that we ought to intervene in this.  We certainly do not think it appropriate to make an order to compel a Prosecution witness to speak with Defence counsel, and I thought we had indicated that already.  And so we don't have any -- that remedy which is suggested, in any event, would be completely outside what we consider as a proper order for the Court to make regardless to what the factual background was with regard to that meeting.  
And we think the issue of excluding the testimony is also completely without merit in relation to the factual basis which is apparently being laid.  We, in those circumstances, we deny the motion. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, also I would just like to introduce two exhibits that we -- documents that were referred to during the morning that I had printed out, there were two portions of transcripts which contained inconsistencies with the witness's testimony, and I would like to now offer them as exhibits.  The first being the prior testimony given in this trial on the 5th of April 2004, at page 33, concerning Mr. Ngirumpatse's signature and his being the president of the MRND, and I would offer that as Exhibit D. NZ146.  I have given Mr. Webster a copy and I have copies for the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that exhibit would be admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ146 admitted)  
MR. ROBINSON: 
The second is the testimony in the case of Prosecutor versus Bizimungu and this is dated the 
12th October 2004.  It is on page 8, in which there was testimony that there were about 50 people being trained in 1992 by the Interahamwe, and I would ask that that be admitted as D. NZ147. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ147 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am ready to resume my cross-examination now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you bring the witness back?  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the testimony will continue now, and Mr. Robinson will continue his cross-examination. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, with respect to the meetings that were held on weekends at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's residence, did you ever attend any of the meetings inside the residence? 
A.	Yes.  I did enter the house but on just one occasion. 
Q.	Now, isn't it a fact that when you were interviewed about this issue by the Office of the Prosecutor on the 26th of August 2003, you told them that "Sometimes I would be present in the meeting inside the house, but normally, I was outside the house in the compound."  
A.	I do not know where they got that information.  All I know is that at these meetings I would stand within the yard but outside the house.  I know I entered the house just once.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, with the assistance of the registrar, I would like to have the witness shown his statement from the 26th of August 2003, which I have here and which I believe everyone has electronically, it is part of the witness statement. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, I put in front of you the French version of your statement from the 26th of August 2003, and I would like to direct your attention to the ninth paragraph, which appears on the bottom of page 1 in the English, but I am not sure where it appears in the French, but it begins with the words, "I always attended these meetings."  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I have found it. 
Q.	And it is true, is it not, that it also says that "Sometimes I would be present in the meeting inside the house, but normally, I was outside the house in the compound."  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I see the passage in the document drafted in French, but I must tell you that when I was interviewed, I was answering in Kinyarwanda and not in English or French.  What I know is that I told the interpreter that I participated in the meetings, that on one occasion I had entered the house but that -- with regard to other meetings, I was definitely within the compound but outside the house.  And I know there are many mistakes that were made during those interviews.  Sometimes my statement would be read out to me and just one paragraph would be read to me, then I would be given general explanations.  They wanted to go into details so that I would sign the document -- rather, they would not want to go into details so that I would sign the document without being fully aware of its contents.  At times I would tell the Prosecutor mistakes had been made, but even today, if I were to be shown all the documents, I would be able to show you the passages that contain mistakes.  Besides, I think that is the reason you called me as a witness.  You wanted me to testify here before the Court because you are well aware that there are mistakes in the statements.  I am therefore here before the Court to tell you the truth.  I know I have given a lot of statements, but whenever I came to testify here, I never said that I had entered the house more than once.  It is only once that I entered the house.  For all the other meetings, I would stand outside the house and once the meeting was over they would come to brief us on items debated. 
Q.	Now this particular interview of the 26th of August 2003, it is indicated that it took place at the ICTR office at the Amahoro hotel.  Do you remember being present and being interviewed on this occasion? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	And on this occasion when you were interviewed and you gave information, were the investigators taking notes? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then on the bottom of the page where it indicates the signature, you signed the interview report after it was typed out, did you not? 
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	And before signing that report, did someone read the contents of it to you so that when you signed you would be certifying that the contents were what you had said; they were accurate? 
A.	I believe I explained it, but let me repeat.  The person who was interpreting for me did not explain everything to me, did not want to go into the details.  He would read a paragraph and tell me the content of that paragraph and I would say that he was summarising.  I can give you another example that I have just discovered so as to show you that sometimes there are mistakes.  On the first page it says, "President of a group of survivors for reconciliation in Ruhengeri préfecture."  I must point out to you that I never was in charge of a group of survivors and this I have never stated.  There is no way I could be mistaken about it.  I said I was*********************************************************************, but here it is written that it was an association of survivors.  I think that survivors are not prisoners who have been released.  So you will clearly see that there are mistakes at times in the statements. 
Q.	When the statement was presented to you for your signature, were the two investigators, Julie Watson and Ngiyebingi (phonetic) also present, in addition to the interpreter, Richard Kayonga? 
A.	I was questioned by those people.  They had a computer and were taking notes.  Thereafter, they printed out the document and Kayonga brought it and told me the content of the document but without going into the details.  He gave me a summary, after which I appended my signature. 
Q.	And is it your testimony that the interpreter failed in his duty to read to you the exact content of your statement? 
A.	I do not know and I am not to be held responsible for what was supposed to be done by the interpreter.  What I can confirm is that I told him that I entered the house on just one occasion, on the occasion of a single -- of just one meeting and then this had been reported to him during my previous testimonies.  The Prosecutor knows that I made a request that those mistakes be rectified. 
Q.	Witness BTH, the certification by the interpreter on the statements is that they certify that they have orally translated the statement into Kinyarwanda language in the presence of the witness, and the witness has assured the interpreter that they heard and understood the translation of the statement, and then the interpreter further certifies that the witness has acknowledged that the facts and matters set out in the statement as translated by me reflect the most faithfully possible what he has seen and what he has heard concerning the matter at hand and has accordingly appended his signature where indicated.  And so are you telling us that the interpreter has falsely certified to having faithfully interpreted your answers? 
A.	I was not there when the document was drafted.  I know that the form exists, and if the interpreter said he had explained everything to me, word-for-word, then he is lying.  Why do you want to believe or rely on what the interpreter said and therefore refuting what I am telling you?  I am telling the Court of all that happened.  If you want, you can invite that interpreter, let him come here and explain whether he actually did go into the details with me.  In that way you can challenge me with him. 
Q.	Yes, I can assure you that we will do that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Now, Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer the witness statement of the 26th of August 2003 with the French version being Exhibit D. NZ148A and the English version being D. NZ148, and under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ148A and D. NZ148B admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, you have told us that among the instructions given to the Interahamwe was that the enemy included not only Tutsi but Hutus who were married to Tutsi; Hutu men who were married to Tutsi women; is that correct? 
A.	I think I explained this.  You are right.  Sometimes such people were perceived as accomplices of Inkotanyi.  So that people who had relations -- friendly relations with Tutsi, some of these people were suspect because they would say that the Tutsis were using these people and making them -- thereby making them accomplices.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, just if I can intervene with the Registrar.  There is some confusion because this document was admitted as an exhibit in our first trial, so it still bears the numbering, but, nevertheless, it is to be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ148A and B in this trial. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness, because those who had married Tutsi women were considered part of the enemy, can you explain how it was that you were allowed to participate in ********************the Interahamwe organisation, given the fact that your mother was Tutsi? 
A.	Perhaps I was cleverer than them.  Yes, it is true; there is no need to laugh.  But there were also Tutsis, for instance, Kajuga who used this.  Moreover, I see that Mr. Nzirorera is busy laughing, but he is well aware that these people he did not trust.  He knows fully well that he did not trust my parents.  I would like to prove to you that my parents were sought after.  There are many documents that you have provided to the documents which contain the names of persons I mentioned in my trial.  I had given the names of these people.  I had called them as witnesses so that they could come and demonstrate that my family was on the run, practically.  I am not the only one aware of this; even my neighbours are fully aware of this.  I know that these documents are here in the possession of the Chamber and, therefore, the Chamber can go through them so as to ascertain that these people were being sought.  Unfortunately, it seems to have escaped their attention.  Therefore, I invite you to go through these documents so as to establish that my parents were sought after.  And, therefore, I am not the only one saying this.  If you are not convinced, I can give you another example to show that my family were on the run.  I was a man of action and, therefore, I got people -- these people to trust me.  They never thought I was an accomplice of the Inkotanyi.  In fact, I was very compliant to their orders.  If you want, I would also like to point out that there were also Tutsis serving in Habyarimana's army, but that did not stop the killers from killing the families of those soldiers. 
Q.	Did Mr. Nzirorera know that your mother was a Tutsi? 
A.	I see him sitting next to you.  You can ask him that question.  You can ask him, "Yes or no, did you know that my mother was Tutsi?"  
Q.	Witness, given***************************************************************************************, is there any doubt in your mind that Mr. Nzirorera knew your family well and knew that your mother was Tutsi? 
A.	I think he was aware of the fact.  But why don't you ask him the question?  I see him sitting next to you, why not ask him; he knows?  
Q.	Well, Witness BTH, this isn't the time in the trial when I ask my client questions; that comes at a later stage.  So I am putting the questions to you.  And it is pretty obvious, is it not, that Mr. Nzirorera knew the whereabouts of your mother from 1990 through 1994, given***************************************** *******************************, correct? 
A.	Yes, perhaps he was aware of the fact.  He knew it, but I would like to point one thing out to you.  I think you should actually have asked me if my family was sought after and how my mother came to escape death.  The way I see it, you are trying to prove that my family were not being sought, they were not being hunted after and yet there are names including*************.  I know you did hand these documents to the Chamber, and the reason you did this is that you were convinced that these documents were truthful.  So please go through them and you will see that there are witnesses that I called and who can show that my family was being sought.  You are convinced that my family was sought and that is why you handed over the documents to the Chamber.  My family was being hunted down.  Fortunately, not everybody who was sought during that period was killed. 
Q.	Witness, with respect to those documents, I tried to offer them into evidence, but they weren't received.  

Now, if Mr. Nzirorera was ordering Tutsis to be killed from the end of 1991 through April 1994 and that was -- that's your testimony and that was his intention, how difficult would it have been to ************ ***********************from an area where he was very familiar and have your mother killed?  Would it have been simple if that was, in fact, what he was interested in doing, wouldn't it? 
A.	That is a good question.  In fact, when he killed people, he would select.  But let me ask you another question.  Why -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I didn't understand the question. 
THE WITNESS:
It simply means my mother's turn had not yet come.  But in 1990, 1991, '92 and '93 only men were killed in our area and in neighbouring areas.  Women were not killed, unless you can give me the name of any woman killed prior to 1994.  I do know that prior to that period, only men were killed.  But when the time came for women to be killed, well, then they were killed. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, you have told us that the Interahamwe in early 1992 launched an attack against other parties; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And the duties to do that and the transportation to do that were given to you by Mr. Nzirorera; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would like the witness to be shown a copy of the statement he made to the Prosecutor on the 18th of October 2002.  And I have the French version for the witness and we all have our copies electronically. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, I want to direct your attention to the last page of the statement and the second paragraph from the bottom, and I am going to read to you from that paragraph.  "When the genocide began, I saw Setako only once.  However, I did see him at various meetings during 1994 just before the genocide.  He held meetings with Nzirorera at Nzirorera's house, usually at weekends, Saturdays and Sundays.  I and my chairman would be given instructions after these meetings.  My group would often be told to destroy the flags of other political parties, not the MRND and CDR parties.  I would be given money and transport by Setako to complete these tasks.  These duties were given to us by Setako." 

Did you make that statement to the Office of the Prosecutor on the 18th of October 2002? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	It was on that occasion -- it was on that occasion that the Office of the Prosecutor's investigators came to speak with you specifically about Colonel Ephrem Setako; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And so when they came to talk to you about Nzirorera, you incriminated Nzirorera; when they came to talk to you about Setako, you incriminated Setako; and when they came to talk to you about Kajelijeli, you incriminated Kajelijeli, correct? 
A.	Yes.  What is the problem?  It is true.  I could not have incriminated someone I had not been asked about.  The fact is that I still or always had something to say about all these people.  Nzirorera is sitting next to you, let him deny that he did not -- that he gave us a vehicle which belonged to his brother-in-law named Mbonamihaba.  When I was asked questions on that day about a person -- well, I was talking about that person, maybe it would be best to ask me if we were provided transport on just one occasion or on more than one occasion.  Moreover, in this document you only see the answers.  The questions do not appear.  Do you see any questions?  How do you know what questions were put to me?  On that day I talked about Setako because I had just been asked questions about Setako.  

When I was asked questions about Nzirorera, I answered accordingly, and I told them where we had met.  Besides, I knew that at some point I would have a chance to come to testify before the Tribunal. 
Q.	So you were willing to accuse everyone that the ICTR came to talk to you about in September and October 2002 so that you could be released from prison, which you were just a few months after this interview?  
A.	No.  No, I never answered their questions in order to secure my release.  I was not released because I had accused Setako, Nzirorera or anybody else.  I talked about people I knew something about.  I knew some things about them.  I was released because I had gone through the normal procedure.  I was not released because I accused Kajelijeli, Setako and Nzirorera. 
Q.	Witness, one more thing about this witness statement.  You have told us that you were ************the Interahamwe that was created in 1992 and that you became ***********in late 1991 when the MRND youth wing was formed in Mukingo; is that correct? 
A.	I explained that the MRND youth wing was created in 1991 and that is when we held our first meeting.  As for the word "Interahamwe", we took up that name in 1992. 
Q.	And your position as **********that group predated the creation of the Amahindure after the attack on February 1993; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Amahindura -- Amahindure was created after the attack on Ruhengeri in 1993. 
Q.	And your position as **********the Interahamwe began in 1992 at the latest, correct? 
A.	That is possible.  I did not recall the exact date.  Maybe it was after a month or four.  It is at that time that I changed my position. 
Q.	But you were an officer of the Interahamwe, according to you, as early as the end of 1991, correct? 
A.	'91, no.  I said that I belonged to MRND youth wing as of the end of 1991.  Since then and up to 
	July 1994, at the time of our flight, I was still a member of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And if you could look at the witness statement that is in front of you, on the second page, 
	item number 13, isn't it true that you told the investigators for the ICTR Office of the Prosecutor that you ******************with the Interahamwe at Mukingo commune from 1993 to 1994? 
A.	What page are you referring to, Counsel, so that I may check for myself?  I can see the page numbers at the bottom of the page.  Could you please tell me the page you are referring to so that I may check this out for myself?  
Q.	Page 2, and there is number 13.  Do you have a page 2 in French that indicates such things as parents, marital status, language, past residence outside of Rwanda and then member of social or political association? 
A.	There is a mistake.  They made a mistake.  I never provided this information to them.  If you look into other documents, you would find different information from this one.  By the way, I have talked about this several times over in court and I know exactly at what point I became a member of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Well, in any event, the statement that you signed on the 18th of October 2002, indicates that you were ***************the Interahamwe at the Mukingo commune level from 1993 to 1994; is that correct? 
A.	On the 16th September 2002, I made another statement and I drafted that document in my own hand.  If you look at it, you would see in it the exact date.  So there was a mistake in this document. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer the witness statement of the 18th of October 2002 as Exhibit D. NZ149, A for the French and B for the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ149A and D. NZ149B admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	While we are on that topic, Witness BTH, of when you became ***************the Interahamwe, I am going to ask that you be shown your first statement that you made to the ICTR on the 
	24th of September 2002, and I will give you the French copy and I will retain the English.  

And directing your attention to page 2 of this statement, the first meeting you had with the ICTR on the 24th of September 2002, looking at item number 13, it is true, is it not, that it also indicates that you said that you became *************the Interahamwe from 1993 to 1994, correct? 
A.	Now I can see why there is a mistake.  They simply copied information from the first page.  What they did was take into consideration the period during which I received training as an Interahamwe, which was in 1993, and that is true, but the effective date on which I joined the Interahamwe is in 1992. 
Q.	Witness, looking at the first page of this -- the third page of the statement, the first paragraph, you indicate that this is the first time I was interviewed by the ICTR.  And then on the next paragraph you go on to say this:  "I was trained as an Interahamwe in 1993 in the vicinity of the office of the Mukingo commune.  I was appointed the" -- and I will leave the office blank, "*************** the Interahamwe in the commune by Kajelijeli, Juvénal, because of my academic background."  Correct?  So it was you that provided information and not a mistake by investigators. 
A.	Yes, I agree with you, but you are not looking at the question to which this answer is provided.  Let me give you the question.  The question was to find out when I had received training as an Interahamwe.  And then I was asked later on what position I occupied within the Interahamwe group, and then they asked me who had appointed me to that position, and I also answered.  I do clearly remember the question that was put to me at the time; namely, "When did you receive military training as an Interahamwe?"  And it is in answer to that question that I provided the information.  

Furthermore, and generally speaking, it would seem to me that they took information on the first page, and by the time they were dealing with the identification, they did not look back to the first page, which is the identification sheet to -- which was in their possession.  So what I am telling you is that a number of questions were put to me and I answered them according to the flow of the answers, as you can see in the document.  You can see for yourself that this document only bears the answers and not the questions that were put to me. 
Q.	But, Witness, that explanation doesn't make any sense because you told us this morning that you received military training as Interahamwe in 1992 at the Isimbi building.  So if someone asked you when you received training and you were trying to tell them the truth, if that was the truth, you would have told them '92, correct? 
A.	I am telling the truth, but you are being oblivious to one thing.  You don't seem to be satisfied because you are looking for a specific answer from me.  You asked me when I started receiving training as an Interahamwe and I told you that it was in 1992.  Well, it was not very serious training as such.  Our official training -- military training started in 1993, and I remember telling you that I received training on two occasions.  This morning you asked me when it was that I underwent training for the first time as an Interahamwe. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I apologise for interrupting, but I have an objection and it is the same type of objection that I have raised previously with other cross-examinations, other aspects of Mr. Robinson's cross-examination on documents.  None of this hurts the Prosecution.  So I am not objecting to this information coming on the record.  But I wonder how fruitful it is to cross-examine the witness on whether he was truthful and complete in 2002 when the statement was drafted, when the question for this Chamber is whether the witness is truthful and complete in his direct examination.  None of this is contradictory to what this witness testified to in court.  

Mr. Robinson focuses on these documents and suggests to the witness that somehow he cannot be relied upon because what was recorded four years ago was not complete, but that is not the test of whether this witness should be believed or not by this Trial Chamber.  We are focusing on the wrong thing.  And perhaps this is a subtle point, but I feel like we waste so much time going over material that really is not germane to this Court's analysis of the content of what this witness is saying now at this point in his cross-examination.  

So while the question itself is not impermissible, we have been on this issue for at least 20 minutes now, and how useful is it, really?  So I object to the form of the question, and I would appreciate it if the Court could push Mr. Robinson along so that we deal with issues that are really -- that will really test the witness's credibility in relation to what he testified to during his direct examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, when a witness actually lives through events, they remember them and then recall them consistently over time, especially the significant events such as being trained militarily, such as assuming the office of a group, and the fact that this witness changes his story over time is relevant to whether he is creating these events as part of false testimony or whether he is a truthful witness.  And so that is the purpose of pointing out that on earlier occasions the witness had said something differently than what he has testified to in this Trial Chamber.  

So may I continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the -- of course, you can continue.  But the problem that has been -- that has been throughout a lot of this exercise is that you have not -- you seem to be suggesting that many of these issues are false in relation to what he said in this Court. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I am suggesting that but they are false in -- I am not pointing out exactly my position, which one is true, was he an officer in '92 or '93.  I can do that if it helps you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
It is your examination, but the bottom line -- we are going to have to decide if what he said in this court is true. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is correct. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, to conclude on the statement of the 24th of September 2002, it is true, is it not, that you signed every page of the statement, including the page that listed your function as an officer of the Interahamwe during 1993 and 1994, that being page 2? 
A.	You are putting that question to me because you know that I was the one who was being interviewed and who was present.  I have told you why I provided the answers I provided.  I provided those answers based on the questions that were put to me.  I was asked at what time I received official training as an Interahamwe, and I said 1993.  Furthermore, apart from that first statement, you may also want to question the investigators, some of whom may be present here.  You may also question them to find out from them whether in their subsequent questions they revisited the issue of my identification.  They took it once and for all.  So if those investigators made a mistake the first time around, it is only normal that that mistake stood over time in their documents. 
Q.	Witness, you are distributing responsibility to everyone but yourself, investigators, Mr. Nzirorera, Colonel Setako.  But the point is that on page 2 you signed your name right underneath, where it says "MRND officer Interahamwe 1993, 1994", correct? 
A.	What I can say is that I accused Kajelijeli, Nzirorera, Setako and others, but the accusations against the investigators are not as serious as those I am levelling against these personalities.  So I believe that the mistake is not a very serious mistake as far as I am concerned.  My testimony, therefore, is that I became a member of the Interahamwe in 1992.  Now, whatever you want to make of that is your choice.  
	
	Now, all the actions undertaken by the Interahamwe were at the orders of Nzirorera.  Now, let us take it that I became an Interahamwe member in 1993; that does not in any way absolve Nzirorera of his responsibility.  I told you, for example, that I received the Interahamwe uniform in 1992.  I could not have been given that uniform if I was not yet a member of the Interahamwe.  Please go on and investigate.  Other Interahamwe members would tell you that they received their uniforms in 1992.  So there was a mistake.  I am pointing it out to you, instead of writing '91, they wrote '93.  

Now if you insist that there is a contradiction, well, that would be to the benefit of your client, but my position is that I became an Interahamwe member in 1992 and that all the acts we were involved in were pursuant to the orders of Nzirorera.  Well, maybe, with your leave, I should ask one small question.  Ordinarily, when a witness comes to testify before the Tribunal, he is given his information sheet, that identification sheet, because the Tribunal is conscious of the fact that there might have been a mistake on that identification sheet.  That is why it is presented to you so that you may cross-check and determine whether there is some mistake in it or not. 

My assertion, therefore, is that there was a mistake and the mistake did not arise from me. 
Q.	Did you sign page 2? 
A.	I know that one signs the last page of one's interview. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the registry could show the witness the English copy in case there is something different that appears on the French copy, but on page 2, it clearly shows his signature.  So just to be absolutely sure, that can be shown to the witness.  In the meantime, I will move the admission of the statement of the 24th of September 2002 as Exhibit D. NZ150, A for the French and B for the Kinyarwandan.
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps it would clarify matters if I explain that the original statement was taken -- was recorded in English, that's the one that would bear the witness's signature, and that the French came, I am sure, weeks, if not months, afterwards because it was a translation of the original English text. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So just to finish up, Witness BTH, did you sign page 2? 
A.	Yes, I saw it.  I signed it, but I had not read the document.  And I wanted to make it clear, this identification sheet was not read out to me.  I had already told you that the investigators would not always read me my identification sheet. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take the break now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But, Mr. Robinson, I think we have exhausted this issue now.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I agree. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document is admitted.  And we take the afternoon recess. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ150A and D. NZ150B admitted) 
(Court recessed from 1532H to 1558H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, how are you holding up today? 
A.	I think you will finish today, but if you intend to finish tomorrow or the day after, it is at the end of that day that I will tell you what I think.  As for today, I will manage, assuming we end today.  But the fact that you are asking me questions to which you already have the answers, I find that very amusing.  I will express myself when you finish. 
Q.	In 1992, when you say that you attacked the president of the MDR in Nyakinama commune, was that individual killed as a result of that attack? 
A.	First of all, I never told you it was the president of the MDR in Nyakinama commune.  I told you the attack was led at the place where the MDR flag was located.  I never said it was the MDR president.  When we got there we found women and young girls.  We got into the house, we took the registers that were there.  We removed the MDR flag, took it away and left. 
Q.	Another witness, Witness GBU, has testified that during this event the Interahamwe killed the president of the MDR in Nyakinama commune; is that true? 
A.	That is for Witness GBU to say.  I think you should ask him that question.  Ask him the circumstances of that person's killing.  Therefore, he should answer for this.  I have only recounted the events I witnessed.  I cannot comment on another person's statements.  If by chance he participated in an incident that resulted in loss of life of those people, then I think you should bear in mind that I am only here to testify about what I witnessed.  I cannot commit or comment on statements made by other persons. 
Q.	To your knowledge, was the president of the MDR in Nyakinama commune killed by the Interahamwe of Mukingo? 
A.	I have already told you I know nothing about that.  I cannot comment on an incident I was not an eyewitness of.  I have reported only events I witnessed.  Now, when you ask me about that person's death, I think it should actually be Witness GBU to answer about it. 
Q.	And the bourgmestre of Mukingo who replaced Kajelijeli in 1993 was a member of the MDR party, correct? 
A.	Yes, I know that he was a member of the MDR party. 
Q.	Now, with respect to the PSD party, you testified that an attack was launched against an individual named Tuyizere; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And that is T-U-Y-I-Z-E-R-E.  And, in fact, that individual was employed by Mr. Nzirorera at the school, ESTB, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And it is your testimony that Mr. Nzirorera directed the Interahamwe to go and attack that individual and bring him -- bring that man to him, and then when he was brought to him, Mr. Nzirorera gave him a job; is that correct? 
A.	But there is something you have left out, Counsel.  Tuyizere joined the PSD and began to recruit other people to that party.  Nzirorera was informed about this and he instructed that Tuyizere be brought to him.  When he was handed over to him, Nzirorera asked him why he had decided to join the PSD party.  He said the reason he had been driven to join that party was his poverty.  He asked him if he was prepared to leave the party.  And in answer to that question, he answered "yes", then Nzirorera gave him a job. 
Q.	Now, turning your attention to November of 1992 and the meeting in Ruhengeri where 
	President Habyarimana spoke, would you agree that the speech of President Habyarimana was not a call to violence against Tutsis? 
A.	He did not say the word "Tutsi" as such, but he said that the Interahamwe were going to adorn their uniform and descend, and that speech was interpreted in various ways by various individuals. 
Q.	Did you interpret that as a call to violence against Tutsis? 
A.	I -- some interpretation came to mind, given that we were -- that he said that the Interahamwe were going to put on their uniforms and descend.  I remember that he had just raised issue of security.  The RPF had attacked Rwanda and there were opposition parties who were against the MRND.  There was the JDR youth wing and the Abakombozi who opposed the MDR youth.  I merely understood this.  There were problems with the MRND.  The RPF had attacked the country.  Therefore, I understood that the Interahamwe were there to help them solve all those problems. 
Q.	Are you aware of any other MRND meetings in Ruhengeri stadium between the date of 
	President Habyarimana's speech in November 1992 and the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	No.  The only political rally I attended is the one held in November 1992 when the president, 
	President Habyarimana spoke. 
Q.	Were you a student in 1992? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was one of your close relatives****************************************************? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Are you aware of any occasion when school children were gathered from primary schools in Busogo and taken to Gisesero to attend a rally or speeches by authorities?
A.	But I think that at that time the school children from the primary school were at school.  I was also at school.  I know that at one point the primary school children and secondary school children -- students demonstrated against Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  So I must clarify that the pupils must have been at school at that time, and I therefore have difficulty understanding how they could have taken part in that political rally.  I do, however, recall a demonstration against Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  I know that Agathe Uwilingiyimana was not buried.  I think an effigy of the prime minister was buried during that demonstration.
Q.	I am speaking of an occasion in Gisesero when students were marched from the primary schools to Gisesero to attend speeches by Mr. Nzirorera and others.  Did that ever occur as far as you know? 
A.	No, I do not recall that. 
Q.	I want to ask you some questions about the meeting that was held in 1993 regarding the formation of the Amahindure.  You told us that the meeting was held following the attack of 8th February 1993 by the RPF, correct? 
A.	You are right. 
(Pages 37 to 50 by Sithembiso Moyo)









1615H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you tell us approximately how much time had elapsed between the time the meeting had been held and --
A.	I no longer remember.  Moreover, all the information I am given in relation to dates today is but an estimate.  I know that it happened some days afterwards.  
Q.	In your statement of 18th of October 2002, on page 3, it is indicated that the volcanic lava squad was formed at a meeting in late 1993, I think between June and October of that year.  Now, when you made that statement in 2003 was that your recollection?  
A.	Once again I would like to make it clear that when I gave dates, these were just estimates.  This is something that happened about 13 years ago, a long time ago.  It is not something I had committed to memory.  We did not take down notes.  So, again, please remember I am just giving estimates.  I just know that the meeting took place after the February 1993 attack -- the second attack, that is. 
Q.	Who was the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune at the time of this meeting? 
A.	I believe it is Kajelijeli who was the bourgmestre at the time.  I do not know on what date Habyarimana took over from Kajelijeli.  All I know is that Kajelijeli was in attendance at the meeting.  And I believe he was the bourgmestre at the time.  And I do not know on what date Habyarimana took over from Kajelijeli. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that Kajelijeli was removed as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in February of 1993.  Now, it is a fact, isn't it, that Mr Kajelijeli was not the bourgmestre at the time this meeting took place? 
A.	All I know is that he was present at the meeting, and that he was bourgmestre.  At the time of that meeting he was still the bourgmestre. 
Q.	And you have also told us that at this meeting was the préfet of Ruhengeri; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that was Charles Nzabagerageza; correct? 
A.	I said that the préfet was present, and I was asked to give a name and I say Nzabagerageza.  But I do not know whether it was Bariyanga or Nzabagerageza, if I said Nzabagerageza, maybe I was mistaken, because I do not know the dates one took over from the other. 
Q.	Now, you've also told us that among the authorities present were Mr. Nzirorera, Kajelijeli, Alphonse Ntirivamunda, which is 67 on the spelling list, Colonel Setako, Colonel Augustin Bizimungu, Jean Baptiste Nyabusore, Colonel Bonaventure Ntibitura, which is 66 on the spelling list, the préfet of Ruhengeri, whoever it might have been, Michel Bakuzakundi, number 5 on the spelling list, Major Bizabarimana, number 12 on the spelling list, Dominic Gatsimbanyi, number 24 on the spelling list and the conseiller, Assiel Ndisetse, number 61 on the spelling list; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  Most of those whose names I mentioned were present at the meeting, and you have just mentioned the same names. 
Q.	You've also told us more than 1,00 people from Mukingo and Nkuli commune attended this meeting; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you told us that Mr. Nzirorera promised to support the youths with military equipment and said that he would also provide training and trainers, correct? 
A.	Yes.  He was one of those who agreed to provide equipment and to make available trainers.  
Q.	And you told us that Colonel Ntibitura spoke at this meeting, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you've told us that you did not recall if any other military authorities spoke at the meeting, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But when you were interviewed about Colonel Setako on the 18th of October 2002, you said that Setako said at this meeting that, "The youths will be used to kill Tutsis.  He announced this fact to all of us.  Setako included all Tutsi in this statement; Tutsi at the front and Tutsi at home as well.  He even included Hutu who were married to Tutsis.  And all the other dignitaries who were present  supported the views of Setako in their own speeches.  He went on to say that Setako said that he would support these youths with military equipment, including rifles, ammunition, grenades, and that he would also provide training and trainers."  And so, isn't it true, Witness BTH, that whenever the OTP came to you and asked you to accuse somebody, you accused them of the very same things that you're accusing Mr. Nzirorera of today? 
A.	They all participated in the same meeting, all those people, so if questions are put to me about Nzirorera, my answers will cover everything that I know about Nzirorera.  The same would apply for Setako; I would say everything that I know about him, if any questions are put about him to me.  If I am asked what Nzirorera said about the Amahindure force, I would say everything I knew about that.  And they were always together, so the answers I provided were in answer to the questions that were put to me.  I said everything that I knew about the individual about whom I was being questioned. 
Q.	And so you simply took the same information, and you just changed the name of the speaker.  When you were asked about Setako, you say Setako said, "We would support the youths with military equipment."  When you talk about Nzirorera, you say, "Nzirorera would support the youths with military equipment."  When you talk about Kajelijeli, you say the same thing.  You just change the name, isn't that right? 
A.	No, Counsel, if you were to look at the statements, you would notice that they are not identical, and if you have read through them you would see for yourself that they are not identical.  Kajelijeli and Nzirorera are two different people.  I said that it was Nzirorera who gave uniforms to the Interahamwe and I never said that it was Kajelijeli and Setako.  Therefore, I made a clear distinction about what I said about each of those persons.  

For example, I never said we went to collect guns from Kajelijeli's house.  That notwithstanding, all those people were always together and that is why some of the information is shared amongst and between them, whenever I say something about one of them or the other, because the information may overlap.  
Q.	Were you elected an officer of the Amahindure at any time? 
A.	No.  However,****************************************************************.  And as I have already explained, that Interahamwe leadership collaborated with the leadership of the Amahindure force. 
Q.	Were you ever the deputy head of the Amahindure? 
A.	No.  I was (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript  has been extracted and filed under separate cover)
Q.	I want to read to you from your statement of 18th October 2002 on page 4:  "The heads of the volcanic lava force****************************************************, and Niyigaba, Michel, was the chairman."  Did you say that? 
A.	Let me explain.  When the Interahamwe became Amahindure force, the leader was Niyigaba.  What I wanted to say was in reference to the Interahamwe members who were integrated into the Amahindure force.  What I am saying is that the leaders of the Interahamwe were also leaders of the Amahindure force. 
Q.	So, were you the deputy of the Amahindure force? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness had not finished answering, so there was an overlap. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Sorry. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Were you the deputy of the Amahindure force? 
A.	No.  I was the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) who became the Amahindure force.  Let me explain further.  The commander of the Amahindure Virunga force battalion was in position.  There was the Mukingo half and the Nkuli half of the Amahindure force.  The general coordinator had two deputies; namely, the Interahamwe leader in Mukingo, and the Interahamwe leader in Nkuli.  So, the Interahamwe leader in Mukingo was assisted by the Interahamwe leader and the deputy, and the same applied for the Interahamwe leader in Nkuli.  
MR.  WEBSTER:
Just one brief comment.  I'll be going through the transcripts at the end of the day and I'd like to remove two references where the witness indirectly disclosed his identity.  If the Court could make an order to that effect now, then when I submit it to the stenographers, there won't be a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I missed what you're referring to.  The order will be made when it is pointed out.  It is a question of identifying it. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I think the witness referred to his position within these organisations; the specific post that he held, and that should be redacted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) I am not that certain what is -- if you can give me assistance in the -- exactly what to order redacted. 
MR. ROBINSON:
His position in the organisation, the post that he held. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, the order is made. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness BTH, with respect to the military training, prior to the meeting to create the Amahindure, were night patrols in existence at the level of the cellule? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel Robinson please kindly repeat his question.  It was not properly understood by the Kinyarwanda booth.
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Prior to the formation of the Amahindure, were there night patrols in existence at the cellule level?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did that involve citizens with being provided with weapons so that they could patrol the area in the evenings? 
A.	No.  Weapons were distributed, I believe, in 1993.  I am not certain of the date, but those weapons were very different.  Members of the population received weapons with wooden handles, which were different from those which we had received. 
Q.	So it's true, is it not, that throughout the country night patrols were set up by the authorities, and that the people who participated in these night patrols were issued weapons with wooden handles, so that they could protect the inhabitants of the community from possible RPF attacks? 
A.	These were guns which could take five bullets only, and those guns could fire only one bullet at a time.  The Interahamwe received either R4s or Kalashnikovs or automatic rifles.  Now, as for the night patrols, everyone knows that there were night patrols at that time across the country.  So, let us not confuse the night patrols for the military training that was given to the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And the night patrols existed before the RPF attack on Ruhengeri in February 1993, correct? 
A.	Yes, the night patrols were in place, although not regularly.  Sometimes the officials would call for  back-to-back patrols, and then there would be times when there were no night patrols. 
Q.	And the purpose of those night patrols was to protect the population from RPF attacks, correct? 
A.	The purpose of the night patrols was to seek out infiltrators.  I am not sure that the (inaudible) night patrols were strong enough to check off or ward off RPF attacks. 
Q.	But the night patrols were not used to exterminate Tutsis, were they? 
A.	They were just night patrols looking out for those who did not have identification papers and to seek out the enemy.  As a matter of fact, I do not know much about those night patrols. 
Q.	And that was the beginning of civil defence in Rwanda, correct? 
A.	No, that is not what I think.  When the civilian self-defence started in Rwanda it was with the Amahindure and Impuzamugambi, and not with members of the population.  I, therefore, do not see the link between the night patrols and the civil self-defence -- at least as far as what happened in my area goes.  In my area, when the civil self-defence started it is the Impuzamugambi and the Amahindure force that were involved. 
Q.	Now, how long was the military training that you received? 
A.	About one month.  Some people spent two months, three months, or four months undergoing the military training. 
Q.	And why did you only spend one month? 
A.	I was busy elsewhere.  I was involved in other activities and, I, therefore, did not have the time for the military training whereas I was a student.  
Q.	And since you were a********, in 1993 at the*******, did that take up most of your time? 
A.	I noticed that I said something which made you smile.  I said that I was smart and you smiled.  But let me tell you that I did my level best to be seen at the training, but I also had to go back to school, after a while. 
Q.	One thing that we could probably agree on is that you're very intelligent.  Did you go to school?  What type of --
A.	Even if you think that I am not intelligent, that doesn't affect me.  I am a struggling man.  I know how to get around; I know how to distinguish good, from evil.  I know how to fend for myself, to get something to eat.  And I am satisfied with that. 
Q.	Actually, what I had said was I think we could both agree that you are very intelligent.  
A.	Yes.  And that is my answer, because you seem to be showing some compassion towards me, whereas I know that as a matter of fact I know there is no love lost between us.  That is my difficulty. 
Q.	Well, I can assure you that there's nothing personal whatsoever in my questions to you.  Can you tell me approximately what time of day you would go to school in the morning? 
A.	Classes started at 8:00 a.m. and would go to 12 noon.  Then there would be lunch break, and classes resume at 2:00 up to 4:30 p.m., from Monday to Friday.  And then we went to school on Saturday from 8:00 to 12:00, and the same applied for Wednesday, that is from 8:00 to 12:00.  I don't know if that satisfies you. 
Q.	And did you have a high performance at school? 
A.	Yes, very high.  I was very intelligent, very intelligent.  I was often the first in my class, and then I would be second also from time to time.  
Q.	And how much time did you have to spend on Interahamwe duties during 1993? 
A.	What month are you referring to, Counsel, during the genocide or before the genocide?  
Q.	I'm referring to, for example, the school year of 1993; from, well, let's just say from January of 1993 to December 1993, excluding your holidays; how much time did you have to spend on Interahamwe business during the school year? 
A.	I do not recall.  Many activities were going on, but 80 per cent of my time was spent in school.  But, whenever there were any activities to be undertaken by the Interahamwe I would participate.  But you must also remember that we had holiday periods as well. 
Q.	And when there were activities for the Interahamwe before April of 1994, would you cut classes and participate in those activities? 
A.	Yes, sometimes, depending on the importance or significance of the given activity.  Let me add, that I spent one term at home.  At some point an entire term was spent at home.  I just wanted to make that clear. 
Q.	Do you remember approximately when that was? 
A.	That was the last term of my third year, in 1992.  The third term ends in June.  It was probably in April, May or June, rather, those three months that I had spent away from school. 
Q.	Did you, personally, kill anyone before the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	No one. 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe or the Amahindure kill anyone before 7 April 1994? 
A.	I do not clearly remember.  I do not remember, clearly, but if the information does resurface, I will let you know. 
Q.	You said at one point that you were sent to kill an MDR member, named Makoni; is that correct? 
A.	I do not know what Makoni's political leanings were, and I do not know whether he belonged to the MDR. 
Q.	In any event, the Interahamwe or Amahindure never killed Makoni, correct? 
A.	No.  He was killed by a soldier called Shyiramuburyo, who was a captain. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
That is spelt S-H-Y-I-R-A-M-U-B-U-R-Y-O. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	And, in fact, he was killed after the 6th of April 1994, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And he was Hutu, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And he was killed by some -- as a result of some personal dispute between him and Captain Shyiramuburyo, who was a neighbour to him, correct? 
A.	No.  Shyiramuburyo went to his house and shot at him.  He was standing behind the counter.  He found him there and killed him. 
Q.	But it had nothing to do with the Inkotanyi.  It was a personal dispute between the two men, correct? 
A.	No.  I can tell you the reason: On the 7th of April, when the killings began, we came down from the Busogo parish, and they went by his house where a telephone line had been installed.  They cut Makoni's phone line.  And Makoni had for a long time been suspected of collaborating with the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	And is it your testimony that he was killed by Captain Shyiramuburyo because he was suspected of being an Inkotanyi accomplice? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Let's turn to the events of the 7th of April of 1994.  And you told us that you had arrived at the restaurant in Byangabo centre called Haguma's, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And can you tell us who it was you met inside that restaurant when you arrived? 
A.	There were many people there.  Theoneste Barebereho, the owner of the restaurant, one Chiongi (phonetic), and many other people whose names I no longer remember.  But there was a big crowd there.  Jean-Bosco Ndyambaje was there, that is Kadodoji (phonetic).  
Q.	Was Michel Niyigaba already there when you arrived? 
A.	No.  He found me there when he arrived. 
Q.	And when he arrived was anyone with him? 
A.	He came along with Ndusabi.
Q.	And did there come a time in which Michel and Dusabimana left -- so they arrived together; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  They left together and I followed them, by the way.
Q.	So just to get the sequence of events correct.  You arrived at Haguma's, number one; number two, Niyigaba and Dusabimana came together to Haguma's; and number three, the three of you left together to go back to the residence of Nzirorera's mother; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, please continue. 
Q.	Well, I'm just going to refer to your testimony in the case of General Bizimungu on the 31st of January 2006 at page 2, because at that time you testified that Dusabimana came to the tea shop and took Michel Niyigaba to Nzirorera's mother's house, and that shortly thereafter Nyiagaba returned and summoned you to Nzirorera's house.    Did you give that testimony on the 31st of January 2006? 
A.	Counsel, would you please, kindly, repeat your question?  I do not clearly understand your question. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes.  I'm suggesting to you that you gave a different version of these events when you testified at the trial of General Bizimungu on the 31st of January 2006, and I'm referring to page 2.  And I'm telling you that on that occasion you testified that Dusabimana came to the tea shop and -- excuse me, I notice that you are coughing.  There is some water there, if you would like to take a drink. 
A.	Yes, I have a cough and, yes, I'm drinking some water.  But I don't think that water takes away cough.  I think we can proceed.  If I have any serious problems, I will inform the Trial Chamber accordingly. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, I was telling you that at your testimony in the General Bizimungu's case you had said that Dusabimana came to the tea shop, and took Niyigaba to Nzirorera's mother's house, and that shortly thereafter, Niyigaba returned and took you to Nzirorera's mother's house, and I'm asking you if you recall that testimony. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  Could you give me the page reference, please?
MR. ROBINSON:
Page 2. 
THE PRESIDENT:
What are you waiting for?  
MR. ROBINSON:  
I was waiting for the witness to answer. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It may be fairer to the witness to simply give him the page in French and have him look at the passage, because I don't quite see the narrative the way Mr. Robinson has rephrased it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I don't actually have a hard copy here, but if you give me a minute, I can actually read the questions and answers to him.  
By MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, I am going to read the questions and answers.  It is page 2, beginning on line 11.  And the question is: "Now, Witness, I would like you to take your time and describe to this Court how that came about, how did these killings start?  What happened?" And the answer begins, "During that morning after we had our tea, we stood in front of the place where we had the tea, and then I saw three men, including Jean-Baptiste, who was the director of IASE.  I saw a certain -- " and it says in here "Gahiki", but I think he was referring to "Baheza", who was a businessman, and Juvenal Kajelijeli, who was a bourgmestre.  "I saw them going to the residence of Nzirorera's mother.  Immediately when they got there, Dusabe came as a messenger. He came to fetch Michel, they went down together towards" -- and it says "Niyigaba's" house, but I believe he meant "Nzirorera's" house.  "Subsequently, Michel told me that I, myself, was being sought after.  And then when I got to Nzirorera's mother's house, I saw the mother and the three men I were (sic) referring to."  

	So, Witness, having heard that testimony or the transcript of that testimony, I'm asking you whether, in fact, when you were testifying in General Bizimungu's case you gave a different sequence of events than the one you have given us here today. 
A.	It depends on the manner in which the question is put to me.  The flow of your questions is not the same as the questions put to me in the Bizimungu case, so my answer depends on the flow of your questions.  You asked me who was with Niyigaba.  I said he was with Dusabi and who was with him when he left.  And I said he left with Dusabi, and I told you that I then followed them.  So, I don't see any difference or contradictions in the narrations.  You did not ask me whether I went with them or whether I followed them.  Furthermore, I have not memorised my testimony as one would memorise a song.  

If you put a question to me and you put the same question to me after a while, I am not sure that I would repeat exactly the same words in answer to your question.  Maybe at that time I started answering the question from the last phase to the first, and today I might have started answering from the first phase moving towards the last.  In Kinyarwanda, you can express yourself in a thousand and one ways.  So, if I say that they left, and then I followed them, later on it might be more appropriate to ask me how I followed them.  
Q.	Witness BTH, you are testifying in great detail to events that occurred 12 years ago or even longer.  And I suggest to you that you don't really remember exactly the sequence of all of these events, but you come here and testify to them with great certainty, but, in fact, as a human, you don't really remember exactly what you did from one moment to next; isn't that true? 
A.	I believe that I have already explained this to the Court.  You are asking me to remember things that happened 13 years ago.  I never wrote down these events on a piece of paper anywhere.  Nobody wrote these things down.  I am a human being.  Yes, I agree with you, I am human.  And it is possible that the sequence of events may be reversed in my answers, but what matters is that the events did occur.  

	Now, ever since I came here you have put questions to me on facts that you have drawn from documents, but I don't have any documents with me.  And I am sure that if questions were put to you about the things that we talked about this morning it would be impossible for you to reproduce what we discussed this morning.  So, I am not a tape-recorder and I am not a computer.  What matters is that I answer your questions, and whether I do it in ten words or in two words, what really matters is that I should tell the truth.  I thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BTH.  And I think that we agree on that, but when you come here and testify with certainty as to one thing happening after another, I think the reality is that you are doing your best, but you're filling in some blanks as to what you think happened, but sometimes you can be mistaken.  For example --
A.	No, wait a moment, I apologise.  I might be mistaken and then correct myself, but there are certain facts that I cannot forget.  I cannot forget Nzirorera, for example.  For instance, I could never forget you.  There are major facts or events that one cannot forget -- one can never forget.  There are people who cannot give you their date of birth, but know the year.  There are others who may recall dates and years.  But I tell you that even though 13 years has passed, there are events I can never forget.  I would like to remind you that I do not have notes before me, as you do. 
Q.	Witness, when you were outside of the tea shop on the 7th of April, you testified that you saw some people arrive at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's residence; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I saw those people heading towards Nzirorera's mother's house. 
Q.	Did you see Kajelijeli arrive? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you see Baheza arrive? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you see Nyabusore arrive? 
A.	I also saw him. 
Q.	See, now, Witness, I'm going to give you an example  --  I think you have just given us an example of testifying to something that you don't really remember.  Because when you were asked that question in 2004, in this very trial, you said, "I did not see Nyabusore come, but I saw his Peugeot parked in front of Nzirorera's mother's house."  Do you recall giving that testimony? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry, can you please provide me with the page and date references any time you are going to elicit a contradictory statement. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. That is on the 8th of April 2004, at page 13, line 7.  
THE WITNESS:
I do not see the difference between what I said at the time, and what I have said today, because on both occasions I told you I saw Nyabusore.  Maybe you want to know exactly where I saw him.  And I can answer you on that too.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, I asked you if you saw Nyabusore arrive and you said "yes", and in April of 2004 I asked you the following question; this is line 33, page 13.  "Did you also see Jean Baptiste Nyabusore arrive?"  And you said, "When Nyabusore arrived I did not see him come but I saw his Peugeot 205.  I did not see him arrive.  So I don't know exactly when he came."  Now, to me, Witness BTH, you have given two answers that are exactly the opposite.  And I don't think you're lying whether you saw him arrive or whether you didn't see him arrive, because I don't think he was ever there.  And to me, this is an example of you testifying to events that you never observed, and that's why you can't keep your story straight.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	Let me ask you a question.  Did you investigate to ascertain whether I was not there on that day?  I told you that I saw Nyabusore arrive.  And earlier on I was telling you that if you want to know when Nyabusore arrived, that I'm ready to answer.  I said that I, personally, found Nyabusore, Baheza, and Kajelijeli at the house of Nzirorera's mother.  So I do not want to exclude him from the group of people who arrived at Nzirorera's mother's house, whereas I actually saw him.  
Q.	Well, Witness BTH, Mr. Nyabusore, says he was in Kigali on the morning of the 7th of April, and that, therefore, it would have been impossible for you to have seen him at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house.  
A.	I have already answered you.  Nyabusore could not dare to incriminate himself by saying that he was not at Nzirorera's mother's house.  He is protecting himself as well as his friend, Nzirorera.  And to prove this let him -- to prove this, Nyabusore would not go to Rwanda and return safely.  He would not agree to go there.

1715H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, did you see Mr. Nzirorera on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you see General Augustin Bizimungu on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you see Casimir Bizimungu on the 7th of April? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Would it be accurate to say that, as far as you know, to say that Joseph Nzirorera participated in decisions taken at a meeting at his mother's Busogo secteur residence on the evening of 6 April 1994, and on the morning of 7 April 1994, or both, other participants at one or the other of these meetings were Casimir Bizimungu, Augustin Bizimungu, and Juvénal Kajelijeli, and that during the meeting that took place on or about the early morning of 7 April 1994, Joseph Nzirorera agreed with the other participants and ordered the Interahamwe militias and locally recruited armed civilians to attack and kill the Tutsi population in Mukingo and Nkuli commune.  Is that accurate?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I am objecting to the question, Your Honour.  We're revisiting an issue that I've raised with the Court several times before.  This is a paragraph taken directly out of the indictment -- out of the indictment.  And it's a compound -- it's a consolidation of facts.  That allegation was based on information from a number of different sources; it includes direct -- it's based on direct testimony, as well as circumstantial evidence, as well as deductions from evidence.  So, to ask this one witness to comment on that paragraph is not appropriate.  

There's been no foundation within -- in this witness' testimony to ask about any meeting that took place at Nzirorera's mother's house.  If Mr. Robinson wants to pursue it, then he should do so incrementally, ask about a meeting, ask about the various personalities, then he can get to the factual issue.  But simply to put this complex proposition to the witness at this stage by reading from the indictment is not appropriate.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I can break it down if that's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think on this occasion Mr. Webster's comment is quite correct.  The witness won't answer that question.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I will break it down.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	To your knowledge, was there a meeting at Mr. Nzirorera's house on the morning of the 7th of April in which he, Casimir Bizimungu, Augustin Bizimungu, and Juvénal Kajelijeli participated?  
A.	I witnessed the meeting attended by Kajelijeli, Baheza and Nyabusore.  These are the three men I saw at the meeting, unless other men came to the same place thereafter, but I witnessed those three in attendance, the three whose names I have just mentioned.  
Q.	And do you have any information that either Mr. Nzirorera or Casimir Bizimungu, or Augustin Bizimungu, were in Mukingo commune on the 7th of April? 
A.	On the 7th or 8th of April people were heated -- people's minds were heated.  People were busy.  I was attending to my own problems, and could therefore not be careful, or pay attention to whoever was present.  
Q.	Did you ever hear that Joseph Nzirorera or Casimir Bizimungu, or Augustin Bizimungu had been in Mukingo commune on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	I believe I have just answered your question, Counsel.  That day I was very busy, I had problems, so that it was not a priority for me to notice the presence of those men. 
Q.	And therefore your answer to my question is no, you did not hear any information that either of those men were in Mukingo on the 7th of April? 
A.	You have just answered in my place.  That is not the answer I gave you.  The answer you have just given is your own.  If I were to say I do not know, or no, those are different answers.  Or if I were to say that I did not pay attention, that is not the same thing as saying no, or that I did not know.  Those are different -- distinct points.  
Q.	Well, Witness, you're talking in circles, and I'm suggesting that you're just trying to help the Prosecutor here.  So, could you just answer a very simple question:  Did you receive any information that Joseph Nzirorera, Casimir Bizimungu, or Augustin Bizimungu were present in Mukingo on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	I answered you.  At that time I was very busy, I had my own concerns.  That is the answer I gave you.  And that is why I did not want to -- I did not have the time to gather other information.  I was very busy sorting out my problems.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness, you could answer the question by saying either that you did get information, or that you did not get information, or you don't remember whether you got information or not.  
THE WITNESS: 
I never heard such information on that day.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you see Colonel Ephrem Setako on the 7th of April? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you see Jean Damascene Niyoyita in the area of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	I saw him standing with Ndisetse and Nzirorera's mother.  There was also Baheza.  But they were standing next to the road, the tarred road. 
Q.	And what time of day was that? 
A.	It was in the afternoon, at about 3 p.m. 
Q.	And did you see Mr. Niyoyita in the area of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house in the early morning of the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you see the conseiller, Assiel Ndisetse, in front of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house in the early morning of the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	No, rather I saw him at the place where the killers were executing Rukara. 
Q.	Did you see Bourgmestre Harerimana -- 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you see Brigadier Bazeriyimana, and that's B-A-Z-E-R-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A? 
A.	His name was actually Bazimanyira (phonetic), Ezekiel.  I did not see him.  
Q.	Now, when you went from the tea shop to the house of Nzirorera's mother, did anyone say anything to you at that house?  
A.	Do you mean Nzirorera's mother's house?  No, I did not mention it to anyone.  I returned immediately.  
Q.	But, did anyone speak to you at Nzirorera's mother's house when you arrived there? 
A.	No, I was with Michel and Dusabe.  I was in discussion with Michel and Dusabe.  I never talked to any of those officials. 
Q.	In your testimony of the 30th of March 2004 at your prior -- at this prior trial, at page 38 you said:  "We went to Nzirorera's mother's house, where I found Kajelijeli, Nyabusore, and Esdras Baheza, and someone known as Nyiramakuba, which is Nzirorera's mother.  They were there and they also were sad.  They told us that Nzirorera spoke to them on the telephone, and they told us that we needed to avenge the death of Habyarimana, come what may."  Did you give that testimony on the 30th of March 2004? 
A.	I can say one thing on this subject.  Personally those authorities did not give me that information.  I was actually told about this by Michel.  There is a time when Kajelijeli spoke, maybe you have not yet got there.  But let me tell you about it.  After Rukara died, when Kajelijeli was standing in front of his house, that is when Kajelijeli spoke and said something, before we climbed further.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take a break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, it's now 5:30.  How much more time do you have?

Yes, Mr. Witness?  Did you wish to say something, Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I do not want to discuss my testimony, I would like to request for permission to seek treatment tomorrow.  If there is an intention to put questions to me tomorrow, I would like to ask permission to see a doctor.  I have tried to be strong, but I think I have reached the end of my -- I have reached my limit.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, how much more time do you require?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think I will be finished some time at the end of tomorrow, or perhaps on Friday. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I beg your pardon?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think I will be finished some time tomorrow, but perhaps on Friday.  But I'm hoping to finish tomorrow, by the end of the day.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness, the issue of medical treatment is a matter which happens as a matter of course.  If you communicate your situation to WVSS, the Chamber will facilitate what is necessary for your health interests.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I did not quite understand your observation because I thought that if one has a problem, one can address the Chamber about it.  As for the procedure to go to see the doctor, I knew that indeed one must address the Chamber, the victims and witness support section, but because I felt it would not be good to be absent tomorrow to seek treatment, I thought it better to address the Chamber so that it would not be thought that I did not want to answer the questions being put to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, my comment to you was that the giving of medical assistance where it is necessary is a matter for which there's a routine established procedure.  You could not just absent yourself without permission, that's not the point at all.  But if you communicated your problem through WVSS, the registry will make appropriate arrangements in conjunction with the Trial Chamber.  Do you understand that?  

Witness, do you understand what I've suggested to you -- that you should communicate with the -- sorry.  

I've just been informed that the procedure is the WVSS will take the witness to get treatment first thing tomorrow morning.  So, what would happen is that we would have to be ready to be told when the Court will be convened.  That will depend on information from the medical services that will be treating him in the morning.  

So, arrangements have been made, Mr. Witness, for you to get medical attention tomorrow morning.  And depending on the results of those -- that treatment, we will fix a time for resumption of the -- of your examination.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, we take the adjournment now, for a time to be fixed tomorrow morning.
