A.	There is a difference.  There is a difference.  There is a difference between these two marriages.
Q.	Could you explain to the Tribunal the difference of your marriage to Soffie as compared to Laurence?
A.	There is the cultural -- the culture in the family that says that you can marry someone according to the culture.  So, this is how -- this is the way we followed.
Q.	When you say you can marry someone according to the culture, could you explain to the Tribunal what is the cultural norm - - what do you mean by according to culture?
A.	This is when -- when the second wife used to be my brothers'; and my brother disappeared and he was living in Uganda.  And then the family came together and determine -- took the decision that I should live with the second wife.  So, this is according to our custom.  This is a customary law.  In my region, the family has the right to give you orders depending on your capabilities, because they realised that there was no other way.  So I lived with her, according to this custom.
Q.	So that I get some clarification of that for the Court.  Is your testimony that Soffie was previously married to your brother; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And what happened to your brother?
A.	My elder brother lived in Uganda at first, then he came and got married with Soffie, then he went back to Uganda to go and bring his belongings.  At the end, we heard he might have been killed.  So the family gathered and because this woman had already become part of the family, I was ordered to marry her.  And since I felt this has been a norm, a normal custom, I accepted and I lived with her because there was a -- we could not -- we had learnt reliably that my brother -- my elder brother had died.  So I had to take her as second wife.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, did you have children with both wives?
A.	Yes, I have children with both wives.
Q.	How many children did you have with Laurence?
A.	We had six children with Laurence.
Q.	And how many children did you have with Soffie?
A.	We had eight children and seven are alive.  Seven of the eight are alive.
Q.	Were your wives, Laurence and Soffie, were they employed while you were in Rwanda?
A.	Yes, they were employed.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal what was the employment of Laurence and then Soffie?
A.	Laurence was working in sustainable development centre in Nkuli commune while Soffie was a teacher at Rwinzovu School -- at Rwinzovu primary school.
Q.	Could you tell the Tribunal whether, when you were in Rwanda in 1994, whether or not that your parents were alive?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sorry, could you repeat your question, Counsel?
BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
Q.	Could you tell the Tribunal whether, when you were in Rwanda in 1994, whether your parents were alive?
A.	Yes, they were alive.
Q.	What was the name of your father?
A.	His name is Bananiye, Gerald.  I spell Bananiye, B-A-N-A-N-I-Y-E; Bananiye, Bananiye, Gerald.

BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
Q.	Could you tell the Tribunal whether your father had more than one wife?  And if he did, what are their names?
A.	When I was born he had two wives, but he had three before then.
Q.	Witness, let me just take you back to one question I thought you had answered it, but maybe you hadn't.  Did you tell the Tribunal what was the employment of Laurence, your first wife, what type of job did she do?
A.	She was a teacher at Nkuli sustainable development centre -- permanent development centre training of Nkuli commune.
Q.	Is that I-G-A centre?
A.	In Kinyarwanda it is called Iga, I-G-A.  This is a centre for developing -- centre for permanent development.
Q.	Could you tell the Tribunal --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Go on, Counsel, except I just wanted to finish -- in the earlier answer on this matter, the Accused has said with regard to Laurence that she was working -- working at a sustainable centre in Nkuli.  Now she says she was actually a teacher; is that correct, Counsel?  Because in the earlier answer -- yes, you may have to verify that from the Accused because in the earlier answer she had used the formulation that she was working "with" or "working at".
BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
Q.	The Court would like a clarification with respect to Laurence.  Was she actually a teacher at Iga in Nkuli, or what specifically was her job function?
A.	She was a teacher in that centre for permanent development.  She was a teacher.  That's how they were called social teachers, social extension worker, but teaching.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, go ahead.  Go on.
BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell the Tribunal the names of your father's three wives?  What were their names?

Is this different from the Accused?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:

PROFESSOR HINDS:
That is him, the other names.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Because the two other names are not familiar.  So this is himself.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Yes.

A.	The fourth child is Mwitabangoma, Bwica. Mwitabangoma, I spell it, M-W-I-T-A-B-A-N-G-O-M-A; Mwitabangoma, Bwica.

A.	Yes, I do have brothers and sisters from the other wives of my father.
Q.	How many brothers and sisters do you have from your father's other wives?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Professor Hinds. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
These people -- these relatives of his would certainly be in this part of the world, the brothers and sisters.  What would you call them in English?  In this part of the world there would certainly be no distinction.
PROFESSOR HINDS: 
In the Western culture, they are certainly brothers and sisters, but they are -- they would be considered step-brothers and step-sisters.  That is those children that his father had with someone other than his mother. 

From a legal standpoint, they very well may have equal footing depending upon the jurisdiction, but we are not dealing with that.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, it's just a question of language because the record is going to be read by -- so that other people, other readers of this record can understand.   We would be comfortable to use the word "Brothers or half-brothers".  In this part of the world, as you have seen from the testimony of so many witnesses, these are regarded as brothers and sisters.

PROFESSOR HINDS:
Yes, but I just wanted to -- for the record to distinguish that his father had several wives and that he had brothers and sisters from one of the wives, and he also had brothers and sisters from other wives of his father.  I am not making any distinction between them as brothers and sisters except to designate the mother.  That's all.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, we just wanted to see that the record can be understood clearly by any other reader.  That's all we are trying to ensure.  

Go on, Counsel.
PROFESSOR HINDS: 
Thank you.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Now, Witness, I'm not sure you answered the question that I put to you.  How many brothers and sisters did you have from the other wives of your father?
A.	I had five brothers and sisters from my step mothers.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, are all of your brothers and sisters alive today; that is, those who were from your mother?  I am only focusing on your brothers and sisters, the seven of them that you have named, you have given their names.  Are they all alive today?
A.	The first name I gave died in Uganda.
Q.	Go ahead?
A.	The second one was our sister, our elder sister who died.  Right now we are eight, if you like.
Q.	How many brothers and sisters are now alive today?
A.	Right now we are seven.
Q.	That is excluding yourself?
A.	That is correct?
MS. OJEMENI:
The Defence can now direct the witness to answer with respect to a particular name of the wife.  I mean, are we talking about the brothers from the same mum or sisters from the same mum?  It's a bit confusing.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
I thought I was clear on this, but maybe if there is some  -- let me clarify.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your question was very clear and precise.  I think we understood you -- we understand you -- we understood you to be asking the Accused to be saying of the seven brothers from his own mother - - 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
- - how many are alive.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many are alive?
 PROFESSOR HINDS: 
That's correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then he started off by saying that the first one died in Uganda, that is -- should be --
PROFESSOR HINDS: 
Budeli.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And then he talked about the second one being a sister.  We understood him to be saying that she is also dead, and then he said we are now eight.  So, maybe can you be -- perhaps draw -- let the witness -- the Accused clarify that you are addressing the brothers or siblings from his own mother.
BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, of your brothers and sisters from your mother, Uburiyemuye -- the question I am asking you, how many of your those brothers and sisters died, how many?  Without giving us the names just give us the number.  How many died?
A.	Two of them died.
Q.	So, can you tell us where your brothers and sisters are now residing?  Where are they?  Are they all in Rwanda or are they elsewhere?  Could you tell the Tribunal?
A.	Yes, I can, of course.
Q.	Can you tell us?
A.	Five of them are in Rwanda and the rest we are outside the country.
Q.	Now, are your mother and father alive today?
A.	They have died.
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber when did your father die and when did your mother die?
A.	Yes, I can tell the Tribunal -- the Chamber, sorry.
Q.	Yes, could you give us the date of your mother and then your father?
A.	My father died in 1997 and my mother died in the year 2001.
Q.	Now, during the time period that you were bourgmestre, could you tell the Tribunal the names of the préfet who served during that time period from 1988 to 1993?
A.	Yes, I can.
Q.	Can you give us the names?
A.	Protais.  Protais Zigiranyirazo was one of them.  I spell the name Protais, P-R-O-T-A-I-S, Protais,
 Z-I-G-I-R-A-N-Y-I-R-A-Z-O; Zigiranyirazo.
Q.	Were there any other préfets?
A.	Yes, there were, Nzabagerageza, Charles.  Nzabagerageza, Charles, I spell the name, 
N-Z-A-B-A-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-A; Nzabagerageza, Charles, C-H-A-R-L-E-S; Charles.
Q.	Was there --
A.	The third one is Bariyanga, Sylvestre.  Bariyanga, B-A-R-I-Y-A-N-G-A; Bariyanga, Sylvestre, 
S-Y-L-V-E-S-T-R-E; Sylvestre.
Q.	Now, when you were the accountant in Nkuli commune, who was the bourgmestre in Nkuli commune at that time?  Do you recall?
A.	Yes, I remember him.
Q.	Do you recall his name?
A.	Yes, I do recall the name.
Q.	Could you tell the Tribunal the name?
A.	He was called Gisanabagabo  Stanislas, Gisanabagabo, G-I-S-A-N-A-B-A-G-A-B-O; Gisanabagabo, Stanislas.
Q.	And Mr. Kajelijeli, could you tell the Tribunal the name of the bourgmestre that you were replacing when you were first interim or acting bourgmestre?  What was his name?
A.	His name was Munyankiko, André.  I will spell Munyankiko, M-U-N-Y-A-N-K-I-K-O; Munyankiko, André.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, did there come a time when you were arrested by agents of the ICTR?
A.	Yes, there was such a time.
Q.	Could you tell the Tribunal when you were arrested and where you were when you were arrested?
A.	When I was arrested, I was in Benin.
Q.	Were you alone or were you with someone else when you were arrested?
A.	When I was arrested I was with Nzirorera, Joseph.   I will spell Nzirorera, N-Z-I-R-O-R-E-R-A; Nzirorera, Joseph.
Q.	Were you questioned at the time that you were arrested by the agents of the ICTR?
A.	Yes, I was asked some questions.
Q.	Did you answer those questions truthfully?
A.	I tried to answer, but I couldn't follow whether what I answered could be corrected.  The statement was not read to me so that I may correct it, if necessary.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Did the Judge want me to repeat something or - -
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think some questions didn't come out in French. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
The questions or the answers?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The answers.  I think after he had mentioned the fact that when he was arrested, he was with Joseph Nzirorera.  And then I think the subsequent question, "Were you questioned?"  "Yes", and he said, " I was questioned" or "some questions were put to me".
I think those are the few things which do not -

	1030H
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Okay, I am going to put some questions or repeat some questions that I had asked you so that we can clarify it with the translation. 

Now, when you were arrested were you asked -- were you questioned by agents of the ICTR?
A.	I was asked afterwards, it was not the same day.
Q.	So, your answer is, yes, you were questioned by agents of the ICTR; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I was asked questions.
Q.	When were you asked questions by agents of the ICTR?
A.	It was on the 12th June 1998. 
Q.	And is it your testimony that you were arrested on the 5th of June 1998, is that correct?
A.	I was arrested on the 5th June 1998 and I explained that I was asked questions a week later, after my arrest.
Q.	Do you know whether or not you were tape-recorded at the time that you were questioned?
A.	They had a registering machine, a tape recorder, and everything that I said was tape-recorded on that same day.
Q.	In 1998 did the agents of the ICTR ask you about your whereabouts during the events of April 1994?
A.	Yes, they did ask me questions about that.
Q.	In June of 1998 did you inform them about your whereabouts?
A.	Yes, I told them.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, did you tell the agents of the ICTR where you were in 1998, which is any different than what you have said in 2003?  Have you changed your story at all?
A.	I never changed my story except a few clarifications, a few rectifications, but it's no different than what I said.
Q.	What are the corrections you have noted; could you tell the Tribunal?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What corrections have you noted?
A.	I didn't say much because the Prosecutor said this is not proper, the Prosecutor cannot use them.  There were a few cassettes, I didn't have the opportunity, I did not have the opportunity to show what has to be rectified.
Q.	But, can you tell the Trial Chamber, now, what needs to be rectified, specifically; can you tell the Trial Chamber?
A.	Yes, I can.
Q.	Please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  Is there a problem?  The French is not coming through.  Can you repeat your question, Counsel?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Can you tell the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any problem, Interpreters?
THE INTERPRETER:
This is the English booth. Mr. President, we are having a problem with the relay from Kinyarwanda in the English and matters are further complicated by counsel not providing enough space between the questions and his answer in English.  So, the French booth is also missing the first part of his question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What does he need to do in order to slow down?
THE INTERPRETER: 
I believe Counsel ought to wait for the Kinyarwanda answer to be completed and give that space before he puts in his question, because there's -- we need to have a channel released and this is something we had discussed and explained earlier.  I believe counsel needs to be reminded.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, now, which button does he look at?
MR. HINDS:
Look, I need some instructions and guidance from my colleagues in the translation booth.  If someone -- if it is the individual to my right -- my left, your right, who is in a tan coat with a blue shirt, if he is the individual who I'm looking at, I need to know whether or not I speak when his light is off or on.  I need some signal, because I am not quite sure what is going on, or should I count from one to ten or something?  Just tell me what you need to do.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which button he needs to observe.  Okay, that one, Counsel, you see it.
BY MR. HINDS:
Do I speak when his light goes off?
THE INTERPRETER:
No, Counsel will just have to pause long enough after the answer in English, from the Kinyarwanda booth is complete, we cannot rely on visualising the light because he needs to keep the channel open for your question, so the switching off and on of his microphone will not work.
MR. HINDS:
How about if French -- if the control in issue is a French relay, when I see the French light go off then I know the French is completed?
THE INTERPRETER:
No, because there's a time lag that needs to be allowed to the French-speaking booth because they're relaying -- picking up from the Kinyarwanda booth, which at that time will be speaking English.  I'm afraid counsel will just have to pause adequately long enough for the French to be able to pick up the beginning of his questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, can you please go over your questions again?  You were dealing with the issue of corrections, if any, and the witness was trying to explain.
MR. HINDS:
That's correct.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you indicated that there were some corrections that you noted that should be made in terms of your answers and I've asked you to share those corrections and what they were.
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.  Your Honour may recall that in 2000 this particular issue was conversed or ventilated before the Court and a ruling was given.  My learned friend had challenged the integrity of the tape, of this interrogation, I mean the tape that was made during the interrogation; secondly, that there was exculpatory material in the tapes and at the same time there were also some mistakes in the tape and there was -- the Court ruled that there was no transcript of these tapes in place then and that my learned friend should bring to the attention of this Court or the attention of the Prosecution any error or any mistake or any exculpatory material that he found in the tape, and this transcript had been given to the Accused and my learned friend since 2000.  And what he's trying to correct now I'm objecting to it, and I'd like my objection to be noted because he had the opportunity since 2000, which is about three years now, to bring to the attention of this Court whatever mistakes or whatever errors might have arisen in the transcript and we would have resolved this issue by way of a motion or somehow he would have brought it to the attention of the Court.  I am aware that the Accused has the right to correct the errors or whatever problem he might have had with the transcript, but this would have been done long before now.  That's just the objection that I have as to the form of questions being asked.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
I don't know if the objection is to form or substance. 

Your Honour, this Court is quite familiar with the history of the recording of Mr. Kajelijeli and I'm not now ventilating any of those issues which went to the question of the illegality of his arrest.  I'm not dealing with that.  Mr. Kajelijeli was taped by representatives of the ICTR and to the extent that the tape showed inculpatory information the Prosecutor would have been showing it.  To the extent that the tape shows exculpatory information, we are entitled to show that.  If Mr. Kajelijeli is not changing anything, the tape stands for itself.  He is now testifying that at some point in time he heard some discrepancies and he's putting on the record what they are, that's it.  The objection that the Prosecutor is making is without any substance.  We are not attempting to change anything.  He has a right to testify and say whether the tape showed that he made the same statements five years ago as he, in fact, is saying today.  The Trial Chamber will listen to it, there are transcripts of it and we'll move on.  The objection, as I understand it, is she's objecting to him clarifying whatever he wants to clarify, I mean it's without merit.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, if my learned friend's position is that the tape -- there is no discrepancy in the tape, so he might as well, to save the time of the Court, he might as well put it into evidence.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I'm laying a foundation to put the tape on.  These are the questions, the foundation questions that I'm putting.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, to further assist the Court, I'm referring to your decision of 8 May 2000 in respect of my objection.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't remember what we said a long time ago.  What was the substance of that?
MS. OJEMENI:
It's actually on the decision on the Defence motion concerning the arbitrary arrest and illegal detention of the Accused and on the Defence notice of urgent motion to expand and supplement the motion of 
8 December 2000.  And it was actually on this tape or the transcript, as then the transcripts of the tape were not in place, so the Defence had alleged that the tape contained exculpatory material and there were discrepancies.  But the Court couldn't rule on the issue because the transcripts were not in place, and my learned friend was asked to bring to the Court's attention as soon as possible whatever discoveries or exculpatory materials are contained in the tape through the transcripts, but, since then, we have not heard nothing from my learned friend.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any problem with the taped statement?
MS. OJEMENI:
We don't have a problem.  I'm more or less pre-empting my learned friend because I know what we are discussing, parts, but if he intends -- if he's saying that the Accused has no problem with the transcript, that he hasn't changed his position, he might as well put it into evidence, because the Accused has sat here all through and listened to all the witnesses.  So, if he's changing anything he should have brought it to our attention before now, that's the point I'm making.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What -- we perceive the only problem that, Counsel, we have, if you are talking about the tape --
MR. HINDS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and what the Accused is alleged to have said in that term, are there any other matters to be taken further on that?
MR. HINDS:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In order for the Trial Chamber to appreciate, we must, first of all, know what he said, because you cannot talk about correction before we know what the witness, now the Accused, says.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you can't start with, if there are any corrections, you can't start with the correction before exactly knowing what is sought to be corrected.
MR. HINDS:
Fair enough.  Perhaps --
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we have to follow you.  We have to understand the context.
MR. HINDS:
No problem.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I think the best way would be to know exactly if you are dealing with the problem to produce the tape that's in issue we have to know exactly what the witness said in the tape and if there are any issues with regard to correction that could be addressed after, because you can't start with the corrections when there is nothing.
MR. HINDS:
Fair enough.  Your Honour, at this stage we will offer as Defence Exhibit 55 and 56, which are two tapes -- or it could be 55A and B, depending upon how the Court deals with it, there are two tapes which contain the interview of Mr. Kajelijeli in Benin on June 12, 1998.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any objection to that?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, my only problem is that I'm not too sure whether these tapes are the ones we gave the Defence.  We will offer to make copies of the original of these tapes and then we can present that.  I don't know which tapes my learned friend is presenting --

MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we --
MS. OJEMENI:
Can I finish?  

-- is presenting, but we have the original, which we have given to the Defence this morning.  I can offer in the next ten minutes to have that copied and he can tender that, but on Friday he told us that the tape he has will last about 15 minutes and the one we give him will not last 15 minutes.  So I don't know which tape my learned friend is tendering.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thought you sorted out these issues over the weekend.
MS. OJEMENI:
We couldn't for various reasons going to the Defence.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, this problem is vexing and irritating to me at this point.  I made every effort to make sure that we proceed expeditiously.  I'm very irritated at this particular time.  I've said to the Prosecutor -- they gave us two tapes.  We would use those.  If they have objections we would use the originals.  So we would not trespass upon the Court's time.  They have given me their originals.  I would play their originals.  There's no problem with that.  We don't need to make copies.  Now, we could play the originals and then have copies made and entered into evidence for the registry, but we do not need to waste time at this time.  There's no issue, as far as we are concerned, with the tapes.  We are taking their originals; it was unsealed in our presence; it's right here where they have left it.  I'm just talking now about marking them 55A and B and we'll get on to play them.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, my problem is the marking our tapes.  If it's -- what I'm saying, we can put in the tapes later.  We're giving him the original.  I have no problem the tapes being played, but I wasn't too sure if Your Honours were disposed to listen to the tapes now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
All I'm saying is that if the tapes will be tendered in evidence, we might as well have copies made so that we can then return the originals for exhibits because we don't have any in our possession.  What we have is what we have given the Defence.  So, I thought the Defence was using theirs and that's why I said I'm not sure of the content of what the Defence has, going by our discussion on Friday that their own tape will last 15 minutes when I informed the Court that it will take three hours.  So, if we are talking of our tape there's no problem with that, but at the end of the day we have to copy the tape so that we can have our own copies.  So, I have no problem with the original being tendered.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think you can apply for - we can have the originals tendered , I mean the originals tendered, but when copies are made, so that you maintain your copies, your originals, with the agreement of the parties, this could be made, copies can be made of those tapes, so that you take back the originals.  But for the purposes of proceeding with those proceedings, in order not to wait for the making of copies we'll have those tendered, then you can make your formal application as they are being tendered that you will -- because they will be exhibited, and then you will take them out, with agreement of the parties, you will make copies which will be exhibited instead of the original, you take back the original and the copies will be put back in evidence, will remain.
MS. OJEMENI:
That would be okay, Your Honour.  But, again, I have another problem.  While we were here we brought another tape marked A1 and A2 and I think we also gave it to the Defence in 2000, but I'm not too sure what the content is because it appears there's nothing in these tapes.  So, we'll also have to reconcile this tape with what they have.  We don't keep precision -- we don't keep the tapes.  These are kept by our evidence unit, but I wasn't aware that there is another set of tapes.  So they just brought it while we are already -- the Court had already started.  So it will -- also we will need some time to compare what we've given them and what we have here, but if my learned friend is going to rely solely on B2 or B1, that we've given them, perhaps when we look at their copy he can still bring it to the attention of the Court.  I don't know what this contains.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I'm totally confused about what is happening now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you have, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I have two tapes, copies of two tapes that were unsealed in my presence, in the presence of my client at the UNDF, you recall the whole scenario of that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
And Mr. Webster was here.  He said that Kajelijeli was never taped, you remember that, he said there were no tapes available.  Judge Kama was the presiding Judge.  Then several months later he apologised and said, "Yes, we did taperecord him", but the tapes were in the Hague.  We then had an unsealing process and at that point in time they gave that -- the Prosecutor's office gave me two tapes.  I accepted those two tapes as copies of the original two tapes.  I don't know what else is in their possession, but they gave me these two.  I offered to proffer these.  The Prosecutor said, "No, we prefer for you to use the original because we don't know what these are."  I said, "Fine.  Produce the originals."  They have produced the original.  I am prepared to play them with the assumption that it is the same content they gave to us.  Not only that, they gave us these two tapes, but they also transcribed what was on it in French.  I've accepted that to be true.  Now, I am told there are other tapes, it just seems so confusing. I don't know what they are talking about now.  All I'm interested in are these two tapes, for us to play it, get it into the record, and we move on.  I don't need to be reviewing other tapes, unless the Prosecutor is telling me now, now,  that the two tapes they purport to be the original are different than what we have listened to.  If they are saying that, then we have a problem.  If they are not saying that, then we should proceed.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I'm as puzzled as my learned friend because in the first instance I was not in charge of this case at the time this was done, but the fact remains that I -- on Friday I had offered to resolve this problem with the Defence if only I had been given the opportunity.  The man told me they had a tape that would last 15 minutes and I told them the tape we had would not last 15 minute.  The translator offered to have this tape listened to over the weekend so that at least to facilitate the translation.  And this morning the translator brought to my attention that that tape she was given on Friday that two tapes were empty.  And I played them.  This could be the tapes.  So while we were already seated, that was why Your Honours were -- we requested that Your Honours could delay a bit so that we could get this issue resolved.  And I had gone upstairs to get this resolved and that's when we were given the original of the tapes.  And I asked the man in charge of evidence unit to come down and open the seal in the presence of the Defence, which we did.  While the Court had already started the man came back and gave me two tapes.  I couldn't talk to him to find out what the tapes were.  So I'm only craving Your Honours indulgence, if I could be given ten minutes to compare what we have here and so we don't waste the Court's time unnecessarily.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the tapes that you gave to the Defence this morning, the original tapes, are the ones that you wanted to give to the Defence?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, marked as B1 and B2, which the Defence said we have given him.  But what we have here is A1 and A2.  But I do recall that when we went to the -- when the tapes were played for us in the presence of the Defence, that was in 2000, we had about four tapes and two of them were not clear.  So that could be the two tapes that are here.  I'm not too sure whether they are the ones, but I remember it took us over four hours, that's why I told the Court on Friday that the tapes would last about three hours, then my learned friend corrected me later and said what they had would last 15 minutes.  And I said, "It's not the same tapes."  And even the translator said that the transcript that we had would be more than 15 minutes, as my learned friend has said.  So this issue we could resolve within 15 minutes, subject to the convenience of the Court.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I know nothing about A1 and A2.  I mean, I'm now hearing new information.  I do not know what the Prosecutor's Office have.  I can only represent to the Court when Mr. Fleming was around they unsealed the tapes, made two copies for us, we accepted them in terms of face value.  I don't know -- for the record it's Interview With Kajelijeli, B1, copied 12-6-98; B2, Interview With Kajelijeli copied, 12-6.  Oh, I'm sorry, when I say it's 12-6, it's probably June 12, '98, B1 and B2.  That's all we have.  My staff tells me tape one is 30 minutes, tape two, 22 minutes, that's what I'm told.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
The tape I have has the signature of the Accused on the envelope I have.  It could -- and it's still not opened, it's still sealed.  It could be a mistake on our own part we didn't bring it to the attention of the Defence, but I'm not too sure -- that's why I want to verify, if they made two copies of the tapes and then sealed it -I mean include them in two different envelopes, but it has the signature of the Accused, as well.
MR. HINDS:
Just for the record, Your Honour, the tape that was -- the original that was unsealed in my presence this morning also had the signature of the Accused.  So, I mean, we are not talking about one envelope which had his signature and the other didn't.  And I don't know what process the Prosecutor's office has used.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you wanted to say something Accused?
Speak slowly.
THE WITNESS:
When we were given these cassettes on the interrogation, and I went in Benin, the Prosecutor retained some copies and when we were preparing to use them there was a transcript made, all the tapes are available and were presented by the Prosecutor and they have been copied again on the cassettes.  I think there is no problem, because it's the Prosecutor who gave us these cassettes and the transcript.  I don't see where the problem is.  It's okay to listen to them and then compare them with the transcript and it's only through that that we can see some passages to be rectified, but they are small details that do not matter much.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, what we'll do, what we propose to do, we'll take a break, check on those two audiovideo (sic) and when we come back after the -- you have found out what these other tapes are we will certainly deal with the issues that you have, the case that you have with regard to the statement --
MR. HINDS:
Interview.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- has said - is alleged to have said, but also it might be important to know what these other things are you can find out.  It's unfortunate, we thought things could be sorted out in a much better way than they appear to have been.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So how much time will you need, Counsel, with your colleague?
MS. OJEMENI:
By 1130.
MR. PRESIDENT:
1130.  All right.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think that those tapes, if she's going to review the tapes, we know it's 50 minutes, unless they are scanning it.  I don't know what they intend to do.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, by 1130 will be fine, 20 minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We really want to move forward.  This matter has been going on for quite some time.  We do appreciate counsel for the Defence's concern and we have been dealing with almost similar matters since Thursday, in one way or another.  Okay, so we'll adjourn these proceedings to 1130.  Until then, these proceedings stand adjourned. 
	(Court adjourned at 1108H)
(Pages 18 to 27 by R. Lear)









(Court resumed at 1149H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Yes, counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
With the greatest respect, Your Honour, we have since resolved the issue.  The A1 -- the two tapes marked A1 and A2 are actually the originals of B1 and B2.  The problem was more or less initiated by the investigators who did the interview.  They made two copies.  They made a copy from the original and they did not label it correctly.  And we have the form indicating the chain of command -- I mean, the question of custody of the tapes, right from 12th June 1998, when the tapes were recorded, up to this moment.  And it's always been in the custody of the evidence -- the two tapes -- the four tapes had always been in the custody of our evidence unit.  But the problem is that the two tapes were not labelled as a copy; that's, B1 and B2 are not labelled as copies of A1 and A2.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So A1 and A2 are the originals?
MS. OJEMENI:
The originals.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the B1 and B2 are the copies of -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
A1 and A2. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry -- A1 and A2 are the originals, and B1 and B2 are the originals of A1 and A2 respectively? 
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes, they are copies, and that's the ones we are introducing into evidence now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MS. OJEMENI: 
We apologise, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So which copies are we - which ones are we going to use for this purpose, Professor Hinds? 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, Mr. Kajelijeli moves into evidence cassette B1, and we would request that this be marked --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. HINDS:
-- as defendant's Exhibit 55A.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So B1 -- these are the copies, counsel? 
MR. HINDS:
Yeah, these are copies of the interview with Mr. Kajelijeli.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  And they have been checked with A1, A2?
MR. HINDS:
The Prosecutor has just certified on the record --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  All right..
MR. HINDS:
-- that this is so, and we accept their certification to that effect.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So we are tendering B1 and B2?.
MR. HINDS:
As 55A and 55B, respectively.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So let us start -- any objection, counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
No objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So let us start with B1.  B1 becomes Exhibit D one fifty (sic)? 
MR. HINDS:
55A.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  B1 becomes Exhibit 55A.  And B2 is admitted as Defence Exhibit No. 55B.
MR. HINDS:
That's correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  And these being the copies of the original interview of --
MR. HINDS:
Mr. Kajelijeli on June 12th, 1998, in Benin.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In Benin, right.
MR. HINDS:
By representatives of the ICTR.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes; okay. 
(Defence Exhibit Nos 55A and 55B admitted)
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, we also intend to bring the original of the translation -- of the transcript that we received from the translation department of -- that's the transcript of these tapes, and they've gone to the archives to bring the original.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. HINDS:
Well -- Your Honour, for us -- and I'm anxious for us to proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
The Prosecutor has given us copies of the original of the transcripts, which we have given to the interpreters.  They all have copies in the booth.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
So they'll be able to follow the tape (sic) as they are translating.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And the Trial Chamber directs to properly keep the original -- counsel, the original exhibit -- that is the original copy; that's, A1 and A2 --
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour we already have --
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- in your custody If they ever be required.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, we have them here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the transcripts might also be necessary at some stage, counsel, because those are the ones we might be using when they are available. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I didn't get that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The transcripts of the - of these tapes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yah.
MS. OJEMENI:
They are available now.  Do you want the original?
MR. HINDS:
Do you want us to mark them, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
We could mark that as 55C.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That might be helpful, counsel.
MR. HINDS: 
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will hear the transcripts, but we would like to have those if they are easily accessible.
MR. HINDS:
Yeah.  So maybe we need maybe -- well, Your Honour, the Defence also would move the transcript --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- of B1 and B2 into evidence as Defence Exhibit 55C.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Collectively.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, it's just one, one document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  All right.  So the transcripts will be admitted as -- the transcripts of now Exhibit B1 (sic) and B2 (sic) shall be admitted as Defence Exhibit No. 55C. 
(Defence Exhibit No 55C admitted)
MR. HINDS:
Yes, that's right. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Can the court assistant ...
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, we are told the transcripts are in French, and if they would be able -- if there will ever be any -- well, the English text, when made available and certified by the Registry, shall be admitted as Defence Exhibit No. 55D, D.  This one, the French text, shall be admitted as  Defence Exhibit No. 55C.  Right, Registry? 
MR. KIYEYEU:
We have taken note, My Lord. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Proceed, counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we would now request that the Registry play Exhibit 55A.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you do that?  
(Audiotape played)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Interpreting from the audiotape)  "There we are.  We're going to start.  We are at 11 hours 10 minutes at the office of the headquarters of the police in Cotonou.  I will, first of all, introduce myself.   My name is Charles Mengalle.  I am an investigator with the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Kigali.  Gandhi, can you introduce yourself?" 

It's going very fast, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, can he reduce the speed?  Oh, I see. 
MR. HINDS:
Is that playing at a regular speed?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is regular speed, yes, Your Honours, but it is fast, nonetheless, for us to keep up. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you could be stopping it for a while.  I don't know.
MR. HINDS:
How does (sic) the interpreters wish we proceed?  They want us to stop or just continue? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes. 
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
So far, I'd like to make a correction.  It was 10 minutes to 11, not 11:10, as I had said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
(Audiotape played)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Interpreting from the audiotape) "My name is Kajelijeli, Juvénal.  I am a refugee here in Cotonou.  Very well.  Can one know -- before we start, I'm going to read you your rights, um, and the rights of the suspect.  I will begin.  Before you answer your questions, our questions, you need to understand your rights according to articles 41 -- Rules 42 and 43 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the ICTR.  You have the following rights.  You have the rights to be assisted by counsel of your choice and to have legal assistance assigned to you without payment - "

Oh.  Could that be stopped, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, interpreter?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, we have listened to the tape, but it is rather fast, if we have to look at the text that is being referred to by the investigator, because we don't want to give an off-the-cuff interpretation; we'd rather follow the rules.  That was the difficulty in that instance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think we can always go as we are going.  Whenever the speed becomes perhaps not easy to keep up with, we could stop for a while. 
MR. HINDS:
Does the interpreter need us to go back?  Interpreter, French -- French to English, do you need the technician to go back, please advise, to reverse, rewind?  What would you wish, French to English?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, it would be preferable that we try it from the beginning once again, by your leave. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Can we start all over again, technician?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, just to be guided, are we playing the entire tape or the specific issues my learned friend wants to bring to the attention of the Court? 
MR. HINDS:
We are playing the entire tape.  I don't think that we can deal with it out of context.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would like to -- the Trial Chamber would like to hear it, because there may be some subsequent questions that are going to arise, so we have to know the context and we can only do so by hearing the entire tape.
MS. OJEMENI:
Very well, Your Honour.  I just want to be guided by the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
(Audiotape played)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Interpreting from the audiotape)  There we are.  We are going to start.  The time is ten minutes to eleven at the headquarters of the police in Cotonou.  I am going to, first of all, introduce myself.  My name is Charles Mengalle.  I am an investigator with the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Kigali.  Gandhi, can you introduce yourself.  My name is Ghandi Shukry.  I'm an investigator with the International Criminal Tribunal of Kigali.  I am -- my name is Juvénal Kajelijeli.  I'm a refugee here at Cotonou, Republic of Benin.  Very well.  Can one know -- before we start to ask you questions, I'm going to first of all read you a document; this is concerning the rights of a suspect.  I will begin.  Before you answer our questions, you need to understand your rights pursuant to Rules 42 and 43 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the ICTR.  We need to inform you that our interview is being recorded and that you have the following rights.  No. 1, you have the right to be assisted by counsel of your choice and to have legal assistance without payment.  No. 2, you have the right to have free assistance of an interpreter if you cannot understand or speak the language to be used for questioning.  No. 3, you have the right to remain silent, if you so wish.  No. 4, any statement that you make will be recorded and could be used as evidence against you.  No. 5 -- where are all those No. 5s -- if you decide to respond to our questions without the presence of your lawyer, your counsel, you can stop the interview and request the services of counsel.  I want to know whether you've understood.  Very well.  You're going to read this here.  Read it completely and then sign here."  

The sound is atrocious. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No translation coming through?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's just counting as the tape is running.  There is no -- I believe the suspect is reading the document he was given.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
	(Audiotape played)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Interpreting from the audiotape)  "Well, have you finished?  Yes.  I believe that you were going to read it out for our microphone.  Well, if you wish -- if you do not wish to do so -- but have you read the document?  Can you sign it for us?  For me, I wish to say -- I have just read the text, but the articles that you referred to in the Rules, I would like to understand them, at least, so that I can sign what I have understood.  Yes, you can.  The Rules which are in the Rules pursuant to Rule 40, these are Rules -- require that we tell you what your rights are before we interview you.  But you don't have these Rules?  No, unfortunately, we don't have the Rules, but they oblige us, as I have told you.  That is self-explanatory.  What it means is that these two Rules oblige the investigators, the members of the Tribunal to read before the interrogation -- to read you your rights.  But in the five questions, I'm asked to answer yes or no?  No, there is no yes or no.  We have to inform you of your rights; in other words, if you want to stop the interview.  You see?  If you're not in agreement, you can stop the interview.  As you wish.  That's what I wanted to say.  Your signature here.  Yes.  And your name below.  And the date.  Today's date?  There you are.  I'm going to sign immediately.  You should also sign.  Sign as what?  Well, it's not serious.  Sign -- I, at least, have to sign.  Sign somewhere.  Very well.  We are going to continue.  I'm, first of all, going to ask you questions concerning your civil status.  Right.  You have given your name.  Can I have the name of your father.  Yes.  Very well.  Go ahead.  Bananiye.  Mm-mmm.  Can you write that out.  Bananiye.  Second name.  There's no second name.  Bananiye.  Okay.  And the first name of your mother.  Spell the name, for our recording.  Let's start with the name of your father.  You mean the spelling?  Yes.  My father's name is Bananiye.  Can we have the spelling, the spelling for the recording?  Spell it out.  For our needs, can you spell out the names?  Can you spell that, like B-A.  Bananiye, Gérard.  My mother's name is Uburiyemuye.  Is that all?  That's all.  Okay.  Very well.  What is your -- how old are you?  I am going to leave you with your document.  What is your age?  Can you respond?  I was born in 1951, on the 26th December.  Investigator:  Okay, thank you.  Now, place of birth?  Answer:  What?  Question:  Place of birth.  Answer:  Place of birth, oh, yes, place of birth, I was born in Rwanda, Ruhengeri préfecture, Mukingo commune, Rwinsovu secteur.  Rwinsovu is my native village.  Okay.  During which year did you leave Rwanda?  Well, we -- well, when did you leave Rwanda?  We left Rwanda on the 13th of July 1994.  Before leaving Rwanda, what was your occupation?  Well, I was a bourgmestre, in August 1980 -- 1980 what?  1988.  Uh-huh.  Up to 1993, in February.  In February, 1993?  Yes, in February.  That is up to February 1993?  Uh-huh.  In what commune?  Excuse me?  You were a bourgmestre in what commune?  I was a bourgmestre in Mukingo commune.  I think I have told you.  Can you spell it, Mukingo?  Yes, Mukingo is spelt M-U-K-I-N-G-O.  Mukingo?  Yes.  In Ruhengeri préfecture?  Yes, I was re-elected.  Yes.  Yes, I was re-elected.  Yes.  I was re-elected on the 26th of June - uh-huh -- 1994, on the 26th of June.  So you became bourgmestre once again?  Yes.  In the same commune?  Yes.  On the 26th of June?  Yes, I was re-elected.  Re-elected?  Yes.  Who re-elected you?  The population.  And this time round it was through elections.  Through elections?  Yes, through elections.  But how did that take place in Rwanda?  Were the bourgmestres elected or were they appointed?  You see, after the advent of the multiparty political system, there were limited elections at the level of the communal development council, and then on the recommendation of the préfet and following a proposal of the minister of interior at the president's office, so it was at the level of the cabinet?  Uh-huh.  Yes.  Well, in 1993 when you left the commune, how were you in notified that you were no longer a bourgmestre?  I received a presidential order that I'd be relieved of my duties, because opposition parties wanted to take over my place.  Prior to that, there had been a single party; but with multiparty political system, all political parties shared existing posts.  So I was relieved of my duties from that particular day.  Well, so, you said that since in 1993 you already had a multiparty system; is that what you're saying?  Yes, that's what I was saying.  So, what I don't understand is that you were relieved of your duties through a presidential decree and the population decided to re-elect you.  Yes, in 1994, on the 26th.  Okay.  So you want to say that the president did not have the power -- did not have power to appoint you?  He could not appoint you.  No, it was just to see whether the population wanted you, whether the population wanted you, or if they didn't want to elect you.  If they didn't want you, they would not elect you.  Okay.  So if there's anything with which you were reproached, you would not have been acceptable to the population.  This is why the opinion of the population was necessary, because we had come to a democratic system where the population had the right to choose its authority, its leaders.  Okay.  Between February '93 and the 26th of June 1994, what were you doing?  Well, I was dealing with my own activities.  Where were you at the time?  Well, specifically, in Ruhengeri préfecture.  In Mukingo commune or in the préfecture?  Please be specific.  Well, in my commune of Mukingo.  Very well.  Okay.  Well, um -- okay.  Between -- whilst you were bourgmestre there were political -- activities of parties -- activities of political parties.  What was your role as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune?  But your question, your question is not -- isn't it against the Rules, as you said from the beginning?  I don't know if the international tribunal for Rwanda is going to deal with years prior to what happened in Rwanda, because in the Rules one should simply see what happened in Rwanda from -- from 1994.  Uh?  Uh?  So if you go back, you need to tell me, uh.   No, as I have explained, you have the right to refuse -- to remain silent.  Precisely.  That's what the Rules provide.  Since we -- yes, the Rules provide for that.  You cannot go backwards.  You have the right to remain silent.  As for the Rules, it's not up to you to tell us what Rule to use.  It is our Rules.  So you can say no, you do not want to respond to that, because I am talking about what is provided in the Rules that you cannot go back to matters prior to 1994.  Very well.  Can you tell me when you were re-elected on the 26th of June 1994 by the population, you said -- why were you elected, in your view?  Well, the people re-elected me to lead the commune -- to lead the commune since my successor -- or my predecessor -- I can say everything had died.  Yes.  Before -- before we come to the predecessor, what was your predecessor's name.  Harerimana, Emmanuel.  Yes.  That means that when you were -- when you left the commune, the leadership of the commune, that's the person who replaced you?  Yes.  By presidential decree, still?  Yes.  And then in the meantime, he died?  In the meantime -- well, during the war of 1994, in April, he died.  He died following what consequence?  Well, I don't know if he was killed by the RPF, because at the time of his death it was said that bombs were falling on the commune.  Excuse me.  We are going -- unfortunately, we are next to this window and there are interruptions.  So, we are going to interrupt for the time being.  Uh?  Okay, we'll resume.  We are going to continue.  So, for you, there's the element of the RPF.  At that point in time, the RPF launched bombs close to the commune and part of the commune had been taken by the RPF, so at that point in time we did not have the opportunity to contact the doctor.  We heard that the bourgmestre died, by radio.  We did not have time to investigate the consequences of his death.  Okay.  So do you -- did you know the date of his death?  Well, if I were to recall, it was -- it was between the 9th and the 10th, if my -- if I remember right.  Ten -- 10th June?  No between the 9th and the 10th April.  April 1994?  Mm.  In other words, one can find that out, but it's between the dates of the 9th and the 8th?  I'm a little hesitant.  Okay.  But he died during the war, when the war was fully raging.  Okay.  Between that date, between April and the 26th of June, as you have said, you were appointed to head the commune.  Who was acting?  There was, uh, an assistant bourgmestre who took over.  His name?  The assistant bourgmestre who took over after the death of the bourgmestre was Mr. Félicien Semahane.  Could you write that out?  You have a piece of paper.  Can you write that?  It's S-E -- Félicien.  If you can spell it out for us.  So he was called Semahane, Félicien:  S-E-M -- S-E-M-A-H-A-N-E, Félicien.  Okay.  Do you know where this gentleman is now?  I do not know, because I left the refugee camp in 1996.  He was at Mugunga.  Mugunga?  Camp -- Mugunga camp?  In Mugunga, in 1996, at Mugunga, in the east of Zaire.  Goma.  Yes, yes.  And then I do not know what his situation is, what his present destination is.  You left him, you left him in the camp?  Yes.  Yes.  Apart from him, was there another person at the commune, another civil servant at the commune?  Who dealt with what?  Well, let's say there is the commune.  So he was an assistant bourgmestre?  Yes.  Were there secretaries, were there conseillers?  Conseiller, yes, conseillers, that's it.  But that was your former commune.  Yes, normally, but when I left the commune, everything changed.  I'm not -- or, rather, I was not interested in the staff.  Okay.  Do you remember the names of people who worked there, the names of your aides at the commune?  Do you remember their names? Well, for me, firstly, there was -- since, you mean, since -- since when?  Well, give us the names of people who are working with you at the commune.  But when?  In February 1993, before your departure, and the names of the people who worked with you from the 26th of June onwards, if that's possible.  Well, firstly, I can say that in the first instance you had the communal conseillers, or councillors.  I'm going to ask you for names, the names of those people.  Okay.  Firstly, in February '93, if you can, and then after that".  Okay.  The person being interviewed is writing names of his offices, his aides.  

So the investigator is saying that the interviewee is still writing names of his staff. 

(Interpreting from the audiotape)  "So we need some time.  It would be better if you write -- well, there's too much.  Well, there are many names, eh?  Could you please read out the names for us?  Well, Mr. Félicien Semahane was there.  What was he doing?  Well, he was just -- well, let's say he was the assistant -- acting as an assistant bourgmestre.  And after that, there was also Assiel Ndisetse.  Yes.  He was a councillor.  And then there was Amos Murara.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  He was a councillor.  Hategekimana, Ezekiel.  Yes.  He was a councillor.  Apollinaire Mendero.  Yes.  Ntibiramira, Elie.  Uh-huh.  What was he doing?  He was a councillor.  Yes.  So all these people were conseillers?  Yes.  And then there was Papias Gashongore.  He was a councillor.  Semwanzi, Grégoire; he was also a councillor.  Sebahige, Jean de Dieu; he was a councillor.  And was that in 1993?  Yes, yes.  And then in 1994, in July 1994, up to your departure from Rwanda, who was with you at the commune?  Well, well -- I'm talking about communal office.  Well, I continued working with all these gentlemen, because they continued working with me, and they had been elected by the population, so there were no way of changing them.  So you worked with the same people?  Yes, the same people to lead the commune.  So that was a list?  Yes.  A list of all those people?  Yes.  Now, Gandhi, do you have something else to say?  You said that they were elected by the population.  How did the elections take place?  Was it during a general meeting or -- how did the elections take place?  No no, no, no.  Those were elections pursuant to the appropriate law governing communal elections; it was not elections at meetings.  Okay, we are going -- we have to stop here.  We are going to stop here in order to flip over the cassette.  It's now 11:20 a.m., Cotonou time.  So we'll stop here and continue later". 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we would now like to play 55B.
MR. PRESIDENT:
55B.
MR. HINDS:
Yeah.  We have now completed 55A, which was B1. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we are going to 55B, which is?
MR. HINDS:
B2. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is B2. 
MR. HINDS:
My correction, Your Honour.  I think it is -- we are just -- they are just flipping.  We are still with B1.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We're still with B1.
MR. HINDS:
That's right.  It's the other side of B1.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
MR. HINDS:
So I withdraw that introduction.  This tape would B1, just the other side of it.  I apologise.  My staff have just corrected me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we continue with Exhibit 50 -- Defence Exhibit 55A, B1, continues, eh?
MR. HINDS:
That's correct, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The other side.  Okay. 
(Audiotape played)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Interpreting from the audiotape)  "Side B of our cassette.  The time is 1123 minutes, the 12th June 1998.  I'm going to remind you again that you have your rights.  Your rights are still there, you know them, and we are going to continue.  Right.  You were talking about the manner in which the elections -- how you were elected.  You said that you were presented.  This is your list.  But there were other lists, uh.  It was with other lists or was it just a list which was presented to the commune?  Can you -- your question is confused.  No, what I mean is, I wanted to know whether -- because the elections, when you speak of elections, well, there are elections -- I want to say that these were elections which took place throughout the country.  Yes, I understand that, but in your commune, I want to know whether there were several lists during the elections.  No, no, there were not -- there were several lists.  Those who -- those men that I had spoke of were elected by -- among the major lists which existed.  So there was only one list?  In each secteur -- these were representatives of the secteurs.  In each secteur there were candidates, and amongst the candidates the population would choose a candidate which seemed best to them.  Well, so, that's for which period of time?  The names that -- well, I left the commune in 1993, in February, and then the bourgmestre who succeeded me continued with these conseillers, eh, after his death.  These conseillers continued to work, eh?  After having been re-elected, I mean myself, I also continued to work with them for -- I don't know how many days, because at that time the war was raging.  There was no way of seeing whether they were able to continue with their activities.  But as bourgmestre -- the bourgmestre who died, was it you who replaced him?  No, you are aware that we did not have the opportunity to follow.  I mention that there.  He had his -- he was replaced by his assistant.  I've told you that.  Yes, yes.  You have said that.  Okay.  So, from -- from 26 June when you were re-elected, what was -- how could you describe the situation in your commune?  In our commune, the population, which was able to do so, could flee, because part of the commune was taken by the RPF.  So during the night the RPF would threaten the people to flee.  Just like myself, I would come to the commune, coming from Gisenyi where I had -- to where I had fled.  Well, yes.  However, it's -- that's okay.  When you were re-elected you didn't go immediately to Gisenyi to stay there, you remained in the commune, like the others?  No everybody was moving about; the whole population was moving about.  On the 26th of June the population was moving.  All of this -- those who were not able to do -- well, the stability -- for maybe -- they tried to calm down, to reduce movements, but each -- and you know the war was threatening -- each person had to save his or her life.  Very well.  Mr. Juvénal, you are a member of which party?  At that time to be elected bourgmestre, one had to be neutral, without belonging to any party, without being biased.  You were not a member of any political party?  Yes, yes; one had to be neutral.  You needed to be neutral, clean, without working for any party whatsoever.  Very well.  Whilst you were -- or even before you became bourgmestre, you remained in your commune.  You didn't take -- because you were no longer bourgmestre between '93 and June '94, did you not carry out some political activities?  No, no.  I've already -- I had already removed myself from political activities.  I was dealing with my own personal affairs.  No.  How?  You said -- well, when you were bourgmestre, before you became neutral, before you removed yourselves from political activities -- what activity?  You need to tell me what political activity.  But I do not understand".  

It's going a bit fast here, Mr. President.  There's an exchange.  Can it be stopped?

Could it just be rewound a little bit, so we catch up with where he was, where I lost it?
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not on) ... catch up, technician?
	(Audiotape played)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Interpreting from the audiotape)  "I had already removed myself from political actives and I was dealing with my own personal affairs.  No.  How?  You said that when you were bourgmestre you had to be neutral.  How were you removed from political activities?  What political activities are you referring to?  I do not understand what political activities you are asking me about.  No, you said that you removed yourself.  No, personally, from my own will, I left politics, eh, because there was a new bourgmestre.  One had to leave about peace for one to deal with the commune, but there was no way, once again, of having a policy contrary to one's will.  I was just -- I was obliged to deal with my own affairs, for my own survival.  That's all.  Well, yes, but you are talking what political activities?  I do not understand what political activities you are asking me about.  Is it -- you said you did not deal with politics.  I want to know what politics.  That's all.  Well, this is it.  When I was a bourgmestre, I was dealing with the policy of governing the commune.  You see.  There is the policy of communal development and there's social policies.  So you need to look at all that.  The well-being of the whole of the commune, whereas -- so I -- I put myself aside.  Yes.  Well, you were in your commune, however, you had political activities in parties, political parties, people who came to your commune to carry out -- can you tell us something?  Activities, the personalities, who came to your commune?  Uh, uh, you need to excuse me.  At that point in time I was not responsible for knowing what personalities were coming to the commune.  I told you that I was dealing with my own personal activities.  You mean that you didn't see anyone, you didn't see anybody?  No, that was not my duty.  If I took my vehicle to transport something or someone, I mean, I could go and see what was happening at the commune.  But that was not my duty.  Why did you decide to assume the functions of a bourgmestre on the 26th of June 1994 when you knew very well that things were not going well in the commune?  You know very well that that was a risk so why did you accept, assuming that responsibility?  I would not ask -- I'd rather ask why he refuses assuming those duties?  Why not?  So you say no?  No, I think I was able to take over the responsibility.  But why did you accept them?  I'd say that it was not my will, it was the will of the people.  But if the population say, you can refuse -- you have the right to refuse.  Yes, but if you do that to the people, that would be not a good thing.  No, no, it wouldn't be a bad thing, but it was my choice.  I could have refused or I could have accepted, so I decided not to refuse.  Well, you opted for that.  That's why I'm asking you.  Go on.  Why did you accept?  Because I had the interests of the population at heart.  Is that all?  Yes.  Well, could you not tell us what happened from the 26th of June up to the point of your departure.  What -- how was the situation in your commune?  Well, in the commune there was a lot of movement.  There were people who were living in neighbouring communes who were fleeing the war, who were coming to our commune, so we were organising ourselves; we were working so that we restore peace.  But since -- but the war was progressing, so we had to organise the people -- to help people who felt threatened by the war.  We wanted to see how facilities could be organised, and, up to a point, when we ourselves took the initiative of fleeing as the war advanced or moved forward.  Very well.  Now, in your commune, as in other communes of the Ruhengeri and the Gisenyi préfectures, there were killings.  There were deaths, there were killings.  Were you aware of those killings?  Well -- yeah, and I'm asking you as a bourgmestre.  Well, since -- or, rather, on the 26th of June 1994, up to that time I had never seen killings.  I tried to organise the population to avoid all conflicts which could bring about killings.  So you are saying that there were no killings?  Well, since I took power again at the commune, there were no killings.  In July 1994?  Since July 1994 you are underlining that?  I'm saying that there were -- emphasising that there were no killings.  But if I put it to you that there were killings, if I told you that indeed there were killings.  Well, first of all, tell me what dates, and then I will rely on those dates.  But what date did you refer to?  Well, I mentioned the 26th of July 1994.  Well, you were re-elected on the 26th of June -- I beg your pardon.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes; you're right.  You were elected on the 26th June.  I beg your pardon.  Yes.  Since I was re-elected, there were no killings.  Since you were re-elected on 26th June 1994?  Yes.  Now you're talking about 26th July.  No, no, no, please rectify that.  So what date should I take?  Please take 26th of June.  Twenty-sixth of June?  Well, you see, there are names which bring about confusion.  You see, here we are talking about the sixth month of the year in 1994.  You see, there is confusion when one refers to names of the months.  So you are saying that there were no killings?  No, I'm saying there were killings since 26th July 1994.  Question: How can you assert that?  Well, you told me that even after that date, you did not spend all your time at the commune because you went to Gisenyi to seek refuge like other people.  How can you assert that?  Every day I had a meeting with conseillers, and this took us time.  Each conseiller gave me a report, and on the basis of that report, I knew everything that happened in the commune during the night or during the day.  That is why I am asserting that there were no killings, because everyone was fleeing.  But these conseillers, did they also not flee?  Those conseillers.  But why not?  Yes, because -- because they were passing, through the communes, first of all.  And you're sure that you are reporting exactly what happened in your commune?  Ah, unless -- yes.  Unless there's something to prove the contrary, uh?  Yes, that's what I'm trying to say.  I'm saying that somebody should provide evidence to the contrary so that I can justify it.  But I am basing myself -- I'm basing myself on all that the conseillers were telling me, and with verification indeed, because there was no killings.  Gandhi, you do have any questions to ask?  What I do not understand, you have said that you were appointed by the people on the 26th of June 1994 as bourgmestre.  Is that right?  How did that happen?  Was there a large meeting made of the people of your commune?  Was there a good meeting or did they come to your house?  No.  How?  So, we proceeded just with each secteur of the commune which was represented; all the services were represented.  It was a whole assembly amongst -- and amongst the candidates -- candidate who was capable of representing the people to ensure that peace is restored among the people, so I was chosen.  It was the assembly, the meeting, eh, which represented the population.  So, after that, the list of candidates was submitted and the result was submitted to the presidency, and then I found the presidential decree the same day, the 26th -- just on the 26th of June.  Why did they decide on that day, on that day?  What?  Why did they decide -- the population or -- why did they decide on the 26th June to appoint you as bourgmestre?  Well, it's not a question for me to answer, because one is appointed bourgmestre according to the proposal of this assembly, eh, with all the parties involved, and then the president of the republic is advised and the presidential decree is communicated, is issued.  And it's from that decree that you begin to carry out your activities as bourgmestre.  Very well.  Um -- what did I want to tell you?  Well, ah, since you've said that you would come to the commune and then you left for Gisenyi, to go and remain in Gisenyi.  Yes, yes.  Did you see the activities of these killings before you did that?  No, there were secteurs, and it was prohibited to go there because these were secteurs already conquered by the RPF, and there was no access there.  Yes, yes.  Well, did you say that you did not see -- that you did not see any killings?  Is that because of the war between the government -- the Rwandan government and the RPF?  But the killings, in Rwanda, killings which took place in your commune, because you have said you -- I asked you a moment ago to tell us about the situation.  I said, did you see any killings.  I personally as bourgmestre, I never assisted in -- I never witnessed any killings from the time I was appointed bourgmestre on the 25th -- 26th June 1994; I never saw any killings.  And before, before those killings?  But yes, even before.  Even before?  Yes, yes.  So you're saying that there were no killings, the events, killings?  I am saying that before 1994 -- before 1994 it was the war of the two armies, and that's when part of the commune was taken.  You can understand that it was -- there could not have been no killings.  I'm asking -- answering that after I was re-elected in my commune.  But if you want us to go back, if your Rules permit this, we can go back to -- begin with 1990, and that way we will see how the war started.  No, that's not where we are.  Oh, yes.  I know all that.  We don't need to, thank you very much.  Tell me, do (sic) you follow the news of the death of President Habyarimana?  Can you please repeat your question?  I'm saying, when did you follow the death of President Habyarimana?  When did I follow the death of President Habyarimana?  Yes.  Well, thank you for the question.  I -- during the death of President Habyarimana, in the 9th -- night of 6th to 7th -- from 6th to 7th, yes, in the night of 6th to 7th April 1994.  Uh.  I was not in Mukingo commune.  Mm, where were you?  I was Nkuli commune.  Nkuli?  Yes, yes.  Yes.  Right.  Ah, at four in the morning we tried -- so four in the morning, that's already the 7th, isn't it?  Yes, yes, the 7th of April.  Yes, we tried to switch on the radio and then we heard music.  Eh?  Classical music.  We began to be afraid.  After a given point in time we heard a statement -- eh -- from the Ministry of Defence, saying that no one should leave his home.  So from that point on, we remained where we were.  And where were you precisely?  I was in Nkuli.  I had a house there.  You were in your house.  Yes.  Okay.  Right.  From that time, we waited, ah, until, ah -- until the -- until the 9th April.  Mm-mmm.  The day on which the bourgmestre I've spoken to you of died.  That was the 9th.  Yes.  Between the 9th and the 10th.  I tried to see on the road whether the people were moving.  So I tried to move up to Mukingo commune to see whether -- how -- under what circumstances this bourgmestre met his death, and when was the burial ceremony going to take place.  So it was said that his burial was going to take place at 7 p.m.  We had to go back home and then, ah, ah -- and then go to decide -- we returned to his place for the burial.  Just as he was being buried, the bombs were falling on the commune.  We tried to flee, but others had the courage to remain and conclude with the burial ceremony.  So that night, everybody tried to escape, because they could not spend the night there.  How could they spend the night there; whereas, at the same time there was -- there was some calm and then they just -- we just went back.  That's all.  Nothing else that I know about the death of Habyarimana.  You said that the Ministry of Defence issued a statement, according to which no one could leave home until further notice.  Who was it?  Was it the Minister of Defence?  The minister?  No, it was a statement which came from the Ministry of Defence.  Ah, very well.  Yes.  So after the burial, you went back to Mukingo?  No, no, I was still in Nkuli.  So you went back to Nkuli?  Yes.  And then you continued following the situation of the death of -- yes, yes, yes.  So what happened where you were?  You see -- no, no, my question is, did -- what changes were there, after there were bombs falling?  Is it true -- but what did you notice has changed among the population?  Everyone was frightened.  Everyone was frightened.  We heard gunshots everywhere.  We could see soldiers passing by, you see.  And the RPF army which had been stationed on the other side wanted to advance towards the Ruhengeri préfecture.  So the people fled, coming from Ruhengeri, following which we saw the same thing regarding people coming from Kigali.  So the whole country was in a turmoil, and we could not say that there was any point which was spared.  There was conflagration everywhere.  Okay.  So you stayed on in Nkuli for how long?  Well, the situation calmed down, let's say, around the 12th.  Calm?  I mean, in what regard?  You are referring to the war with RPF or calm among the population?  No, I'm referring to the war with the RPF.  Yes.  Now, among the population, was there anything happening?  We would heard from here and there, you know, people were saying that RPF was advancing in the Nkuli part of the commune, which had it taken, so the population of that region fled.  This is what prevented me to go to the Mukingo commune at that time.  As the army was there, they were trying to halt RPF's advance and there was a situation -- there was a lull, and I was able to move to the commune around the 12th.  Well, if you had a house in Nkuli, it means that you know Mr. Nzirorera.  Even if I didn't have the house in Nkuli, Mr. Nzirorera is known; he'd been a minister.  How can one not know him?  During elections, he used to go out.  He would be first, he would be second, he would be third.  Very well.  Thank you.  So you know him?  Yes, yes.  Did he often used to come to the Nkuli commune?  No, he would come there when there were presidential ceremonies, or, let's say, when there was a minister visiting the area.  He -- and in such cases, he would accompany the minister.  But he, on his own, never came to Mukingo.  It was out of the question to come as the minister.  As a party authority, what about coming there as an authority of MRND?  No, he never came there in the two communes for such meetings, and I'm telling this to you sincerely.  Well, Mr. Juvénal, earlier I'd asked you whether -- I mean, since you're denying that there were problems, that there were not killings, every time I'm telling you about killings, you have said no.  I'm telling you that -- I told you that there were no killings, but what about when you were a bourgmestre?  Even when you're not a bourgmestre, in Mukingo and Nkuli?  Answer:  What I would like to tell you very truthfully -- and here I beg your pardon -- I did not want to be a witness who is lying.  I want to clearly tell you the truth.  So from the 26th of June 1994 I never saw killings.  Well, before that date?  Mm.  Personally, I never saw deaths.  Killings, I never saw killings.  No, no.  I'm not telling whether you're a witness, but did you hear that there were killings?  Even if you didn't witness them, what I'm telling you is that I would hear gunshots left, right and centre.  Since it was declared that the president had been killed by the RPF.  You see, the situation, or rather, the population arranged -- in other words, if you do not stay home with the anger of the population.  No, no, we're going to stop here.  We're going to stop here.  Uh-huh.  It is now ten to midday.  We've reached the end of the cassette.  We are still on the 12th of June 1998, and we are going to stop here.  We're going to stop here in order to change the cassette.  Yes, we are going to change the cassette.  Okay." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
We are finished with the first tape.  The second tape, I understand is -- what's the length?  I'm told that the second tape is 22 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
MR. HINDS:
Absolutely, about one hour.  And I'm just talking to my staff about it.  They told me 30 minutes.  Now, I've just asked them whether it's 22 minutes on one side or not. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe we --
MR. HINDS:
I think we -- my suggestion, Your Honour, is that we break now for lunch.  During the lunch break, I'm going to time the second tape just to make sure.  I was told it was 22 minutes.  I'm hoping it's not 22 minutes on one side.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay. 
MR. HINDS:
And I'll make a decision whether we'll play it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So we will stop here and then we'll come -- we'll go to -- that will be Exhibit 55B?
MR. HINDS:
That's correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is B2?
MR. HINDS:
That's correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All right.  Then we'll adjourn these proceedings and resume our work at twenty-five to three; twenty-five to three.  Until then, these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court recessed at 1306H)
(Pages 28 to 45 by Geraldine O'Loughlin)












	(Court resumed at 1440H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Professor Hinds.  So we now continue --
MR. HINDS: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We continue with -- that would be Exhibit 55(B) or B2?
MR. HINDS: 
Yes, 55(B) which the cassette tape B2.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
We have examined the tape, Your Honour, over the lunch break and confirm that it is 22 minutes in duration, and we propose to play that tape for completeness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  All right.  We can start right now, if they are ready. 
(Audiotape played)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Interpreting from the audiotape)  "It is 11:57.  We are still at the office".  

Could you kindly switch off those mikes?  

(Interpreting from the audiotape)  "It's still the 12th of June 1998.  I am going to begin with the second cassette.  I am going to repeat to you your rights, Mr. Juvénal.  As always, you have a right to be assisted by counsel of your choice and to have legal assistance even without you being able to pay; you have the right to have a free assistance of an interpreter".  

I am sorry, Your Honours, can the volume of that tape be increased?  It's very difficult to hear it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The interpreters want you to increase the voice (sic).
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could we also inform the Court that this is not the beginning of side A of the cassette, B2.  There is a portion missing, where we are involving the introduction of the investigators and the suspect being questioned.
MR. HINDS:
I am addressing myself to the technician.  Can you rewind to the beginning, because we are told that we haven't started at the very beginning?  So can you rewind all the way at the beginning and then start again, and increase the volume so that the interpreters can pick it up?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Interpreting from the audiotape)  "It is 11:57.  We are still at the office of the police headquarters in Cotonou, still the 12th of June '98".  

There's been a skip there.  

"We will begin with the cassette A2, the second cassette, and I am going to repeat to you, Mr. Juvénal, your rights.  As always you have the right to be assisted by counsel of your choice and have legal assistance even if you do not have the means with which to pay.  You have the right to have the free assistance of an interpreter if you cannot understand speak the language used.  You have the right to remain silent if you so wish.  The statement you make will be recorded and may be used as evidence against you. If you decide to respond with -- in the absence of your counsel, you can stop the interview at any moment and request the services of counsel.  There, you are.  I was -- you were explaining to us the general situation which reigned in your commune and also following the death the President Habyarimana.  I want to ask you -- I have not yet quite understood because I am telling -- you said that there were killings in the -- not killings -- you said that there was a lot of firing and general incitement, there were (sic) firing everywhere, but the question which I am asking you is, did you not see bodies, dead bodies - dead bodies? -- in your commune in the commune, even when you were not bourgmestre, you were still nonetheless in your commune?  I told you a moment ago that I cannot  in any case speak lies or be a witness if there is lies being told.  Personally, even before the good Lord, I've told you that I never saw dead bodies, and I am the one telling you this, except in the Republic of Zaire in Goma where the population fleeing the RPF died in large scale, and at the airport of Goma where the population was killed, and priests -- the RPF launched bombs at the Goma airport and a lot of people were, including even members of the population, of my population.  As for the dead bodies, the dead bodies that I personally saw, but before that even outside that, I never saw any dead bodies.  No, no, I am the one telling you that, I am the one telling you.  But you at least knew that there had been problems, that there had been killings.  You had heard that people were being killing, part of the population was killing another part?  But, rather, it was RPF army even before -- if we were to go back to the war of the RPF, there was a time when about 440 persons were killed, especially the majority, the civil servants of the Ruhengeri préfecture, including persons from Mukingo commune.  At that point in time, I saw these bodies because I sent the vehicle of the commune to transport the dead bodies which had been killed by the RPF in order to bury them in the Mukingo commune.  What period of time was this?  Well, it was the period from 8 February 1992, so I know that -- Nineteen ninety-two?  Yes.  That was when you were bourgmestre for the first time?  Yes, yes.  I witnessed the burying, and we tried to remove the bodies but we were not able to.  This was following what?  You had spoken about the RPF.  I think you have already recorded that.  Yes, I know.  Yes, it was the war of the 8th February 1992, which killed more than 440 civil servants of Ruhengeri préfecture, including natives of my own commune.  On that day, I lent the people a vehicle in order to recover the bodies of their kin found amongst the 440 bodies which were buried in Mukingo commune, at the Mukingo commune.  That's what I was able to see, because those were your civil servants of my commune and I had to help them.  Very well.  But as for the killings at the time when the RPF were killing, I was not there.  This was done in Ruhengeri préfecture, in town.  Can you tell us that you did not know that people were being killed in your commune?  When?  I'm asking you when?  In April 1994, after the death of President Habyarimana?  And I said in April 1994, during the night of 6th to 7th, eh, April 1994, I was not in that commune.  So what happened in that commune, I was not -- I would not be a witness to that, eh.  I was aside, at home in Nkuli.  So what happened there, you can ask that of others I was not there.  Not you?  Not me.  That means you were not - no. For you there was no genocide in Rwanda?  Me, personally, I am saying, I personally, I am asking -- I am answering questions you are asking me.  If you are asking me a question about genocide and you are closing what you have just started to speak about, and then we will come back to that question.  Come back how?  You mean you want to go to another page or -- Yes, I would take another page.  You don't wan to talk about that here?  No.  You -- you can even withdraw that, because you are asking me that as a question.  Well, okay.  Because you're mixing things.  You're saying what happened in my commune and then you are also talking to me about genocide.  That's something else.  I cannot answer you.  I cannot answer you if you do not turn the page.  Very well.  The seven names which you gave me like that, can you help us in saying where these people are if you have an idea, if you could tell us where these people are now?  Me, that is a trap for all of us.  You have to ask me clear questions.  I promised your colleagues there that even before they had come and handcuffed me at night that we were ready, since we had received information that they were criss-crossing this region.  So we were ready.  Even if ICTR wanted to summon us, we were ready to go in order separate this suspicion, to remove these perceptions.  We don't want to be treated anyhow, because this really annoyed us.  So if you are asking me the question, if you want to want to know where is the last of these conseillers, I told you earlier this is how I would like to answer your question.  Well.  Firstly, we were in the camp in eastern Zaire, in the Kibumba camp.  Since United -- UNHCR wanted to work with the entire population with the aim of distributing rations in the camp.  Well?  Well, okay.  Go ahead.  But let's stop.  It's now 2:10 (sic), and we are still on the 12th of June.  It's 12:10, 12th of June.  Okay.  We are resuming.  It is now 11:00 or, rather, it's 12:15 p.m.  We would like to remind you that you still have your rights.  We are still on the 12th of June 1998.  So you are telling us or, rather, you're talking about the situation of your staff members.  Yeah, you are asking me where are those conseillers were?.  Yeah, those conseillers.  Well, what I will tell you is that when we got to the UNHCR refugee camps, UNHCR asked us to fully cooperate with them, and they chose me in order to help them control the situation, to bring about peace, security, as well as for the sound management of rations; to help them, in short.  So every commune, every préfecture, and so on and so forth.  So, in order to achieve that, I used my conseillers who knew the population, and that was on or about the 20th June -- I beg your pardon, 20th July.  We were in the camps.  They had just started bringing rations and the population did not know how they had to go about getting their rations.  So, promptly, the conseillers were used in order to bring the people to reason and for them to change their behaviour.  Well, at that time I worked within UNHCR up to 1996 when UNHCR wanted to repatriate the entire population.  Well.  Then UNHCR wanted others -- that is, us -- wanted us who had been leaders to be separated.  In my case, they separated me from my family and I went to Kinshasa, where I was detained for a whole year.  And since the time I have not seen those conseillers.  All I know is that I left them in the refugee camp, and since then -- and since the war broke out in eastern Zaire, RPF has sent back the population to Rwanda.  I do not know whether those conseillers are all in Rwanda.  However, you could seek information about them because you are better informed, because you are present everywhere; you are in Kigali and throughout Rwanda.  You could seek information regarding the whereabouts of those conseillers.  Regarding whom, I would say with the assistance, I'd say, of the bourgmestre Semwanzi.  He, too, can testify to this situation, because even before the outbreak of the war, he was there, and since I have come back again, we continued working together, have -- the place where you can find them, in my opinion, I imagine, would be Rwanda.  Okay, well, when you come back again you became a bourgmestre on the 26 June 1994. On the 26th, did you find disorder there?  Yes, that's true.  So what was your first objective?. Well, firstly, we had to work according to directives from the hierarchy, from the préfet; he used to give instructions through telephone because the road was impassable, because there was too much movement.  So my first objective was to stabilise the situation and to bring about ,calm to restore calm.  But at that point in time, that was not possible because the war was still raging.  I was telling you earlier that a part of my commune had been taken over by the RPF and it was controlled by the RPF.  Well, in order to provide security to the whole community, that was something difficult for me.  It was difficult everyone, because everyone who could manage to do so was seeing that the situation was changing on a daily basis, try to flee without waiting for the conflagration.  But my first objective was indeed to maintain and security for the entire population.  Okay.  Do you have anything else to add?  No.  Personally, I count on the two of you for your impartiality and neutrality in respect of the events that took place in Rwanda, because according to what has been said during the establishment of the ICTR, it was being said that the Tribunal's objective was to bring to light -- was to shed light on everything that happened in Rwanda, and the United Nations had established the Tribunal, but without saying that they were going to prosecute Hutus only.  It was said that all parties which were in conflict in respect of which the Tribunal would shed light without any segregation.  So up to this point in time, up to today, the party which is being pursued, from what I understand, is the ethnic Hutu group.  So if this is part of ICTR's mission, or, rather, if the Rules have been changed in order to target only one party, I don't know about it.  But, personally, what I am asking you, or, rather, what I would like to add is for your neutrality in regarding the events in Rwanda.  Thank you very much.  Well, we are not here talking about the ethnic groups, because you still have Hutus, to my knowledge, who are Rwandans, and most Hutus, to my knowledge, are still in Rwanda.  If you allow me", says the Accused, the Kibori event, are aware of it?  Do you know about the Kibori event?  Yeah, we are aware of it.  The Kamana commune events, even on the radio it was -- it has been said that they are deserted communes, they are villages which have no people.  What is the army doing there?  Well, to say that there are Hutus, and so on and so forth, and that Hutus aren't worth anything, isn't the government not putting itself between the two groups, and we could go far and ask why even RPF collaborators of Hutu, are they still together with them, the same collaborators who pointed a finger at their brothers.  They used to point their fingers at their brothers.  But are they still in the country, those Hutu collaborators?  No, they have gone on exile; they are outside the country.  Among those, you heard about the assassination of the two former ministers.  There was Rushoga and he was the immediate collaborator, even a founder of -- so can you say that Colonel Ruzinde was killed pointlessly.  His death is known.  No, no, no, no.  We are getting out of our scope.  No, no.  We are getting out of our scope", says the investigator.  

Kajelijeli:  "Well. what I am requesting is the neutrality regarding the events in Rwanda.  But we are not involved in politics here.  Well, it's true. Yeah, we are dealing with justice here.  It is justice, but it is written in newspapers that the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is a political tribunal.  Well, if this is politics, I would like to request that maybe things should be changed to see whether the Tribunal is dealing with politics or it is dealing with justice.  Justice should be given precedence.  I think that we are going to stop here because we have now entered the political arena.  But this is a political tribunal.  I am sorry.  May we know it.  No, no, no, no.  This is what the newspapers are saying.  No, no, that is what is coming from - what we are saying.  In any case, I am asking for neutrality.  Please be patient.  We are going to stop here.  But I want to tell you that -- I want to tell you that in this whole affair I have nothing to do with this affair. I am requesting my release, because I never participated in any such acts regarding events that took place in Rwanda.  I am demanding my liberation, because I am innocent.  I am demanding my liberation.  And that is why I had to wait for the ICTR delegation to come here in order for me to explain myself to them, since UNHCR mistreated me, to the point of isolating me from my family and to detain me in Kinshasa.  Up to the same, UNHCR pursued me up to here, in Benin.  And I suspect that it is UNHCR which caused the ICTR to arrest me.  So I would like my rights to be respected.  Thank you."  

Question:  "Have you been ill-treated by UNHCR?  No I expect ICTR -- I had expected ICTR to intervene, because according to UNHCR, they are saying a lot of things against me.  They kept me in Kinshasa without any evidence, and the -- the Kinshasa government intervened, and it released me, but UNHCR pursued me up to here, and I am waiting that for ICTR to take measures, special measures, so that I can be released.  Okay.  We are stopping here.  It is 12:25 p.m.  We are going to stop here.  Today is the 12th of June 1998." 
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  This is the end of the playing of Exhibits -- Defence Exhibits 55A and 55B.  

May I proceed?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, after you were interviewed on June 12 of 1998, in Benin, did you have an opportunity to review the tapes recordings that were made of you?
A.	I didn't get the time to do that.  It was too late, and I found that there are certain things that I could change without changing what I said before, especially as I had a problem of language with French.  The confusion with the French brought about that I said what I didn't wish to say.  That is why I wish to change a few things, but that where the principle is not changed, where the gist of the story is not changed.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, when was the first time you had an opportunity to review the tape recordings that were made of you? 
A.	It was after I had seen transcripts of the contents of the tape which was recorded in Benin. 
Q.	After you arrived here in Arusha or was it when you were still in Benin?
A.	It was when I was around here, when the cassettes were supposed to -- especially after the Prosecutor said that she wouldn't need them.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, what corrections --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, before that, there are two issues.  In your questions, there is -- it talks about the tapes.  Now, what are the time frames, if any?
MR. HINDS:
Yeah.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, could you tell the Tribunal, to the best of your recollection, when you first reviewed the tapes or looked at the transcript?  When?  What year, do you recall?
A.	I can confirm that the time I read the transcripts was last week.  That is when I compared the words I said and what is written.  That is why -- where I found some discrepancies with the French words that didn't express what I meant, especially as those I was talking with had problems, because they didn't understand French like I did.  Once I saw the transcripts, I was able to follow, to pinpoint the faults that were due to the language that I used.
Q.	Did you review the tapes themselves?  Did you listen to the tapes themselves, and did the tapes also contain the same errors that you detected in the transcript?
A.	It is true I compared, and I found that those mistakes were there, contained in the cassettes.
Q.	And when did you do this, make the comparison?
A.	I did all that last week. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, what were the other discrepancies that you noted?
A.	There is that day when we buried the bourgmestre of commune Mukingo, and the others were -- I went from, it wasn't on the 9th.  I was doubting about the 9th, but eventually I found it was true.
Q.	So, if you could be clear so that Tribunal understands what you are making the corrections -- from what to what?  Is it concerning the date of the burial of the bourgmestre?
A.	It is the -- the date is correct, because I said it was the 9th or the 10th, but I found it was the 9th.  But what I was to correct is the precise ,time because I wanted to correct was 9:00.  And the second I wanted to correct was the conseiller of Kimunyi secteur, who was Ntibiramira, Elie.   He was conseiller, but be was replaced by Kaburabuza, Gasper.  But afterwards, I found it was Ntibiramira instead of Gasper Kaburabuza .  The third, (speaking Kinyarwanda) --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of course the record remains --
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, sorry.
MR. HINDS:
We have to watch the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we there?
MR. HINDS:
No, we're not.  I think they are still speaking in French.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of course, the Accused, the witness, is testifying on his own behalf can state what would be the correct version as he sees it, but the record otherwise remains as it is. 

Go on, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you were citing the -- you said there was an additional correction --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have the date, the 9th, which he confirms.
MR. HINDS:
That's correct.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Except the time frames.
MR. HINDS:
Correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Nine, he used the word --
MR. HINDS:
He said 9 o'clock in the morning.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, I think -- he said 9:00.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, 9 o'clock.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, 9:00 o'clock.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, maybe let me ask him again.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we need the confirmation --
MS. OJEMENI: 
-- confirm the dates and the time, unless my learned friend didn't get what he wanted, but be confirmed the date and time, and we move on to the next one --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the time - yes, he confirmed the date as being 9, according to him, and the time, 9:00.  The only thing that you want to verify, learned counsel for the Defence said 9:00 am, but can you have that one confirmed, because it could be 9:00 and --
MR. HINDS:
Sure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't want to assume.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, was it 9:00 -- what time of day was it?  You said 9 o'clock.  Could you be more specific.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  It was 9 o'clock in the morning on the 9th.  But on the cassette I said, if I am not wrong -- on the cassette I said 1900 hours instead of 9 o'clock, and then I also said the 8th, 9th and 10th, but I was doubting.  Now I can confirm it was on the 9th that the bourgmestre was buried.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you indicated that you were about to state another correction that you wanted to make.
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  It is that the conseiller Kimunyi secteur, that I gave on the list, when I told the investigators of the Tribunal, I mentioned the name of the conseiller who had been replaced and who had died.  I confused him with the one who was there called Kaburabuza, Gasper, and instead I said Ntibiramira, Elie .
MR. PRESIDENT:
The new stenographers - the names are not very familiar.  Interpreter?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
Ntibiramira, N-T-I-B-I-R-A-M-I-R-A, and Kaburabuza, K-A-B-U-R-A-B-U-Z-A, Kaburabuza.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Any other corrections, Mr. Kajelijeli?
A.	Thank you.  The other one is the presidential decree, which I confused with -- in terms of dates.  I heard it -- I heard about it on the 17th and the 18th of June, and I confused it with the time when I was handing over on the 26th to 28th.  The date of the presidential decree, the one confirming the elections, it was between 17th and 18th of June.  I confused it with the date when I handed over.  That is the third alteration I wanted to make.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I think that your answer is not very clear, and so, therefore, we would like you to explain what presidential decree you are talking about.  And when you say "handed over", that also is confusing.  What do you mean by "handed over"?
A.	Thank you.  The presidential decree came out on the 17th and 18th of June. And my handing over and swearing on the 22nd June -- and my handing over was from the 23rd to the 26th of June.  So I confused the two dates.  After thinking, I found that the date I gave was that one when I was handing over.  That's why I have to explain myself before Your Excellencies.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you are using terms that are confusing to the Tribunal.  The presidential decree, what did it relate to?  There was a presidential decree, that related to what event?  The Tribunal would like to know that.
A.	The presidential decree was confirming that elections had taken place, and, according to the majority of people who were elected, the decree confirmed that those people who were voted by the majority.  It was, in the case, Kajelijeli who was supposed to be the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.
Q.	Now, when you said that date was confused with the date you handed over, can you describe the process of handing over?  What did that consist of?
A.	Thank you.  I mixed the map in French.  I meant that it was handing over power -- I don't know whether it is power -- and the equipment and the administration of the commune.  That is the way I understand it.  In Kinyarwanda, we use the French word, temise et reprise.  That is how we use it.  But in a clear manner, it is handing over the power to -- for the job that you are going to start.  So you take over the new functions that you have been assigned.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Some other dates, I think 22nd or 23rd, you know, during his initial answer when dealing with the question of having over, according to him.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, I think that what he is saying is that he confused the dates of the 17th with the 22nd.  The 17th was the date when there was a presidential decree establishing, confirming the elections.  On the 22nd, he actually took the reins of power, but he used the term "handed over".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it the 22nd or 26th?  Twenty-sixth.  That is why we want know exactly if the taking over of his functions was done on the 26th, subject, of course, to his confirmation, and then what would be the other date that he mentioned?  He mentioned two other dates in his answer, 22nd and 23rd.  If he can - of June, of course, and I think we are talking about 1994.
MR. HINDS: 
That's correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If he can clarify those aspects. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, in your answer you gave several dates.  So can you confirm the date when you actually took the position of bourgmestre for the second time, in June; what was the date?
A.	I was sworn in on the 22nd of June 1994, and then I started replacing the person that I found on the job, and there was a handover after the 26th of June 1994.  
MR. HINDS: 
May I continue, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, taking you back to when you were first appointed bourgmestre in 1988, were there any structures or communal organs within the commune?
A.	Thank you, but I want to point out that certain things that I wanted to rectify are not yet over.
Q.	I am sorry.  Go on.
A.	There is that part where I said, part of Nkuli commune, was wrong.  It was the part of commune Mukingo that was taken over by -- occupied by the RPF.  There is also --
Q.	Okay go on, Mr. Kajelijeli.
A.	There is also a place where I said the population was very angry.  I am sorry for saying that.  I meant that the population was crazy. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, could you try to -- Mr. Kajelijeli, are you hearing me?  We would like you to give further explanation concerning when in your statement you made reference to the population being angry.
A.	The way I saw the population, there are those I wanted to pinpoint because of the -- some of them, because of the behaviour of some them.  When you hear the population, you would understand that it is the whole population, but that is not true; it was just part of it .  But those few I am talking about, they behaved like mad people.  This really tries to distinguish those who behaved in that crazy manner, but it wasn't the whole population.

Q.	Are you there?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would like to know where in your statement.  Can you locate it?  I mean, it is a general statement.  We would like to know exactly at what particular stage in your statement did Exhibit 55A or 55B -- would you give it context?  We would like to know so that we can go back to it if we need to.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I found it on the first cassette, on the transcript -- on the transcript where the first cassette has been recorded.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the interpreters make an off-the-record comment?  In the French transcription there was a mistake in the French.  Instead or writing "enragé", they wrote "arranger", which is an arrangement.  So I think that could be the source of the confusion, because there was a mistake in the French transcript.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't understand.  At --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Page 26 of the transcript there was a mistake which, instead of saying "enragé", which is to enrage, it is written "arranger", which is to arrange.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is wrong?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That was a mistake in the original French transcript.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to rectify it?  Do a follow-up.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, it is the last page.  I think it probably is the penultimate question that was put to Mr. Kajelijeli, and he is making the correction and that is the reference.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes.  Yes, can you have it verified, Counsel, so that we know where it is?
MR. HINDS:
Well, could we show the witness what is now Exhibit 55C?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  He doesn't speak French.  Prosecution, have you seen that paragraph?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, we have.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, can you now turn --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is Exhibit D55A.
MR. HINDS:
No, it is 55C.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, sorry; 55C, the transcript.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, can you turn to page 26, the small numbers at the bottom right-hand corner?  Are you at that page?
A.	I'm checking on that page.
Q.	All right.  Look at the second paragraph and read it to yourself, and when you have finished reading it let me know.
A.	Yes, I have finished reading it.
Q.	Now, can you tell the Tribunal whether or not, after reading this portion of the transcript, that refreshes your recollection as to this being the error that you wanted to correct?
A.	It reminds me -- it reminds me why I -- before I said that, I meant to say that when the population -- the people, heard that the president of the republic -- after it was confirmed that the plane carrying the president had been shot down by the president (sic), the people were almost mad, people couldn't stay in their homes; there was too much anger in the people.  That's what I meant.
Q.	Okay.  Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, are you finished with pointing out discrepancies you found between the transcript --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, will you take back the document?
MR. KIYEYEU:
Yes, My Lord.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	-- and your recollection of what you said?
A.	I've finished.
Q.	Now I would like to take you back to when you were first appointed bourgmestre in 1998 of Mukingo commune.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  I don't know that we heard correctly, but at some stage when the tape was -- videotape was running, we heard mention made of the date of 8th February -- February, nineteen ninety --
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Two.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, 1992.  Go on, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
That is what I heard also.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's not one of the corrections.
MR. HINDS:
He doesn't see that as a correction.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, taking you back to 1988 when you were first appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo, were there structures or commune organs in existence at that time?
A.	Can you repeat the question?
Q.	At the time you were nominated for the first time to be bourgmestre in 1988, and you were appointed, what were the structures or communal organs that existed at that time?
A.	The organs that existed then, there was, first of all, the communal council.  There was also the experts -- experts' council.  There was a development -- communal development council -- committee, rather; beg your pardon.  These was -- those were, in principle, the main organs of the commune, and these were -- and these were based on legal instructions that were clear.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, could you tell the Tribunal what was the composition and function of the experts -- that is the term that you used -- experts' council?
A.	It is difficult to remember their names.  I can only recall a few names.
Q.	I'm not asking you to recall the names of the individuals, but just could you tell the Tribunal what was the composition -- how many people -- and what were -- what was the function of that technical council?
A.	The number -- the composition was 11 members.  Among their functions we can mention studying the projects that can help develop the commune, to find funding for those projects.  In brief, this was to look into projects that can help develop the commune so that there can also be proper strategies to implement those strategies and find funds for financing these projects.  You know, they were supposed to help the communes achieve all these.
Q.	Now, what was the function of the committee and what was its composition?
A.	The development council had to decide on the existence of such projects, to also decide on the viability of the projects, and the financing of such projects, and to ensure that all parts of the commune benefited from this, especially taking into consideration more backward areas of the commune.  So it was a council that actually had to take decisions.  It was the policy-making organ of the commune.
Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal what were your functions, your duties and responsibilities as bourgmestre between 1988 and 1993?
A.	Can you repeat the question?
Q.	What were your duties and responsibilities as bourgmestre between 1988 and 1993?
A.	My responsibilities consisted of a long list.  First of all, I had to coordinate the different organs and ensure harmonisation with the people; to chair the commune meetings; to prepare the agenda for the communal meetings; to prepare and implement the budget for the commune; to ensure security in the commune; to chair the commune development council, to represent the commune; to be the legal representative of the commune, whether in legal matters or whether in courts of law; to advance -- to help develop the development projects in the commune within different secteurs; and to chair the general meeting of the -- of the citizens in this commune; and many other responsibilities.
Q.	Did you have an assistant or assistants while you were bourgmestre during the years of 1988 to 1993?
A.	There were several assistants.
Q.	Could you give us the names of the assistants who served between 1988 and 1993 and tell the Tribunal what function they served or what roles they played?
A.	One was in charge of governance, political systems, justice, but they -- she (sic) was working under the bourgmestre.  I can tell you his name if you want.  His name was Semahene, Félicien.  I'll spell Semahene, S-E-M-A-H-E-N-E; Semahene, Félicien.
Q.	And were there any other assistants that you had between 1988 and 1993?
A.	There was another who was in charge of economic affairs and development matters.  His name was Innocent Nsengiyumva.  I'll spell Nsengiyumva: N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A.  There was another in charge of cultural matters and social affairs, as well as education.
Q.	And who was that?
A.	His name -- her name was Nyirambunga, Beatrice.  Nyirambunga is spelt -- I'll spell Nyirambunga: N-Y-I-R-A-M-B-U-N-G-A, Nyirambunga.  That's all.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, in Mukingo, were there secteurs and, if so, how many secteurs were there?
A.	I remember that there were eight -- eight secteurs.
Q.	And was there an authority figure who was in charge of each of those secteurs?
A.	Yes, they were there.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal the names of the secteurs that existed, that is, between 1988 and 1993, when you were bourgmestre?
A.	I can mention the secteur as well as the conseiller.
Q.	Yes, please.
A.	There was Busogo secteur -- Busogo, headed by Ndisetse, Assiel.

MR. PRESIDENT:

Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, is that the list of conseillers?
A.	Yes, that's the full list.
Q.	Um, was there a conseiller --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Remember; he said there were eight.
MR. HINDS:
I am about to ask.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Was there a conseiller for Gikoro?
A.	His name was Bashongore, Papias.  I have mentioned him.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter thinks not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the name again?

Bashongore, Papias.  Bashongore, I'll spell out:  B-A-S-H-O-N-G-O-R-E, Bashongore.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the secteur?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
The secteur is Gikoro, G-I-K-O-R-O.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, were there cellules in Mukingo?  And you do not have to list the responsables for the cellules, but could you tell us how many cellules there were?
A.	Mukingo commune had 51 cellules.
Q.	And do you know the population of Mukingo between 1988 and 1993?
A.	As far as I recall, there was a census in 1991.  The findings gave more than 44,000 people for this commune. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Forty-four?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Forty-four thousand; more than 44,000, were in Mukingo commune.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did you at that time know the breakdown of ethnicity within the population; that is, from the census of 1991?
A.	According to that census, there was no ethnic break down.  The census just showed the number of people in Mukingo commune.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are taking the break at the usual time, at 4:00, so you can see how you can wrap up your questions around this time.
MR. HINDS:
Okay. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you have testified that in 1993 you were dismissed from office; is that correct?
A.	In 1993 I was removed from my post.
Q.	And who removed you from your post?
A.	I was -- I received a presidential decree, stating that I was removed from my post as bourgmestre.  There was no explanation.  We could be redeployed in other -- on other jobs, according what we were told.
Q.	Did you, subsequently, find out why you were removed from office in 1993?
A.	I know some of the reasons.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal?
A.	The first reason was that during the Arusha peace negotiations there was going to be the implementation stage and the RPF had to have (sic) the ministry of internal affairs and communal development, and the RPF -- the RPF -- the RPF requested that people who had been appointed by President Habyarimana who were not members of RPF should be removed, and I'm basing this information on the letter received from Mr. Kanyarengwe, Alexis, who was the new minister, who had requested me to change parties, because I knew that once the negotiations are concluded people can join the parties of their choice, and that is why I was removed from that post.

The second reason was that the internal opposition (sic) wanted different bourgmestres appointed by the presidential decree issued by Habyarimana.  In case these were not changing parties, it was decided they should be removed.  Since the new prime minister was a member of the opposition (sic) he followed -- he complied with the wishes of the RPF and it wasn't -- this wasn't a unique case.  It happened to many civil servants, and there were many changes in accordance with the Arusha Accords.  There were ministries being offered to RPF and people had to be removed from these positions according to the wishes of the RPF.  I was not surprised, especially considering the letter I had received from Kanyarengwe.  I'll spell Kanyarengwe, K-A-N-Y-A-R-E-N-G-W-E; Kanyarengwe.
MR. HINDS:
I think if this is convenient, Your Honour, we could stop here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Kanyarengwe was the minister for what?  Can the witness explain?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, the Court would like you to explain what was the ministry that Mr. Kanyarengwe -- what ministry was he in charge of?
A.	Before Kanyarengwe fled the country he had been minister of internal affairs as well as public service, and he is the man who had given me a job after my training, my management training.  He had been my friend and he felt that we can collaborate, but I felt it wasn't too late because he was the chairman of RPF.  I wasn't able to comply with his wishes, but there were bad consequences.  I was a bit persecuted by Radio Muhabura.  It was a long story and many people heard this.  He was a minister of internal affairs and civil service.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
That the end of this section.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Your Honour, I would like to apologise -- in 1993 -- I mentioned 1992 instead of 1993 when I was talking of -- when I was talking of -- when I was talking of the massacre -- when I was taking of the massacre of 404 people on the 8th of February 1993 -- 1993.  It was in 1992.  I would like to rectify this.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will stop here and adjourn for -- yes, we will resume our work at 20 past 4:00.  That's 15 minutes.  Until then the proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1605H to 1622H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Yes, Learned Counsel for the Defence, could you please continue your examination-in-chief?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you testified that Alexis Kanyarengwe asked you to change your party affiliation and you refused.  What was your party affiliation in February of 1993?
A.	I do not know if he asked me to change from my party.  Actually, I said that he requested me to collaborate with him.  That's one.  Two, in 1992, during the multiparty era I was not a member; I was not affiliated to any political party because it was not -- it was forbidden for a bourgmestre to have political affiliation -- political party affiliation.
Q.	So, is it your testimony that after multipartyism was initiated you were not a member of any political party; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's what I said.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, when you were removed as bourgmestre in February of 1993, do you know who replaced you?
A.	I know him.  I know the person who officially replaced me.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	And who was that person?
A.	This was Harerimana, Emmanuel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have been through that, Counsel, haven't we, at the beginning of his testimony?

MR. HINDS:
Yes, he did say that, but I needed to lay the foundation for the next question that I'm asking.  Yes, he has said that, I think.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Was he elected or nominated, do you know, for the position?
A.	He was elected because there was a procedure that confirmed the bourgmestre after he had been approved by the organs representing the population.
Q.	Now, when you left office, did you turn over any properties belonging to the commune to him?
A.	We had the handover ceremony and process.  There was a handover procedure -- process and I showed him everything, and both of us signed after that ceremony.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal what properties you turned over to your successor, Harera (sic) -- or Harerimana?
A.	There is something I would like to correct in the meantime, and that is that before Harerimana became the bourgmestre to head the commune after I had been removed from the bourgmestre -- there are some people who acted as bourgmestre before he was approved by the communal development committee.  So I will say that these were the people who were temporarily replacing me, and Harerimana replaced me officially after the communal committee met and approved him, and the president also issued a presidential decree to approve this, and so I could see that -- I did the handover -- I handed over to the bourgmestre assistant in charge of administration and political affairs and then he, in turn, later on, handed over -- he handed over this after Harerimana was appointed by presidential decree.  I say that there was this official handover process because those who replaced before him (sic), were temporarily replaced and acting in limited time.  I think we had not understood this well -- properly, so I think -- I would like to have it corrected.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, could you also slow, so that translation can come through in both two languages smoothly; that is, French and English?

	1630H
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now Mr. Kajelijeli, can you tell the Tribunal if you do recall who served in an interim capacity after you were removed? 
A.	There was a conseiller by the name of Ndisetse, Asiel. 
Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal to whom did you turn over communal properties when you were removed from office? 
A.	After the presidential decree was issued, I temporarily handed over to my assistant, and then this one in turn handed over to the conseiller, and after the process I talked about, the process of appointing a bourgmestre through the communal development committee, and after the presidential decree was issued -- so I did hand over to the bourgmestre Ndisetse, who later on handed over to the conseiller. 
Q.	And who was that assistant whom you handed over properties?
A.	His name is Semahane Felicien.
Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal what property you handed over to him when you were removed from office?  What communal properties did you hand over? 
A.	These included the communal accounts made of money, but there was also an accountant who was in charge of this, so those are the different services.  And then there were communal vehicles, and then there was the communal police with its equipment and materials, and he knew all the other property that the commune had and this included -- like plots, forest assets that are fixed assets, the commune's fixed assets like forests and plots of land; that is, in short, the communal property that I handed over. 
Q.	Now Mr. Kajelijeli, what -- could you describe the communal vehicle that you said you turned over in February of 1993 when you left office? 
A.	There was a red Toyota pickup, which belonged to the commune.  There was an ambulance for the health centre, and it was also this vehicle which belonged to the commune because the health centre was also run by the commune. 
Q.	Could you describe the pickup that you said you turned over at that time? 
A.	This was a new pickup, it was red with the names "Mukingo commune" written on it, and there are no other special signs or characteristics apart from its colour and the name of the commune which was written on both sides of the vehicle. 
Q.	After you turned over that vehicle in February of 1993, did you have access to that vehicle from that time on? 
A.	No. 
Q.	During the five years that you were bourgmestre, what contributions -- specific contributions did you make to the Mukingo commune during that time period, in terms of highlights? 
A.	You will excuse me.  There is something I would like to correct.  I played another role again.  I played another role after becoming bourgmestre in June 1994, when I became bourgmestre again, this is another -- having gained access to the vehicle.  I again had access to the vehicle when I became bourgmestre  again in June 1994.  I don't know if I have answered to your first question.  I don't know if I have understood your question properly. 
Q.	What I want to know is, between February of 1993 and the time that you were then re-elected in June of 1994, during that time period, did you have access to the communal vehicle of Mukingo?
A.	No, this could not have been possible, I could not have access to the communal vehicle because I did not hold any position at the commune level. 
Q.	Now during the five years -- during the five years that you were bourgmestre, can you tell the Tribunal what contribution you made, highlights of your term in office between 1988 and 1993? 
A.	I did a lot of things, but I will just mention the most important ones.  From 1988 to 1993, we constructed a communal office, this is in the area of administration, we constructed secteur offices for the eight secteurs; we constructed main roads in secteurs as well as in cellules.  As far as justice is concerned, we constructed a tribunal for Mukingo, we constructed a prosecutor's office, with the prosecutor representing the ministry of justice.  As in the area of communication, we had completed a post office with a telephone, to the extent that you could ring anywhere in the world, and people who had children outside the country would ring them and they could also receive or send money as well as mail from anywhere.  So there was incoming and outgoing mail services as well as telephone services.  

As far as the economy is concerned, we had a popular bank, which was a modern one and had been constructed by the commune.  We also had activities in forestry and husbandry.  We had an association that was carrying out modern husbandry, practices as well as disseminating improved breed.  

In the area of health, we had two hospitals, and the two hospitals had experienced doctors and had ambulances to help patients and mothers.  We also had nutritional centres to help with children, to help with good feeding for children, for babies and children, in order to help also mothers and parents in family planning area.  We also had centres for teaching, for carrying out literacy campaigns and dissemination.  We had also carried out some centralisation activities to the extent that the members of the population did not have to travel all the way to the commune office, the conseiller at the secteur level could solve problems in respect of cases in ensuring security as well as judicial matters.  We had a lot of development activities, for instance, every member of the population, about 50 percent of the population had access to electricity. 

As far as education is concerned, we had about 11 primary school centres.  We had two secondary schools.  Although these were constructed during the time I was bourgmestre, we had a university there which was also constructed during my time of office as bourgmestre.  So  we had a lot of projects and we had achieved a lot of these new projects.  But unfortunately, most of these projects were destroyed during the war, for instance, the post office had been destroyed, at least, according to what I have seen on TV, as well as in the cassettes.  But as far as the question you put to me, I think we had achieved a lot of development there and the population -- the people were happy and as well with the structures that had put me in place to collaborate with the members of the population.  
Thank you.
Q.	Now, drawing your attention, Mr. Kajelijeli, to June of 1994, when you assumed the position of bourgmestre for the second time, were you appointed or elected in June of 1994? 
A.	Thank you.  I think I had talked about this.  I said that after the political parties -- after multipartism, no bourgmestre was appointed.  There was no -- the bourgmestres were neither appointed nor put in place by presidential decrees.  Anyone who wanted to become a bourgmestre after the vacancy had been announced, you present yourself with others who are candidates and then the organs that I talked about, representing the population, would be the ones to elect the bourgmestres.  So it was not enough and these elections of the bourgmestres would be confirmed after the list of candidates, as well as the votes they got during the election would have been sent to the préfet and the préfet would send it to the minister for internal affairs and communal development and he would in turn take it to the cabinet, and then after the cabinet had approved the person who got the majority of the votes or the most of the votes, then his name would be -- the list would be sent to the president of the republic, and if the president found that this person was fit for the position, then he would say -- confirm that the election took place legally, and that is how I was elected.  This is a long procedure that had been decided upon by the government after multipartism became allowed in Rwanda in 1991, if I am not mistaken. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, how many candidates stood for the election including yourself in June of 1994? 
A.	We were seven candidates. 
Q.	Do you remember any of the names of any of the candidates? 
A.	I could mention myself.  There was me, Kajelijeli, if you wish; there was Semahane, Felicien; there was Niyoyita Jean Ndamasene, Maniragaba, Innocent; there was Ndakaza, I don't remember the other one. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
I am sorry, My Lord.  We would request for the spellings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell out, Interpreter, the names. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, Your Honour.  The first was Semahane.  I spell Semahane, S-E-M-A-H-A-N-E.  Niyoyita,
	N-I-Y-O-Y-I-T-A; Maniragaba, M-A-N-I-R-A-G-A-B-A.  The last was Ndakaza, N-D-A-K-A-Z-A. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, what was the name of the organ that elected you? 
A.	Thank you.  There were many organs representing the population, some of which I told you.  It was not only one organ. 
Q.	Can you then explain to the Tribunal the composition of the various organs that participated in your election? 
A.	Thank you.  There was the communal development committee; there is the technical committee; there is the heads of the cellules; there were religious leaders; there was also those in charge of the various departments; there were many because all structures that had -- the commune was represented and the population was represented by the heads of the cellules.  So all these together were the ones who would confirm someone's candidature, and then the préfet would seek to see if these people had voted him according to what they know about him, and then that person also carried out their responsibilities, then he would send the list of the candidates with votes, the corresponding votes to the minister of communal development and internal affairs, and then the minister would in turn look at each other's activities and then he would give the report to the cabinet.  

And then after the cabinet had made a decision on this, then the president would decide if that person could serve the population, and then he would confirm that that person has been legally elected.  And then after the presidential decree is issued, then the election results would be announced, and that means that the bourgmestre would be announced, the person who won the election would be announced by the bourgmestre. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  I think in listing the various people and institutions involved in the electoral process, he did mention communal development committees.  Does he mean that members of this committee participated in that electoral process as well as members of the technical committee?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I am going to get into the various -- but I am pausing because I am told that as long as that light is on in the French booth, I should remain silent, I am waiting until I get a proper signal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  I hope the signal is there because we would like to understand whether these people met together on one occasion to the electoral process. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, can you give the Tribunal the composition of this communal development committee, who were they composed of, how many members? We don't need the names of the people, just the number of people who comprised the communal development committee or council.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  He hasn't switched on his microphone, Your Honour. 
MR. HINDS:
Mr. Kajelijeli, switch on your microphone. 
THE WITNESS:
The communal development committee was composed of the commune conseillers, it was composed of the experts operating in the commune; it was composed of the members of the technical committee.  Those are actually the members of -- all these together, with the members of the commune development council. 
Q.	Now, how many conseillers were there who participated in the communal development committee?
A.	There were eight conseillers. 
Q.	And with respect to technical experts, how many? 
A.	The experts committee was made of 11 members. 
Q.	And the technical committee, the technical commission? 
A.	The technical committee is the same, actually. 
Q.	Now, did there -- did a political party play any role with respect to your election being part of the communal --
A.	The political parties -- normally, it is the political parties that should come first, because during this multipartism, they had the biggest say, or they should come first, the political party representatives, that is what I mean, they should be the ones to come first. 
Q.	Did they participate in your election process? 
A.	The political parties were represented; some political parties were represented because there are some parties that were not really represented -- well represented in the commune, but all the parties in the then government were there and were represented, and during the elections, these political parties were represented in the election process.
Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal what were the names of the representatives of political parties who participated in your election? 
A.	During that election, there was the MRND representative, whose name was Niyoyita, Jean Ndamasene; there was the MDR representative, his name was Bigirishaka Amiel, he was an MDR representative.  I'll spell Bigirishaka, B-I-G-I-R-I-S-H-A-K-A.  There was the PSD representative, his name was Kagano, Simone.  I'll spell Kagano, K-A-G-A-N-O.  There was the CDR representative, his name was Bambonye, B-A-M-B-O-N-Y-E.  There was the PL representative at the préfecture level, at the Ruhengeri préfecture is Sibomana, Rajah.  I spell Sibomana.  S-I-B-O-M-A-N-A.  These five political parties were represented in those elections. 
Q.	Now, can you tell the Tribunal -- I don't want you to give the names of these people, but how many heads of the cellules participated in your election, the number? 
A.	The number of people heading the cellules was 51. 
Q.	And when you said religious leaders, how many are religious leaders who participated in the election process? 
A.	I remember that three religions were represented, but I have difficulty remembering some of them -- some of the representatives. 
Q.	I don't want you to mention the names of these people, but do you recall the religious organisations who participated in your election process? 
A.	The religions that were represented were the Catholic religion, the Catholic church which had the majority of members in that area.  There was the Seventh Day Adventist church that was represented; then there is the Rwanda Episcopal church that was also represented, and we also had the Baptist church represented in those elections.  These four religious organisations were represented. 
Q.	And when you indicated that there were representatives of civil departments, what was the number of people representing civil departments who participated in your election process? 
A.	There was, unless I make the list because the heads of departments in the commune, I could say, we had directors of public and private institutions, we had the people in charge of the health centre. We had a person heading the population literacy centre.  We had project managers, managers of the projects who were active in the commune because they were collaborators at the communal level, and they also took part in the elections.  I do not know if I should mention the people heading these different structures.  I do not remember the people who were heading these different structures because they were many, but I remember at least the names of those structures, the organisations that they were heading. 
Q.	You don't have to give us the names of those people.  Mr. Kajelijeli, can you tell us whether or not this election and the various committees and individuals you have just described, did they vote at one time for the candidate, the seven candidates you testified about? 
A.	Yes, these elections took place in one day and the votes were counted that same day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, do you have any evidence confirming when the president notified the public of your nomination or your election of June 17, 1994? 
A.	At first, there was an announcement, an announcement was made twice, the first on the 17th of June 1994, and another announcement was made on the 18th of June 1994.  And then the week that followed, I received a presidential decree confirming the result of those elections. 
Q.	Now, where was that announcement made, the announcement you just testified about? 
A.	I heard it over the radio on two occasions. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we could do this two ways:  We can have a stipulation by the Prosecutor that there was an announcement of Mr. Kajelijeli's election on the 17th; if not, we would move a tape of the broadcast into evidence and play the tape.  But I don't really think there is an issue here, we could do it a simple way.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel for the Prosecution, what do you say to that?  Is that matter likely to be in dispute? 
MS. OJEMENI:
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, we have the announcement, according to the evidence of this witness, first 17th and then 18th. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	What are the dates that you heard the announcement on the radio?  Could you repeat for the Trial Chamber the dates that you heard the announcement on the radio? 
A.	I would like to ask the President of this Chamber that -- the elections were represented by the préfecture electoral authority, the dates involved were the 17th of June 1994 and the 18th June 1994. 
MR. HINDS:
Can I proceed, Your Honour? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Sorry.  The election took place on the 17th, is that what he is saying? 
MR. HINDS:
No, those are the dates when the broadcast was made after the president confirmed the results. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.  Go on, Counsel. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, who was the bourgmestre prior to you taking office in June of 1994? 
A.	It was the person who was appointed by the préfecture's authority, who was known as Semahane, Felicien.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He has already said that.
MR. HINDS:
Well, no.  We are dealing with different time periods, Your Honour.  This is after Harerimana died, the person who took over. Semahane is the fellow who was always --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he did say so previously, but you can have him --
MR. HINDS:
What we are doing is -- on the cassette when he was interviewed by representatives of the ICTR, a lot of this was said.  So it appears as if it is his testimony, but I had stopped and just listened to the tape.  So a lot of it came out on the tape, which is not being contradicted here, but I am trying to move, just touching on it and moving forward. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All right.  You may be right because it might have come from the tape, but because I have -- at least from my notes in substance, "Before my election, there was an assistant bourgmestre who took over from Felicien Semahane.  I do not know where he is now.  I left the refugee camp in 1996 in eastern Zaire", whatever.

Go on, Counsel.  We will see it is on record, we will be able to trace it.  So, what was your question?
MR. HINDS:
Well, I am now going -- I think he has already answered that it was Felicien Semahane whom he took over from in June. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, at that time in June of 1994, where were you living?  Where was your residence? 
A.	Thank you.  I had two residences, one in Mukingo commune, and the other one in Nkuli commune. 
Q.	At the time that you took over as bourgmestre in June of 1994, were you living or spending the night in any of those -- at any of those residences? 
A.	Because of the security reason, I used to spend more time in Nkuli and in Gisenyi, but that is from '92, '93.  I didn't stay in Mukingo a lot of the time because of very little security. 
Q.	I am directing your attention to the time when you took office in June of 1994.  Do you recall where you were spending your evenings? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.  That was the question he asked before.  It has been answered.  If my learned friend didn't get the answer he anticipated, I mean, it has been answered.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
The witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel is precising this one for June.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, that is correct, Your Honour.  I was trying to get the witness to focus at the time that he was re-elected in June, not prior to that.  And --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Although, of course, in June 1994 he had two residences, one at Mukingo commune and the other at Nkuli commune, so it was really during this period of time.  So the answer given by the witness could indeed have been asked and answered.
 MR. HINDS:
But he also said Gisenyi, so I just wanted to clarify -- get some clarification at what time did he in fact spend in Gisenyi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right, you can have that one clarified -- that aspect clarified.

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, can you inform the Tribunal, as to what time you were spending time in Gisenyi? 
A.	Every time there were attacks, I would go to Gisenyi and work in Mukingo commune and in Gisenyi here, but when the attacks were fewer, I would work in Mukingo and then sleep in Nkuli, but in June when I resumed commune work, I was residing in Nkuli. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, I would like to move to a new area which deals with your political party affiliations.  Can you tell the Tribunal when a multiparty system was introduced in Rwanda? 
A.	I don't recall the date very well, but I remember it was in June of 1991, that is when the cabinet approved the multipartism and those official parties that came out in the official government gazette, it was in 1991.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, do you now recall the names of the major political parties that existed at that time in June of 1991? 
A.	Those that came out in the official gazette, there was the MRND party, the MDR party, PSD party, those are the ones that I can remember; maybe the others were working on a provisional basis, but those three are the ones I remember that were officially recognised. 
Q.	Now prior to June of 1991, what was your political party affiliation? 
A.	Could you repeat the question please?
Q.	Prior to the advent of multiparty politics in Rwanda, that is prior to June of 1991, what was your political party affiliation? 
A.	I was a member of the MRND because it was a unique party and ruling party, and we were part of that administration, which meant that everybody in that administration was a member whether he wanted it or not. 
Q.	After the advent of multipartism in 1991, what was your political party affiliation? 
A.	I actually did not belong to any political party, although directives had been given that bourgmestres were not supposed to be members of any political party, I did not join any particular political party.  I was just there as an administrator without belonging to any particular political party. 
Q.	Who was the préfet in 1991? 
A.	The préfet in 1991 was Nzabagerageza, Charles.  Nzabagerageza, N-Z-A-B-A-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-A, Charles. 
Q.	Now, what was his political party affiliation if any, that is the préfet at that time? 
A.	At that time, even the préfet did not belong to any political party.  If I remember well, it could be verified, but I remember he didn't belong to any political party; he was simply the préfet. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, did you serve on any MRND committees at the préfecture or at the communal level? 
A.	I wish you could give me some specifications because when there was a unique party, everybody belonged to it, and therefore, when you belong to any committee, you would be identified with the party.  But I would say that I didn't belong to any committee, especially as I didn't belong to any political party. 
Q.	Well, I think you are correct, Mr. Kajelijeli, and I should have been more specific.  After 1991, after the advent of the multiparty system in Rwanda, did you ever serve on any communal -- MRND communal committees or on any préfectural committees of MRND?
A.	Thank you.  During the multiparty introduction, MRND elected structures up to the cellule level, to the extent that no single administrator, including the bourgmestre, would appear in any of those committees.  So you will understand that I didn't belong to any of those committees. 
Q.	During 1991 to the time that you left office in 1993, did you participate in recruiting members for the MRND? 
A.	It wasn't possible, I didn't do it because I didn't belong to the party and therefore, the party couldn't send me to recruit members when I did not belong to it. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, can you tell the Tribunal if you know the names of the leaders of the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture between 1991 and 1993, at the préfecture level, the commune level and the secteur level? 
A.	Thank you.  At préfectural level, the MRND had its own chairman known as -- whose name was Kasim Bizimungu.  At commune level, I could say -- I could talk about the Mukingo commune, the MRND chairman was Jean Ndamaseni Niyoyita.  At secteur level, I wouldn't know the names because afterwards, I couldn't follow well the names of those that were elected at secteur level for the MRND party, because as I said, I had left the administration, I couldn't follow the functioning of the MRND party, especially as in 1993.  I had left the administration and it became worse because I had to do something else, and I can therefore not indicate how the MRND functioned from the time I left the administration; only those who represented it could tell. 
Q.	After you left office in February of 1993, did you join the MRND? 
A.	I thought I had said it wouldn't be possible because the job I had started wouldn't allow me to join any political party, especially as party members -- various party members, be they traders, some of them were my own customers at the level of -- at business level.  I couldn't therefore have joined the MRND because my work would be impaired.  I do not know if the answer is clear. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel is talking about after you left office in February 1993, that is after you left being bourgmestre.  Is that correct?
MR. HINDS:
That is correct, after he left being bourgmestre.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What would you say to that?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, because I mean, I couldn't follow what was happening at the party level, especially as party followers, some of them were traders, businessmen and they were my customers, and if we had -- if I joined any political party, I wouldn't deal with so many people belonging to various political parties.  So I was just a private individual, and I didn't have time to be involved in party politics. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think that we are -- I think I am just finished with this area, and I think this may be an appropriate time to take an interlude. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, how do you gauge, halfway?
MR. HINDS:
I think I will be picking up speed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be better.  All right.  This in any case is the first day.  Yes.  All right.  

We will adjourn the proceedings to tomorrow at nine in the morning.  And Accused, you have made your solemn declaration, so take that into account.  

So until tomorrow at nine in the morning, these proceedings stand adjourned.  
	(Court adjourned at 1730H)
