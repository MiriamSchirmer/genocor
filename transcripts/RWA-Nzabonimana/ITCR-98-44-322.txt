FIDÉLE UWIZEYE
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, what I would say amakutiku (phonetic). 
A.	Good morning, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would ask that Exhibit D. NZ317 be provided to the witness, the Kinyarwandan.  This is a transcript of an interview in early June 1994 broadcast on Radio Rwanda between Gaspard Rwakana, the journalist, ***************************, the *************************** commune and the person identified as Fidéle Uwizeye, the préfet of Gitarama.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Mr. Uwizeye, I am going to bring you the Kinyarwandan -- have you brought the Kinyarwandan transcript, while we follow in English and French.  I am going to ask you some questions about this event, but before I do that I want to ask you if you understand that testimonies you give today is under oath?  Do you realise that?  So my question to you, Mr. Uwizeye, is whether you understand that the testimony you are giving today in this Court is under oath?  Do you understand that? 
A.	I don't think that question is pertinent.  I took -- made a solemn declaration.  I am an adult and I know the contents of solemn declarations.  Of course, I respect the oath I took.  I don't know what you are thinking of. 
Q.	Well, we are reaching a very sensitive area of your examination and I want to make a very clear record that:  One, you are under oath and you realise that?  And secondly, do you understand that if you are to give false testimony before this Tribunal, you could be subject to penalties including a prosecution here in Arusha for the giving of false testimony?  Do you understand that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry; I am objecting to this question, Your Honour.  This is something for the Court to address to the witness.  It is inappropriate for Mr. Robinson to phrase his question in that manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Robinson, I think that that should be assumed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, fine.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Uwizeye, I want to ask you about this day in which it is alleged that you were interviewed by Gaspard Rwakana along with the *********************************commune, and I have the tape and I am prepared to play portions of it or the whole thing, if necessary, so that there is no doubt about what is being presented to you and what your answers are.  And, again, I consider this to be a very important part of your testimony here and a very important ingredient in the credibility of your evidence.  

Now, looking at page 2 of both the French, the English and the Kinyarwandan, it begins with the journalist, Gaspard Rwakana, saying that:  

"Good day, Rwanda.  You know that at this moment security has been disrupted in certain regions whereby the Inkotanyi have tried to infiltrate many places including Gitarama" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could you slow down please?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	-- "as part of a programme that we have prepared to that effect, we are with the préfet of Gitarama préfecture, Fidéle Uwizeye, and **********************************commune where Gitarama is located."  

Now, would you agree that Gaspard Rwakana was acquainted with you; true? 
A.	He knew me and I knew him. 
Q.	And so he went on to say that you were going to discuss the security situation in Gitarama and deliver a message to the people of Gitarama who had taken refuge in the outskirts of the town so that they will understand what the situation looks like, and so they can come back to Gitarama.  And he first gave the floor to the bourgmestre of Gitarama to tell us about the general situation in the commune.  And there upon, **************************spoke, and to paraphrase -- summarise essentially what he said, he said that people had been pleased with the government, the Abatabazi government, which they supported and they hoped that they would be able to save the country.  And he went on to speak of some historical events concerning the monarchy and the social revolution and said that we must mobilise all our forces, what we call power in our jargon, in order to fight the Inkotanyi, and that we are never going to let the Inkotanyi take our commune.  And then he went on to say that it was clear that the Rwandan government had put up an end to the upheavals prevailing among the people, but that whenever the Inkotanyi reaches a region, the upheavals and killings resumed.  And he urged the Inkotanyi to stop persecuting innocent civilians.  And he said that all the inhabitants of the communes, from the youngest to the oldest, support them and be ready to go to the front and determined to win the war.  At that point, the journalist Gaspard Rwakana thanked him, and I said that "I would like to request the préfet, who perhaps, knows the general situation in Gitarama préfecture to tell us briefly about the situation."  And then the speaker identified as Fidéle Uwizeye, the préfet of Gitarama thanked him and said the following:  "I would say that generally the security has not been much disrupted here in Gitarama.  I would like to tell our listeners that it is the Inyenzi/Inkotanyi, who are trying to spread rumours among the people claiming they have taken over Rutobwe commune.  However, I was in that commune yesterday.  Moreover, I had a discussion with the bourgmestre.  The people of that commune are ready to support other communes in order to hunt down the Inkotanyi wherever they are."  

Now, I am going to stop here for a second and I am going to ask you if you were, in fact, in Rutobwe commune in early 1994? 
A.	Counsel, I should like to tell you that I did go to Rutobwe on the dates I have stipulated in my various statements and testimony.  I went to Rutobwe to help the bourgmestre.  He told me that he'd been beaten by Minister Callixte under the pretext that he locked up people who'd attacked some Tutsis living near the communal offices.  So that visit was sooner -- earlier than the one alleged in the month of June.  And you recall that it is one of the things I accused Callixte of when I told Kambanda that some of his ministers were indulging in acts that were sabotaging efforts to stop the programme of killing the Tutsis.  

When you say that I went to Rutobwe at the beginning of the month of June to assess the effect of the Inkotanyi war in that commune, I (inaudible) that is not based.  It is baseless.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Now, continuing to what was said by the individual identified as the préfet of Gitarama: 

"In this regard, I would like to inform you that we have heard about the presence of Inkotanyi in the Ntongwe commune.  After crossing the Rwabusoro bridge, they passed through the Propaya (phonetic) swamp on the way from Muyara commune and our soldiers pushed them back openly.  They wanted to go to Gasoro, but they were pushed back and they returned to Murinja, where they spent two or three days.  They fled from our paracommando battalion that arrived in the Ntongwe commune office in Kinazi.  They sneaked in at night and fired some shots in the air.  When people heard those gunshots, they fled saying that the Inkotanyi had attacked and that the commune had fallen et cetera.  You can see, therefore, that they used a great deal of ruse.  They used the Muhabura radio station saying we have taken control of some -- such communes, and the foreign radio stations supporting them spread those rumours and listeners of those radio stations said that the situation is critical."  

I want to stop here, Mr. Uwizeye, and ask you, whether or not, in early June you were aware that the RPF had come to the Ntongwe commune by crossing the Rwabusoro bridge through the Muyara commune and had been pushed back to Murinja by a paracommando battalion?  Did you have that information in late May or early June 1994? 
A.	That sort of information is only available to soldiers, the people on -- at the battle fronts.  Anyone else who wasn't -- was not at the battle front, couldn't know those things.  Unless someone from the battle front reported to them.  As far as I am concerned, I did not possess such information.  I, myself, Fidéle, was not in contact with unit commanders fighting in those places.  I was not or wasn't a soldier, so if you ask me whether I've heard such information, well, I can't say so, but I know that at Rwabusoro bridge, there was fighting.  But that is something everyone knew.  And then the two days that followed -- in the following -- two days later, elements of the defeated army arrived in Ruhango, which is a town not far from Gitarama and they came to loot and pillage and killed people.  And I had to go to Ruhango, and when I arrived there, I had a violent discussion with the commanding officers present, and who said that our préfecture hid accomplices.  They said every household hid an Inkotanyi and the people of Gitarama did not help them to carry their guns or their ammunition, and every time they saw a soldier, they hid him.  That the population did not support the army, and the local commander said, that is unfortunate, because in other préfectures the soldiers were well received by locals who sheltered them, fed them, showed them the way and helped them carry their equipment, but that it was the other way round in our préfecture.  And I said that if they blame the population for not hosting them, not helping them, it was because the soldiers were shooting the local inhabitants.  I gave the example of Ruhango that had been looted.  The shops had been broken into and looted, and under such conditions, local citizens could not hold the army in esteem.  So the only information I had regarding Rwabusoro is in that context, but as regards the various fighting, skirmishes, or fighting -- the battle that took place in various places, this information was not accessible to the préfet even if he could have used it to calm the population, but the colonel you referred to Rutacumba (phonetic), is someone who insulted me in Ruhango.  He isn't someone we could have talked to and obtain information from -- that would help in any way to calm the citizenry.  So it wasn't, under the circumstances you've described, that I went to Ruhango.  I did go to Tambwe in April because I had an appointment -- I had to meet the bourgmestre, who began killing Tutsis.  But when I arrived, he wasn't available.  I tried to contact him, but he didn't want to come to me.  So I organised a meeting with local citizens in his absence and I ordered that the vehicles he'd ceased be returned to their owners.  And the bourgmestre, he wasn't a good man.  He was a member of the CDR.  The only thing he knew was how to kill people.  That's all I can say about Ntongwe and my visit there.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Uwizeye.  

Now, further down in this interview, the radio broadcaster speaks again and addressed the question:  

"In these hard days, you go to several communes and various secteurs, you meet with the people and discussed with them, what message do you convey to them?  And then the person identified as 
Fidéle Uwizeye said the following, 'The message I gave to the population is to support Rwandan armed forces in the following manner:

First, avoid rumours that may lead them astray."  And I am going to paraphrase by saying that you encouraged people not to flee when Inkotanyi frightened them by shooting in the air.  

And then in the next paragraph, he said:  

"I would like to say that here in Gitarama; people are starting to follow this advice.  If you go, for instance, to Nyamabuye commune, you would see that nobody has moved.  Those who had left, for instance, Gahogo secteur, for the neighbouring secteur, for Gitarama or for Ruli secteurs, for those who had gone a bit further to Meru, have all returned.  Even those who were not in their houses are staying in their neighbours.  That is why the Inkotanyi no longer have any opening and they have failed to take Gitarama town, and indeed, the population have understood the strategy to be adopted and is determined to support soldiers by helping them carry their effects by guiding them and helping them fight this war.  That is what the situation looks like."  

And he went on -- Fidéle Uwizeye went on to say that:  

"This is now a war in which we must unite.  This is a war waged by valiant men and people who understand the situation as it is.  That is why in our messages we often asked the population not to be afraid of these gunshots.  For instance, you hear in Gihuma, an explosion, whose echo reaches here and the cowards flee immediately.  But you have seen up to now that everywhere around there's people lived in their houses."  

Then the second message given was to avoid rumours spread by people who, we would say, were on the payroll of the Inkotanyi or are cowards.  

And you go on to say that in Gikomero, in Mushubati commune, someone played with his gun, fired it in the air and near a quarter of the population of the secteur fled.  And you said that the people of Gitarama préfecture should not be frightened by such things and such stories make me laugh.  I would urge them to contain the enemy by seeking true information; by being perceptive and joining hands.  

And then the radio broadcaster, the journalist asked, "You, as the préfecture authority, you meet with senior officials.  The youth, and foremost, of a problem they are facing, especially at the roadblocks; namely lack of equipment.  Since you are in contact with senior officials, what is the status of this issue?"  And the person identified as Fidéle Uwizeye said, "We know that talking about equipment, the youths are referring to firearms.  But we know that in civil defence, firearms are not the only things used, for the main point is that the individual responsibility of each reasoning person.  The main point is that we have to have a common strategy to act."  And then you go on to say -- the person goes on to say, "Furthermore, we have put several strategies in place, including roadblocks.  We have noted that even roadblocks manned by young people armed with clubs, machetes; in short, traditional weapons, have fulfilled their mission.  Those manning most roadblocks, intercept the real Inkotanyi, armed with rifles, disarm them and hand them over to authorities.  There are many such cases which we have witnessed.  These are not people intercepted for not having identity cards.  No, that is not it.  Hardened Inkotanyi who have been fighting since 1990, have often been arrested at roadblocks manned by young people not armed with rifles.  You can see, therefore, one can use several strategies and act efficiently."  And the person known as Fidéle Uwizeye said that, "I would, however, like to say that the government has not spared any effort.  We have received a large number of firearms, so much so that in some communes, some youths have received some of them.  We also have some refugees holding firearms and we have included them in the civil defence system.  Let us take, for instance Runda commune, where not less than 150 rifles are used.  There is a channel through which firearms reach us and their number is growing.  The government has plans to purchase firearms even if it does not have the resources.  It has already given us some weapons which we have distributed amongst certain communes.  We hope that the quantity of weapons will increase in the days ahead for we know that some orders have been made.  

As I told you, these rifles are not enough by themselves.  The main point is to have a thinking head.  Therefore, we are inculcating into these youths the sense of protecting the citizenry."  
Then is the question from the journalist.  Before asking you to tell us what the bourgmestre -- what you are expecting from the bourgmestres and from the people.  He asked the ***************************** commune to give a word about the traders -- to the traders.  And the ****************************** commune then speaks about his advice to the traders, and traders are T-R-A-D-E-R-S, persons who were doing business.  

And then finally, he -- the journalist goes and turns to the préfet and asked the préfet of Gitarama préfecture to give a message to the population and his subordinates, the bourgmestres, conseillers and the responsables of the cellules, and the préfet said that as a matter of priority, I should like to urge the authorities to be very close to the people under them, to help them advise and unite them.  There is a word we used in French, incandremo (phonetic), it is the authorities who are responsible for supervision.  And then the préfet goes on to say that it is necessary for those responsible to be close to the population in good times and hard times.  In this war time, I will not tolerate any person in the category I have mentioned who is among the first to flee.  We cannot tolerate such conduct.  As far as I am concerned, I will submit a report to the minister of interior and community development about any official under me who is found to have taken flight.  I know that the minister of interior and communal development is worried about such cases wherever they occurred and I will, therefore, help him in the struggle so that no leader in our préfecture deceives the minister or the préfet or any Rwandan who loves foresight and truth.  And then went on to again urge the members of the authority to become closer to the population.  

And then the journalist asked what was the message for the population, and the person identified as Fidéle Uwizeye asked them to follow the instructions, to let the officials know their desires and work together.  And then the journalist ends by thanking the préfet of Gitarama préfecture, Fidéle Uwizeye, and the ****************************commune,***********************************.  

Now, are you the person who made the statement attributed to Fidéle Uwizeye in this broadcast? 
A.	That is possible.  When I testified in this Tribunal last year, there was a tape played which I followed and actually I was initially surprised because it was the first time I was listening to that tape and the quality of the sound was not good, such that I was unable to recognise that interview.  But when I came to testify in this trial, counsel for the Prosecution played another sound recording for me and the quality of this one seemed to be better than the one listened to last year.  And I believe I was able to recognise my voice even though it may be some form of editing, but I was able to remember or recognise my voice.  The problem is that I no longer remember the date when that interview took place and under what circumstances and in which place.  

I also noticed that there is a wide gamut of issues addressed in that interview.  Some of the things, indeed, occurred.  Others are not proven.  If I put it this way it is because when I left Gitarama town -- and I think that Rwakana could not have contacted me elsewhere than in Gitarama town.  When I left Gitarama town, I went to Bulinga, Buramba and Rwakana never came to that place.  

However, generally, the utterances in the document tend to calm down the members of the population.  There is no threat contained therein.  At no point in that document do I see any reference to inciting the population to kill one another.  So there is nothing in that document which scares me.  That is why I am saying that it may be my voice.  I don't want to challenge that, please do understand me, but I am unable to recall the date and circumstances under which that interview was conducted.  I am unable to remember the political or psychological context.  However, I am ready to tell you that I do recognise that the voice which I heard in that recording is, indeed, mine. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Uwizeye.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have asked that a document be distributed which is a pleading on the 8th of May 2006, filed in the Casimir Bizimungu case and it was entitled: "Prosecutor's response to 
Prosper Mugareneza's application for a writ of mandamus or other appropriate relief."  And in this document, the Prosecutor set forth the background of the events in which Mr. Uwizeye had testified in Casimir Bizimungu's case, and there had been some correspondence between the parties as to whether or not a voice exemplary should be taken from Mr. Uwizeye to determine whether it was, in fact, his voice, and it indicates also that another witness had been recalled and testified that the voice on the tape was that of Mr. Uwizeye.  And in paragraph six, it is indicated that the Prosecutor did not contest this testimony as he had previously admitted by letter to Mr. Justin Mugenzi that the voice in the tape recording was that of Mr. Fidéle Uwizeye.  

And then in paragraph eight, it is indicated that the Prosecutor -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if counsel could slow down please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Sorry.  

In paragraph eight, it is indicated that on or about the 8th of August 2005, the Prosecutor had admitted that the voice in the audio tape recording in question was actually that of Mr. Fidéle Uwizeye and that the words attributed to him were, in fact, uttered by him.  And I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ328.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Admitted.
(Exhibit D. NZ328 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Uwizeye, just to give you a little bit more information that we had, the bourgmestre had stated that the circumstances of this broadcast involved him responding to a disturbance at a hill -- Gitarama hill, as he described it, where members of the population had found RPF uniforms in the bushes, and that the members of the population were agitated, saying that the Tutsis in the area were getting ready to join the Inkotanyi and threatening to go and hunt down and kill the Tutsis and address the people who were hiding the Tutsis in that area.  And he said that he became so concerned about this matter that he called the préfet for assistance.  And that the préfet, you, arrived at that location and tried to calm the members of the population, but that it was very difficult to do that and that the members of the population were threatening both the bourgmestre and yourself, the préfet.  And that at that time the journalist, Mr. Rwakana, arrived.  And according to the***************, it was decided that the best way to try to get out of that situation was to give an interview to the journalist in which it was stated that to support the interim government, support the army, and to demonstrate that both you and the ***************were not accomplices.  And the bourgmestre went on to say that he was not proud of what had been said in this interview, but that it was necessary under the circumstances.  And he affirmed again that you were definitely present on that occasion and that it was you who made the statements attributed to you.  

Now, does any of that refresh your memory so that you are able to recall the circumstances under which you gave this interview? 
A.	To be honest with you, Counsel, I was unable to follow what you are telling me because it was news to me; and you say that it is information you got from the****************.  

Now when you refer to Gitarama hill, for instance, I know not of any hill bearing that name.  When you kept on reading your document, actually, I wanted to find out from you whether the ****************had reported to me.  I think you explained that he had called me over and I had gone to see him.  And you also referred to the Inkotanyi.  I don't know whether you mean that there was a recruitment of new Inkotanyi in Gitarama town during the war, who was -- or, were carrying out the recruitment.  Because that is a problem I have right now.  It is necessary to have leaders to do that.  Where were the Inkotanyi at that time?  Because all what I know about the Inkotanyi in Gitarama town before I left that town, all what had happened in the town of Gitarama itself -- and I am specifying this because you referred to the hill.  Perhaps it is the hill or ****************commune.  So what I can say is that before I left Gitarama town, that is 2nd of June 1994, prior to that date, the date when I left Gitarama town, all that I know is that the Inkotanyis came from the south of Gitarama préfecture, went up through Ruhango and Kirengere and then they passed through the Rugera/Mugushi valley, then going up subsequently towards Kabgayi.  And when they arrived at the Saint Kabwa Institute (phonetic), they carried out raids to free Tutsi refugees who were at Kabgayi.  And when we started registering them, we had already registered as many as 40,000, but we discontinued the exercise without having registered all the refugees based there.  And I remember that at that time it was difficult for us to provide foodstuff to all of them, and the commission which had been set up was unable to do its work.  That raid is the lone Interahamwe operation that I know of and which was carried out in Gitarama.  So they organised that raid in order to rescue the refugees based at Kabgayi and to move them towards the south of the préfecture, and we even subsequently learnt that the refugees had been taken to the Bugesera.  So that is the lone operation carried out which I know of before I left Gitarama town.  There was no other fighting.  And it was after that operation that I left the town to go to the Buramba health centre.  

If you carry out in-depth investigations you will realise that Gitarama fell very late in the day.  I don't even know whether there was any real fighting in Gitarama town.  Even though I was not present, I never received information about any fighting which took place in Gitarama town.  Gitarama fell without any resistance whatsoever put up by the army.  But what I find positive in the préfet's statement is that they were calling on members of the population not to be afraid and to refrain from acts of violence, and that is what I appreciate in the utterance ascribed to the préfet.  Now if they say they should not be afraid, it is because fear is one of the aggravating factors of acts of violence.  When members of the population felt, for instance, that the Inkotanyis were coming and disemboweling pregnant women, members of the population were upset and angry and they were ready to attack any Tutsi who had remained in hiding.  So that was caused by the atmosphere of great fear which came following the utterances and rumours about acts of barbarism committed by the Inkotanyi.  

But as I have already told you, Counsel, I appreciate your approach and attitude and I must acknowledge, once again, that after listening to the recording which the Prosecutor played for me, I was able to hear a voice which I am ready to recognise as being mine.  But even though the utterances were not negative, I don't know whether all those utterances were pronounced by me, and I must also add that I no longer remember the circumstances under which the interview took place.  

Now, when I am being told that the interview took place at a location where Inkotanyis had been arrested in the process of handing over uniforms to members of the population and teaching them techniques of combat, then I am saying that if such were the case, I could not have forgotten it.  I must also say that the bourgmestre does not explain what, indeed, happened.  He talks about the presence of uniforms; he talks about disturbances, but he doesn't really explain what had happened.  Were members of the population killing the Inkotanyi who had been arrested?  I think there is something which the bourgmestre did not explain vividly, and I would be curious to get specific information about that fact because it would be news to me and it would be of use to me.  Otherwise, I am ready to repeat to you what I've just said.  I must acknowledge that when I testified here; when you put various elements to me, I learnt quite a few things.  I learnt -- it's also useful to me in my capacity as someone who loves Rwanda and who would like to know the truth about what happened.  

This Tribunal is a Tribunal I would refer to as special.  In our country, the Gacaca proceedings are open.  Anyone can intervene.  What is important is that the Judges assess all what has been said to draw their conclusions and make their determination.  But what I find positive is that, thanks to the work of this Tribunal, the entire international community can know the truth and Rwandans can at last know the truth.  Hutu, Tutsi and Twa alike, can all know the truth about what happened, and that would help towards reconciliation amongst Rwandan people.  Accordingly, I am quite delighted to appear in this Tribunal because I learnt quite a few things.  And I must tell you that once I return to Rwanda, I will personally conduct my enquiries to gather information concerning the events you just informed me.  Please bear with me for having dwelt on this at length.  It is because the information was quite new and interesting.  Thank you.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, can you tell us what was your purpose when you spoke about the roadblocks armed 
	with -- manned by young people armed with traditional weapons who were intercepting Inkotanyi?  And when you said that you hoped that the quality of firearms possessed by people at the roadblocks will increase, what was your purpose in saying those things? 
A.	I think that is military resistance, but it would be necessary to check whether on the tape there is only one person speaking.  You are asking me, "What do you mean when you talked about roadblocks and the weapons at those roadblocks?"  Perhaps you would want to ask me why all of a sudden you talked about weapons and roadblocks, whereas before you were against the setting of such roadblocks.  I don't know whether that is the question you wanted to put to me because I don't quite understand what you are saying. 
Q.	That will be good if you could answer that question, yes.  
A.	But when someone tells you he doesn't quite understand your question, and you say it would be better for you to answer, are you being fair?  
Q.	Actually, I thought you would ask yourself the question, and I was basically saying that was a good question and perhaps you should answer it.  So I will ask the question.  Why was it that if you had been against roadblocks earlier, that you are now encouraging people to have weapons at these roadblocks and to intercept the Inkotanyi, were changed? 
A.	I would like to answer that question.  Concerning roadblocks, from the military point of view, I think you were referring to the military standpoint.  Whenever there is war -- wherever there is a war, it is necessary to set up roadblocks and barriers.  Now the question is to know who will man the roadblocks.  The roadblocks have to be manned by soldiers and the roadblocks ought to serve solely military purposes and military activities.  

Now in Rwanda in the month of April, at least in the area I was familiar with, at those roadblocks people were checking identity cards in order to kill Tutsis.  And in all my speeches and utterances, when Colonels Ndindiliyimana and Rusatira came to Gitarama and I met them at the door, I overheard their discussions.  They also said that the roadblocks were not helping the fighting, they were not helping military action.  In fact, they were thwarting military effectiveness and efficacy and they did not understand why the Interahamwe would come and meddle into military matters; that the Interahamwe were actually causing disorder and impeding the conduct of military action.  So I agree that the roadblocks had to be set up.  But they had to be manned by soldiers, which is what I fought against.  I fought against Interahamwe manned roadblocks.

THE WITNESS: (continuing)
In less than three months they killed more than one million people, so what I can say is that, you know, we are actually saying the same thing.  I agree that roadblocks were set up, granted, but they have to be set up within the military context.  They should not been manned by Interahamwe. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, in this passage I read to you, you were saying that, speaking of roadblocks manned by young people armed in -- with traditional weapons, and saying that those roadblocks were useful to catch hardened Inkotanyi, and that firearms had already been distributed to some of the youth, and that you were hoping that the quantity of weapons would increase -- so you weren't speaking here of military roadblocks, you were speaking of roadblocks manned by youth, and you were encouraging the government to provide youths with firearms.  Why did you say those things? 
A.	You can rely on these words.  That's not going to cause third world war.  I don't have any problem with that.  Concerning those utterances, I don't see why you have any issue with them.  It depends on what the objective was when the roadblocks were set up.  I told you that when roadblocks are set up in connection with military action, I have no issue with that.  Besides, I have told you that the speech may actually be a combination of utterances from various people.  You need to check that.  But when you hang on to my very words in that connection, I'm not referring to any Tutsi.  Nowhere do I make reference to any Tutsi.  I refer to the Inkotanyi, and this is in military framework.  The Inkotanyi were combatants, people fighting against the Rwandan army.  

So, if we place ourselves in the military situation, you will understand that soldiers of Habyarimana, or the former government, had the mission to fight the Inkotanyi.  And when I say Inkotanyi, I mean RPF combatants.  But when there are excesses and you go and take it out on innocent civilians, that is something I stand against. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Uwizeye.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have the actual recording.  I didn't want to take the Chamber's time to listen to it because it's in Kinyarwanda and it wouldn't mean much to you.  But I would like to offer it as Exhibit 317D so that it can be in evidence.  And to the extent that the Trial Chamber wishes to listen to it to verify that the same voice is speaking, and for other purposes, it's available.  So I would ask that this recording be received as Exhibit D. NZ317D.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Perhaps I could offer a suggestion.  I'm not opposing the application, but since we have the transcripts in evidence, why don't we just make the recording part of that exhibit?  It's a Prosecution exhibit, and we have the three transcripts, I believe, in Kinyarwanda, French and English, and we can just add the tape to that so they all -- they'll all be together. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  That was, actually, exactly what I was doing.  The transcripts are Exhibit D. NZ317A, B and C, so I'm making this 317D. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, can that be done administratively?  
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The order is made accordingly.  It's admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ317D admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, just a last thing about this tape and then we're going to move on.  I just want to suggest to you that, at least from my perspective, I want to put it to you that during these events which were very difficult, I think that you behaved well and that you saved many people, but I think that it was also necessary during these difficult events for people like yourself to walk on eggs, to use the words that you used in your letter to the lawyer for Ndindabahizi; and it was necessary during these hard times for people like you to essentially keep one foot in each camp so that you were able to accomplish good things that you were trying to accomplish and save people but, at the same time, not be, yourself, killed.  

And I am suggesting to you that your remarks on this tape were, in fact, part of your strategy for how you survived during these difficult times, and that you did say the things that are attributed to you, and that you said them so that you could continue to survive at this time and continue to also exercise the authority of the office of the préfet that you were exercising.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	What I can say is that you've drawn your conclusion, sir.  You are expressing your opinions concerning the recording, concerning what I said.  Such is your conclusion.  I am not going to say that it is 100 per cent true, but I have no issue with the conclusion you've drawn.  We are not completely on the same wavelength about that, but I respect your conclusion.  To me, it is sound, it is a sound analysis.  I don't have any comments to make.  It's a sound analysis. 

However, personally, concerning the way you have described things when you talk about having one foot in one camp and another foot in another camp, or sitting on the fence, there's something I'm going to say.  I think you need to look at people's deeds first.  When you are privileged to have information and you want to know someone's personality -- you see, I like analysing things, and if I realise that someone is not sharing my opinion, then I prefer keeping my distance from that person and going my way.  That is why when you look at my deeds in Gitarama, there are many things which I did there which were not brought to the knowledge of the government or the ministers.  I know that from way back when they had been opposed to me.  I even told you that even the finance minister told me that they had wanted to fire me as early as April, that I was impeding military action, preventing soldiers in their bid to fight the Inkotanyi.  But that was not my opinion.  For me, the priority was to save and rescue Tutsis from death.  For me, the Tutsis were not the Inkotanyi.  Perhaps they were members of the party of the Inkotanyi, perhaps family members of theirs were in the RPF, but it does not mean that they were all Inkotanyi.  Personally, I lost lots of family members.  

When you see others dying or killing, you are not happy.  So it was a military war.  It was an armed conflict which started in 1990.  It was not a civil war.  Civilians had nothing to do with it.  So the genocidaires planned that war to kill civilians.  Those people led members of the population into killing, whereas, their interest was to remain in power.  They put members of the population against one another, which is sad.  Any government worthy of its name is a government for the people.  It is not a government which comes to repress members of the population.  Today we have a policy of good governance.  Come to Rwanda and you will see for yourself.  

If we were lucky in that people had understood the problems in 1990 and they had accorded priority to the overriding interests of members of the population, then what happened would not have happened.  So it's my fervent wish that everyone, with hindsight, think about his role and, if need be, beg for the forgiveness from the good Lord.  

Mr. Robinson, may I enjoin you to play a proper role towards wiping the tears of all the Rwandans, be it those who lost family members of theirs or those who indulged in shameful deeds.  That genocide was very open and overt.  Everyone could see that killings were taking place in broad daylight and in the open.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please control yourself and just respond to the questions that are put to you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, with respect to the situation in Rwanda in 1994, as a préfet, you were responsible for the bourgmestres, correct? 
A.	Agreed. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, if the witness could be shown the contents of tab 98.  This is from the Prosecution exhibits.  It's a document entitled, "The organisation and function of the préfecture from the codes of Rwanda."  And I'd like the witness to be shown this document so that we can admit it into evidence.  

I'm wondering from Mr. Issa whether this is a document that was brought up from the other courtroom or not.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, what has been provided to you is a copy of the law on organisation of the préfecture, and I would like to have you direct your attention to articles 15 and 16 of that law.  And I'll ask you ask you whether or not it's correct that under the law, the préfet exercises authority over the bourgmestres and has a general power of supervision over the acts of communal authorities, and in times of disorder, the préfet can even suspend the orders of superiors in order to administer the préfecture.  Is that correct? 
A.	Counsel Robinson, this is a law -- I don't know if there was another law after, but this is the decree of 1975.  When things were changing in Rwanda from single-party politics to multiparty politics, all these decrees, all these laws, were modified.  I think this was the law in force before I was préfet.  Once I was préfet, this law no longer existed.  The préfet could not suspend the prosecutor.  And regarding communal finances mentioned in article 14, to control the communal treasury, that is contrary to what you showed me -- or to what you alleged.  You alleged that I had influence or impact -- impacted the communal treasurer.  The communal accountant was a civil servant in the ministry of finance.  I had no control over him.  
Q.	Okay.  
A.	For example, I couldn't suspend the person in charge of security.  It is written here, but what -- the situation, in fact, was quite different.  The préfets who were appointed represented their political party.  They had been elected within their political party.  So sometimes they were more powerful than you think, because they represented their political party.  Instead of going to the préfet, they would go to the party from which it come.  

I hold you in esteem because you understand me.  You give me the opportunity to speak.  

But sometimes there were ignorant people within the administration.  I know one of you asked me why was I préfet when I'd never studied administration.  There were unqualified people at various jobs.  There were some useless people.  But we were in bad times.  But look at the politics of the thing, because it's politics that started the war, not administration.  An Interahamwe could take the vehicle of a minister, for example.  I don't know if you see how things were.  Even a colonel could have his car confiscated. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Uwizeye.  I think that's, actually, the point I'm trying to make at the end of all this.  So, let me try to combine a lot of things into one, and that is this:  You have told us that some eight out of the 
	17 bourgmestres were participants in the killings during the time that you were préfet.  And I'm suggesting that, as the préfet, although you had the responsibility over the bourgmestres, during the genocide, you did not have the material ability to prevent or punish the crimes of the bourgmestres or of other people under your command, so to speak, because of the total lack of authority that had broken down in Rwanda at that time.  Do you agree?  
A.	But I had to report to my hierarchical superiors, which is why I asked to see Kambanda, not once, and he refused to receive me.  I went to the house where he was staying, I knocked on the door, and the private assistant -- personal assistant told me Kambanda did not want to see me.  A few days later I went back, and he again refused to see me.  And I wanted to report to him on a very important point, something that occurred in Murama, where the bourgmestre himself committed an offence.  He lined people up in the open and then opened fire on them with his R4.  And when I went to see Kambanda, he refused to see me and even insulted me.  He told me not to come back, he had nothing to talk of with me.  What could I have done?  I tried.  I tried, but I failed.  I was completely alone.  I was working entirely on my own, and I tried to solve what I could hope to solve.  
Q.	And can we agree that the prosecutors were not working, the judiciary was not working, and that it was impossible for you, as préfet, to punish any of the people who were committing the crimes there under your command?  
A.	Even if the prosecutor was no longer there and it was only the deputy who, in fact, is working today at the office of the attorney general in Kigali, you can put the question to him.  I contacted him -- and this was mentioned in the Gacaca courts.  So I was saying at one point I asked him to arrest the hooligans who were committing acts of banditry in the town.  And when he told me he couldn't do anything in the absence of the prosecutor, I told him, but he was a deputy.  He told me that he had no security forces at his disposal, no policemen, no gendarme.  

I think yesterday I spoke of an attack at an old man named Désiré.  I used the communal policemen.  I arrested the people responsible for that attack, and we put them in the Gitarama lock-up for five days.  But then the soldiers came and freed him, released him, and they told me I couldn't lock up someone who is fighting for the country.  

I told you there was a bourgmestre in Mugina -- a bourgmestre form Mugina who had arrested five people who had undertaken an attack in Mugina.  We took them to the local commander, who put them in the lock-up, but they were released three days later.  You see, things came above -- the movement was from above, and that's what handicapped efforts at ground level.  I don't know what the purpose was, exactly, but I'd say that it was to facilitate the killing, because they impeded our efforts every step of the way.  And that's why things went sour in Gitarama, whereas we'd never dreamt -- or, in any case, didn't hope for any such tragedy in our préfecture. 
Q.	Well, in any event, Mr. Uwizeye, I think we can agree that as the préfet, you had the duty to punish the bourgmestres who were committing crimes, and you were unable to punish them, correct? 
A.	I wanted those people to be punished, but it wasn't possible, which is what I would call a failure.  From the point of view of public administration, it was a failure.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, turning to the MDR party, I understand you were a member of the secretariat of the MDR party in Gitarama préfecture; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And we can also agree, could we not, that among those who committed crimes were youth of the MDR party? 
A.	Yes, but unless you allow me to give some more details -- but if you don't need them, then we can move on.  Do you -- might I develop further, or do you want me to answer by yes or no, your questions?  
Q.	I think for this point you don't need to develop it further, because my next question is, I think, something we can agree on.  And that is, that as a leader of the MDR, the party itself did not have the ability to punish its youth at that time in those chaotic conditions.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	But where were the party leaders?  Where was the chairman?  Ask me, rather, what my role or position was in the party.  You should perhaps see the MDR party in the context.  At one point, MDR was a united party.  And then in 1993, it divided into two.  And at préfectoral level, the party was no longer functioning.  With a schism in the party, it was not operational at préfectoral level.  As united -- it was not functioning as a united party.  

At one point, *****************************was chairman and Nsengiyaremye was vice-president, and there was one politburo.  There was unity in the party, and there were meetings of the JDR.  But once -- after I had been appointed préfet, there were no longer any meetings of the MDR's youth wing.  Things were difficult and people were wondering, where is this party going?  Will it ever be a unified party again?  Everybody was wondering what would happen.  And for a long time the party stayed without any proper leadership.  
Q.	And can I suggest to you that during the genocide, you never considered seeking to ask the party to discipline its youth by expelling them from the party or doing some of the disciplinary measures which can be taken under the statutes of the MDR, because the situation was so chaotic that any remedy the party might make against its members would be meaningless?  
A.	But it was not possible because the leader of the JDR at préfectoral level lived in Kigali, and I didn't see him throughout the war.  So there wasn't any real structure.  The -- at national level it was as though the party had been hijacked.  There were people in Murambi speaking on behalf of the party.  There was Murego, Shingiro.  They held the power, and yet neither of them either were chairman or first vice chairman.  One was the executive secretary and the other one was a member of the Gitarama préfectoral politburo, not even the steering committee.  I'm talking of Shingiro.  So there wasn't anybody from the top.  The two people I mentioned, Donat Murego and Shingiro, were also members of the faction opposed to that of which I was a member.  So there couldn't be any contact between me and those two people.  
Q.	So, finally, Mr. Uwizeye, I just wanted to ask you if you would agree with this, because you yourself held a high position within the government of Rwanda during the genocide.  And would you agree that when evaluating the responsibility of a person who held a post, whether it be within the government or within a political party, during these events, that you have to look at that individual's deeds, and that simply because a person held a post during that time does not make them a genocidaire?  Would you agree with that? 
A.	I would agree with you, but sometimes action can commit an institution.  For example, a political party might be responsible as an institution.  But, as you know, I'm not a jurist.  I shouldn't like to go into this subject in depth.  You're better trained that I am in that respect.  So I would ask you to consider that aspect.  

Sometimes one might consider that there are institutions that might support their acts or back them up, in general terms.  But at other times, it isn't the role of the institution, but the role of the individual.  And there are various levels, there are different levels, institutional level and the individual level within the institution.  

But that is a legal debate in which I really couldn't participate in, and I think that each case must be assessed individually.  Sometimes one says -- regime of this or that ,or the Nazi regime.  Sometimes the role of the institution is considerably more important than the role of the individual.  And responsibility can be shared.  But I'm not the person to give you best explanation on this.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Uwizeye.  I have just one more matter.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I'm going a little bit into overtime, but I think I can finish in the next five minutes if you would like to keep going.  Or if you would prefer to take the recess now, we can do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If five minutes is a realistic estimate, we would prefer to finish now.  

Mr. Webster, how much time would you have in cross -- redirect?  That's also another issue.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't think it should go beyond 15 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We'll try and finish before the recess.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  If Mr. Issa could show document 7 to the witness in my packet of exhibits. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, my last question is just about the institution that you're now affiliated with, the RPF.  And I just want to simply show you a document and ask you whether or not this is the oath that you took when you joined the RPF, as you've told us, in 2002.  So hopefully we can do that quickly. 

Mr. Uwizeye, I'm going to just read this very briefly, and if you could tell me if this is the oath that you took.  It says that:  "At this irreversible step, I" -- the name of the person -- "solemnly take the oath in the presence of members, confirming that I have understood very well the objectives of the RPF-Inkotanyi, decided to further, in order to promote dignity of all Rwandans, be them young, old or generations to come, in this country or in any other country he may be.  And I solemnly confirm and pledge" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, I think we've lost you, sir.  Perhaps you'd like to start again.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	"I solemnly take oath in the presence of members, confirming that I have understood very well the objectives of RPF-Inkotanyi, decided to further promote dignity of all Rwandans, be them young, old or generations to come, in his country or in any other country he may be.  I solemnly confirm and pledge to cooperate with every RPF member today and for times to come.  I hereby pledge that I fully understand that any RPF member has to protect, to be protected, to provide and receive advice so that we may avoid calamities such as that which befell our country and all of its inhabitants, anyone who will be a member of the RPF.  I hereby pledge to fully cooperate with others to fight enemies of Rwanda wherever they may be.  I firmly swear, in the presence of all these members, that I will abide by all RPF-Inkotanyi laws and regulations existing and those to be enacted.  I will avoid any wrongs, unfaithfulness, laziness and other mistakes which led our country to the catastrophe.  Dear members here gathered, if I betray or do anything against objectives, motto and regulations of the RPF-Inkotanyi, I will have betrayed every Rwandan and I should be crucified as any other criminal." 

Is that the oath that you took?  
A.	No, Counsel.  It's sad.  If I'd known things would turn out that way, I'd have come with the text.  But these words here, in italics or not, I tell you this is not -- I will tell you this is not the correct oath.  Where it says that I should be punished, hung, crucified as any criminal, well, that is not in the oath that I gave.  If my memory serves me right, what is said, rather, is if I break my oath, I will have betrayed -- I will have betrayed all Rwandans and I should, therefore, be punished as a traitor. 

Wait, let me repeat.  Were I to go against this oath, I will have betrayed all Rwandans and I should be punished as a traitor or as a criminal.  I think those are the words uttered at the end of the oath.  And it is longer than this document, because it's practically a full -- a full page, three times as a long as that which is here before me.  

I don't know whether you can obtain it through other channels, or whether I should send it to you once I am back home in Rwanda.  

And then after the oath, you have to sign it.  You have to sign the document.  And, personally, I signed.  But I don't know whether the other people who joined the party -- sometimes there is collective taking of the oath and then there's a ceremony called ubusadane in Kinyarwanda.  Ubusadane, U-B-U-S-A-D-A-N-E, which is a sort of reception.  

And I should like to tell you that the terms used are terms of patriotism, which is the RPF's strong point, because the RPF distinguishes itself from other parties by its patriotism.  And the oath is in terms that shows that patriotism, that the RPF is working for the well-being of all citizens of the country, and anyone who goes against that should be dealt with.  

And I think all that is rather -- is creditable.  I don't see why you want to discuss this, because it is a constructive thing, this oath.  It reminds people what happened in Rwanda and that they want to avoid a repetition of such events.  And at the outset you see -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)  
THE WITNESS:
-- the oath says that I confirm that I understand the purposes pursued by the RPF.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you've already answered the question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, thank you.  I'm going to take you up on your offer to obtain the correct oath, and perhaps I'll contact you when I'm in Rwanda.  And if you can provide that to me, I would appreciate that.  

I've used up all the time that I have, and I want to thank you very much for answering all my questions.  
A.	I'm going to send it to you, and I'd like you to tell me through which channels I could send it to you, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  I think if you could give it to Mr. Webster, then he -- or someone from the Office of the Prosecutor, he can get it to us.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I thank you very much.  I have concluded all of my questions.  

And I thank the witness, again.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Mr. Webster. 

Witness, you now have to respond to counsel of the Prosecutor who has the right to ask you certain questions in clarification of your cross-examination.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no problem going ahead, Your Honour.  I would like to inform the Trial Chamber that we do have an application that we'd like to make after the break.  So my understanding is that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's going to be no break.  After we close, we're going to adjourn for the day. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your response to one of the questions from Mr. Robinson just some 10 or 15 minutes ago, you were drawing a distinction between the party -- the parties -- the political parties and the government.  And this was when he was asking you questions of accountability.  He was asking you if you had the capacity to -- to lock people up, punish your subordinates, and so on and so forth.  And part of your answer, you addressed the issue of the power -- the relative power -- powers between the political party and the administration.  Do you recall that portion of your cross-examination? 
A.	Sorry, could you be a bit more specific?  
Q.	You were discussing the breakdown of authority with Mr. Robinson, and you were referring to your own experience as préfet, and Mr. Robinson was speaking more generally about the government authorities, the territorial administration.  And in your response you gave the example of an Interahamwe being able to take a vehicle away from a minister, and that you implied that an Interahamwe could be more powerful than a minister, and you made a reference to the strength of the political parties during the events of April and May.  So I'm asking you to go back to that portion of your cross-examination and explain that to us a bit.  Do you recall that portion of your examination now?  
A.	Yes, I remember that.  When I gave the example of Interahamwe who could seize (inaudible) more influential than a minister, I didn't mean that the Interahamwe as an institution was stronger than the government.  He who gave guns to the Interahamwe -- who gave guns to the Interahamwe?  It was the government, or the parties.  I think you should try to seek why the conditions were created that made it impossible for the local authorities to act.  And that was the fault of the institution, whether the government or the parties, because those were the entities that created conditions where grass-roots organisations -- or, rather, the local administration, local government, could no longer function.  And it is in that light that one must see the way the government and the parties prepared the genocide.  And the proof of it is that they put in place conditions that made it impossible for grass-roots administration to function.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, based on your experience of April, May, June of 1994, did the MRND party play any role or have any role to play in undermining your authorities or the authority of local authorities in Gitarama? 
A.	Yes, the MRND did play a role.  What was discussed at the meeting of the 18th of April is enough.  The utterances of the three people I've already referred to in that meeting are sufficient.  In the utterances they tended to clear the MRND or the Interahamwe of any responsibility, whereas I thought that the Interahamwe were responsible for acts of violence.  That showed that they had not changed anything within the MRND.  Because we, at that time, were addressing leaders of that party which was in the majority of government, even though there were other representatives of other parties.  The policy being implemented was that of the MRND.  The president himself was a member of the MRND.  The army, even though it was a government army, was an army abiding by the orders of a government, the majority of whose members were the MRND.  And it was the MRND which had been in power ever since 1992.  

The genocide of the Tutsi had already started with the massacres in the Bugesera, the massacres in Murambi, and the massacres of the Bagogwe, which had occurred at a time when the MRND alone was in power.  Those acts continued until 1994.  

So I said to myself that it was absolutely necessary for a ceasefire to intervene before the act of violence reached Gitarama préfecture.  And I believed in it, honestly.  But at government level, they had a different agenda, and they started what they referred to as the all-out war.  They started massacring members of the population. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Well, since you mentioned the meeting of the 18th of April, I'd like to go back to that portion of your testimony.  And I'm only going to ask you one or two questions on this.  

So, now, reflecting back on everything that you've said, and through all of the cross-examination from the Defence teams, is there any doubt in your mind at all whether or not Édouard Karemera was present in Murambi for that meeting on the 18th of April that you attended?  
A.	There is no doubt in my mind.  And I am relying on the utterances he made which I have given an account of here.  
Q.	And now I'll ask you the same question about Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Thinking back through the entire process of your cross-examination, your evidence here in direct examination, and everything that you've said in regard to this meeting of the 18th of April, I ask you, for the last time, is there any doubt in your mind about whether or not Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present in the room with you when you attended that meeting in Murambi on the 18th of April? 
A.	There is no doubt in my mind with respect to Mathieu Ngirumpatse's presence, because I saw him and I listened to what he said.  
Q.	You've mentioned -- you've mentioned again that both Karemera and Ngirumpatse spoke during the course of that meeting on the 18th of April.  Was there any disagreement between them in regard to the Interahamwe?  In other words, when you think about what Karemera said and when you think about what Ngirumpatse said, was there any disagreement between them that you could discern? 
A.	There was no disagreement between them, and that is what I said here.  The first one spoke, and the second one spoke along the same lines.  
Q.	I'd like to move on to the meeting -- or to the encounter you described when you were at Murambi, again, and General Ndindiliyimana and Colonel Rusatira arrived.  When you were testifying in direct examination, you weren't quite sure whether that encounter with the military officers took place before the 18th of April or after the 18th of April.  But in cross-examination from Mr. Robinson, reflecting on the past through the process of his questioning you, you mentioned that on the 18th of April when you left Murambi, you, in effect, slammed the door and you had no intention of going back, but that a few days later you had to go back and get gas.  So it seems as if your evidence has developed in the process of your examination before this Chamber.  

So, I'd like you now, once again, to reflect back on your examination here over the past two or three days and back to the events of April and tell us, after thinking about it, whether this encounter with Ndindiliyimana and Rusatira in Murambi took place before the 18th of April or after. 
A.	Counsel, allow me to make a first clarification.  I did not tell Defence counsel that I slammed the door when I left the meeting room on the 18th of April, to come back subsequently.  Rather, it is what Defence counsel wanted me to say, and I actually told him that I did not come back.  Because, you see, Defence counsel was asking me whether the meeting continued or whether there was another meeting, and in my answer I told him I had no information about that.  But perhaps there was some second meeting which I did not attend.  I told him I attended just one meeting, during which meeting the politicians insulted me, and I told Kambanda that I could no longer bear this so I walked out.  

Concerning my encounter with General Ndindiliyimana, I said that that encounter could have taken place either before or after the 18th of April.  But from the discussions which took place, I think 
today -- and besides, there is some other detail which comes to mind.  I believe I said in this court that I was on my way -- I was about to go to the Mutyabanda avenue (phonetic), but at the last minute, I realised I had to go to Mugina because the bourgmestre of that commune had been murdered.  I think he had been murdered on the 20th, and we buried him on the 21st.  So it is likely that I encountered General Ndindiliyimana on the 20th and the 21st, because I saw them when I was about to leave for Mugina for the funeral of the bourgmestre who had just been murdered.  So it was either on the 20th or the 21st.  So it was around the 20th or the 21st of April because the other dates you mentioned, amongst others, is the 18th.  I think that on that date I had gone to Kabgayi, and I also had to contact the authorities of the Astaldi company to secure trucks and fuel.  I even had difficulties getting a physician to go and assist us in ferrying the bodies and the wounded.  So I would place my encounter with Ndindiliyimana in the period between the 18th and the 21st of April. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
Concerning that encounter now, I'm going to ask you a similar question to the one I posed in relation to the 18th of April.  Thinking back, is there any doubt in your mind that Édouard Karemera was present and spoke when you were in the room with Ndindiliyimana and Rusatira? 
A.	There is no doubt in my mind about that, Counsel.  And that is something which features in my other statements and testimonies, even in this Tribunal.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, on cross-examination from Mr. Weyl, he suggested to you that you provided information about Karemera, Ngirumpatse to OTP investigators because they prompted you for that information.  Thinking back to your statement of the 17th of March 1997, which is the first time that you mentioned Ngirumpatse being present on the 18th of April, was that because you were asked specifically about Ngirumpatse on that date, or was that information that you volunteered? 
A.	You say I talked about it to the Prosecutor, that is information I gave to the Prosecutor.  Are you referring to yourself or to someone else?  
Q.	No.  I'm referring to the investigators that you spoke to on the 17th of March 1997.  That's the witness statement.  I'm not sure if your conversation took place on that date, but we refer to that statement as your statement of the 17th of March 1997.  You were cross-examined on that statement, and it's in that statement that you mention Ngirumpatse being present during the meeting of the 18th of April.  And my question to you now is, thinking back to that conversation that you had with investigators of the 
	Office of the Prosecutor, were they asking you specifically about Ngirumpatse or were you providing them information in a general manner?  I'm trying to understand the dynamic between you, as the witness, and the investigator who was getting information from you. 
A.	They did not put any specific question to me.  They asked me whether I could come and testify here in Arusha in Ngirumpatse's trial, and I said that, concerning someone like Karemera, I cannot come to Arusha to say what he did to me, what he said against me in the meeting of the 18th of April.  I said I had no problem and I was ready to testify.  So when I gave that information, it was in general terms, not an answer to any specific question concerning that person.  
Q.	I'm not quite sure I understand you, Mr. Witness, because the first portion of your answer seems a little different from the last portion of your answer.  So I'll ask the question again.  If you think back to your conversations with investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor in 1997, did they prompt you for information concerning Ngirumpatse, or was that information that you provided of your own volition? 
A.	I no longer remember very well.  Was it an interview or, rather, a signed document?  Was it an interview which I had with the investigators, or was it, rather, a signed statement?  Because I no longer know whether you are referring to an interview with the investigations or a statement which I signed.  
Q.	Well, it was an interview that then was written down and resulted in a signed statement.  So we're talking about the same thing.  You had a conversation, and then that conversation was memorialised in writing which you then signed.  So that's what I'm talking about.  
A.	I no longer remember how it happened. 
Q.	All right.  Well, thank you.  We'll go on to next statement you made, which was one that was recorded in March of 1998.  And at that time, you were speaking to the Defence attorney for Akayesu, and that conversation also resulted in a signed statement, and you were cross-examined on that statement by Mr. Robinson.  In that statement you make reference to the president of the MRND being present on the 18th of April.  So my question to you now is, was that information that you provided gratuitously to the Akayesu Defence counsel, or did he prompt you for that information, if you can remember?  
A.	Even about that, I no longer remember what happened, but I don't even see whether the problem is about information I gave on my own initiative or information I gave in response to a specific question.  I could have given the same answer in the two scenarios.  I would have mentioned his presence.  What is most important is the answer given, be it in writing or orally.  My answer was that the MRND chairman was present.  There is the high likelihood that I mentioned his presence in the course of a narration focussing on what had happened in Murambi.  In my answers I always spoke in general terms.  I decipher the acts of those concerned by the things which I mentioned. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...answer the question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And my last series of questions for you now, Mr. Witness.  In cross-examination from Mr. Robinson, you were asked about Kambanda's endorsement of the civil defence programme.  And in responding to 
	Mr. Robinson, you mentioned the impact -- or the content of President Sindikubwabo's speech in Butare.  So, in other words, in response to Mr. Robinson, you told him you know what Sindikubwabo said in Butare.  And I'd like to take you back to that portion of your cross-examination and ask you to explain what you meant in relation to the government's civil defence programme and your response about President Sindikubwabo.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I object to that.  That's not arising from cross-examination.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, the witness provided a response to Mr. Robinson about civil defence during the course of his cross-examination, and Mr. Robinson quickly went on to something else, and I would like to come back to that portion of the witness's response concerning civil defence and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, what's your question?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what did you understand President Sindikubwabo to be saying -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Webster.  You can't go into that, his speech.  His speech in Butare does not arise from the cross-examination.  And we've had abundant evidence on this already in this trial.  You can't open that up now.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you aware of any other messages concerning civil defence that Prime Minister Jean Kambanda delivered directly to the people of Gitarama? 
A.	He often gave such messages.  I even think that there is a document, and there were utterances which were broadcast over radio.  Perhaps I don't have a copy of that document, but such themes always recurred in his utterances and even in Sindikubwabo's speech, because you talked about Sindikubwabo.  And I always made a linkage between the speeches of those two personalities.  What followed the utterances of the 18th of April can be illustrated in Sindikubwabo's speeches.  I say that three days after the meeting of the 18th of April, we understood the hidden agenda behind that civil self-defence system through Sindikubwabo's speech in Butare where he first explained what he meant by civil self-defence.

1115H
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I don't believe the witness should be able to overrule your objection.  Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, has your testimony over the last week been truthful and complete to the best of your ability? 
A.	I have said the truth and I have been abiding by my solemn declaration, the oath I took in this Court.  So I said the truth. 
Q.	Alright.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have no further questions.  
MR. WEBSTER:
You Honours, there is one matter I would like to bring up.  I should have brought this up before the witness -- before I started my re-direct, but Mr. Robinson made reference to two documents which have not been admitted into evidence through the Defence.  I'm concerned about the 1996 statement from this witness, and the 1998 statement from -- that he made to the Akayesu Defence team.  And both of those actually should be admitted as Defence exhibits in view of the way they were addressed in cross-examination.  So I'm asking Mr. Robinson to consider that.  And if not, for the Court tomorrow -- as Court exhibits.  But beyond that, my re-direct is complete.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I would like to offer the January 1996 statement as Exhibit D. NZ -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So agree to add both of them as exhibits?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you do that Monday morning?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  But, Mr. President, are we -- is there a rush to adjourn because -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Then fine.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Based upon the commitments that had been given by counsel I made other appointments for 11 o'clock today.  

We take the adjournment now.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, please, if you allow me just 15 seconds, Mr. President, to mention that we have exhibits which we need to tender.  And we are going to do that on Monday morning.  

And, Mr. President, I will on this occasion would like to tell the Trial Chamber that I am leaving Arusha this evening and I would like to convey my respectful regards to the Bench and all parties apologising for not being able to stay here until the end of this session.  So I would like to avail myself of the end of this particular hearing to greet everyone and to convey to you my respect.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Witness, I was so impatient to rise, which I thought would have happened about an hour ago.  But I omitted to thank you for coming to testify at our Trial.  We do this to every witness.  And we thank you for giving your time and coming here as a witness.  You maybe excused and you may (unintelligible).  
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you, Mr. President.  

I thank everyone.  And I hope you have a fruitful work. 
(Court adjourned at 1120H)
