MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will try to proceed.  I see Counsel Roach is standing up.  

Counsel Roach, do you have something to say?  
MR. ROACH:
Yes, Madam President.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Counsel Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, Madam President.  This morning, I omitted to introduce to the Court a new addition to our team, and that's Maître Cheickh Bangoura, who is a member of the Guinea Bar Association from Conakry.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  Thank you, Counsel Roach.  Welcome to counsel from the Guinea Bar.  

Since we are no longer in the Status Conference, for the need of the record, I should like to ask the parties to introduce themselves again after the registrar reads out the matter before us.  This is just for the record. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andrésia Vaz, presiding, Judge Flavia Lattanzi and Judge Florence Rita Arrey, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 29th of March 2004, for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, registry.  

Prosecution, can you introduce your team?  
MR. WEBSTER:
The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, as the senior trial attorney.  Holo Makwaia is the trial attorney; Madam Dior Fall is the legal advisor; Mr. Gregory Lombardi, an assistant trial attorney; Mr. Bongani Dyani is an assistant trial attorney.  The record should also reflect the presence of our case manager, Ayo Fadugba, and our intern.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecution. 
Defence?  Counsel Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Good morning again to the Court.  My name is Charles Roach.  I live in Canada.  I'm a member of the Ontario Bar and the Canadian Federal and Supreme Court system. 

I have with me Mr. Frederic Weyl, who is seated here and who is from the Parisian Bar.  And also with us on our team, assisting us, is Dr. Cheickh Bangura, who is a member of the Bar of Guinea.  Thank you.  We represent Dr. Ngirumpatse, of course.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Roach. 

Counsel Diagne. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Madam President.  My name is Dior Diagne, from the Dakar Bar.  We defend 
Édouard Karemera.  I am accompanied by Counsel Felix Sow, also from the Dakar  Bar -- he is my co-counsel -- as well as Peggy Reinette, our legal assistant, and Jean-Paul Temahagali, our legal assistant.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel.  

Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson for Joseph Nzirorera, and I'm assisted by my legal assistant, Leopold Nsengiyumva.  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
David Hooper, of the English and Welsh Bar, assisted by Dr. Professor Andreas O'Shea of the English and Welsh Bar and also professor of international law at the Kwazulu-Natal University in South Africa.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

We took more time than anticipated, and we should like to answer the questions and some of the motions that were put before us. 

The Chamber has decided on the preliminary motions.  It seems to be essential before -- to do so before continuing the trial.  We believe that the trial, since it already has begun, we are acting pursuant to Rule 72 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, in the sense that the opening statements dealt with by this Rule were already given in the beginning of the trial in November 2003.  Indeed, Rule 72 provides the Chamber shall rule on preliminary motions 60 days following their filing before -- and before the opening statements are made in Rule 84 -- pursuant to 84.  

Some of the motions -- some of the preliminary motions filed, in the view of the Chamber, as soon as we receive the -- are not yet to be decided upon.  We shall wait to receive the Prosecutor's response before we respond to those. 

The appeals brought before the Appeals Chamber are not suspended, and, as such, we can continue the trial, as we said in a written decision that you received on this day. 

Translation issues raised before the Chamber cannot stop the proceedings.  The Chamber requests, if necessary, that some statements must be translated orally, with the assistance of the interpreters.  

As regards decisions already rendered, we are not going to come back to those.  The Chamber is not charged with executing those decisions rendered. 

As regards Witness GFA, the Prosecutor explained that he has just received the documents disclosed on this day.  The Defence can use the necessary time to prepare its cross-examination of said witness. 

A material error found its way into paragraph 8 of the decision of the motion to adjourn the trial.  A corrigendum shall be provided, in writing, to paragraph 8 of that decision. 

The Chamber considers that the letter of the Accused written in February 2004 is almost contemptuous.  The Chamber has deemed it unnecessary to reply, and it goes without saying that the Chamber makes sure that there is equality of arms and fair trial for all concerned.  The Chamber shall be satisfied once the Accused persons return to the trial.  It is in their interest to be present.  We thank all of the parties.  

This is the decision of the Chamber.  

We should now ask the Prosecutor if he is ready to bring in Witness GFA for continuation of trial. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, the Prosecution is ready to proceed.  The witness is in the waiting room.  He can be called into the courtroom by the registry.  This is a protected witness.  

While we wait for the witness to be brought in, I could pass this on to the registry and have it displayed to the Court and then to the parties.  It's the identification form for the witness that's going to testify.
	(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I have the floor before we start with this witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson, you have the floor.
MR. ROBINSON:
There is a number of unresolved matters, some of which pertain to this witness and some of which pertain to the resumption of the trial, that I should like to now raise with the Trial Chamber, and the first is that pursuant to Rule 15 --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please.  We responded to all of these issues, and we said, as regards the other motions, we will, in due time, respond to those. 

As such, I don't understand why you're standing up again with new motions before the Chamber. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, you've just informed us of your decision to continue the trial as of this moment, and I have some motions which relate to that.  

In addition, I have some motions which relate to the testimony of Witness GFA that have not been ruled upon, such as the motion to exclude his testimony.  But in any event, I would like to be heard on the decision you've just made to resume the trial, and I would like to inform the Trial Chamber of some motions and requests that we have that relate to that that have not already been raised. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I think that the Prosecutor must have an objection because he's standing.  That's why I gave him the floor.  No, no, no.  

Therefore, Counsel Robinson, you have the floor.  We were consulting amongst ourselves regarding the motion you want to present us.  We wanted to see whether or not we were going to hear it. 

We think that we have answered your questions, Counsel.  If we said the witness can appear now and we give you sufficient time to prepare your cross-examination, that means that we've already responded.  As such, we don't understand why you are reproaching us for not having answered your motion.  Perhaps we didn't take up word-for-word what you said, but we did say that we can hear this witness and that you will have ample time to prepare yourself for cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, putting aside this witness for the moment, now that you've decided to resume the trial, I want to bring a few motions based on that.  

The first motion -- and this is not a motion that I'm making before this Trial Chamber at this time, but I'm notifying you, the Trial Chamber, that pursuant to Rule 15 that, regrettably, the Accused and their counsel, at least Mr. Nzirorera, speaking for Mr. Nzirorera now, and I think you'll hear from a few others in moments, we hereby move to recuse and disqualify the members of the Trial Chamber under Rule 15.  And under the provisions of the Rule, that is a motion that must be made before the Presiding Judge of the Trial Chamber III, which I'm not exactly sure who that is in the event of the resignation of Judge Williams, but in any event the Rule indicates that a motion for disqualification should be made to the Presiding Judge of the Trial Chamber, and we intend to do that.  And we 
have --  regret having to do that, but I think the events of this morning have shown us that this Trial Chamber is not capable of being fair to the Accused, and it has both the actual and appearance of bias.  And so I'm going to yield the floor to my colleagues to speak to that issue and on that motion in a moment.  

I also wish to deal with two other issues prior to the commencement of the trial.  Rule 67 requires that a notice of alibi be filed before the commencement of the trial, and I have prepared a preliminary notice of alibi which I wish to file at this time because I intend to comply with the Rules.  And so I would ask that the registrar accept my preliminary notice of alibi and file it and so that everyone knows that I have filed this notice in advance of the trial, or recommencement of the trial. 

My last request, in general, with respect to recommencing this trial is that I be given the opportunity to make a supplemental opening statement before the evidence goes forward, because when I made my opening statement, we dealt with a much different indictment.  There's many new elements, as you've already ruled, that were not in the original indictment, for which I did not have the opportunity to address the Trial Chamber about.  And so I would request that I be allowed to make a supplemental opening statement before you hear any evidence.  But it's our position initially that because of the pendancy of this disqualification motion, that that matter should be decided before proceeding any further in this case.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, Your Honours, it is with much bitterness that I associate myself with counsel for Nzirorera in support of his motion.  When I say it's with bitterness, what I mean is that I would like to keep the hope that we can convince Mr. Ngirumpatse -- I would like to hope that we can convince him that the motions and his treatment continues to be fair and that he will be able to benefit from a fair trial.  I say this with much emotion.  I have the feeling that this is a very serious situation, the way things are proceeding. 

I remember a recent decision that you made to certify an appeal.  You even implicitly asked about recommencing trial, and you were already giving the answer by continuing, continuing, et cetera.  I must say -- and this is very regrettable -- as I already explained on several occasions, as a lawyer from the civil law system, how we have the feeling that as we advance, as we move on, all of the conditions are not met, the prerequisites are not met.  If you're in a plane that must take off, and if you're not sure there's enough fuel in that plane, if you're not sure that all of the checklists have been verified, you have great fear.  And I have great fear that as we move forward continually, as we look for a trial to be finished in a reasonable amount of time, we cannot proceed because we have been impeded.  

And we will file a brief.  We fully support Peter Robinson's motion.  And I thank you for giving me the floor, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel Weyl. 

Are there any other counsel who wish to speak?  Yes, Counsel Sow. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Édouard Karemera, under Rules 12 and -- rather, Articles 12 and 20 of the Statute and Rules 14 and 15 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, has -- as well as international conventions -- has asked us to ask that we adjourn this trial and that we disqualify Judges Andrésia Vaz, Florence Rita Arrey and Flavia Lattanzi, because he believes that the procedure is rampant with defects in form and he has serious concerns as regards the impartiality of this Trial Chamber. 

Mr. Édouard Karemera has asked us to file a motion on his behalf with the Tribunal, a motion before these Judges in this Trial Chamber, to disqualify these Judges, and he's asking that the Tribunal make a ruling on said motion.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Sow.  

Any other Defence counsel who wish to take the floor?  No.  Thank you very much. 

Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to conclude, Your Honour, I must say that we find these motions quite outrageous, that the Accused, or the counsel on their behalf, would raise such distasteful comments.  They have not the respect for the Court to be present to voice their concerns, and yet we have three interventions without -- completely lacking in substance.  There's not one motion that was made, one comment or one observation by any of the Defence attorneys, that raise any material fact, application.  There is no basis for any of the Defence applications, and I simply take this opportunity to voice our outrage at the type of disrespect that the Accused would have for this Court in making such an application.  But the Prosecutor is ready to proceed, the witness is on the stand, and I would like to continue.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you finished, Counsel?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.

The Chamber shall consider the motion.  We will adjourn now and we will tell you when we shall render a decision.  You will be informed of said moment. 

Witness -- the witness should be removed from the courtroom.  

We apologise, Witness.  At the given point in time, if deemed necessary, you shall appear for testimony.  But for the time being, we must rule on a motion that has been put before us. 

The proceedings are therefore adjourned and we shall recommence at a later time.  We shall advise the parties. 
(Court adjourned at 1215H)
