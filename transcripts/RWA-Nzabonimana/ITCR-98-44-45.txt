         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  

         3        

         4        Could the registry introduce the matter coming before 

         5        the Trial Chamber this morning, please?

         6   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  

         7        

         8        Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal 

         9        for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, 

        10        presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and

        12        today, Tuesday, the 26th of November 2002, for the 

        13        continuation of the Defence case when Prosecution 

        14        Counsel Ms. Ojemeni, will continue with the 

        15        cross-examination of Witness MEM, 

        16        PW14, in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Juvénal 

        17        Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.

        18        

        19        Thank you, Mr. President.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registry.  

        21        

        22        May we have the appearance of the parties, starting with 

        23        the Prosecution for the record, please? 

        24   MS. OJEMENI: Thank you, Your Honour.  With due respect, 

        25        Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial attorney, Dorothée Marotine, 

        26        case manager.  Mr. Fleming will also be joining us for 

        27        the Prosecution this morning later.  Thank you.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

        29        

        30        Yes, may we also have the appearance of the Defence,

         1        please, for the record?

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Lennox Hinds representing Mr. Kajelijeli, 

         3        assisted by Professor Bompaka and Mr. Emilien Dusabe.  

         4        Professor Bompaka just stepped out.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

         6        

         7        Yes, Interpreter, could you, please, tell Witness MEM 

         8        that the Trial Chamber reminds him of the solemn 

         9        declaration he made previously, and that he will 

        10        continue with his evidence today on that same solemn 

        11        declaration.  Yes. 

        12   THE WITNESS: Very well.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: And secondly, we continue to be in open 

        14        session.  So, he should be careful not to mention names, 

        15        which could have -- or places and people, which could 

        16        have a bearing on his identity.  

        17        

        18        Yes, Learned Counsel, please?

        19   MS. OJEMENI: Thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honour, as I 

        20        mentioned yesterday, my -- the line of my questions for 

        21        the next two or three hours would reveal the identity of 

        22        this witness, and I would be asking for a closed session 

        23        in the interest of justice and fairness.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  No objection, I suppose, from the 

        25        other side?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: No objection, Your Honour.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  So, we'll go in closed session to 

        28        enable counsel raise questions, even those which could 

        29        have a bearing on the identity of the witness.

        30   THE WITNESS:  Very well.
