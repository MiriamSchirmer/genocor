P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg and Judge Gberdao Gustav Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday the 20th of September, 2006, for the delivery of the judgement in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, Case No.  ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have appearances, please.
MR. JALLOW:
May it please the Court, the Prosecutor appears in person.  And with me is the Chief of Prosecutions and senior trial attorneys, Dior Fall and Don Webster, and the rest of the trial team, as it please the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

And for the Defence.  
MR. HOOPER:
Good morning, Mr. President.  David Hooper, on behalf of André Rwamakuba, together with 
Dr. Andreas O'Shea.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Hooper, as I have had to throughout the trial, I again inquire about the absence of the Accused; 
do you have anything to report? 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I saw him yesterday and the day before and we discussed this matter.  He is not here at present.  He might come, but he's not here -- certainly at the minute.  And he doesn't seek to be here for his judgement, which, he has declared to me, he would find a burden too great to bear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We will proceed in his absence.  

This is a summary of the judgement of the Trial Chamber.  

The Chamber today pronounces its judgement in the case of the Prosecutor against André Rwamakuba.  The full text of the judgement, which will be available at the close of this hearing, 
is the exclusive and unanimous statement of the Chamber's findings and reasoning in the present case.  

The Accused, André Rwamakuba, was born in 1950 in Nduba, Gikongoro commune, 
Kigali rural préfecture, Rwanda.  He is qualified as a doctor and was a public health specialist.  
In 1994, after the death of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana, he was appointed 
Minister of Primary and Secondary Education in the interim government.  He was also a member of the 
Mouvement Démocratique du Rwanda, MDR party.  

The Accused was arrested in 1998 at the Tribunal's request.  A first trial against him and three co-accused persons commenced in November 2003.  In 2005, however, the Prosecution requested and obtained his severance and a separate trial under an amended indictment.  

The effective indictment filed on 10th June 2005, charges André Rwamakuba with genocide, or alternatively, complicity in genocide, and murder and extermination as crimes against humanity for specific acts allegedly committed between 6th and 30th April, 1994, in Gikomero commune and at Butare University Hospital.  The Accused pleaded not guilty to all counts.  His Defence did admit that genocide occurred in Rwanda in 1994 but disputed the Accused's involvement in any of the crimes alleged in the indictment.  Between June 2005 and February 2006, 49 Prosecution witnesses -- 
49 Prosecution and Defence witnesses were heard over 78 trial days.  

Before turning to the facts of the case, the Chamber must first address a point of law concerning the charges against the Accused.  

The charges against the Accused:  

At the closure of the case, the Prosecution submitted in its closing brief that as 
Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, André Rwamakuba, and I quote, "Did nothing either to denounce the crimes committed against the Tutsi or to dissociate himself from the interim government."  It alleged that by these omissions, Rwamakuba directly failed to discharge the duties entrusted to him, which he had sworn to fulfil, and that he encouraged the genocidal activities.  
The Prosecution concluded that, and I quote again, "A Trial Chamber may find an accused guilty when it is satisfied that the accused participated in a crime by committing any one of the acts covered by the Statute, even if the Chamber does not endorse the Prosecution's case." 

It added that, and I quote, "As a Tribunal of fact and law, the Chamber may accept any argument that it finds relevant to the facts of the case, on condition that the said argument is consistent with the provisions of Article 6(1) of the Statute." 

This submission raises the question whether the Accused was given adequate notice of these alleged charges against him and was, therefore, in a reasonable position to confront the Prosecution's case.  

The Chamber notes that nowhere in the indictment, pre-trial brief, or opening statement is there any charge against the Accused which included a criminal responsibility as a minister of the April 1994 government for not having denounced the crimes committed against the Tutsi, for not dissociating himself from the government and for failure to discharge duties entrusted to him as a member of the government.  There is no allegation of any criminal responsibility of the Accused as a superior for crimes committed by subordinates, nor is there any indication of any legal duty under which he was mandated to act and which failure to do so would constitute a criminal act.  

On the contrary, when the Prosecution requested the severance of the Accused in 2005 and as the trial proceeded, it gave clear and consistent information both to the Accused and the Chamber that its case was limited to Rwamakuba's direct participation in criminal activities in two specific locations within a specific time frame.  

The Prosecution explicitly stated that, and I quote, "Any pleading of common purpose implicating Rwamakuba as co-perpetrator of crimes committed throughout Rwanda in furtherance of a government conspiracy to commit genocide had been removed from the indictment."  It must be noted that the Accused agreed to the severance and a separate trial, and conducted his defence on the basis of these assertions.  The Chamber also reviewed the suggested amendment in the light of this Prosecution's stated position.  

It would therefore be contrary to the fundamental right of the Accused to a fair trial, including his right to defend himself and to know the charges against him, if the Chamber were to accede to a Prosecution request to find André Rwamakuba criminally responsible for omissions, which were neither set forth in the indictment, nor subsequently notified by timely, clear and consistent information from the Prosecution.  

The Chamber therefore considers that in the present case, the Prosecution charges André Rwamakuba, pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Statute, with genocide, or alternatively, complicity in genocide, and crimes against humanity for acts allegedly committed between 6th and 30th April, 1994, in Gikomero commune and at Butare University Hospital.  Any factual allegation related to André Rwamakuba's political activities or role as a member of the MDR party or as minister of the interim government must be considered as context or background from which inferences could be drawn concerning, for example, his intent, disposition or other elements of the crimes.  

The Chamber turns now to the facts of the case.  

Factual findings:  

The case against the Accused revolves around two sets of events in Gikomero commune and at 
Butare University Hospital between 6th and 30th April 1994.  

The presumption of innocence requires the Prosecution to prove the Accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  According to this principle, the Defence does not have to adduce rebuttal evidence to the Prosecution's case.  If a reasonable doubt is raised in the Judges' minds, the Prosecution would have failed to discharge its persuasive burden of proof.  

The Chamber will not here review the evidence in detail.  It must be noted that it has been assessed as a whole and for each allegation, the identification of the Accused, the credibility and reliability of the witnesses and the alibi evidence were discussed.  In the assessment of the evidence, various criteria were used, such as internal discrepancies in the witness's testimony, inconsistencies with other witnesses' testimony, inconsistencies with the witness's prior statements, relationship between the witness and the Accused and other witnesses, the criminal record of the witness, the impact of trauma on a witness's memory, discrepancies in translation, social and cultural factors, and the demeanour of the witness.  

The Prosecution's case consisted mainly of hearsay evidence concerning both the content of the allegations and also the identification of André Rwamakuba.  Five of the 18 Prosecution witnesses claimed to have direct knowledge of Rwamakuba.  Two witnesses also gave uncorroborated evidence to support specific allegations in the indictment.  The Prosecution did not specify why this was the case and it must be presumed that this was the best evidence available.  
The Defence called 31 witnesses who had both direct and indirect knowledge of Rwamakuba.  Many of them claimed to have been eyewitnesses to events alleged in the indictment, and some of them to be victims of the genocide.  

The Chamber now turns to the first set of events which allegedly took place in Gikomero commune.  

The indictment alleges two main sets of events in Gikomero commune, which can be described as follows:  

The first set took place from 26 July 1993 until June 1994, when André Rwamakuba conducted sensitization campaigns in the Gikomero commune, organising and participating in various secteurs of the commune in meetings calling upon the Hutu majority to exterminate the Tutsi, recruiting members for the extremist anti-Tutsi wing of the MDR, MDR Hutu Power and supporting the Hutu Power.  

The second set includes four events over a period of a few days in April 1994, as follows:  

Between 10th and 11th April 1994, André Rwamakuba delivered machetes, that were to be used to kill the Tutsi, to the homes of, on the one hand, André Muhire and, on the other, Etienne Kamanzi located in two different secteurs of Gikomero commune, five kilometres apart.  

Between 10th and 20th April 1994, at the Gikomero secteur office, he ordered the killing of three Tutsi and encouraged the beginning of the massacres against Tutsi in the commune.  

And between 13th and 15th April 1994, Rwamakuba went to the Kayanga Health Centre where he signalled the beginning of the massacres against Tutsi refugees and witnessed their killing committed by soldiers and Interahamwe.  

With respect to the allegations on the sensitization campaigns, six Prosecution witnesses, including two hearsay witnesses, testified to 11 instances between 1992 and March 1994, during which André Rwamakuba allegedly participated in meetings, political rallies and gatherings, or came to Gikomero commune to call for the extermination of the Tutsi and to recruit members of the 
MDR extremist wing.  The Chamber has considered this evidence as circumstantial evidence that could be relevant concerning the alleged crimes committed by the Accused in the Gikomero commune in April 1994.  

The Chamber notes that some of this evidence was inconsistent with the allegations set forth in the indictment and no evidence was adduced on certain allegations.  
The identification of André Rwamakuba at the time and place of the events described by the witnesses raises serious concerns. The Chamber finds, for reasons detailed in its judgement, that the Prosecution witnesses could not be found reliable because of internal inconsistencies and vagueness in their testimonies or contradictions with testimony given by other Prosecution witnesses.  This conclusion was supported by the Defence evidence that the Accused was not in Rwanda.  

A reasonable probability has been shown that between 23rd September 1993 and 10th March 1994, Rwamakuba attended a training course at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, and that between the 17th and 29th of March, 1994, he attended a international colloquium organised by the WHO in Egypt.  The Chamber therefore finds that the Prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused participated in sensitization campaigns from 26th July 1993 until June 1994.  

With respect to the events in Gikomero commune in April 1994, both parties gave evidence that attacks and massacres took place against Tutsi in that commune, and specifically in Ndatemwa Trading Centre, at Gikomero Protestant School, Gishaka Parish and Kayanga Health centre.  The Prosecution called six witnesses, including two uncorroborated witnesses, to support its allegations that during a period of five days, between 10th and 15th April 1994, André Rwamakuba went to four different locations in Gikomero commune to deliver machetes that were to be used in killings against the Tutsi, to encourage and give instructions to kill Tutsi, and to launch the beginning of the attacks against Tutsi in the commune.  

Again, the Prosecution's evidence was, in some instances, inconsistent with the allegations set forth in the indictment.  But mainly, the testimony of the Prosecution witnesses was tainted by major deficiencies which could not be justified by the time elapsed, translation discrepancies, the manner in which the prior statements were taken, or the impact of trauma inflicted upon the witnesses.  

These inconsistencies, which are detailed in the full text of the judgement, undermined the witnesses' credibility or reliability.  Furthermore, at the outset, the Defence disputed that the Accused could have been present in Gikomero commune at the time of the alleged events.  The parties agreed and the Chamber accepted that André Rwamakuba was sworn in as a minister of the interim government on 
9th April 1994, attended a governmental meeting held in Kigali at the Hôtel des Diplomates on 
11th April 1994, and was living in Kigali until 12th April, 1994, when he went to Gitarama with the convoy of the interim government.  

The admission of these facts had a major impact on the Prosecution's case, since the Defence challenged the accessibility from and to Gikomero commune in April 1994.  The Prosecution did not provide a chronological account of the Accused's alleged activities in Gikomero in April 1994, and seemed to suggest that on each event alleged, the Accused commuted between Kigali or Gitarama and the various locations in the Gikomero commune.  

There was, however, reliable evidence on the potential hazards to travel to and from Gikomero commune after 7th April 1994.  Reliable testimonies were also given that Rwamakuba's name was not mentioned before Rwandan local courts in relation to the crimes committed in Gikomero commune in April 1994, and that he was not present at the scene of the crimes.  This evidence was not satisfactorily rebutted by the Prosecution.  

In the Chamber's view, the absence of any reliable identification of André Rwamakuba at the time and location of the alleged events, the lack of credibility or reliability of the Prosecution witnesses, the admitted facts that the Accused participated in other activities during the period alleged in the indictment, the potential hazards of travel to the locations of the alleged crimes, cumulatively contribute to raise a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution's case.  

The Chamber therefore finds that the Prosecution failed to prove at all or beyond reasonable doubt the charges against the Accused in Gikomero commune.  

The Chamber now turns to the second set of events concerning André Rwamakuba's alleged participation in the killings at Butare University Hospital in April 1994.  

The indictment alleges that between the 18th and 25th April 1994, the Accused came to Butare 
hospital -- Butare University Hospital.  During that period, along with Dr. Gatera, soldiers and militiamen, he conducted the identification of Tutsi patients and refugees, removing drips from Tutsi patients, injured others with an axe and directly caused the death of other Tutsi refugees and patients, and gave orders to Interahamwe and soldiers to kill or take away to kill Tutsi patients on board a vehicle.  Many Tutsi refugees and patients were massacred in Butare University Hospital as a result of the Accused's orders and instigation.  

The existence of a massacre against Tutsi at Butare University Hospital in April 1994, was not a contentious matter in the present case, and both parties adduced evidence on that event.  

The Prosecution called six witnesses who asserted their presence at Butare University Hospital and testified to criminal acts committed by the Accused on different dates between 21st and 25th April 1994, and eventually in May 1994.  Again, the Prosecution did not adduce evidence on some allegations against the Accused and adduced evidence inconsistent with some allegations in the indictment.  
In the Chamber's view, the identification of the Accused at the scene of the crimes was a core issue regarding the Butare University Hospital event and raised serious doubts.  Apart from Witness XV who claimed to have personally known André Rwamakuba, the identification of the Accused was either based on untested hearsay evidence or on Witness XV's identification.  

Specifically, Witness XV pointed out Rwamakuba to Witness HF and RJ, who in turn identified him to Witness GIO.  In that respect, it is remarkable that Witness XV was confusing Rwamakuba with a man named Rekeraho.  This confusion was also entertained by Witness GIO.  As developed in detail in the judgement, Witness XV's evidence contained many inconsistencies that could not be reasonably explained or reconciled.  His personal knowledge and identification of Rwamakuba was therefore unreliable.  

In addition to these identification issues, the credibility and reliability of the Prosecution witnesses as to the Butare hospital event also raised serious concerns.  In the Chamber's view, the major inconsistencies between the witnesses' testimonies and their prior statements and testimonies in other cases could not be explained by the time elapsed, translation discrepancies, the manner in which the prior statements were taken or the impact of trauma inflicted upon the witnesses.  They undermined the credibility and reliability of the Prosecution witnesses.  

In addition, the Prosecution did not satisfactorily rebut the six Defence witnesses who testified that Rwamakuba did not participate in the killings at Butare University Hospital, and that during the considered period, he was staying in Gitarama and Gisenyi and could not have been in Butare to the extent suggested by the Prosecution witnesses.  

The absence of any reliable identification of André Rwamakuba at the time and location of the event, the lack of credibility and reliability of the Prosecution witnesses and the Defence alibi evidence, cumulatively contribute to levy reasonable doubt on the Prosecution's case.  

Consequently, the Chamber finds that the Prosecution failed to prove at all or beyond a reasonable doubt the allegations against the Accused at the Butare University Hospital.  

The Chamber now turns to the remaining allegations in the indictment.  

In addition to the charges pertaining to events in Gikomero and Butare events, the indictment contains allegations regarding André Rwamakuba's political status and related political activities.  

As the Chamber explained at the beginning of the delivery of this judgement, André Rwamakuba was not alleged to be criminally responsible as a member of the interim government for failing to denounce the crimes committed against the Tutsi, for not dissociating himself from the government, or for failing to discharge his duties as minister.  

In view of the charges against the Accused set forth in the indictment, and according to the clear and consistent notice given by the Prosecution, the allegations pertaining to Rwamakuba's political role and activities are considered as context or background from which inferences concerning his intent and disposition may be drawn.  

In any case, the Chamber notes that no evidence was adduced concerning what the Accused could or should have done as a minister or what he failed to do.  The Prosecution also did not bring any evidence to prove its contentions regarding the structures of the MDR Hutu Power, André Rwamakuba's alleged authority over local administrative officials, his alleged mobilisation of the physical and logistical resources of the other parties that were allied with MRND and Hutu Power, the interim government ministries controlled by those parties and the military to execute the campaign of destruction of the Tutsi throughout Rwanda.  No direct evidence was adduced concerning the responsibilities of Rwamakuba with regard to the programme of civilian self-defence or how he might have used it to kill Tutsi.    

Since the Prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the charges against the Accused pertaining to Gikomero commune and Butare University Hospital as detailed above, the Chamber need not to discuss the allegations and evidence concerning his criminal intent or disposition in relation to these alleged incidents.  

Before concluding, the Chamber recalls that the Appeals Chamber recently held that genocide against Tutsi and widespread or systematic attacks against a civilian population, based on Tutsi ethnic identification, occurred in Rwanda between April and July 1994 are notorious facts not subject to reasonable dispute, nor were they disputed by the Defence in the present case.  

This Tribunal was established to contribute to the process of reconciliation and to the restoration of peace and security in Rwanda.  The Tribunal's contribution in this area is by conducting impartial criminal proceedings where the burden of proving the guilt of an individual accused is on the Prosecution.  In the present case, the parties agreed that massacres against Tutsi took place in Gikomero commune and at Butare University Hospital in April 1994.  However, having considered the totality of the evidence, the Chamber finds that the Prosecution failed to discharge its burden of proof and to establish the charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  

One last issue related to the rights of the Accused will be addressed by the Chamber before pronouncing its verdict.  

In a prior decision, another Chamber of this Tribunal found that there was a violation of Rwamakuba's right to legal assistance during the first months of his detention at the UNDF, from 22nd October 1998 until 10th March 1999, and that the delay in assigning him duty counsel further caused a delay in his initial appearance.  According to the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber of this Tribunal, any violation of the Accused's rights entails the provision of an effective remedy.  

Accordingly, André Rwamakuba will be at liberty to file an application seeking an appropriate remedy for the above-mentioned violation within the time limits set out in the judgement.  The Prosecution and the registry will also be at liberty to file any submission on this matter.  

The Chamber now concludes with the verdict.  

Having considered all the evidence and the arguments of the parties, the Chamber finds André Rwamakuba unanimously not guilty on all counts in the indictment.  He is, accordingly, acquitted.  

The Chamber orders his immediate release and requests the registrar to make all necessary arrangements in the implementation of this decision.  

Now, do any of the parties want to make any further submissions before we adjourn our session? 
MR. JALLOW:
It if it pleases the Court, we have no applications to make to the Court.  Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  

Well, as you know, André Rwamakuba isn't here and he's maintained now for a very long time to me that he'd only come to this Court as an innocent and vindicated man, and you've given him that opportunity, and I'd invite you -- it may be difficult with your other duties and obligations -- but I'd invite you, in the circumstances of this case, to rise and adjourn for a short -- a relatively short period of time to enable Dr. Rwamakuba to be brought from the UNDF to this Court.  I mentioned this to the commandant yesterday and to others. 

There are issues that need to be addressed in terms of the Court's order for immediate release.  And part of this, for example, relates to Rwamakuba's perceived personal requirements for security.  And I know, Mr. President, you and your colleagues will appreciate, that this is not an area that it's been very easy to discuss with a judgement hanging over his head, and it's not one that I've chosen to develop with him.  If he were brought here, I could also deal with that and raise matters of concern relating to that with -- with the Chamber.  

There's two other matters that I'd seek to raise.  One of them was dealt with -- and that is the issue of compensation.  That's been dealt with and we will, in fact, move for compensation in respect of the particular matter.  But we also feel that in the particular circumstances of this case, this particular Accused has a right to invoke a greater degree of compensation from, what we would argue, is the inherent right of this Tribunal to award it.  

And, secondly, I'd seek to -- to do no more but to remind the Chamber of its powers under Rule 91 of the Rules in respect of those witnesses who give false testimony before the Tribunal.  And that in the particular circumstances of this case, the Tribunal has the power and authority to order the appointment of an amicus curiae to investigate the matters that have obviously given this Court -- as expressed in its short judgement this morning, in the Court's -- the Tribunal's own words, serious concern.  

I appreciate that not only -- as we've argued throughout this case -- was the most appalling genocide in Rwanda against the Tutsis of that country, but that most of the Prosecution witnesses were themselves victims and many, in fact, suffered dreadfully.  But for all that, it's our submission that there has been a deliberate attempt -- to use the phrase that's often been used -- to poison the waters of justice and to bring before you, the Judges, false allegations that have essentially resulted in André Rwamakuba being detained for seven years, totally separated from family -- and work, and opportunity and effectively having his life broken on those lies.  

I'm not asking - and, nor would I dream of doing so -- for this Chamber to move to the decision that there were lies, but there are such sufficient concerns raised by the evidence, confronted as those witnesses were by their previous wholly -- wholly inconsistent statements, that it's a matter that falls properly to be examined and investigated.  

The sentences, of course, that can be imposed -- sentences of up to seven years for perjury might not be necessarily appropriate in the particular circumstances and background of the witnesses.  But this Tribunal should not, in my submission, have to be subject to the kind of conspiracy of lies that, in the Defence submission were, in fact, the substance of the Prosecution case here.  

So those are matters and of course I realise that after today I assume that you, Mr. President, and your colleagues will be functus in terms of this particular case.  So I raise those matters now.  It's not a matter, as we see it, for a motion, but it's certainly a matter that we raise with concern.  And it may be a concern to a greater or a lesser extent will be reflected by the attitude of both you, Mr. President, and that of your colleagues in this case.  

But, returning to the other matter.  Can I invite you to adjourn in order that Dr. Rwamakuba, who I know you haven't seen, can be brought here?  I know, in these particular circumstances, he would like to be here.  
MR. JALLOW:
If it pleases the Court, we do have some remarks to make -- some comments to make on the application by Defence counsel. 

Of course, we would object to the Court adjourning for the purpose of enabling the Accused to appear before it here.  The Court will note that throughout these proceedings the Accused has chosen to absent himself, perhaps in the exercise of his rights, but the fact is that he has chosen to absent himself.  And at this stage, the proceedings have concluded.  The Court is functus officio as far as those criminal proceedings are concerned and there is no reason to adjourn for him to appear.  

On the other issue, the Prosecution does not condone abuse of the process of the Court.  
To characterise the trial as subject to a conspiracy of lies is unfair to the Prosecution.  I think it's important to note that the Accused person, much as he has been acquitted, was charged on an indictment confirmed by a judge and that at the end of the case for the Prosecution, the Court held that the Prosecution had established a prima facie case.  

I think these factors need to be taken into account in considering the remarks that my learned friend has just made.  It is unfair.  The Prosecution had reasonable cause to bring this action and at no stage did the Prosecution engage in what he describes as a conspiracy of lies to influence this Court.  That was all we wished to point to -- to the Court.  

As Your Lordship pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Jallow.  

Mr. Matar, would the registry like to be heard?
MR. DIOP:
Thank you, Mr. President, Honourable Judges, the registry (inaudible). 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I think he ought to speak into his microphone.  
MR. DIOP:
So, I was saying that we take note of the decision of the Chamber and the implementation of the decision immediately -- (inaudible)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, once again, if the speaker could speak to his microphone. 
MR. DIOP:
(Inaudible)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would invite you to sit to facilitate your speaking into the microphone. 
MR. DIOP  
I was saying that we take note of the decision of the immediate release of the Accused -- the acquitted person, but we would like to bring to the attention of the Chamber that the immediate release would require some negotiation with the host country and also with the newly acquitted person as to determine his new relocation.  

For that, we request the Chamber to allow us time to conduct those negotiations and discussions with the Accused -- the newly acquitted person and to revert to the Chamber. 

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Matar.  

The Chamber would like to thank Counsel -- the Defence, the Prosecutor and the Registrar, for the remarks which have been made.  

We have taken them all into consideration and we have decided that it's not necessary or desirable for us to adjourn for the purpose of having the Accused make -- or, the newly acquitted person make what could only be a symbolic appearance which would have no value whatsoever to the proceedings.  

The matters raised with regard to the implementation of our order, I think, are already contained in the way the order was formulated.  The effect of the order for immediate release means that the status of the Accused at the detention facility is that he's no longer a detained person.  But we recognise that in order for other steps to be taken, it is necessary for the registrar to take certain action.  And the decision -- and I'd invite the registrar to take that action.  I don't think it's necessary for us to make any order because it's understood that the action will be taken -- that the action that will be taken will be a reasonable action and that it will be taken within a reasonable time frame.  

With regard to the other submissions made by the Defence counsel, I don't think it is necessary for us to comment further on them at this stage.  

If there's no other business, I think we should simply adjourn our proceedings at this stage.  

We'll take our adjournment now.

ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III
