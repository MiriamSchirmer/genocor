Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. SOW: 
Sir -- good morning, Your Honours.  Mr. President, I would like to inform you that the witness would like to testify in full view.  You may want to put the question to the witness to ascertain this.  

Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Counsel Sow has informed us that the protection order that the Chamber made in your benefit, one element of which was to have your identity as a witness concealed from the public, is a matter which you have reconsidered, and you would like us to withdraw those -- those protective measures from you so that you could testify openly and in public.  

We now request that you comment upon that and let us know what is the position.  
THE WITNESS:
Indeed, that is my wish.  I elect to testify in public in full view so as to be in a position to state the truth, using my real identity. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
I'm obliged, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam -- Madam Registrar, would you be kind enough to administer the oath to the witness, please? 
(Declaration made by Jean Marie Vianney Ndagijimana in French)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Registrar, will you please inform the security and the technicians that this is not a protected witness and his images can be shown to the public on the screens available for that purpose?  
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Much obliged, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you'll give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you'll have to respond, first of all, to Mr. Sow, counsel on behalf of Édouard Karemera, who will begin his examination now.

A.	What month?  Because I changed addresses twice.  
Q.	Until July 1994.

A.	Ambassador of Rwanda to France until April 1994 -- end April; and minister of foreign affairs in the first government formed at the -- on the 19th of July up until October 1994. 
Q.	What is your current occupation? 
A.	I am a consultant. 
Q.	Witness, to ensure sound communication and for the appropriate form of address, I will call you "Your Excellency".  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	Your Excellency, I would like to ask you some questions about Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Do you know Mr. Édouard Karemera? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court for how long you've known him? 
A.	I have known him for 30 years exactly.  I met him for the first time at the end of our university studies, between March and April 1978.  So it totals 30 years. 
Q.	What is your assessment of Édouard Karemera as a minister, a member of government? 
A.	As a member of government, or minister, Édouard Karemera, as far as I'm concerned, is this top-ranking official, this great legal mind, this public servant whom I met when I first joined the civil service.  So beyond his ministerial and political positions or functions, Mr. Karemera was especially known to be a man of principle, a man of action who was entrusted with the impossible missions, especially the technical missions which others deemed impossible. 
Q.	Your Excellency, kindly tell the Court the part played by Édouard Karemera in connection with the advent, or establishment, of multiparty politics in Rwanda.  
A.	Let me point out that when the groundwork for the establishment of multiparty politics was launched, I was not in Rwanda.  But from the embassy in Paris where I was, I closely monitored the development of events; and especially the commission which was chaired by Édouard Karemera, if my memory serves me right.  

So it was under his auspices that one can really say that multiparty politics saw the light of day in our country.  And everyone at the time had welcomed the method applied by his commission; namely, a method that was based on broad-based consultations of all the political, social and professional circles, or stakeholders of our country.  That is especially what earned him the famous nickname of Rukusanya, meaning the gatherer, the one who unites.  That is, the person who brings people together and who also ensures technical coordination culminating in a consensus.  That was the nickname which Mr. Karemera earned when he had completed his mission and had submitted his report, which was lauded by all the political, professional and social leanings of our country.  

So, in short, he was a man of consensus. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Based on your description of Mr. Karemera, can he be considered a democrat? 
A.	In fact, that is why that assignment was entrusted with him.  Basically, because since I had known him as a young man and having seen him grow, I knew that Édouard Karemera was not very comfortable with the one-state -- one-party system, rather.  And I knew that because each time I returned to Rwanda on mission or on vacation, I paid him a courtesy call and, obviously, we would discuss the political situation of our country. 

And, Counsel, believe you me, that although he was minister, a member of cabinet, he continued to exercise discipline.  However, Édouard Karemera was a very open-minded person, and he said this to all and sundry.  And this is one of his qualities.  Some consider it a weakness, which I deem not true.  But to me, this is a great quality, a lofty one.  Because when Édouard Karemera has something to say, he says it.  He calls a spade a spade.  He is outspoken.  So even at the time of the single-party system, Édouard Karemera was among the young ministers who advocated change, and this led him into trouble with some circles.  And to me, summarily, he was a democrat.  
Q.	Thank you, Your Excellency.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	Kindly state your political affiliation prior to April 1994.  
A.	Immediately after the advent of multiparty politics, I joined the political party known as the MDR. 
Q.	And what was your position within that party? 
A.	I did not have a specific position.  Since I was not in Rwanda, I did not play any particular part in the organisation or in the circles of power of the MDR.  I was an ordinary member of that party. 
Q.	Thank you, Your Excellency.  Let us now address the war and its consequences in Rwanda.  

Your Excellency, can you tell the Court, as far as you know, who triggered the war in Rwanda in October 1990? 
A.	It is public knowledge the war that broke out on the 1st of October 1990 was launched from the neighbouring republic of Uganda.  It was a wide scale military attack led by senior officers of the Ugandan army with sophisticated equipment garnered from the pile of weaponry of the Uganda armed forces, and coordinated from Kampala by the general staff of the Uganda armed forces.  

Subsequently, it was established that among the assailants there was a large number of Rwandan refugees who had been living in Uganda for some 25 years, but who served in Ugandan army.  

So, as far as I'm concerned, it was a gross aggression.  Although, subsequently, the assailants were ultimately identified as Rwandan refugees.  
Q.	Tell me, Your Excellency, did Rwanda at the time find a solution to the problem of refugees before October 1990?  How, then, would you explain that attack?  
A.	I can try to explain it, but if you ask me to give you the in-depth and comprehensive reasons for that attack, you would agree with me that such an explanation can only be given by members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front themselves.  But if we try to analyse what happened, and if we rely on information I had in September 1990, you would indeed recall that a sustainable solution, a lasting solution, had just been agreed upon between Rwanda and neighbouring Uganda.  A mixed Rwandan-Ugandan commission was set up at both political and technical levels.  That commission had met on several occasions and agreed that a process be put in place, first of all, to identify potential sites in September 1990, and that representatives of the Rwandan refugees should participate in that process.  And it was also envisaged that refugees who wished to be repatriated would be repatriated, particularly in collaboration with the United Nations high commission for refugees, as well as other international organisations that were competent in that area.  

Let me give you a personal testimony which confirms what I am saying.  In July 1990, I was ambassador in Addis Abiba in Ethiopia.  And on the day the OAU annual summit was opened, the Ugandan president, Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, was elected chairman of the OAU summit.  I attended the summit.  The Ugandan -- the Rwandan delegation was led by the secretary general of the MRND, Mr. Bonaventure Habimana.  Habimana is spelt as follows:  H-A-B-I-M-A-N-A.  That delegation also included the Rwandan minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Casimir Bizimungu.  Bizimungu is spelt as follows:  B-I-Z-I-M-U-N-G-U.  

And in the evening, during the reception offered by President Mangisto, the Ugandan head of state, that is Museveni, asked Minister Bizimungu to come closer to him.  I was next to him.  And he informed him that in the two months that would follow, that is, in September or later, the discussions that he had had with his counterpart, Habyarimana, would be pursued.  And that a delegation of Rwandan refugees in Uganda, who would be led by General Fred Rwigema himself -- Rwigema is spelt as follows:  R-W-I-G-E-M-A -- that the refugees would come, and that it would be a group comprising refugees in Uganda, in Kenya, in Tanzania, in Burundi, and in Zaire.  And he requested that Rwanda should prepare the logistics for the transportation of those refugees, because the objective was to go and visit Rwanda, tour the country, take stock of the economic and democratic situation in Rwanda, with a view to going back to their countries of exile.  That is, the refugees going back to their countries of exile to inform the other refugees such that those refugees who wished to be repatriated would accept to be repatriated knowingly.  We're talking of a visit envisaged in September 1990.  

And in the evening, Minister Bizimungu phoned President Habyarimana from his room at the Hilton hotel in Addis Abiba, and I was with him.  And he called President Habyarimana to inform him of the good news, and he also requested that the president should issue effective orders for the preparation of the visit of our brothers who are refugees.  

As far as I was concerned, that stage was a decisive one.  Here we are with a message issued by a head of state, whom I respected very much and still respect today; that is, President Museveni.  And he was addressing that message to a neighbouring friendly country -- the head of state of a neighbouring friendly country.  So, there is no doubt that the stage was set.  President Museveni was ready, and the refugees were ready to go back to Rwanda in a peaceful process, and Rwanda was ready to open its doors to let those refugees in.  

But instead of that visit, you know what happened on the 1st of October 1990 at the time when the visit of the refugees was expected.  They came, and they were headed by General Fred Rwigema.  Unfortunately, they did not come on a friendly visit; they came with murderous weapons and attacked the country.  

You asked me to explain why they launched that attack.  I believe that one of the main reasons was that that war had been prepared for a very long time, and the refugees could not give up a project that they had prepared for years, a project in respect of which they had spent millions and had received various kinds of support from certain super powers, from the refugees themselves who funded that war.  And the main reason, of course, is the determination to take power by force and to dominate the country instead of returning as mere repatriated persons.  

In my opinion, those were the main reasons.  Now, there are other reasons, geo-political reasons.  I am personally convinced that Uganda was aware, and that President Museveni was aware, that repatriation by the force of arms was a good opportunity for him to get rid of those refugees who were already beginning to pose real political problems to the Rwandan army -- to the Ugandan army, I beg your pardon -- in Uganda.  Also, as the officers, the Rwandan officers in the Ugandan army, were using methods that were more than suspect.  And they had used those methods in the war against Ugandans in the north of the country.  

So, it was good riddance for the Ugandan government.  So that attack was in the interest of everyone except for Uganda -- except for Rwanda, I beg your pardon. 
Q.	Thank you, Your Excellency, for the clarifications you have just given.  

Your Excellency, let me put this question to you:  It was stated that prior to the attack of October 1990 there was social cohesion between the ethnic groups.  Following the attack launched in October 1990, from what you know, can you tell us what were relations between Hutus and Tutsis?  Was there still social cohesion between those ethnic groups after the attack of the 1st of October 1990? 
A.	We can say that the social fabric was shredded by force or -- a good reason.  One part of our country suspected the other, that is, the Hutus suspected the Tutsi for being behind that attack.  In fact, in October 1990 practically the majority of the officers and the rank and file of the rebel army, that is, the army of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, were of Tutsi origin.  Such that with considerable mix-up of the issues and manipulation, some people ended up thinking that all the Tutsis were supporting the RPF.  But that, also, followed -- flowed from the speech, the discourse, of the RPF.  Although, apparently, in the ranks of the RPF, there were some members of the Tutsi -- of the Hutu ethnic group, including President Kanyarengwe, Pasteur Bizimungu, and others.  It was clear, and the RPF said it, that they were coming to liberate the Tutsi, which they considered as being under the thumb of President Habyarimana.  

And that sent out a bad signal to the Rwandans such that the manipulation led to an explosion, an explosive situation pitting the various ethnic groups in Rwanda against one another, particularly against the Tutsi.  After the war, that is, the war of the 1st of October 1990, we can assert that the peace and harmony that had prevailed previously between the ethnic groups no longer prevailed as a result of the war.  
Q.	Your Excellency, in spite of the provocation by the RPF, the Rwandan government took initiatives to restore peace in Rwanda.  In your capacity as a diplomate, were you aware of such initiatives?  If yes, can you tell us about them?  And if need be, please give us some examples, one or two examples, quite simply.  I know your explanations can be very long, but may I request you to be concise, Witness? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Indeed, the Rwandan government took certain initiatives, particularly initiatives aimed at signing a ceasefire agreement with the invader.  And to initiate at the earliest opportunity negotiations to put an end, once and for all, to the war.  

I can cite, for instance, secret negotiations in which I personally participated in Paris.  Those negotiations were characterised as secret because there were no reports of those negotiations published subsequently.  Those negotiations were initially at the technical level, and subsequently at the political level.  And besides, they led to the drafting of the agenda for the negotiations that would be held in Arusha, subsequently, in Tanzania -- in Arusha, Tanzania.  

It would be fastidious to mention all the initiatives taken by the Rwandan government and by its diplomats; but you should bear in mind that the role I played in Paris, for instance, consisted in serving as an intermediary between France, which played some kind of role as a go-between initially.  Because the meetings in Paris were held at the behest of Rwanda on the initiative of France, and they were funded by France, of course, who funded the participation of both the RPF and members of the Rwandan government.  

So the other initiatives were taken by heads of states of the region, regional countries like President Mobutu; other initiatives were taken by Tanzanian president, and so on and so forth.  That was up until the Arusha Peace Accords were signed subsequently.  I do not know whether your question also has to do with the events of 1994.  I would also be ready to provide further information on that, if you so wish, Counsel.  
Q.	I thank you, Your Excellency.  The Arusha peace agreement was signed on the 4th of August 1993, but there were difficulties in terms of the implementation of those accords.  Can you tell us if you know what obstructed the implementation of those accords in order that peace should be restored to Rwanda? 
A.	I would say that I can mention several obstacles, because the obstacles were on several sides.  Some of the obstacles came from the side of the Rwandan government.  These obstacles were brought about by internal actors in Kigali.  But we also have obstacles that came from the side of the Rwandan Patriotic Front after the signing of the Arusha Peace Accords.  

The first obstacle, in my opinion, came up when it came to putting in place UNAMIR, United Nations mission.  Then we had the problem of determining countries that would be part of the mission.  That was a major problem.  Rwanda considered that some countries had de facto alliances with the RPF, and, so, those countries would not be acceptable as members of UNAMIR.  And the RPF thought that some countries had had special relations with the Rwandan government and it was, therefore, out of the question that they should be part of UNAMIR.  

A lot of time was wasted on discussions regarding those issues.  After UNAMIR was put in place, there were incidents in Kigali.  Those incidents were triggered by members of certain political party militias, as well as the attitude of some of the members of UNAMIR who gave the impression that they were supporting one side.  And they gave the impression that they were supporting the RPF.  

And then we had political obstacles when the time came to put in place the transitional government.  Political parties that were supposed to designate members to join that government split into various camps.  We have those in favour of the RPF and those against the RPF.  

The composition of the new parliament, which was supposed to follow, was completely disorganised, nothing could be done.  The situation before August 1993 had changed completely.  The divisions between -- or, within parties created a lot of tension in Kigali.  Such (unintelligible) conflicts were exploited by the different protagonists; particularly, the Rwandan Patriotic Front that wanted to destabilise the balance in the parliamentary majority in order to reduce the powers of President Habyarimana through an upset in the balance in parliament.

There was another major obstacle, which was such that at certain levels in certain institutions one political party was excluded, that is, the CDR, which at the end of the Arusha -- the signing of the Arusha peace agreement and the additional protocol thereto, was entitled to designate a member of parliament.  Some people thought that that party should not be a member of the transitional parliament.  That caused a lot of conflicts, a lot of hatred and confusion in the capital; quite simply, because the president of the court of cassation, that was the minister of foreign affairs at the time.  I know that because I was in regular contact with the minister to request him to allow the CDR to be given the seat in parliament, although I did not support its political ideology.  But one of the -- I said one CDR member of parliament is better than having people on the streets in Kigali.  So that was a major obstacle and it caused a lot of conflicts.  

Here again, the Rwandan Patriotic Front took advantage of that situation and manipulated parties that supported it; a situation that culminated in what we have in April 1994.  I didn't talk about the assassination of political figures in February; namely, Gatabazi and Bucyana.  That was also an obstacle which seriously impacted on the budding confidence that came into being after the signing of the Arusha Peace Accords, and would realise later on that those personalities were assassinated by the Rwandan Patriotic Front.

THE WITNESS:  (continued)
In fact, of course, the major obstacle was the assassination of President Habyarimana, who was supposed to -- the president of the country after the putting in place of the transitional government.  Of course, after his death, the Arusha Peace Accords were now meaningless, particularly since hostilities were unleashed immediately after the assassination of the president.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Thank you, Your Excellency.  

Your Excellency, the assassination of President -- did the assassination of the president unleash the killings? 
A.	Of course, Counsel.  It is evident, because in any event, without the assassination of President Habyarimana, there would never have been any systematic and generalised massacre in our country.  We might have had some conflicts, problems, but not massive assassination of that magnitude.  It is the political vacuum and military vacuum that led people to take advantage of that vacuum to commit the massacres that we know.  

And I'm of the opinion that the person who assassinated the president was aware of this.  As a matter of fact, the person who assassinated the president wanted to create a vacuum so that we could return to the starting block.  
Q.	Thank you, Your Excellency. 

Your Excellency, you -- certainly, by virtue of your duties, you were aware of various moves that were made by the Rwandan government at the security council, various letters that were written to draw the attention of this clergy council under the seriousness of the situation and the need to have an intervention force.
A.	What are you talking about, Counsel?  
Q.	I'm talking about the period after the events of April 1994 -- at the months of April, May, June 1994.  
A.	I know letters were sent to the security council.  I was in constant contact with my colleague in 
	New York, Ambassador Damascène Bizimama, spelling: B-I-Z-I-M-A-N-A.  And I knew what he was doing in New York, almost on a daily basis.  That was up to April, because, at the end of April, I was no longer a member of Rwandan diplomacy, but I was in constant contact with Ambassador Bizimana, who is a brother.  Spelling of Bizimana:  B-I-Z-I-M-A-N-A.  Yes, I know there were initiatives; letters were written.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, I would like, with your permission, to have Exhibit No. 1, which is a letter of 
2 May 1994, that Ambassador Bizimana, who was Rwandan representative of the United Nations, sent to the president of the Security Council at the Hague.  

Do you have that document, please?  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
That's affirmative, and it's been put to the witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Counsel.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I am on the first page, first paragraph of the document.  The following is written:  "On order from the Rwandan government, I have the honour to draw the attention of the Security Council on the need to envisage immediate action to halt hostilities which have caused numerous victims in terms of human lives and material damages and others, which are out of any form of proportion." 

In the same document, the writer describes all the violence in Rwanda, and states, precisely, "There are preoccupations with bringing this violence to an end."

Now, Your Excellency, I would like to put the following question to you:  How come that in spite of this letter sent to the Security Council, all these initiatives never were measures allowing to the halting of these murderous activities made?  
A.	In this letter, in particular, I'm not going to comment.  I was no longer ambassador of Rwanda.  But I can say -- confirm, as a matter of fact, that efforts were deployed early in April.  I can inform you that, between 10 and 17 April, my embassy and myself, in particular, served as an intermediary of the Rwandan general staff, that is, the FAR, and the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  Because, at that time, the main preoccupation of the FAR was to cease the fighting as a single condition for an end to the massacres; in any event, with regard to the feasibility of any action to bring the massacres to a halt.  

And so, at the request of the general staff, I got in contact with representatives of the RPF in Europe and in North America, and I told them:  The RPF has to agree to a halt in the fighting, a truce of at least 72 hours, to enable the FAR to have troops available.  Because, at the time, all -- the army was resisting the RPF attacks.  You would understand that, at the time, it was practically impossible to get people out of the front to send them to the -- to Kigali.  

And the RPF's response was categorical and negative.  It was out of the question to have a truce, to momentarily halt hostilities in order to halt the massacres.  And my -- the people I discussed with told us that:  Our goal is to take over Kigali and take over power, and we will stop at nothing.  At the time, they said FAR members had assassinated Habyarimana in order to stop the process of setting up the new transitional government, and that the RPF did not agree to halt the war; that the FAR and the 
Rwandan government, that is, the Kambanda government, had to do what it could to stop the massacres. 

Of course, I sent my report to the Rwandan general staff.  The same efforts were also made by my colleagues, especially the ambassador, Kampala, who met President Museveni on several occasions and asked him to pressurise the Rwandan Patriotic Front, also in view of a truce.  That is what I can tell you in this regard, Counsel.  So efforts were deployed.  

Now, from the government side, I didn't have a lot of relations with the Kambanda government, especially after they retreated to Kigarama.  I believe they stayed in Kigali up to, I think, 
the 12th or 13th of April, and then they went to Gitarama, where they worked.  So I had direct relations, rather, with the Rwandan armed forces, the FAR. 
Q.	Thank you, Your Excellency.  After the victory of the RPF, the first government was set up, and you stated that you were part of the government in the capacity of minister of foreign affairs. 

Can you tell us, Your Excellency, how long you remained in government?  
A.	I stay there till the 10th of October 1994, that is to say, two months and a few days.  
Q.	Could you state to the Chamber the reasons for -- the reason why you left the government?  
A.	There are numerous reasons.  You know, after the 1994 apocalypse, during which I lost many family members, friends, everything was allowed (sic).  We absolutely had to rebuild that country.  And we had to fix everything that was broken; build spirits, especially, and reconcile Rwandans.  

In July 1994, the prime minister designate, Mr. Twagiramungu, Faustin, asked me to be part of his government.  And before this government was installed, the candidate of the MDR, our party, had been turned down by the authorities of the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  And at that level, there was a hitch, because I didn't understand our party.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
T-W-A-G-I-R-A-M-U-N-G-U.  
THE WITNESS: 
So, I was wondering how a party, which was part of a government, could turn down the candidates of another party.  And, with the assistance of Mr. Twagiramungu on the 17th of July, and with the assistance of my friend, Mr. Sentashonga (sic); spelling: S-E-N-T-A-S-H-O-N-G-A (sic), Sentashonga (sic), he explained to me that it was absolutely necessary for me to return and for us to build a proper democracy in our country.  

Now, you understand that there was a problem there, that is, that the Arusha Accords had been put to question by the RPF.  As a matter of fact, when I arrived to Kigali, I noticed that the Arusha Accords were empty, vacuous of their main objective.  Both the spirit and the letter, modifications had been made to crucial parts, to entire chapters of that new constitution.  Because the Arusha Accords, indeed, had to replace the constitution during the transitional period, especially the designation of a body that was not stipulated under the accords, especially the position of vice president, the mix-up of the army and the RPF taking over what belonged to the FAR as a right.  And during cabinet meetings, 
the idea -- it appeared to me -- was not an integration of both armies, as agreed in Arusha.  

I'd begun to feel that I was a minister under supervision.  All the proposals that I tried to make to strengthen Rwandan diplomacy was thrown out.  Proposals to the appointment of diplomats were, on five occasions, rejected by my RPF colleagues during cabinet meetings.  Why?  I can't say, except that, at some point in time, one of my colleagues stated openly that there were too many Hutus in my proposals; that is to say, out of 70 appointed diplomats, there were about 37 Hutus for 32 or 33 Tutsis.  And I was told that was unacceptable, that I was beginning to put on the Habyarimana system, which excluded Tutsi.  I told them that that was in line with some facts, especially considering the fact that this was nomination depending on political parties.  I wasn't looking for candidates.  They were proposed to me by political parties afterwards, and most of all.

At the same time, I received reports from Rwandans returning from regions which were 
occupied -- areas which were occupied by the RPF, and who told us about massacres, systematic massacres and significant massacres of the Hutu people everywhere where the RPF army passed by.  

And lastly, in September 1994, this was confirmed to me by UN delegations under Mr. Kofi Annan, who was the deputy under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and who was leading a strong delegation, including an expert who had been appointed a while ago to investigate the security situation in Rwanda.  That was on 19th September.  

So all the oral reports I had received from refugees returning from the RPF-occupied region were confirmed to me by Mr. Kofi Annan, who handed to me a report written by his -- Mr. Robert Gersony, his expert.  Mr. Gersony is an American expert, and who was funded by the USAID, and provided to the high commission for refugees.  Mr. Gersony had toured some préfectures, especially those in the east, since June -- July.  And, together with his team, they had heard many testimonies about people who lived in the places where the acts had happened, and who were saying that it was massive massacre of the Hutu people.  At the time his estimate was that 30,000 Hutus had been massacred in the préfectures that he had visited only, and this had been done by the RPF.  

I, who in April 1994, had fought against the massacre of Tutsis in Rwanda; I, who had finally condemned the Kambanda government for what I considered to be its passiveness concerning the massacre of the Tutsis, there I was in a government where it clearly seemed that the army, the new government army, was busy in systematically eliminating the people of the other ethnic groups -- ethnic group, the Hutu ethnic group.  

After having discussed this with the prime minister, Twagiramungu, and with some of my colleagues, and having noticed that the government was beginning to pressurise -- especially, the RPF was pressurising -- the high commissioner for the refugees' unfriendly government for this report never to be published, in all honesty, I decided not to be an accomplice to these massacres.  

And that is why, seizing the opportunity of a mission to the United States in the company of President Bizimungu, to whom I rarely discussed this report, but who, also during our mission, was carrying out strong lobbying for the Gersony report to be sent to the back burner, I decided to dissociate myself from the massacre of my people and to stay outside to be able to talk about this new genocide and inform the world about it; the genocide perpetrated by the regime, the government, I was supposed to be part of.  

So that was the final reason why I decided, in all honesty, to leave the government.  I would like to state further that, on several occasions apart from -- and precisely for the reasons that I enumerated to you, I decided not to take the oath of office -- an oath of office which was modified to mean that you -- we were showing our allegiance to the RPF.  And so up to the time when I left Rwanda, I had never taken the oath of office.  That is what I have to say, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you, Your Excellency.  And thank you for your courage.  
MR. SOW: 
I would like to have admitted three documents:  The first of which is a document from Jeune Afrique.  It is number 2 of the documents that I disclosed.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	I would have you take a look at it and see -- tell me if you recognise that document.  It's an interview made by -- made by -- I can't say if it is a gentleman or a lady -- (inaudible) by Géraldine Faes (phonetic).  Could you tell us, after examining this document, if you are the person who granted that interview? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  In November, that is to say, one month after I went on exile, I granted an interview to Madam Géraldine Faes of Jeune Afrique, a newspaper.  In that interview, I talked about what I had just told you, that is, on the massacres that were perpetrated by the RPF on the Hutu civilian people.  I talked about several other things, but that was the main thing I talked about.  And I also reviewed the situation of Tutsi survivors, because, contrary to what people believe, by the time the RPF arrived, they persecuted them just as they did the Hutu population. 

MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, as the witness recognises an interview, I would like the Court -- I pray the Chamber to have it admitted as evidence under an exhibit number that I would like to ask Mr. Issa to state to us. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I thought the application-in-chief, in respect of the interview, might be considered an application to present into evidence what is, in England, referred to as a self-serving statement.  However, what Mr. Sow might be able to say is that the article demonstrates that there is no recent fabrication on the part of the witness.  So it might be admissible under that heading.  But simply to put it in because it's something that the witness said previously, would not be appropriate.  It's a matter for Your Honours.  I don't have any strong objection.  But it's the question:  Under what heading does it become admissible?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Sow, have you come to the end of your examination now?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Your Honour.  I would like to submit the other two documents for admission, and I will be done.  

But with regard to that document, it states facts -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I didn't want to hear argument now.  You have made your application, and we will deal with it on 
Monday morning.  Just indicate the documents that you wish to have admitted, and we will see if the Prosecutor objects to any of them, and then we will discuss that on Monday morning.  It's already 
12 o'clock, and we'd like to complete the testimony of this witness.  

You said there were other documents you wish to have admitted.  Could you identify the documents you wish to have admitted?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Your Honour.  It is document number 3.  It is a communiqué that was made by the witness, and I would like it to be shown to him so that he identifies it.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, did you identify that document, as well as your signature?  
A.	Yes, it is, indeed, a document I signed, Counsel.  And I can recognise my signature.  
MR. SOW: 
There, Your Honour, I would pray you to have this document admitted as Exhibit -- as evidence.  

Your Honour, I would like to put a last question after that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Your Excellency, you talked about Mr. -- Mr. Sendashonga, and stated he was your friend.  What happened to Mr. Sendashonga?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Spelling of Sendashonga, S-E-N-D-A-S-H-O-N-G-A, for the record.
THE WITNESS:
My former colleague resigned from government a few months after I did in 1995.  He went on exile to Kenya and he lived in Nairobi with his family at the time he was assassinated by a commander of the RPF, identified as such by the Kenyan government, indeed, by a member of the Rwandan embassy in Nairobi -- one year, sometime after he went into exile. 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I am done with my examination-in-chief. 

Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Morley -- sorry.  

Are there any other -- any other -- any of the Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
My apologies, Mr. President.  I have no questions for this witness.  Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, my learned colleague, Félix Sow, has raised the questions I had planned to raise.  And to avoid any repetition, I'm not going to examine this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Morley, how much time do you anticipate?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm hoping not long.  Can I suggest half an hour, but not be held to that?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  


CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you see me and can you hear me?  
A.	I can hear you loud and clear.  
Q.	The massacres of the Tutsis, which took place after the death of the president, were perpetrated largely by the MRND's Interahamwe; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Partially, yes, because there were other forces -- there were militia from other political parties.  But, generally, that is what is of public knowledge.  
Q.	And you spoke out against the Kambanda government presiding over the Interahamwe massacre of the Tutsis; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Indeed.  
Q.	You spoke out on the radio in France, condemning the Interahamwe massacre of the Tutsis being presided over by the Kambanda government; isn't that right? 
A.	I did so, and I have not stopped doing so.  
Q.	You were of the view that the Kambanda government was illegitimate and unconstitutional; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Indeed.  It was my view that some provisions of the Arusha Accord -- or, the -- as a matter of fact, the Arusha Accord wasn't such.  However, the key provisions were not implemented fully.  And that also obtained, in fact, as many members of the transition government, designated members, and members of parliament, had just been murdered.  

I was aware -- I was informed that the designated prime minister was still alive.  And as far as I was concerned, there was no need to appoint another prime minister, as the prime minister designate, as per the Arusha Accords, was still alive.  That is why I considered that government as inconsistent with the Arusha Accords and the provisions thereof.  
Q.	You were aware of the murder of Hutu moderates having taken place after the death of the president; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	I was, indeed, aware that several Hutu and Tutsi political figures had been killed following the assassination of the president of the republic.  
Q.	You were concerned that the Kambanda government was constituted, largely, of Hutu extremists; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	It depends on what you mean by "extremists".  I know -- I knew that several members of that government had been pulled out of their beds, just like that, to join the cabinet.  And I knew a good number -- and I still know some members of that cabinet who were not extremists.  It wasn't a government that can be deemed an extremist government.  The prime minister, himself, wasn't an extremist.  To the best of my knowledge, as of the date of his appointment, Mr. Jean Kambanda was not known to me as an extremist.  
Q.	You fought publicly against what was the passiveness of the Kambanda government presiding over the Interahamwe massacres of Tutsis; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Let me make myself clear.  A while ago I pointed out the efforts made by government -- or, in fact, within the armed forces of Rwanda -- to put an end to the massacres by ending the fighting.  However, I also felt that government was not doing enough in respect of some of the decisive issues so as to put an end, specifically, to the massacres.  I am referring here to the neutralisation, as it were, of some media organs which did not heed to what I consider the minimum appeasement requirements; namely, to put an end to hatred, to appease minds, and also to put an end to the killings.  

At the time I was of the opinion that government had all the resources and means to neutralise 
Radio télévision des Mille Collines, and I had suggested that it be done as a sign of good will.  I even went as far as suggesting to friendly countries that they bring pressure to bear accordingly so as to supplement the efforts of government and the armed forces, so as to bring an end to the fighting.  

Since that requirement wasn't met, I considered that there was a bad political faith, and I found that inadmissible.  I was told that the government and the Interahamwe militia did not exercise any good faith, and I couldn't tolerate that.  And, once again, as per my values, my principles and my education, I couldn't stay in a system which I believed did not make all the efforts to protect the population.  And that is what I felt in April 1994.  
Q.	You have described Édouard Karemera as, "a man of action who can be outspoken and who can call a spade a spade."  It's right, is it not, that you would have expected him to do more to curb the excesses of the Interahamwe while he was part of the government; wouldn't you?  
A.	Counsel, you know, between what one thinks -- wishes, and the fact on the ground, I should say there is a whole gulf.  It is a big divide.  

Let me give you an example.  For at least a week, my correspondent at the general staff was no other than General Marcel Gatsinzi, spelt G-A-T-S-I-N-Z-I, Gatsinzi.  General Gatsinzi had been appointed chief of staff of the Rwandan armed forces.  And we usually discussed with his colleagues the ways and means of putting an end to the fighting and to the killings.  

Mr. Gatsinzi, who, as I speak, is minister for defence in Kigali, if you were to put that question to him, he would confirm that he personally told me on several occasions that the Rwandan armed forces was helpless in those circumstances; and if the fighting did not come to an end, it did not have the powers to coerce the draft (sic) and rebel movement of the Interahamwe to put an end to the massacres, because the situation had gone out of hand, it was out of control, unless there had been a cessation of hostilities that would have enabled the army to take control.  

And it wouldn't have been a minister who had sought refuge at Gitarama unless -- call a spade a spade.  The minister had taken refuge in Gitarama and could not set foot in Kigali.  He had control over the media, and they had to make due with the resources at hand to check the movements of the RPF.  A minister, a prime minister, or even the president of the republic himself, could have poured fuel onto fire over that fear of the situation, but could not have put an end to the killings of 1994.  

I am confident that Minister Karemera was one of those who sought to bring -- restore calm, who sent out messages for peace, who called for a national conference, especially in his own préfecture.  Ever since we were young men, that préfecture is a high-breed préfecture; namely, Kibuye, which is a native préfecture of Mr. Karemera.  I believe -- I am sure that Minister Karemera did his level best where he was, that is, in Kibuye, or within government.  

The prime minister, Kambanda, was not a government which had powers as a government ought to exercise.  It was a government that had gone into internal exile, and, at any time, expected to be captured by the RPF or even killed by those mad young persons, as some of the Interahamwe believed that the ministers were not doing anything to weed out the RPF.  And today there are testimonies.  We know what transpired.  Rwandan generals were helpless as far as the Interahamwe were concerned, as the Interahamwe were drunk, they were furious, and would not wait to shoot at the officers of the Rwandan armed forces.  And that is the reality.  

And as far as Karemera is concerned, let me say this:  As far as I know him, he has never nursed any anti-Tutsi feelings.  I worked with him at the ministry of the interior.  I was his deputy while he was minister of public service employment and labour.  At the time when the quarter system and the original balance system was enforced, I never saw Minister Karemera take it out on any ethnicity.  On the contrary, I saw him fight to ensure that the smaller préfectures, which were not adequately represented in the administration -- yes, I actually saw him promote Tutsi public servants whom he believed were proficient enough to deserve promotion instead of being considered as second-rate citizens.  Yes, I saw him advocate for the quality of Rwandan public servants and Rwandan citizens before the law.  Édouard Karemera is not anti-Tutsi.  On the contrary, indeed.  That much, I have to say, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, let's look at the passivity of the government that he was a member of.  You've described how it was "acting in bad faith."  Those were your words.  You were calling for an end to the Interahamwe massacres, and you were concerned that the government was acting in bad faith.  You were calling for them to shut down Radio RTLM, and the government did not do that; it was "acting in bad faith."  

Help us, please, with what the bad faith was, as you perceived it.  It wasn't doing enough to stop these massacres, was it?  
A.	I said, as far as I was concerned, the government in April 1994 -- while I was in Paris, I believed that it was at least possible to stop the negative or (inaudible) broadcast by RTLM, and I still believed so.  I did not talk about bad faith, per se, but I was referring to inadequate action to create conducive conditions for appeasement.  I was referring to the stigmatisation of part of the Rwandan population by RTLM, and Radio Muhabura, which was not a state-controlled government -- a state-controlled organ, but it acted along the same lines as RTLM.  
Q.	Well, the government couldn't close down Muhabura, but it could close down RTLM.  And you've just told us that you still believe that to be true, that the government could have closed down the hate speech which was being broadcast, fueling the massacres on RTLM.  

Now, what explanation can possibly exist in your mind that the government, empowered to close down that radio station, did not do so; other than that the government was tolerating the massacres taking place at the hands of the MRND's Interahamwe?  
A.	Counsel, it is good that you put that question.  One of the answers given to me at the time by Kigali was that RTLM was responding to provocations from Radio Muhabura; and that if the RTLM was expected to change its editorial policy, or change its broadcast, Radio Muhabura had to do the same.  And I said, a while ago, that it was not an option because -- especially as far as RPF was concerned.  

And let me point out that the written proposals from the Rwandan armed forces to the RPF, courtesy of our embassy in Uganda and forwarded to President Museveni to our embassy in Paris, among other things, there was a need for confidence building and also the creation of a conducive atmosphere.  And these proposals were rejected by the RPF.  But it doesn't mean that no measures were taken against RTLM, but this serves as an explanation, at least partially. 
Q.	Well, respectfully, I suggest it doesn't serve as any explanation at all.  What possible reason could there be for the government, with the power to close down RTLM, which we agree was fueling the massacres, not to close down RTLM, other than that it was tolerating the massacres?  

Are you seriously suggesting that they let RTLM run because Muhabura was running?  And if that's the position, then they are encouraging the massacres.  What explanation can there be for not closing down that radio station when they had to power to do so?  
A.	You know, Counsel, the issue about RTLM will continue to be mysterious, because, technically speaking, the government did not have the means to stop or close down RTLM.  I was told that RTLM had exceptional mobile equipment and it could broadcast from any point.  It had a mobile station and it could broadcast from any location.  

And let me point out that between April, and even July 1994, there was a European government that suggested to jam the waves of RTLM with the support of the United Nations, based on the fact that this radio station incited the massacres of Rwandans by Rwandans.  And it was yet another government, the U.S. government, for that matter, that opposed the idea of jamming.  This is also common knowledge.  Why?  I do not know.  Yet, it was a very simple task from a technical and technological standpoint.  
Now, to say that the Rwandan government, which was not as endowed as the European governments who had made the proposals, was unable to do so, I would like to revisit the very nature of that government, which was virtually non-existent, and which had to cope with pressure from different circles, and it really did not exercise the powers it claimed to have at the time.  

And my explanation is that it was due to the bad faith of certain persons who had some vested interest.  I cannot apportion blame on the government, as the government did its level best to put an end to the war and to put an end to the killings without having made an effort to close down the RTLM broadcast, because it was said it was impossible and that the first step to closing down RTLM entailed the closure of Radio Muhabura.  And I think these -- the government was overwhelmed.  The government was overtaken by the events and, therefore, did not have adequate resources to exercise its duties. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm afraid that, at my age, I have to insist on a short emergency break.  So we'll rise for a few minutes.

(Court resumed at 1245H)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Morley, we can hardly see you. 
MR. MORLEY: 
You can hardly see me?  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, without your head piece. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Forgive me.  I am surprised Your Honour can even hear me, never mind see me.  Thank you.  

It occurs to me I haven't actually distributed the paper work, so perhaps Mr. Issa 
(microphones overlapping) will, in the usual way.  And as it is being distributed I will continue with the witness. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's leave aside blaming the Americans or Europeans or other countries for not jamming RTLM.  Let's just talk about the interim government.  All they had to do was send along four soldiers to the building in Kigali and close it down and make an announcement on Radio Rwanda or issue a directive, RTLM is ordered closed.  Whether or not RTLM then became an illegal radio station broadcasting from vehicles running around the countryside of Rwanda, we can leave to one side, the government never actually acted.  It wouldn't have taken much, would it?  Four soldiers, go to the building, close it down.  You know, they could have done that.  And the fact they didn't showed this passivity which you denounce.  It's right, isn't it?  
A.	I am convinced, and I truly think that in early April there were means for neutralising Radio RTLM physically.  Now, I have condemned the attitude of the government at the time which I considered as passive.  I did not have occasion to talk to Édouard Karemera in April.  I believe he had no powers to stop RTLM from broadcasting.  That is my opinion.  Subsequently, the government went to Gitarama, and, as you know, RTLM was broadcasting from practically everywhere.  I believe that Minister Karemera, when he took office, had no control either over the  massacres, in general, apart from his ability to call for calm, nor did he have any powers to neutralise Radio RTLM.  I do not speak for the entire government, but I believe that Minister Karemera did not have the powers in April 1994 to stop RTLM broadcasting in any manner whatsoever. 
Q.	Karemera became the minister of the interior.  It would have been his job to close down RTLM and in order to restore calm as the minister of the interior.  You might have expected him to go on the radio, perhaps, and order the RTLM radio to close.  We have got plenty of examples of Karemera and other ministers of RTLM, but nobody at any stage ordering the radio closed.  How about simply announcing it should close?  An expression of will on the part the government, whether RTLM agreed or not.  Don't you find that surprising?  There you are writing to government, to tell them to close down RTLM, they never even tried.  
A.	I did not write to the government.  I spoke by phone in the first days of April.  And subsequently, I stepped down on the 27th of April.  So after the 27th of April, I was no longer at the embassy and I did not have direct contacts with Édouard Karemera when he was minister of interior. 
Q.	So do you agree, you can't help him after the 27th of April?  He is on his own? 
A.	I have not understood the question, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	You mentioned you stepped down.  In fact, you were dismissed by the interim government.  I mean no criticism of you.  But it's right isn't it that on the 27th of April the interim government formally dismissed you as the ambassador to France and various other European countries because you had denounced the failure of the Kambanda government to curb the Interahamwe massacres.  It's right, isn't it?  They dismissed you? 
A.	Quite correct, Prosecutor.  But to the best of my recollection, Mr. Édouard Karemera was not a member of government at the time. 
Q.	But he was in charge of the MRND; along with his good friend.  Do you know those two individuals, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, I know those two persons, Prosecutor. 
Q.	And would you agree with me that like Karemera, they are men of action who can be outspoken? 
A.	Men of action in what sense?  
Q.	Well, it's your expression in describing Karemera.  So whatever sense you like, really, because it's your words.  They are similar to Karemera, powerful, men of action who are capable of being outspoken.  Or whether a -- mice, hiding in a corner? 
A.	In referring to men of action, it was in the introduction when you were expecting me to talk about Édouard Karemera.  I said he was a minister who remained a technician, a man of action, a dynamic person.  A man of action in the sense that he was someone who acted in the interests of the country.  He is not someone who acts at a low level.  I completed my statement by saying that he was someone who would call a spade a spade and wouldn't refrain from calling the truth the truth.  That is what I meant by using the word, "man of action."  And I added that he was a man of action and a man of principle. 
Q.	And wouldn't the same apply to the other leaders of the MRND, Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse? 
A.	The same thing in what sense, Counsel for the Prosecution?  Because I have been called today to testify in the case of Karemera.  I have told you that I know Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Nzirorera.  I know Mr. Nzirorera because he was a minister for a long time.  I know Mr. Ngirumpatse because we were colleagues.  He was a former ambassador.  Very eminent ambassador.  But I know him less well than Édouard Karemera, who was also a friend and a colleague. 
Q.	And they, too, Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse, like Karemera, were, men of action, capable of being outspoken, acting in the interests of the country as leaders, showing leadership, wouldn't that be right? 
A.	Well, that is quite true.  In any case, at a time when I knew them, they worked with conviction, and I believe they did so in the higher interest of our country.  I took over from Ngirumpatse as Rwandan ambassador in Ethiopia, and all I found was praise for him.  He was an ambassador who was held in high esteem wherever he went.  And in Rwanda, I don't think he changed when he took another office.  As for Mr. Nzirorera, I knew him less well than the two others. 
Q.	And isn't it surprising that not only did Mr. Nzirorera not go on the air, but neither did Ngirumpatse or Nzirorera to declared to the country, as men of action and outspoken, that RTLM, must cease broadcasting, must close down, bearing in mind that Ngirumpatse at the time was a special advisor to the president, Sindikubwabo?  Wouldn't you have expected these men of action, if genuinely trying to stop their MRND Interahamwe's massacres, to say something about closing down RTLM or does it tell you they never said anything about it? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, as I stated a while ago, the situation in Rwanda was such that we have to be very modest even 14 years later.  Let me give you quite a pathetic example.  The Chairman of the Interahamwe militia, called Robert Kajuga, a young Tutsi from a good family, who led the Interahamwe right up to the end, right into exile, he did everything, according to reports I received from my friends.  He did everything to save his family.  He, who was the chairman of the Interahamwe, he was an Apparatchik.  His parents and the children of his brothers and sisters were all massacred by the Interahamwe, who did not even obey the instructions of their chairman.  

Now, everyone is aware today that Robert Kajuga had more power than all the generals of the Rwandan army put together. 

	Cross check, Prosecutor, but he was not able to save members of his own family.  Before Robert Kajuga in 1994, Édouard Karemera was nothing.  I can assure you.  And even that man who was one of the most powerful people in 1994.  Say, that he -- this is the person who was the 
	most -- one of the most powerful in 1994, was not able to save even members of his own family.  This example, Counsel for Prosecution, is a testimony to the fact that many members of the government and many members of the MRND were powerless.  Even at the higher levels of MRND in 1994, being a high level official, didn't mean anything.  They were members of my party of origin, MDR.  These people after the death of President Habyarimana became more powerful than senior officials of the MRND, the leadership of the MRND.  The hierarchy of the party was completely overturned, and power was now being wielded by little bandits, who left no stone unturned to loot people's property, to kill people, just to prove that the situation had overturned, that they were the ones now in power and that they had influence and the power.  You can ask people, and they will tell you that even senior officials of the army were almost leached by the Interahamwe.  They tried to save people at roadblocks manned by the young militias, but they were not able to save people they wanted to evacuate.  This, unfortunately, is a reality; power was wielded on the streets and elsewhere.  It was wielded on the hills.  It was, of course manipulated by some people but you cannot say that.  Any organ or any member of the MRND could have stopped the Interahamwe.  Even their president -- even their chairman was not able to save his family members while he was in Kigali. 
Q.	But wouldn't you have expected them to try and make some sort of announcement to say that the Interahamwe should disband, that the roadblocks should disband?  Perhaps even order the army to arrest the Interahamwe or shoot a few. Wouldn't you expect some attempt on the part of the leadership of the MRND, whose offspring were busy committing most of the massacres to say, something, to announce something, to order something done about disbanding the Interahamwe?  And what does it tell you that they never said anything? 
A.	I received reports to the effect that eminent members of the MRND, including even some ministers, went on tours in the country, in Butare for instance, to call on the population not to stigmatise the Tutsi, to remind the people that the Tutsi were not the enemy of the country and that they shouldn't engage in massacres, mixing up the RPF and the Tutsi population.  I received reports on that.  Prosecutor, if you cross-check, you will find that that was the case.  

Now, there were hundreds of people who were killed.  Hundreds of thousands of people killed.  It was a huge wave without any orders issued at the level of the army.  Nobody could stop them.  Without the use the Rwandan armed forces, it was not the senior officials of the army, it wasn't Ngirumpatse, it wasn't Karemera who could have stopped the massacres from being committed.  Believe me, they, themselves could have gotten killed.  The préfets, the generals and others, had nothing other than their titles.  They had no real power.  Some of them, perhaps, did have, but not Édouard Karemera, in April 1994.  

Already, Counsel for the Prosecution, there's one important factor that we have to take into consideration, if you try to understand the Rwandan reality, even prior to the death of the president.  As of June 1991, being president, secretary general or any other member of a political party had no meaning outside of the party.  Before June 1994, during the multiparty era, yes, being a secretary general of the MRND meant being the second most important person in the country.  It meant that you had power, the means and administration at your disposal.  But after 1991, after the advent of multiparty politics, the national president of the MRND, had very little, power, vis-à-vis the other parties.  It doesn't mean that he didn't have the means to act, but you cannot consider him as the leader of a one-party state as had been the case prior to June 1991.  But after the 6th of April 1994, the situation changed even more.  There were members of the MRND who were assassinated, as well, by other members of the MRND, by the Interahamwe militias. 
Q.	Thank you, for that very long answer.  But in part of it you gave him away.  You said without orders to the army they could do nothing about the Interahamwe.  Well, how do you explain they were never ordered to do anything about the Interahamwe?  Bear in mind, as you, yourself, has described it; these are kids, some of whom are drugged.  They are no much for soldiers properly trained and armed.  How do you explain no orders were given by the interim government to disband the Interahamwe.  No attempt to use the force of arms available to the government in the form of the army to disband the Interahamwe? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I already stated, the major concern of government in 1994 was primarily to resist the RPF.  Because upon the death -- the announcement of the death of the president, hostilities began on all fronts.  And RPF had tens of thousands of soldiers, including infiltrators found on hills and here and there in the country.  Brigades, which were very active, though invisible.  So this first decision that was taken was general mobilisation to halt RPF advances.  Irrespective of the country anywhere in the world, government would react in the same manner at the beginning.  

Now when massacres created confusion - confusion, which I must say, was welcomed by the 
	RPF -- well, it was almost impossible to take people away from the front because that is what it meant, Prosecutor.  It means we had to let the RPF in.  Is there any government in this world which would do that?  I think not.  In any case, with regard to the army, even though there were isolated cases of soldiers participating in the massacres, the vast majority of the army stayed at the front and resisted for three months without weapons, without ammunition.  Because you may recall there was an embargo.  Weapons were controlled by the MINAUR, while the RPF was supplied from its former position in Rwanda which provided them weapons and troops.  And it continued to advance.  The Rwandan army was at the front and was retreating gradually.  You are not going to ask soldiers who are in trenches and under bombardments to expose themselves and to be shot down, and to send them on mission on hills.  Humanly this is impossible -- is mission impossible.  

From Paris, where I was, when I saw certain things, I wondered, why should we take 1,000 people and -- when there's a crack in their defence, it becomes a major point of entry?  That aspect has to be taken into account.  That there was no physical and material possibility.  Without a stop in the fighting massacres could not be stopped.  

The answer that RPF gave me in April -- because I felt this was some sort of emotional 
	argument -- they said, look at our relatives, they are being massacred on the hills.  Because remember, Prosecutor, I also have Tutsi family and I lost many Tutsi members of my family.  I had this feeling, by saying to RPF, Tutsi are being massacred, just give the Rwandan army 72 hours for it to show proof of its goodwill.  And the RPF emissaries told us that the Tutsis within the country were of no concern to them and that they had chosen their camp by staying in Uganda in '59, and that -- the day the RPF people were fighting for the repatriation of Tutsi refugees.  

So, bottom line, I understood on that day that the massacres of the Tutsis within were of no use to the RPF.  That, as a matter of fact, it was useful to their military strategy.  Because the more the combat lasted, and the more massacres were perpetrated, the more the Rwandan army was accused by the international community and the Rwandan army was disorganised because it was on two fronts, the military front against the RPF, and the civilian front against the massacres in the country.  Believe me, Prosecutor, when I arrived Kigali at the end of July that is the feeling I had.  It was celebration.  The deaths were in the past.  Finally, RPF was in power.  It isn't a reason to exonerate anyone whatsoever from the massacre of the Tutsi, Prosecutor.  But it is a collection of facts which you have to put together to have a better understanding of the situation of Rwanda by saying both in terms of law and through analysis, to state who is responsible for what in Rwanda in 1994 events.  

I was also told that Tutsis had been taken hostage and that they had to be released.  Do you think it is appropriate to tell the hostage-taker to kill the hostages and to wash their hands afterwards and say that was it?  That is the scenario.  RPF assassinated our president, Habyarimana, and pushed people to commit crimes, and pushed the Rwandan army to act, to carry out deeds or acts on the victims.  That is it, Prosecutor. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Morley, your half hour is -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, I know, but Your Honour can see the way this is developing.  I am going to finish quite shortly.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we have video footage of the army working with the Interahamwe outside the city of Kigali, a cafe in Kigali and even somebody being intercepted and consequently brought to the army by the Interahamwe, and there's a decision taken to execute him.  So, what do you make the army working with the Interahamwe at a roadblock in Kigali, if the army was so busy fighting with the RPF and, couldn't do anything about the Interahamwe?  What do you make of that?  There's the army working with the Interahamwe.  Oh, dear what do you say? 
A.	I don't know what video you are referring to.  I don't know how many members of the FAR are 
	found -can be seen on that video.  And I stated clearly a while ago that you had isolated cases, especially from the Presidential Guard at the beginning of the night of the 6th to the 7th, and subsequently isolated members of the President Guard took part in the massacres.  And I didn't refuse it.  But you cannot, and I shall -- I can never say that the Rwandan army participated in the massacres.  That is out of the question.  

Listen, the best witness, one of the best witnesses alive is General Gatsinzi, Marcel.  He is in Kigali.  Ask him if he had ever given orders to murder civilian population.  Ask him if the army that he headed participated in massacres.  If he said so, I might have to believe, because I worked close with him in April 1994, him and his colleagues of the general staff.  And never did I have the feeling nor the sentiment that that army wanted to carry on neither the war nor the massacre of the civilians.  It was quite the contrary.  

Afterwards it did not end.  I can cite for the officials.  Prosecutor, justice is the truth.  The FAR was materially and physically incapable of carrying these massacres.  It is true that identifiable members of the army did participate in the massacre.  Nobody denies that.  I suppose that if they are honest, members of the Rwandan army high command would not deny the fact that FAR soldiers participated in the massacres.  But not the FAR, not the Rwandan army, Prosecutor. 
Q.	I just said that it's clear -- you have testified in the Bagosora case on the 6th of November 2006, and you have testified in the Zigiranyirazo case on the 11th of April 2007, and in both testimonies you referred to how you had denounced the Kambanda government for it's failure to act to stop the Interahamwe massacres.  Would you agree with me, you gave that evidence previously as well? 
A.	Yes, well, I was not in Bagosora.  I was in Kibilizi (sic), Gratien, that is point one.  I also presented testimony in Zigiranyirazo trial in which I testified on the function, the running of the Rwandan civil service. 
Q.	But the difference today is that having testified for the third time, that you had denounced the Kambanda government for its failure to act.  It is, in fact, the first time you are being cross-examined on it. 
A.	No, no, not at all.  The last time I was cross-examined lengthily by the Prosecutor, except the fact that these are not the same questions, so I cannot provide the same answers to different questions, of course. 
Q.	Sorry, there's a misunderstanding between us.  What I mean is, this is the first time you have been put on the spot in respect of the government's failure to act.  Previously you were asked questions about the FAR, and you were asked questions about the structure of the government in Rwanda.  Today is the first time that you have been put on the spot about the government's failure to act.  It's right, isn't it? 
A.	Prosecutor, irrespective of the circumstances or the time when these questions are put to me, I shall not change my opinion.  I was not in agreement with what was happening in 1994.  I condemned the massacres of civilians in my country.  I denounced what in my view was a form of passiveness, for lack of a better description of the Kambanda government, and I have not changed my point of view.  However, that doesn't mean everything is permissible.  It doesn't mean that you can deduct from my denouncing of the 1994 events that such-and-such a professional group or another was generally guilty of something.  I am just trying to provide more detail to information to the Court which, by the way, I know the Chamber has information more than me.  So I was coming essentially to talk about Édouard Karemera.  If you have further questions, I am available for answers.  
Q.	No, thank you.  That will do.  

MR. MORLEY: 
I hope I have assisted you, Your Honours.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

Has Mr. Sow any redirect?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Your Honour, just for a few minutes.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Your Excellency, I would like to put a few questions to you. Did you know at what date 
	Édouard Karemera within the interim government, was appointed minister of the interior?  
A.	I can't state precisely, but I recall that he was appointed minister at the time when I was ambassador. Definitely not in the month of April.  I am quite certain of that.  This is significant, because, Prosecutor, I believe he could have -- it should have been in May 1994.  But as to the exact day, precisely I can't say.  Counsel, if Édouard Karemera was minister in April in 1994, I would have done everything in my power to get in touch with him and to communicate with him.  And surely he was not a minister and he shared absolutely no part of power at that time. 
Q.	Yes, indeed, the Prosecutor did not give you the date, by making you believe that he was minister since April, but you would need to note it was as from the 25th of May 1994. 
A.	I thank you for confirming that. 
Q.	On 25th of May the situation of the country doubtlessly, as from where you were, you could have a view of the situation of the country.  But reasonably,  on 25th May, according to you, and taking into account the information that you had, could that government -- did that government truly have a hold on what was happening on the ground? 
A.	Absolutely, no hold which could enable it to stop the cause of events. 
Q.	Wasn't it a government on the run? 
A.	Indeed, it was.  As a matter of fact, before Édouard Karemera entered the government, his predecessor had been on the run.  They were living in Gitarama, and practically no contact with the rest of the world. 
Q.	Witness, did you hear about the following expression that is to say, Tutsi within are Tutsis only by name? 
A.	I didn't get the question clearly, Counsel.  I am sorry, Counsel. 
Q.	My question is as follows:  Did you hear the expression that Tutsis of the -- internal Tutsis were Tutsis merely by name? 
A.	No, not like that.  Yes.  But people -- not like that, but, yes, people said so.  Tutsi - yes, that the Tutsi nose - basically, they were saying that they had sold their spirit to the Hutu regimes.  Yes, I heard that said quite often. 
Q.	Last question, Witness.  You referred to killings as from July 1994 up until October, and even further.  What I would like to know is, did you get information on the behaviour of the RPF as they occupied areas in Rwanda in April -- as from April 1994, even as from October 1990 up to till July 1994?  
	How -- what was RPF's attitude towards the people? 
A.	Before July 1994 I had information -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
I am sorry, that did not emanate from cross-examination -- (inaudible).  
THE WITNESS:
Should I answer or not?  
MR. SOW: 
Wait one minute.  

Your Honour, we referred to the period between 1990 to 1994.  We are at war.  It's a situation of war.  So it is a situation that is an outcrop of the examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The issue here is this is redirect examination.  You are not entitled to ask questions unless they are to clarify or rebut issues that were raised in the cross-examination.  So, we don't recall that this was raised in Mr. Morley's cross-examination, in which case you would not be allowed to -- unless you can jog our memory, you would not be allowed to re-examine on it. 
MR. SOW: 
In principle, I agree, Your Honour.  But a while ago, while -- when the witness answered Mr. Morley's questions, he, indeed, referred to the presence of infiltrators and brigades in the period from 1990 to 1994.  Does that allow me to put the question to him, Your Honour?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Sow, we think that arises from question of 
Mr. Morley. 
MR. SOW: 
Very well, Mr. President.  I will defer to your decision.  

And let me avail myself of this opportunity to thank the witness and to extend my warmest regards to him, especially for his boldness and God speak to you, Witness, Your Excellency. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Counsel.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, for the record, the interpreter mistakenly omitted to say what the witness had said, meaning that the Tutsis who lived in the country were only identified as Tutsi by virtue of their noses.  Thank you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.  

Thank you, Counsel, and thank you, Mr. Witness.  Your testimony has now come to an end.  And we thank you for coming to testify and assisting us in the discharge of our functions.  

You are now excused, and I think -- is there any -- 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you.  Is there any other business that we need to address or can we just adjourn until Monday morning?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Unless there's has been a change in the witness order -- oh, no.  I am assuming we have TXL and potentially CTB, is that correct?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Very well, we adjourn now until Monday morning.  Thank you very much. 
(Court adjourned at 1335H)
