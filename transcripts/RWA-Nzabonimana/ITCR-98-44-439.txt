MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

The Trial Chamber apologies for coming late.  It was dealing with a matter that has a bearing on the progress of this case and which is urgent.  

Can we now have the appearances of the parties, for the record.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution Bar is composed of myself, 
Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; it's also composed of Memory Maposa, appeals counsel; 
Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; and with me, also, is my language assistant, Helen Moenback; and my intern, Nina Kapaun.  That is the appearance for the Prosecutor today, My Lords.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  The Defence team this morning is composed of Nathalie Leblanc, counsel, the Accused, myself, and Célestin Kagango, investigator for the Defence.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, the Trial Chamber reminds you of the oath you took to tell the truth and that you are continuing to testify today and you should continue to bear that oath in mind as you testify.  

Defence Counsel.
WITNESS T24,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, you would remember that yesterday when we adjourned we were talking about the 
Murambi meeting.  
A.	I remember, Counsel. 
Q.	You told us that the prime minister took the floor, that there were bourgmestres, religious authorities, the préfet.  Could you please tell us about the other officials who were present at that meeting?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, sorry to interrupt.  

Witness, before you answer, we are in open session.  So be careful not to give information that may identify you.  
THE WITNESS:
The others who were present at that meeting that I remember are some members of government -- the members of government of Jean Kambanda -- Jean Kambanda's cabinet. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Could you please tell us which members of government you remember? 
A.	All I can say is that most members of government were new ministers because the others had died, and I knew all those new ministers by name.  The only one that I might have been able to recognise was Callixte Nzabonimana. 
Q.	Witness, could you tell us about Callixte Nzabonimana at that meeting? 
A.	Personally, I do not remember anything in particular that Callixte did at that meeting.  I think if he had done anything special, I would have been able to remember, especially since I knew him. 
Q.	Do you recall whether the bourgmestre, as well as the religious officials or authorities present talked to the prime minister, Kambanda? 
A.	If my memory serves me well, Kambanda did not really talk specifically with the bourgmestre.  Once he finished his speech, he left and the bourgmestre and the other participants at the meeting stayed behind because the meeting was going on. 
Q.	What was the tone and the contents of the speech delivered by Prime Minister Kambanda during that meeting? 
A.	The main item on the agenda of the meeting chaired by the prime minister was security.  It was primarily the security of the government that had fled from Kigali and then security in general throughout the country.  

Kambanda, first of all, explained how the new government had been formed.  But, personally, I felt that that government could not take the country out of the crisis.  That was my personal opinion.  

And I recall that the meeting mainly discussed security and those who took the floor were afraid that the soldiers of the RPF and Inkotanyi would infiltrate the region and cross over the Nyabarongo region to enter the Gitarama préfecture passing through the Runda commune.  And I remember that to do something against these RPF infiltration, the access routes had to be controlled and roadblocks erected.  So this meeting focused on security issues, particularly since it had brought together service heads at the préfecture, as well as members of government. 
Q.	Do you have anything to tell us about this meeting with the religious authorities and prime minister on  Jean-Marie Vianney Mporanzi? 
A.	I have nothing special to tell you concerning  Jean-Marie Vianney Mporanzi .  I talked with him, but I know nothing special that could have happened to him in the course of that meeting. 
Q.	Are you aware that in the course of this big meeting, he told the prime minister that he had been slapped  by Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Personally, I do not think he raised that matter to the prime minister, unless he did so during a private meeting with the prime minister.  And as I told you yesterday, Jean-Marie Vianney Mporanzi was *** ******* of **** and *** had lots of things in **********.  But as far as I can remember, he did not tell the prime minister that he had been slapped by Callixte Nzabonimana. 
Q.	Did you know the bourgmestre of Musambira? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
Q.	Do you remember whether he attended that big meeting? 
A.	I do not remember him being present at that meeting. 
Q.	Do you remember that his name was brought up in some connection during that meeting? 
A.	I remember that nothing was said about the bourgmestre of Musambira commune during that meeting. 
Q.	A while ago you told us that after delivering his speech, the prime minister left and you stayed behind with the other bourgmestres.  What happened subsequently? 
A.	After the prime minister left, there was another meeting and the bourgmestres talked about the security situations in their various communes and the bourgmestres of Runda and the one of Taba presented reports concerning the situations in their communes. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well, Madam President, I shall be asking some questions now which require that we move into closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, could we move into closed session.  

Members of the public, you will have to leave now as the matters we are going to discuss may reveal the identity of the witness, who is a protected witness.  
(At this point in the proceedings a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 21] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 3 by Sheriffo Jammeh)


MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, once again.  The proceedings are resumed.  But, before the witness is brought in, we wanted to deliver an oral decision on admission of witness statements of Witnesses T48 and the T41.  

During proceedings on 20th April 2010, the Prosecution made an oral motion to admit into evidence portions of a written statement disclosed by the Defence from prospective witness, T58, who is not currently scheduled to testify before this Trial Chamber in these proceedings.  

The Prosecution submitted that the statement was relevant in that it contradicted testimony given by Defence Witness T5, whose testimony had concluded immediately prior to the Prosecution motion.  

The Defence responded that while it objected in principle to the Prosecution's request, it did not object to the admission of that particular statement so long as the entire statement was admitted, because the Defence claimed that the statement included exculpatory information concerning the Accused.  

On 26th April 2010, following the testimony of Defence Witness T33, the Prosecution made another similar request regarding the written statement of prospective Defence Witness T41, who is also not currently scheduled to testify before this Chamber in these proceedings. And the Defence made a similar argument in reply.  

The Trial Chamber, having considered the oral submissions of both the Prosecution and the Defence, is now prepared to render decision on these matters.  

The Trial Chamber notes that the usual practice of this Tribunal is to admit into evidence written statements of witnesses who ultimately testify at trial, as there is a relevant connection between such statements and oral testimony received by the Trial Chamber.  Typically, this relevance is established when an opposing party demonstrates inconsistencies between the statement of a witness and the testimony that witness gives before the Trial Chamber, or inconsistencies between multiple written statements of a witness who testifies before the Chamber.  

In both cases, the admission is relevant in order to impugn the credibility of a witness who has testified.  The Trial Chamber notes that, according to Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, evidence shall, in principle, be given by way of live testimony.  The Trial Chamber finds that Rule 92 bis, which allows for the admission of written statements in certain circumstances, is inapplicable to the present situation.  

In addition, because neither T58 nor T41 are currently scheduled to testify in these proceedings, there is no relevant connection between the statements the Prosecution wishes to admit and the testimony that has been given by Witnesses T5 and T33 before this Chamber.  For these reasons, the Prosecution's motions are denied.  

With regards to the position taken by the Defence, the Trial Chamber notes that if the Defence felt that either witness could provide exculpatory evidence on behalf of the Accused, it was entitled to call either witness to testify before this Chamber.  For these reasons, the Defence motions are also denied.  

That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could we now have the witness brought in court after the curtains have been drawn.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, as they draw the curtains, I apologise for the late -- for the delay in start of the proceedings.  The Prosecutor had underestimated the time necessary to arrange the documents in preparation for cross-examination of this witness.  We do apologise for that delay, My Lords.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the apology is noted.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, we have also distributed to all the parties a yellow folder containing various exhibits that the Prosecutor may rely upon, and also an index showing the documents that are presented before -- before the Chamber.  

Madam President, there's also a spelling list available, which has also been distributed.  As the Court pleases. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we -- we have not seen the index you are referring to.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Well, then, I'll make it available, if it is not already contained there, in due course, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, and where would you like us to begin?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
We would -- I think we can begin in open session.  I've crafted my questions in such a way that we can proceed in -- in open session until such time that either the Chamber feels that we may go into closed session or the witness displays some concern.  Yes, as the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I will now advise that the index has been found.  So we will have a look at it.  

Good morning, once again, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good day, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are continuing with your testimony, but we will begin in open session.  So be careful not to give information that may identify you, as the public may attend this session.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	We'll discuss certain matters that have arisen out of your testimony and other matters that are contained in the documents that you have in front of you.  So I will request you to leave those documents alone until such time I draw your attention to it; is that all right?  

Did you hear me, Witness?  
A.	Yes, I heard you.  
Q.	Now, Witness, you agree with me, don't you, that Callixte Nzabonimana was the president of MRND in Gitarama préfecture in 1994; is that correct?  
A.	I agree with you.  
Q.	That position, Mr. Witness, is a position where the holder has a very strong connection with party members, irrespective of their station in life; is that correct?  
A.	 Yes, you are correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Yes.  The primary motivation is to win votes and supporters; isn't it?  
A.	Yes, indeed, you are correct.  
Q.	And in the capacity of president of MRND, Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana could visit any homestead, any public place that he pleased, in pursuit of support; isn't it?  
A.	That is possible, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	Witness, Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana wore two hats of responsibilities:  One as the president of MRND, and the other as minister; isn't that correct?  
A.	Yes, you're correct, Prosecutor.  
Q.	It is correct, Witness, that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana has held several ministerial portfolios since 
1989 to 1994; isn't that not correct?  
A.	I think that is the case.  
Q.	Yes, indeed, it is.  

Witness, Callixte Nzabonimana was considered an important personality in Gitarama, and more so in Nyabikenke; isn't that correct?  
A.	Correct.  He was an important personality.
Q.	Yes.  And Callixte Nzabonimana was not the shy type of politician.  He was a charismatic man who went out and did things and projects for the people; is that not correct?  
A.	You're correct.  He was someone who loved his commune and the people of his native commune.  In terms of development, he did everything in his power, for example, the secondary school.  In terms of agriculture and livestock breeding, he helped me to set up farms, cultivate Irish potatoes, wheat, and I believe there was modern breeding of livestock, like goats.  And he also helped the people to set up cooperatives.  He set up a youth centre called CFG.  I believe the centre is still operational today.  

While waiting for rural electrification, he gave *** a generator ******* to have access to electricity.  In a nutshell, he was someone who enjoyed helping the people who lived in his native commune.  
Q.	Witness, in fact, quite a number of people described Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana as the 
	president of the republic of Nyabikenke; did you ever hear of that?  
A.	I did not hear any such comparison.  What I know is that he was very much liked by the population.  He supported development activities for the benefit of the people of his native commune  
Q.	Callixte Nzabonimana displayed his power and influence in a mighty way.  For instance, on 
	the 18th of April 1994, at Murambi training centre, the Accused and the ministers present at Murambi imposed themselves on the préfet of Gitarama and bourgmestre; is that not correct?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, could counsel please repeat his question for the benefit of the Kinyarwanda booth?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you.  I will do that.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana displayed his power and influence in a mighty way.  For instance, on the 18th of April 1994, the Accused and the ministers present at Murambi training centre imposed themselves and their will on the préfet of Gitarama and the bourgmestres who were present there; isn't that correct?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, as I said before, I have narrated the events that I recall as an eyewitness.  When you describe events that are attributed to him, I would say that I do not know, because I cannot lie.  And I cannot talk about events I know nothing about.  
Q.	Furthermore, Witness, Callixte Nzabonimana, at that meeting of the 18th April 1994, told the gathering that anyone who was not working for the administration, who would as much as show support to the Tutsis, would be seen as the enemy; isn't that correct, Witness?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, the person who told you that lied.  I was present at that meeting and he could not have said that (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  So he could not have said that.  They could not have talked about the killing of Tutsis because there were Tutsis in that room that were leaders, authorities, officials, business people and other personalities.  And those who were present at that meeting were not from a single ethnic group.  

At that time the killings had not yet intensified in Gitarama.  As a result, I will tell you that an official would not have made such a statement in public; maybe in private.  But it is unlikely that he could have made such statements.  
Q.	Witness, it is your position that you want this Court to believe that, although Callixte Nzabonimana was present at that meeting, he said nothing; isn't it?  
A.	I know Callixte Nzabonimana.  I am, therefore, telling you that I never saw him stand before that assembly and make any statements.  That is what I am confirming here before the Judges. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, sorry to interrupt you, but could we go into a short closed session.  We want to raise a certain matter.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 27 to 29] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
     (Pages 22 to 26 by Lisa Smith)
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, given the -- the political hat that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana wore, as the president of MRND, he could, therefore, visit Jermaine Karangwa's bar, could he not, in search of support?  
A.	Before 1994, that could have been possible, but when the violence started and Tutsis were being killed and some Tutsis sought refuge at the communal office, people were no longer thinking about recruiting members for their parties.  You should, therefore, understand that it was impossible, under the circumstances in the country, for Nzabonimana to go to that place to recruit members for his party.  
Q.	Witness, I must say that your answer doesn't add up, because, at that time during the genocide more than any other time, the politicians were rallying the Hutus to fight the Tutsis; isn't that correct?  
A.	I would not like to dwell on the attitude of politicians or to assess their actions.  I've come before this Chamber to testify to events that I personally witnessed.  That is why I've always said that I would not like to venture into issues that I did not personally witness.  That is precisely why I did not want to be a Prosecution witness.  
Q.	We'll come to that, Witness, in due course.  

But do you see that it's not convincing that, because Callixte Nzabonimana was a minister, therefore, he could not go to a certain bar; that is the point, isn't it?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, isn't that an argument?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I'll proceed, My Lords.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, during the -- the genocide, you did not arrest any génocidaires, didn't you?  
A.	How do you want me to answer your question, Mr. Prosecution?  Are we in open session or in closed session?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
As a matter of fact, I -- I think that it may be necessary to move into closed session, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, this is an open question.  So, many people could have arrested génocidaires:  Policemen, the préfet, bourgmestres, conseillers.  So I think it does not identify.  And in any event, it's a yes or no question.  If the witness is comfortable with this, that is all I need:  Yes or no.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, if the witness wants to explain what he did, then it will necessarily also say where he did it, when, or even names that he may cite.  Then it could easily be identified.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, you can answer yes or no, but if you want to give explanations, then we will have to go into closed session.  But you can give your yes or no now and indicate whether you want to give an explanation.  

Do you remember the question?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I think I do.  

If I -- if I had to answer the Prosecutor's question, then it would be like saying that my entire testimony should be heard in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, Witness, is your answer yes or no?  We would like to know -- to the question put to you by the Prosecutor.  
THE WITNESS: 
My answer is yes.  And I do so out of respect for the Chamber.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you.  I will deal with explanations in a closed session later.  So don't worry, Mr. Witness.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, did you come to hear or learn that at Musambira, in May, the bourgmestre of Gitarama challenged Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana to tell them whether or not he was behind the massacres?  Do you know of that?  
A.	I cannot know about it, because I did not take part in that meeting that was held in Musambira.  
Q.	Witness, it is correct, isn't it, that you did not get to hear of everything that was going on in your place of residence because you didn't have the ability to do so; is that not correct?  
A.	I was able to talk about information that I received through my testimony before a Chamber, but I cannot venture into events that I did not witness.  So it is up to the Chamber to assess the content of my testimony.  
Q.	Witness, in your testimony in chief, you gave the impression to this Court -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that you had a very reliable network of information? 

All I'm asking is:  You did not come to know of this event, did you?  
A.	I did not quite understand your question, Mr. Prosecutor.  Could you kindly repeat it.  
Q.	Witness, even if I repeated it five times, I don't think you would understand it.  I'll move to the next question.  

Did you hear, Witness, also that Callixte Nzabonimana answered the bourgmestre who had accused him -- or, who had challenged him to give his standing on the massacres and said to them that he was being accused without any basis by the bourgmestre; did you come to know of that?  
A.	Concerning the accusations that were made by some of the officials against another official, I could not be aware of such facts because I was not at the meeting.  
Q.	Yes, but you knew of other facts where you were not present; isn't that correct?  
A.	That is correct.  I was able to obtain some information on account of the duties that I exercised.  That is why I find it difficult to answer some of your questions, because we're in open session.  
Q.	Witness, you're doing quite well.  Witness, did you come Gitarama to hear from your sources of information that, during that meeting at Musambira, the bourgmestre of Gitarama asked Callixte Nzabonimana to denounce the genocide over the radio; did you ever come to hear of that?  
A.	I did not hear that, and I did not mention it in my testimony.  
Q.	Witness, all I'm trying to say is that your sources of information were not as good as you put them to be to this Chamber.  What do you say to that?  
A.	That is very possible.  And it all boils down to the situation of war that was prevailing in the entire country.  We knew that communication was difficult at the time.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, did you get to know, through your network of information, whether at any one time during the genocide, Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana had apologised to anyone for the events that were taking place in Gitarama, in particular?  Did you hear of that?  
A.	I never heard of a place where Callixte Nzabonimana would have apologised for the events that were happening in Gitarama préfecture.  
Q.	Tell this Court, Witness, whether, from your network of information, you heard yourself, or from any other person, that Callixte Nzabonimana had gone somewhere, conducted a meeting, and asked the people to stop the senseless killing; did you?  
A.	I did not learn that he held a meeting during which he called on members of the population to stop the killings.  If he had done so, that would have been a positive act.  
Q.	Witness, from your sources of information and network of informers, did you come to know that at Nyamabuye commune office, Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana called for the destruction of the houses of Tutsis and that people should plant crops where those houses once stood; did you ever hear of that?  
A.	I never heard about that.  And let me add that I lived ************(sic) away from the *************** ************** office.  Communication was difficult during that war period.  
Q.	Witness, it is correct, isn't it, that information-gathering during that period was a difficult task and one cannot rely on what he heard; is that correct?  
A.	That is quite correct.  I do not know your country of origin, but at the time there was no telephone network, or it was not working in the region where I found myself.  The situation was very different from what prevails today, with mobile telephones nowadays.  At the time of the events, it was very difficult to obtain information or even to move about.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, before you continue, could we go into a short closed session.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I think so, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry.

BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, you agree with me, don't you, that during this very difficult period of genocide, people were being killed, maimed, and you can't even remember them?  You can't even remember all of them; isn't that correct?  
A.	I talked about this yesterday.  I testified to facts that I witnessed.  But when you tell me that I cannot even estimate their number, I do not quite understand what you mean.  
Q.	Witness, my question was:  You -- you cannot now, or even during the genocide itself, remember all the persons from your commune who were killed during the genocide, could you?  
A.	It is very difficult for me to answer such a question.  
Q.	Yes.  It is even more difficult, Witness, to narrate or remember all the circumstances under which the people were killed; isn't that correct?  
A.	It is very difficult to answer such a question when people are killed all over.  It is difficult to know the circumstances under which all these persons were killed.  I thought that there were believers in this hall and only God alone can be present everywhere to know what is happening everywhere at the same time.  
Q.	Witness, during the genocide, did your sources of information at one time stop coming to tell you that people were being killed at such-and-such a homestead, at the next homestead so-and-so has been killed; isn't that correct?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, there are some of your questions to which I cannot give an answer because of my security concerns, seeing that we are in open session.  
Q.	The -- the -- Mr. Witness, the answer is -- is simply:   Yes, a certain point came and nobody brought you information; isn't that correct?  
A.	To be able to give an explanation, or to explain as much as possible, I will need to talk about my duties, provide details that could reveal my identity.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
(No interpretation) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes, Madam President, could the witness be taken out for a while so I could say something on this issue.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Witness, it is now time to break for lunch.  You are continuing your testimony, so don't discuss it with anyone until we meet again this afternoon.  You may leave now. 
(Witness exited courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes, Madam President, I believe the situation is neither fair to the Defence nor to the witness.  I understand the technique that the Prosecutor is using.  He's putting very general questions.  We do not know about the specific location he's talking about.  It could apply to any location in Rwanda; whereas, he's asking the witness at the same time to speak about his network of informers -- the expression used by the Prosecutor -- without giving the witness, who held a specific position -- he's asked to say what he did and what he knew within his jurisdiction, that is to say, something of interest to the Prosecutor and to the Chamber, itself, and to know on a case-by-case basis or any (inaudible) whether his sources dried up.  So we are in some kind of hazy area.  And so the Prosecutor is deliberately imposing this on the Chamber.  

The witness is prevented from providing interesting information.  He's prevented from providing the full answer that he would like to give.  He has mentioned this several times earlier this morning that he was being reined in by this particular situation in the answers he wanted to provide.  I believe that the interest of justice is not for the witness to be -- to be -- to be held in check in the answers, because he's always restricted and he cannot go further in his answer because of the public open session that is enforced.  

So I believe that if the Prosecutor continues in this line of questioning, and as the witness, himself, is asking, I think we should move into closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I don't think we should move into closed session.  Here, we're dealing with a fairly sophisticated man.  He knows what I'm asking.  He knows where his sources of information were, and it is very simple for him to say that at a certain point he did not get information.  

I'm not asking him about information from Kampala.  He knows we're talking about his fear of influence.  I can make that clearer to him, but the answer or this line of questioning does not prejudice the 
Defence counsel in any way in his Defence of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, because this witness has already given his testimony and is now being cross-examined.  

Of course, Defence counsel knows where we are going to, and that is why he is relentlessly trying to stop it.  But there is no justice or fairness in his objection.  I can ask him a general question; I can ask him a specific question, and vice versa.  
So I think that this objection should be disallowed; it shouldn't be allowed to proceed, and there is no need for turning this session into a closed session.  I don't think that, at this moment, we need it.  When we go into closed session, I will revisit some of those areas and he'll be able to explain.  As the Court pleases.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Well, under the circumstances, let the Prosecutor not blame the witness each time by saying:  Oh, you are not answering my question.  

Each time he tells you that the open curtain will be hearing -- prevents him from answering your question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber:  Looking at the record, the question was preceded by a comment from counsel suggesting that the answer would be "yes".  The Trial Chamber would like to disapprove of that practice by the Prosecution, to put answers to the witness; rather, we should wait for the answers.  

But we believe that the question was:  "Yes, at a certain point -- a certain point came and nobody brought you information; isn't that correct?" 

We believe that this is -- this is a question which could be answered with yes or no, but we also note that the witness has indicated that he wants to give an explanation which he might need to do in closed session.  Therefore, we will take that explanation in closed session.  

At the same time, we would like to remind the Prosecution not to accumulate too many questions which are partly answered for the closed sessions, for the smooth flow of the record.  

So, Prosecution, organise your questions in such a way so that you can have those which you can have in open session, and then move to the closed session to have complete answers to some others. 

That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

We will now take the break and resume the proceedings at a quarter to three, a quarter to three this afternoon.

(Court resumed at 1447H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everyone.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  

The proceedings are resumed.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

Maybe we should go into a brief closed session, to deal with those two matters that are pending.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Registry, can we go into closed session.

MR. MWAMASANGULA:
We are in open session, My Lord -- Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we are now in open session.  So be careful not to give away information that may identify you, as the public may be attending this session.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, in defence of the charges brought about against you in the five Gacaca courts, you never mentioned in any of those trials that you had arrested the four people you've told this Court, did you?  
A.	I think no question was put to me concerning that fact before the Gacaca court.  If a question had been asked of me in that connection, I would have provided explanations.  It was not difficult because the brigadier was still present, because it was to him that I transferred the people that I arrested, so there was no difficulty for me defending myself against that allegation.  
Q.	However, Witness, in your trial you mentioned that you were helpless, that there is nothing you could do.  And in that context, it was upon you to mention what you did, isn't it? 
A.	It is clear that from the onset, we did what we could.  But as time went on, the assailants increased in numbers, and at some point we were overwhelmed by the situation.  I believe I said in the course of 
	my testimony that even the government did nothing to come to our assistance.  The government itself, which had had to flee, could not assist us.  So it was not at our level that we could help the situation.  
Q.	Witness, that is not the answer to my question.  

Witness, do you agree with me that had you arrested those four persons, it would have been one of the highlights of your defence in the trials that were facing you, isn't it?  
A.	I shall concede that.  I'm saying that when you arrest criminals and punish them, it is a good thing.  I'm also saying that the witness may show up and testify about it today.  But when you are faced with more than 1,000 assailants, it is not insignificant because people were killed.  
Q.	Witness, the point I'm trying to drive home to the Court is that this is an afterthought, this is something that you've just come up with to impress the Chamber.  In fact, you never arrested anyone, did you? 
A.	I have heard that the Tribunal would soon close its doors, otherwise, I would call on you to carry out investigations on the field.  If you visit the cellule that I mentioned, you could find out the truth if you were to go there.  
Q.	Yes.  All you're saying, Witness, is that the Gacaca records do not contain the full truth of what happened on the ground, isn't it? 
A.	You are right, Mr. Prosecutor.  Do you think the entire truth will ever be known concerning these events?  Unless the seekers are very patient and continue with the investigations.  If you were to go on the field, you would find even more information which you do not have today.  You know, often the people behave like children, so you have to proceed slowly when you have to meet the people.  And then at the end you will get the whole truth.  Do you think the whole truth is known concerning all the events?  
Q.	Witness, the point you are making is very simple.  You want this Court to believe, because you did not see or hear that Callixte Nzabonimana was at your native commune, that, therefore, he was never there.  Isn't that the case?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I shall not affirm or confirm anything whatsoever before the Judges.  I am giving 
	my testimony and it is up to the Judges to draw the necessary conclusions.  I have said I'm not going to fabricate anything concerning what happened.  
Q.	Witness, your sole purpose to come here is for you to deny the atrocities that Callixte Nzabonimana committed in Nyabikenke, isn't it? 
A.	I did not come here for that.  At the beginning of my testimony I swore to speak the truth about the events which I, myself, experienced.  I am not talking about things that other people did.  I'm talking about the events as I experienced and saw them.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have an interest in coming to testify here before this Court, don't you? 
A.	The interest is for all Rwandans in general, it's not personal interest.  Actually, this Tribunal was established for the interest of Rwandans so that the truth will be known and remedies taken against the atrocities that took place in Rwanda.  I have no personal interest in this case.  
Q.	Witness, your personal interest in coming here today is, first of all, to discredit the Gacaca proceedings in which you were convicted and sentenced to a life imprisonment in isolation, isn't it? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, maybe that is what you think.  But I think otherwise -- of course you must have reasons for asking such questions because before I was contacted by the Prosecution team and the Prosecutor had asked me to come and testify on hearsay evidence.  And since I was not able to honour that mission, I decided to come and testify for the Defence to talk about events which I experienced.  I believe that is the objective of justice.  The Tribunal would like to know what really happened.  I have not come to discredit the Gacaca courts, because I already stated that the Gacaca courts was 
	one solution to the problem faced by Rwandans.  But for this to be achieved, the Gacaca courts must be well used.  And, of course, a good judge is impartial.  
Q.	Witness, your description of the Gacaca system of justice is such that it creates an image before this Trial Chamber that it is inherently unfair and just (sic) and aimed at bringing you down, and persons of 
	your stature in 1994 down, isn't it? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, maybe that is your understanding of my testimony but I did not talk about 
	Gacaca courts in general.  I was referring to my own trial at a Gacaca court.  And I think that, obviously, a good judge is supposed to be impartial.  He must listen to the witnesses on both sides, from all the parties.  So do not confuse my own case before the Gacaca courts with the Gacaca courts in general.  Maybe it would depend on certain regions, but this does not concern all the Gacaca courts throughout the country.  So, Mr. Prosecutor, you did not understand me well 
Q.	Witness, you created an image before this Court that the *********Gacaca, in which you were imprisoned for a good length of time, was inherently unfair, didn't you? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you're putting words into my mouth.  I did not talk about Gacaca courts in *********** 
	in general.  There you are putting words into my mouth.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you also created an impression that your trial at **************** was inherently unfair, 
	didn't you? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, once again, you are putting words into my mouth.  I did not say that the court which tried me was unfair or impartial because I asked for forgiveness before this same court.  I did not say that that court was impartial. 
Q.	Witness, don't you remember saying that the bench had friends of your accuser sitting on it, Witness? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, could counsel for the Prosecution please repeat his question, for the benefit of the interpreters.
THE WITNESS:
I did not quite understand your question Mr. Prosecutor.  I do not know what Gacaca court or what Gacaca bench you are referring to.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, the Kinyarwanda booth would like to make a correction concerning a mistake made by the witness.  He wanted to say -- talk about -- the Kinyarwanda interpreter apologises for using the word "impartial" instead of "partial".  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel, could you repeat your question.
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, I will.
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	When explaining to the Court about your predicaments in 2009 before the *********** court, you say that you were coerced, no summons was served, and then you said, "The bench had friends of my accuser.  They were brothers of the civil party.  The president were their relatives."   That is creating, before this Chamber, an impression that the Gacaca courts are unfair, isn't it? 
A.	Maybe that was a mistake made by the interpreters.  I believe that what I told this Trial Chamber is different from what you have just read out to me, Mr. Prosecutor.  Please check your transcripts once again.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The records will bear me out.  

Witness, your second interest in this matter is that you are trying to ensure that Callixte Nzabonimana is acquitted at all costs.  Because if he is acquitted, your convictions would look baseless, isn't it?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I am not a judge, nor am I a prosecutor.  I have not come here to help acquit some people.  I am talking about events as I remember them.  I am talking about events which I was an eyewitness to.  
Q.	Witness, in your statement --  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
And, My Lords, may I refer you to document number 1 in the folder.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	In your statement of 20 -- of 2nd of October 2008, Witness, you told the Prosecutor that you were a Christian, aren't you? 
A.	Correct, Mr. Prosecutor, I am a Christian.  
Q.	And, furthermore, Witness, when you appeared before the Gacaca at **********, you told the court there that you had found God, isn't it, and that was -- isn't it, Witness?  That was on the 2nd of August 2008 at the ************** Gacaca, isn't it? 
A.	Could you please show me that portion in the statement?  These are words you are putting into 
	my mouth, words you claim that I said during the Gacaca session.  
Q.	Witness, please don't refer to the file just yet.  I just ask the Bench and Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana's lawyers to look into the file.  I'll come back to that, Mr. Witness.  

All I want you to tell the Court is whether, in your confession in 2008, 2nd of August, when you appeared before the **************-  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, Mugunga is number 8 on the spelling list.
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	************** Gacaca.  You told the court that you had found God, isn't it? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, could you please show me the passage so I can verify.  
Q.	But you remember what you said.  Did you say that or not?  Have you forgotten? 
A.	No, I have not forgotten what I said.  But I believe that some portions are poorly translated or maybe we do not have the same understanding of that portion of text.  You are referring to extracts -- the extracts that you have before you, and I do not have that portion of text.  Could you please show it to me so I can compare it with what you are talking about. 
Q.	Witness, all I want you to tell this Court is whether you told the Gacaca of *********** that you had found God.  That is all, Witness.  Is it yes or no? 
A.	I did not say so only in Mugunga.  I even said so elsewhere.  It is said that when the genocide was perpetrated in Rwanda, more than 90 per cent of the population was Christian.  And afterwards, Rwandans started asking themselves how all these people could have been involved in the genocide if they were Christians.  I examined my conscience and concluded that the acts that were perpetrated in Rwanda were not worthy of people of faith, Christians.  I had the opportunity to re-read the Bible, and that is why I said that I had found God again.  And that is why I decided to confess my crimes before the Gacaca court.  Thank you.  
Q.	However, Witness, a few weeks after the 2nd of August 2008 declaration that you had found God, you gave false information to the Prosecutor on the 2nd of October 2008.  That is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I signed a statement on the 2nd of October 2008 for the Office of the Prosecution, and this was a summary made after our discussions.  And if you carefully read that statement, 
	Counsel for the Prosecution, and I believe the Judges have the same document before them, it's a document bearing a code.  And in that document I spoke of the events such as they were reported to me by others.  In fact, as I have said, the Prosecutor was insisting that I testify.  But since I had not been an eyewitness to the events he wanted me to testify about, I spoke of the hearsay.  So it is taken as a statement on hearsay.  
Q.	Witness, please turn to your folder at number 6.  You'll find a tab like this one that has a number 6 on it.  All right.  You'll find that there is a loosely translated English copy.  And then on the third page you find your handwriting, starting at page 8.  Do you see that, Witness?  Do you see that?  

Yes.  I will not ask you to read the entire part of that testimony.  But I want you to go now to page -- at page 10.  At the last paragraph, I would like you to read it out to the Judges, with the words, "Ndashimira".  Do you see the word Ndashimira?  Start from there.  "Ndashimira, Imana".  
A.	You want me to read that part of the text?  
Q.	Please do.  
A.	"I thank God, as well as the Rwandan heroes, that God used to stop the genocide so that some people can survive the genocide."  Do you wish me to continue?  
Q.	Please do.  I'll tell you when to stop.  
A.	"I thank God who pardoned me my sins, because when I committed those sins I had not become a person of faith.  I want to ask forgiveness from the Rwandan community because I have sinned against God and against many Rwandans.  I'm also asking pardon from all the victims and survivors of the genocide, as well as the Rwandan community and the Rwandan government.  I am ready to cooperate and work with all Rwandans in order to reconstruct Rwandan peace and I am ready to work for the development of Rwanda.  May God help us all."   
Q.	Witness, you declared there that you had become a person of faith, isn't it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, did you hear the question?  
THE WITNESS: 
I didn't realise it was a question.  I thought it was a small comment being made by the Prosecutor.  

Can you please repeat your question, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, following that confession, you had become a person of faith, isn't it? 
A.	You have just spoken the truth.  I am imbued with faith.  
Q.	And following that statement and after you became imbued with faith, a few weeks later you gave a statement to the Prosecutor containing false information, that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	You had already asked me such a question.  And I believe I told you that everything that I said in that statement came from hearsay.  In fact, no converted -- in fact, I cannot accept this statement because it arises from hearsay.  And I made that statement following pressure from the director of prisons who was cooperating with others.  And I risked being accused of having refused to testify.  
Q.	We'll come to that, Witness.  

Now, Witness, you are now testifying before this Court on an affirmation to tell the truth, isn't it?  
A.	Please, can you expand on your question.  
Q.	Witness, did you understand the question or not? 
A.	I didn't quite get the meaning of your question, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Could you kindly repeat it for me. 
Q.	Witness, you are now testifying before this Court under an affirmation to tell the truth, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, you're quite right.  You are speaking the truth, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Now, may I ask the Chamber.  

Not you, Witness.  

The Chamber, to open document 1 at page 3, paragraph 3.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I'll ask you a question now.  Have you closed the document before you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	Were you coerced to tell the Prosecutor that after the death of the president you invited all 
conseillers of secteur in your place of residence to a meeting that you held, is that correct? 
A.	It is very difficult for me to answer that question.  
Q.	Is it because that statement is true, Witness? 
A.	No.  I think that I need to answer some of these questions in a closed session. 
Q.	Witness, simply -- I do not see the need for a closed session for you to explain whether it is -- you were coerced to say those words or not.  I do not think we should hide behind a closed session for that.  You can say yes or no.  If I want explanations and require a closed session, I will request for one.  But for now, I think this is a very straightforward question.  I've asked you about your native place and whether you did that under coercion or not.  What do you say, Witness?  
A.	I don't know your nationality.  But with us in Rwanda, even if you are referring to something, one can understand somewhat.  So I don't know how I need to behave so that I can respond to your question without anyone being able to identify me.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, it is important for us to get an answer --  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
From the witness.  And if he says that in closed session he can give an answer, let's go to 
	closed session.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry.
