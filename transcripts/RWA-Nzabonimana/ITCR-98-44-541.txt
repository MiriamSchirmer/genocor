         6                    Mr. President, Your Honours, good morning.  

         7                    Andr  Ntagerura's Defence is represented by 

         8                    myself Hamuli Rety of the Bobigny Bar of the

        10                    our assistant and who is from the Quebec 

        11                    Bar.   Thank you, Mr. President.

        12     MR. BOUTIN: 

        13                    Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

        14                    Emmanuel Bagambiki's defence is represented 

        15                    by Ms. Anne Desmarest, my legal assistant,

        17                    counsel, Mr. Lurquin, is still in Brussels 

        18                    for reasons that you are aware of. We are 

        19                    surprised not to see him this morning 

        20                    because we were expecting him yesterday 

        21                    evening.  We will keep you abreast of

         3     MS. MBIDA:  

         4                    Mr. President, Your Honours, good morning. 

         5                    Samuel Imanishimwe's Defence is represented 

         6                    by myself, Marie-Louise Mbida of the 

         7                    Cameroonian Bar. I am assisted by Mr. 

         8                    Mathieu Ndongo Koni who is also a lawyer 

         9                    with the Cameroonian Bar.

        10     MR. PRESIDENT:

        11                    You will have noticed that Judge Ostrovsky 

        12                    is not with us today. Unfortunately, Judge 

        13                    Ostrovsky is ill and we all hope that he 

        14                    will be back with us very soon.  

        15                    

        16                    At the recent Plenary, there was an 

        17                    amendment of Rule 15Bis and Rule 15bis now 

        18                    reads as follows:  

        19                    Rule 15bis absence of a Judge.  

        20                    (A) if (i) a Judge is for illness or other 

        21                    urgent personal reasons or for reasons of 

        22                    authorised Tribunal business is unable to 

        23                    continue sitting in a part-heard case for a 

        24                    period of which is likely to be of a short 

        25                    duration,

         1                    and (ii) the remaining Judges of the Chamber 

         2                    are satisfied that it is in interest of 

         3                    justice to do so, those remaining Judges of 

         4                    the Chamber may order that the hearing of 

         5                    the case continue in the absence of that 

         6                    Judge for a period of not more than five 

         7                    working days.

         8                    

         9                    Of course, we have witnesses that have been 

        10                    brought from Rwanda.  It is always not easy 

        11                    to get the witnesses here, and it would even 

        12                    be more difficult, if having brought them 

        13                    here, they were to be sent back because we 

        14                    might not be able to get them back again.  

        15                    So we propose on the -- the Chamber proposes 

        16                    on the issue to proceed with the trial and 

        17                    we will only do so during this week, with 

        18                    two Judges, because in our view taken all 

        19                    the circumstances in consideration, it would 

        20                    be in the interest of justice to proceed 

        21                    accordingly.  

        22                    

        23                    Now, there are a few matters that need to be 

        24                    cleared up. One has to do with the 

        25                    application by the Prosecution asking for an

         1                    order that certain documents which an 

         2                    assistant on the team of Imanishimwe -- that 

         3                    certain documents be returned.  

         4                    

         5                    We make reference to a previous order that 

         6                    this Trial Chamber made on the 3rd of March, 

         7                    and I read from paragraph 5 of that 

         8                    decision, and it reads as follows:  

         9                    The Chamber finds merit, however, in the 

        10                    latter part of the order sought by the 

        11                    Prosecutor in paragraph 3(F) of the motion, 

        12                    namely that the Defence Counsel be required 

        13                    to ensure that any member departing from the 

        14                    Defence team has remitted the documents and 

        15                    information that could lead to the 

        16                    identification of the protected persons.  

        17                    

        18                    The Chamber will, therefore, grant the 

        19                    Prosecutor's request for such an order with 

        20                    the modification that the words; "All 

        21                    documentation or information be replaced 

        22                    with the words all materials." 

        23                    This modification will be entered in 

        24                    recognition of the fact that the term

         2                    remitted.

         4                    And, I think that Madam Mbida has already 

         5                    indicated that she had not handed any 

         6                    documents with regard to witnesses to the 

         7                    particular person who is mentioned and I 

         8                    don't want to get into names -- but I just 

         9                    want to indicate to Madam Mbida that her 

        10                    team is still under this obligation with 

        11                    regard to this order. So if there are any 

        12                    documents this person, may or may not have 

        13                    those documents should be returned to the 

        14                    Defence.

        15     MS. MBIDA:

        16                    Mr. President, I am sorry I did not 

        17                    understand the last part of your decision; 

        18                    should the documents be returned to the 

        19                    Defence or the Prosecutor?

        20     MR. PRESIDENT:  

        21                    Let me have another look at the order.  Yes, 

        22                    it would be to the Defence. It is; the order 

        23                    requires the defence to inform the 

        24                    Prosecutor of any change in the nature of 

        25                    the Defence team, and further that any

         1                    documents that were given to anyone who was 

         2                    connected with the Defence team, who is no 

         3                    longer with the Defence team, then such 

         4                    documents should be returned to the Defence. 

         5                    So I think that should deal with that 

         6                    matter.  

         7                    

         8                    There is one other matter, there is a motion 

         9                    where the Prosecution was asking to have a 

        10                    witness dropped from their list of 

        11                    witnesses.

        12     MR. KAREGYESA:

        13                    Indeed, Your Honour, there are two motions.  

        14                    The first motion is in respect of Witness 

        15                    LCI and was filed with the Registry on 25th 

        16                    of May, this year.

        17                    

        18                    The second motion was filed on the 30th of 

        19                    May and it is in respect of Witnesses MU, 

        20                    LAG, LAR and LAT. Both motions are under 

        21                    Rule 73bis (e).

        22     MR. PRESIDENT:

        23                    MU, LAG, LAR and --

        24     MR. KAREGYESA:

         2                    LAT.

         3     MR. KAREGYESA:

         4                    And both were filed before the amendment to 

         5                    the Rule.

         6     MR. PRESIDENT:

         7                    Yes, would you indicate what the motions 

         8                    relate to?

         9     MR. KAREGYESA:

        10                    Your Honours, both motions, in both motions, 

        11                    the Prosecution seeks relief of this 

        12                    Honourable Chamber to vary the list of 

        13                    Prosecution witnesses, by dispensing with 

        14                    the appearance of Witnesses, LCI, MU, LAG, 

        15                    LAR and LAT. The grounds of this 

        16                    application, Your Honour are inter alia that 

        17                    the shortening of the witness list promotes 

        18                    judiciary efficiency as it shortens the 

        19                    trial and is therefore in the interest of 

        20                    justice.  

        21                    

        22                    Further, that the Prosecution reserves its 

        23                    discretion in determining which witnesses 

        24                    not to call at trial.

         1                    And finally, Your Honours, the accused 

         2                    persons suffer no prejudice if the said 

         3                    witnesses are not called to testify, and the 

         4                    defence are at liberty to call them if they 

         5                    so wish.  

         6                    Those are the grounds of the application  

         7                    Your Honour.

         8     MR. PRESIDENT:  

         9                    Very well, thank you. Mr. Rety?

        10     MR. RETY:

        11                    Mr. President, Your Honours, Andr  

        12                    Ntagerura's Defence does not have any 

        13                    objection against the motion in as far as 

        14                    that it does not seem that the Prosecutor is  

        15                    not obviously addressing discretionary 

        16                    powers. 

        17                    

        18                    However, the Prosecutor -- what that will do 

        19                    is to examine whether -- what the 

        20                    implications of those witnesses will have to 

        21                    the Defence. So we are requesting on the 

        22                    basis of Rules 73 and 74, we are requesting  

        23                    the Tribunal to order the witnesses to be 

        24                    retained here.  I beg your pardon, under 

        25                    Article -- Rules 73 and 75. So we are

         1                    requesting the Chamber to order that these 

         2                    witnesses remain here at least five days 

         3                    after the submission of the list of 

         4                    Prosecution witnesses so that we can make 

         5                    the necessary verifications. This is under 

         6                    the Andr  Ntagerura Defence's position, Mr. 

         7                    President. 

         8     MR. PRESIDENT:  

         9                    Mr. Rety, I don't quite understand your 

        10                    grounds why we should keep the witnesses 

        11                    here for over five days.

        12     MR. RETY:

        13                    Mr. President as you might have noticed, 

        14                    first, I made a mistake. Actually I was 

        15                    referring to Rule 54.  I hope you have 

        16                    understood that. Five days I have referred 

        17                    to after the submission of the Defence 

        18                    witness statements, rather.  As you can 

        19                    notice that we have a tight schedule in view 

        20                    of the long list of witnesses, and as you 

        21                    have noticed the last witnesses on the list 

        22                    are expert witnesses and we will need 

        23                    enormous concentration on our work.  That is 

        24                    why we will be available to inspect and talk 

        25                    to those witnesses only after the submission

         1                    of the statements of Prosecution witnesses, 

         2                    Mr. President.

         3     MR. PRESIDENT:  

         4                    Mr. Rety, even if they are not here, you 

         5                    will still have an opportunity to speak to 

         6                    them wherever they are. I imagine they are 

         7                    coming from Rwanda. You will have an 

         8                    opportunity to speak to them in Rwanda.

         9     MR. KAREGYESA:

        10                    Mr. President, I note that Counsel Rety's 

        11                    submission is contrary to the response filed 

        12                    with the Chamber on the 28th of May in 

        13                    which, and I quote, in which the Defence 

        14                    says, the Defence has no objection to the 

        15                    Prosecution's motion to vary its list of 

        16                    witnesses by withdrawing Witness LCI and 

        17                    leaving the decision to the entire 

        18                    discretion of the Chamber.

        19     MR. PRESIDENT:  

        20                    Yes, very well. Yes, Mr. Rety?

        21     MR. RETY:

        22                    Mr. President, I did not see how this is 

        23                    contrary to what --  that, the Prosecutor 

        24                    has proposed that these witnesses be dropped 

        25                    and I said that we have no objection to

         1                    that, but I would like the Prosecutor to 

         2                    make sure that they present these witnesses 

         3                    to the Defence.  Of course, we will not 

         4                    decline such an offer but up to now, we 

         5                    don't have any elements, we have never 

         6                    talked to those witnesses to see whether or 

         7                    not they will be useful to us. 

         8                    

         9                    With regard to the comments made by Mr. 

        10                    President here, in that those witnesses will 

        11                    be available in Rwanda, I would simply like 

        12                    to say that these witnesses were not our 

        13                    witnesses. We have not been able to contact 

        14                    them. We do not know the techniques of the 

        15                    approach used by the Prosecutor, and we do 

        16                    not know once they are in Rwanda whether we 

        17                    will have access to them.  

        18                    

        19                    However, we believe that it would be useful. 

        20                    In any event, this is the only way of 

        21                    getting contact to those witnesses, that is 

        22                    when they are here, in order for us to 

        23                    evaluate the situation so as to see whether 

        24                    it will be useful for us to go to Rwanda to

         1                    actually present them as witnesses for us, 

         2                    for the Defence but at this point in time, 

         3                    we do not know anything that is why we can 

         4                    neither accept nor reject such an offer and 

         5                    I think it is premature to make such a 

         6                    stand, Mr. President.

         7     MR. PRESIDENT:

         8                    You have had -- these witness statements 

         9                    have been given to you? So you will have an 

        10                    understanding as to what is the nature of 

        11                    their evidence.

        12     MR. RETY:

        13                    When one seeks to bring before your Chamber 

        14                    evidence, Mr. President, one wants to prove 

        15                    something. The statements as they were drawn 

        16                    up, were drawn up by the Prosecutor in order 

        17                    to what they wanted to show to this Chamber. 

        18                    Today, the Prosector has dropped those 

        19                    witnesses as being useless to them. However, 

        20                    we are still obliged in what is before us, 

        21                    to --

        22     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        23                    I don't know whether 'useless' is the 

        24                    correct word.

        25     MR. RETY:

         1                    Okay, I will withdraw this description.  I 

         2                    would like simply to say today, we cannot 

         3                    say that we are going to present these 

         4                    witnesses for us on basis of the statements 

         5                    submitted by the Prosecutor.  We can only 

         6                    actually present them on the basis of the 

         7                    statements that we have collected and which 

         8                    could be useful for the Defence. But for the 

         9                    moment, we don't know anything. Thank you, 

        10                    Mr. President. 

        11     MR. PRESIDENT:

        12                    Very well. Mr. Benoit? Oh, oh sorry, Mr. 

        13                    Boutin. My apologies.

        14     MR. BOUTIN:  

        15                    I understand the application by my learned 

        16                    friend, Counsel Rety. Our approach is 

        17                    similar in that the offer made by the 

        18                    Prosecutor to the Defence of giving up her 

        19                    right of calling up those witnesses would be 

        20                    relevant to us if we know what is the stand 

        21                    of those witnesses. My friend here requested 

        22                    an order -- specific order. I think in our 

        23                    case, we believe that an order could be 

        24                    issued to order the OTP to inform the 

        25                    Defence on the movement of the witnesses so

         1                    that we are able to contact them if this 

         2                    appears to be necessary for the Defence.  

         3                    Such an order, in our point of view, would 

         4                    be a practical thing, without causing 

         5                    prejudice either to the witness or to the 

         6                    Office of the Prosecutor. 

         7     MR. PRESIDENT:

         8                    Yes, Madam Mbida?

         9     MS. MBIDA:

        10                    Thank you, Mr. President.  My reply will be 

        11                    very brief with regard to the two motions 

        12                    that the Prosecutor has presented here.  I 

        13                    am saying I will be very brief because 

        14                    apparently Rule 73bis (E) was amended during 

        15                    the last Plenary session, if I am to go 

        16                    along with information given to us by the 

        17                    Prosecutor since I do not have the contents 

        18                    of the new provisions of this Rule. I 

        19                    believe that it will be risky for me to 

        20                    comment something which I do not have in 

        21                    front of me.  But in response to the first 

        22                    motion of the Prosecutor with regard to the 

        23                    dropping of Witness LCI, you will remember 

        24                    that I had said that at the time, Mr. 

        25                    President, that Rule 73bis (E) under that 


                    PETRUS CHIJARIRA - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

         1                    Rule the Prosecutor is given the possibility 

         2                    of varying the list of witnesses in the 

         3                    interest of justice. And I was saying, in my 

         4                    response, Mr. President that the Prosecutor 

         5                    had not sufficiently shown what here is the 

         6                    interest of justice. I would like to draw 

         7                    the attention of the Chamber to the fact 

         8                    that the witness that the Prosecutor 

         9                    proposes to withdraw was (By order of the 

        10                    Court, the words here have been struck off) 

        11                    who came here and I was saying that if the 

        12                    Prosecutor is dropping her -- that she be 

        13                    withdrawn is because --.

        14     MS. MOBBERLEY:

        15                    -- to be struck from the record.

        16     MR. PRESIDENT:

        17                    Yes. It is better not to make specific 

        18                    references so that parties might be 

        19                    identified. Yes, would you strike that 

        20                    aspect of it from the record, please, with 

        21                    regard to the relationship between the 

        22                    parties -- the witness, the relationship 

        23                    between the witnesses. Yes?

        24     MS. MBIDA:

        25                    Mr. President, I am sorry. I did not think

         1                    that it will -- it might divulge the 

         2                    identity of the witness otherwise I would 

         3                    not have done that. I was saying that the 

         4                    Prosecutor risks contradicting herself 

         5                    seriously. That is why she dared opt for the 

         6                    withdrawal of that witness and that is why I 

         7                    was wondering what here is the interest of 

         8                    justice and I had requested your Chamber to 

         9                    dismiss the Prosecutor's motion. 

        10                    

        11                    The second link of this motion is that the 

        12                    Prosecutor was proposing -- was making a 

        13                    motion and I had informed the Prosecutor 

        14                    what we thought about the application and I 

        15                    told them that I did not actually want to 

        16                    include that witness on Imanishimwe's 

        17                    Defence witnesses' list.

        18                    

        19                    And now with regard to the withdrawal of the 

        20                    of the four other witnesses, he himself has 

        21                    reminded you of the order which he gave you 

        22                    with regard to the order concerning the 

        23                    variation of the list, and this is why, Mr. 

        24                    President, I would like now to defer to your 

        25                    wisdom.

         1     MR. PRESIDENT:  

         2                    I should indicate Madam Mbida that the 

         3                    amendment to (E) is that the Prosecution 

         4                    does not necessarily have to file a written 

         5                    motion.  They can make an oral motion if 

         6                    they want to vary the list of witnesses. 

         7                    That is the amendment that took place at the 

         8                    last Plenary. Yes, Mr. Karegyesa, these 

         9                    witnesses, are they in Arusha to which 

        10                    reference is made here? 

        11     MR. KAREGYESA:

        12                    There are only two witnesses in Arusha, Your 

        13                    Honour.

        14     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        15                    What I am asking, any of these that you are 

        16                    asking to vary from the list?

        17     MR. KAREGYESA:  

        18                    Yes, there are only two who are currently in 

        19                    Arusha.

        20     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        21                    In Arusha?

        22     MR. KAREGYESA: 

        23                    They are detained at the UNDF.

        24     MR. PRESIDENT:

         3     MR. PRESIDENT:  

         4                    You mean these are persons who are already 

         5                    detained?

         6     MR. KAREGYESA: 

         7                    They are witnesses who were transferred 

         8                    pursuant to an order of this Court from the

        20                    issues raised by the Defence?

        23                    that, Your Honour.

         9                    application to interview prosecution 

        10                    witnesses, and in light of that application 

        11                    the Prosecution preserves its right to make 

        12                    similar application in respect of Defence 

        13                    witnesses.  

        14                    

        15                    In terms of the interest of justice, the 

        16                    matter outlined by Mr. Karegyesa was the 

        17                    principal ground relied on by the 

        18                    Prosecution in the matters that in the 

        19                    Prosecution's assessment, these additional 

        20                    witnesses are unnecessary as evidence has 

        21                    already been led, their calling to give 

        22                    evidence would simply be superfluous and the 

        23                    principal interest of justice is there in 

        24                    favour of the accused, which is to reduce 

        25                    the length of trial where there is no major

         1                    prejudice to the accused and where the 

         2                    evidence is already before the court.  It is  

         3                    simply a matter of unnecessary duplication 

         4                    of evidence in the Prosecutor's submission, 

         5                    and that is the basis, the principal basis 

         6                    on which the application is made by the 

         7                    Prosecutor to vary the witness list by 

         8                    dropping these witnesses.

         9     MR. PRESIDENT:  

        10                    Yes, Mr. Rety?

        11     MR. RETY: 

        12                    Mr. President --

        13     

        14     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        15                    We don't want to drag this too long but we 

        16                    try to give each person an opportunity to   

        17                    represent their arguments, but we don't want 

        18                    to have repetitions of arguments.  I think 

        19                    you have made your submission, the 

        20                    Prosecution has made its application and you 

        21                    have responded and that's the end of the 

        22                    issue. It's now for the Trial Chamber to 

        23                    rule. We can't go on with this any further.  

        24                    So we will now make our ruling.

         1                    The application made by the Prosecution with 

         2                    regard to these witnesses, the application 

         3                    is granted.  It is always helpful to the 

         4                    Court when the witnesses are decreased, not 

         5                    when they are increased. So if the number of 

         6                    the witnesses are being decreased, the 

         7                    proceedings go along much more 

         8                    expeditiously, and that is always good.  We 

         9                    don't want to have a number of unnecessary 

        10                    witnesses being called. Prosecution has seen 

        11                    fit to drop these witnesses from its list 

        12                    and there is no reason why the Court should 

        13                    have an objection to that. 

        14                    

        15                    With regard to the Defence application that 

        16                    these witnesses be kept here for five days, 

        17                    that is not acceptable and that is rejected. 

        18                    And so for the record, the witnesses that 

        19                    have been removed from the list of witnesses 

        20                    are LCI, LCU, LAG, LAR and LAT.  

        21                    Yes, will the Prosecutor proceed?

        22     MS. MOBBERLEY:

        23                    Your Honour, the witnesses scheduled for 

        24                    this morning are --.

         1                    Yes, Mr. Rety?

         2     MR. RETY:

         3                    Mr. President, I request you to allow us 

         4                    before the witness is called here, Mr. 

         5                    President, you told us that the provisions 

         6                    of some Rules have been amended and that 

         7                    Rule 15bis has now been added to the Rules. 

         8                    I have taken note of that and I would like 

         9                    to draw with the provisions of Rule 6(c) 

        10                    which says that amendments of a Rule will be 

        11                    effective immediately without prejudice to 

        12                    the rights of the accused whose case is 

        13                    before the Court.  I don't know if this 

        14                    provision or this particular Rule has been 

        15                    modified, Mr. President.

        16     MR. PRESIDENT:  

        17                    What is the prejudice?  Mr. Rety, I should 

        18                    have indicated that, and, of course, that 

        19                    this would follow that if we are hearing the 

        20                    matter for a few days in the absence of  

        21                    Judge Ostrovsky and that when Judge 

        22                    Ostrovsky returns, he will have the 

        23                    transcripts available to him. So I think 

        24                    that should be borne in mind.  But can you 

        25                    tell us what is the prejudice of which you

         1                    speak?

         2     MR. RETY:  

         3                    Yes, Your Honour.  Let us read again our 

         4                    Rule 8(C).  It states that the decisions 

         5                    adopted by the majority of Judges, and that 

         6                    is the reason, opinion attached thereto or 

         7                    that it would follow as soon as possible, 

         8                    separate or dissenting opinions may be 

         9                    appended.  

        10                    

        11                    Now, in the instant case, you will notice, 

        12                    Mr. President, and you will agree that, the 

        13                    credibility of a witness can be assessed on 

        14                    the prima facie basis or maybe on reading 

        15                    his evidence.  I think the only fact of 

        16                    being -- of having access to transcripts is 

        17                    not enough to enable a Judge to assess the 

        18                    credibility of a witness.  And that is the 

        19                    reason why we think that to hold this 

        20                    hearing with only two Judges instead of 

        21                    three would deprive us of the possibility of 

        22                    having the enlightened opinion of three 

        23                    Judges, and this would amount to a 

        24                    prejudice.

         1                    Earlier on, Mr. President, you indeed read 

         2                    out a decision which you had taken which 

         3                    decision was that you had decided to 

         4                    continue with this -- the hearing of this 

         5                    matter, but I would respectfully submit to 

         6                    you that Rule 15(F) which you did not tell 

         7                    us was amended states that:  

         8                    In the event of illness or vacancy in a 

         9                    Chamber or in any other circumstance, the 

        10                    President may authorise a Chamber to conduct 

        11                    current business, for example by rendering 

        12                    decisions in the absence of one or more of 

        13                    its members.  

        14                    

        15                    We of the Defence, we understand the term 

        16                    'President' as being the President of the 

        17                    Tribunal, and in my opinion this provision 

        18                    of Rule 15(F) contradicts the provisions 

        19                    which you just read out to us.  If we 

        20                    maintain the Rules at the same time the 

        21                    possibility that it will be the President 

        22                    that authorises that current matters be 

        23                    disposed of, or that it should be the 

        24                    Chamber itself which will assume 

        25                    responsibility of conducting routine

         1                    business.  

         2                    

         3                    Earlier on, we thought that the matters 

         4                    relating to motions would be part of what 

         5                    would be considered on reading Rule 15(F) as 

         6                    being matters or current matters to be 

         7                    disposed of, routine matters to be disposed 

         8                    of.  

         9                    

        10                    However, I think the hearing of witnesses 

        11                    under these circumstances will contradict 

        12                    both the provisions of Rule 88(C) and the 

        13                    provisions of Rule 6(C), Mr. President.  

        14                    This is what we want to bring to your 

        15                    attention.

        16     

        17     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        18                    Mr. Rety?

        19     MR. RETY: 

        20                    Yes, Your Honour? 

        21     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        22                    Rule 15(F) is no longer in existence. We now 

        23                    have Rule 15bis which is a replacement of 

        24                    Rule 15(F).  That is why we now have a bis 

        25                    when we did not have a bis before. You see,

         1                    we did not have a Rule 15bis before, we had 

         2                    Rule 15(F). Rule 15bis is a replacement of 

         3                    Rule 15(F). I am sorry I did not indicate 

         4                    that earlier on. There is no longer Rule 

         5                    15(F). Rule 15(F) has now become Rule 15bis.

         6     MR. RETY:  

         7                    Yes, Sir, Your Honour, we have just learned 

         8                    about that as you would notice, we are still 

         9                    working with that material. We do not even 

        10                    know the substance of the provisions that 

        11                    have been amended. Mr. President, however, I 

        12                    submit that Rule 6(c) and Rule 88(c) remain 

        13                    relevant. 

        14     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        15                    Yes, I am still trying to find out Mr. Rety 

        16                    what you said -- all right you indicated 

        17                    what you said is a prejudice. Yes, very well 

        18                    Madam Mbida?

        19     MS. MBIDA:  

        20                    Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, 

        21                    indeed I wanted to come back in a few words 

        22                    to the prejudice that our clients may suffer 

        23                    with respect to or because of the absence of 

        24                    a Judge. I do not want to repeat what Mr. 

        25                    Rety has already presented but I simply want

         1                    to underscore one point and this point is 

         2                    related to the need for all the Judges to be 

         3                    present.  Mr. President, as you know, when 

         4                    we are at a hearing, very often I ask the 

         5                    witnesses to come closer because I want to 

         6                    see their demeanour. I also suppose that 

         7                    this is the same attitude of the Judges, 

         8                    that the demeanour of the witness at a 

         9                    hearing, his reaction to the questions put 

        10                    to the witness, all of this may enable the 

        11                    Judge to understand, to assess the degree of 

        12                    credibility of a witness.

        13                    

        14                    Now, if one of the members of the Chamber is 

        15                    absent for one reason or the other and if 

        16                    only he has to have the access to the 

        17                    transcripts of the hearing, Mr. President,  

        18                    I think the accused will suffer immense 

        19                    prejudice because the judge who is absent 

        20                    would not have seen the witness who 

        21                    testified, would not have been able to 

        22                    access the witness' demeanour, or his 

        23                    reaction to the questions put out to him. So 

        24                    Mr. President, I think that one of the 

        25                    reasons which would make us think that the

         1                    accused would suffer a prejudice in the 

         2                    absence of one of the members of the Chamber 

         3                    is also this reason that I have just stated 

         4                    Mr. President. I think it is necessary for 

         5                    you the Judges to see the people who come 

         6                    before you to give testimony. This is all 

         7                    the more necessary as in these hearings, 99 

         8                    percent of the testimony or proof or 

         9                    evidence that we have is the testimony given 

        10                    by the witness.

        11     MR.  PRESIDENT:

        12                    I think we have to bear in mind that we are 

        13                    not thinking of a prolonged hearing. There 

        14                    is a limited period of time within which  

        15                    two Judges can continue to hear the 

        16                    part-heard case. It is not as if the two 

        17                    Judges are going to continue to hear the 

        18                    case to finality. It is only for a limited 

        19                    period of time.  So I think we should bear 

        20                    that aspect of the matter in mind. Anyway, 

        21                    Mr. Boutin?

        22     MR. BOUTIN:  

        23                    I am not going to extend this debate. I 

        24                    subscribe to the views expressed by my 

        25                    colleagues. Obviously for us the Defence, I

         1                    believe it is the same thing for the 

         2                    Prosecution, it is important obviously for 

         3                    accused to be tried by people who are aware 

         4                    not only of the testimony in the 

         5                    transcripts, but also who are in a position 

         6                    to assess the demeanour of the witnesses, 

         7                    the credibility of the witnesses. These are 

         8                    all elements which are very subtle and 

         9                    obviously cannot be reflected in a 

        10                    transcript. We believe that the very absence 

        11                    of a Judge even for a very short period, the 

        12                    Accused Bagambiki, will suffer inherent 

        13                    prejudices as a result of the absence of one 

        14                    of the Judges who eventually would have to 

        15                    render judgment on the basis of not only 

        16                    what he heard but also on the basis of what 

        17                    he saw.  The absent Judge was he able, would 

        18                    be able to assess the credibility of the 

        19                    witness?  So, the absence of a Judge causes 

        20                    inherent prejudice to the accused. Thank 

        21                    you, Mr. President.

        22     MR. PRESIDENT:  

        23                    Yes, Ms. Mobberley?

        24     MR. MOBBERLEY:

         1                    indicated that the Trial Chamber will only 

         2                    be sitting this week and as Tuesday is a 

         3                    holiday and Friday is regularly a day on 

         4                    which the court does not sit and that leaves 

         5                    the balance of three days of testimony that  

         6                    will be put before the Court before it is 

         7                    expected that Judge Ostrovsky will return.  

         8                    

         9                    The principal ground of prejudice or the 

        10                    only ground of prejudice rather advanced by 

        11                    the Defence is that of His Honour not being 

        12                    in position to assess demeanour and 

        13                    therefore the credibility of the witnesses, 

        14                    and it would be possible for the Trial 

        15                    Chamber to order that the witness be filmed, 

        16                    that the tape be sealed and that the tape be 

        17                    destroyed following His Honour's viewing of 

        18                    the tape. 

        19                    

        20                    There is an analogy to be drawn in my 

        21                    submission from Rule 71 of the Rules of 

        22                    Procedure and Evidence which relates to 

        23                    depositions.  Under Rule 71(D) a deposition 

        24                    may be given by means of a video conference 

        25                    and maybe that Rule could be extended, or

         1                    rather interpreted to a situation where if 

         2                    His Honour is not available to receive the 

         3                    video conference immediately, certainly he 

         4                    could be given a viewing of the relevant 

         5                    sealed video upon his return. 

         6                    

         7                    The cases relating to depositions do conform 

         8                    with the position that Your Honours have 

         9                    indicated in that they are allowed as a 

        10                    mechanism for getting testimony before a 

        11                    Judge in these unusual and limited 

        12                    circumstances, and I take it that there is 

        13                    the approach that Your Honours are 

        14                    suggesting in relation to the transcripts.  

        15                    

        16                    The two cases that are relevant in the ICTY 

        17                    jurisdiction arise under Rule 71, which is 

        18                    this correlative provision. The provisions 

        19                    in that jurisdiction is, of course, 

        20                    different and the distinction is that in the 

        21                    ICTY, a Trial Chamber may of its own motion, 

        22                    order that a deposition be taken for use at 

        23                    trial. In this jurisdiction, of course, we 

        24                    are limited to deposition upon application 

        25                    by a party, but in any case, the relevant

         1                    decisions are The Prosecutor and Kupreskic 

         2                    et al, decision dated 11 February, 1999, 

         3                    titled, "Decision on Prosecution and Defence 

         4                    Requests to Proceed by Depositions." In that 

         5                    case, it was considered that it was in the 

         6                    interests of justice that the hearing of a 

         7                    witness in a trial not be stayed. That 

         8                    deposition measures would therefore be taken 

         9                    as a temporary measure for two days, and 

        10                    that the procedure of hearing the witness 

        11                    would be the same as an ordinary hearing 

        12                    with the presiding officers and counsel 

        13                    robed. The other two Judges would act as 

        14                    presiding officers and the record would be 

        15                    transmitted to the Trial Chamber consisting 

        16                    of three Judges.  It seems to me there is an 

        17                    analogy to be drawn even if the situation is 

        18                    not squarely the same on the facts.

        20                    The second decision is The Prosecutor vs 

        21                    Kordic and Erkez, dated 3 November 1999, 

        22                    titled, "Decision on Prosecution Request to 

        23                    proceed on Depositions." In that case, a 

        24                    deposition was agreed on the basis that one 

        25                    of the members of the Trial Chambers was not

         1                    available. And that the Trial Chamber must 

         2                    not prejudice the right of the Accused to be 

         3                    tried without undue delay.  Again the 

         4                    circumstances were limited but may, in some 

         5                    way, be relevant to the present situation 

         6                    given that we are only talking of three days 

         7                    testimony.  

         8                    

         9                    As to the issue of undue delay, it is my

        11                    on proceeding to trial or proceeding to hear 

        12                    the testimony of these witnesses amounts to 

        13                    a waiver of any further objection that may 

        14                    arise undue delay by reason of these 

        15                    circumstances, and, those are my submissions 

        16                    Your Honour. 

        17     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        18                    Yes, do the Defence care to respond?

        19     

        20     MR. RETY:  

        21                    Yes, Your Honour.  As you can see the 

        22                    Prosecutor is not for presenting the same 

        23                    interests as us, I would have been surprised 

        24                    that he would share our view. Moreover this 

        25                    is evidence of the fact that, of course, we

         1                    would suffer a prejudice if there were only 

         2                    two Judges and this is in our interests.  

         3                    

         4                    The Prosecutor by proposing that we should 

         5                    use a video conference method -- I am going 

         6                    to give you the substance of our thinking, 

         7                    the substance of our strategy when we will 

         8                    be defending our clients, Mr. President. The 

         9                    reaction of everyone, we attach importance, 

        10                    we attach importance to each of our Judges 

        11                    and will not accept that anyone of you be 

        12                    absent even if your decision at the final 

        13                    analysis, we do not know what it will be. As 

        14                    you all know, when a witness is questioned 

        15                    or when a witness is examined in-chief or  

        16                    cross-examined, there are other parameters 

        17                    that are used. This could be the reaction of 

        18                    the Judges. And when we have the reaction of 

        19                    a Judge, we could decide whether we should 

        20                    stop or whether we should continue or 

        21                    whether we have done what we had to do. 

        22                    Now, in this case the absence of Judge 

        23                    Ostrovsky would deprive us of a kind of 

        24                    guideline, a fundamental guideline to us, 

        25                    and, Mr. President, we think and rest

         2                    reactions on the Bench. 

         3                    

         4                    The Video Conference has this inconvenience 

         5                    and it is that when you think that our 

         6                    question was relevant or irrelevant or when 

         7                    the witness was not very precise with 

         8                    respect to the opinion that you want to form 

         9                    Mr. President, sometimes you interrupt, you 

        10                    interrupt the witness, you ask additional 

        11                    questions. 

        12                    

        13                    Now, we know that Judge Ostrovsky is one of 

        14                    those who questions the witnesses, who 

        15                    examines the witnesses. I think to deprive 

        16                    him of the possibility of questioning the 

        17                    witness, deprives us of further light which 

        18                    would enable us to reach the goal we are 

        19                    seeking. That is the prejudice we are 

        20                    raising and the Prosecutor may not see this 

        21                    prejudice because it is not in her interest. 

        22     MR. PRESIDENT:

        23                    Very well.  Any Defence counsel who wishes 

        24                    to raise any issue?

         1                    Mr. President, just a brief comment.  You 

         2                    stated that Judge Ostrovsky will be absent 

         3                    this week and you said that it was in the 

         4                    interest of justice for the trial to 

         5                    proceed. I do not think that in the light of 

         6                    the comments made by the Prosecutor to the 

         7                    effect that basically that there will only 

         8                    be three days this week and also taking in 

         9                    account the comments made by the Prosecution 

        10                    in relation to our opinion that the absence 

        11                    of a Judge would create an inherent 

        12                    prejudice against the accused, I think on a 

        13                    balance, on the balance of interests, that 

        14                    you will have to take into consideration, on 

        15                    the other hand, the interest, or rather, 

        16                    need for the expeditious trial to continue, 

        17                    and on the other hand the need that the 

        18                    rights of the accused are protected, in this  

        19                    balance, in this exercise to make a balance  

        20                    of various interests and in the light of the 

        21                    comments made by the Office of the 

        22                    Prosecutor who informed you that perhaps we 

        23                    will not be sitting tomorrow, and that, as 

        24                    usual we will not be sitting on Friday 

        25                    either and that this week we will only be

         1                    having three hearing days, and that 

         2                    therefore, this will not create unfairness, 

         3                    this will not unnecessarily delay the 

         4                    conduct of the proceedings.  I think that 

         5                    should enable us to conserve -- to preserve 

         6                    the interests of the Accused, their inherent 

         7                    rights, and to do so, I think all the Judges 

         8                    should be here to assess the evidence 

         9                    presented. It is not a matter of duration, 

        10                    it is a matter of the quality of evidence. 

        11                    Of course, we would not know how the witness 

        12                    is going to behave maybe he could be a very 

        13                    important witness or a less important 

        14                    witness, but in the assessment of things in 

        15                    that exercise, the assessment exercise that 

        16                    you have to carry out, we submit that we 

        17                    should postpone the hearing.  Thank you. 

        18     

        19     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        20                    Just a matter for your information, it is 

        21                    indeed a fact that we will only sit for 

        22                    three days this week. Tomorrow is a public 

        23                    holiday. So we won't be sitting, we don't 

        24                    normally sit on Friday.  So any sitting  

        25                    will be today and Wednesday and Thursday,

          1                   1l00H. 

          2    MR. PRESIDENT:

          3                   The proceedings are resumed.  We will now 

          4                   deliver our ruling on the submissions 

          5                   that were made by the Prosecution and the 

          6                   Defence.  

          7                   

          8                   It is true that all Judges should be 

          9                   present while the witness is giving 

         10                   evidence.  That is a fundamental 

         11                   principle.  However Rule 15Bis is 

         12                   applicable in a very limited way, and 

         13                   provides an exception in particular 

         14                   circumstances.  It allows the Trial 

         15                   Chamber to proceed with the hearing with 

         16                   two Judges in certain circumstances to 

         17                   which the Rule applies, and for a limited 

         18                   time not exceeding five days.  

         19                   

         20                   In the particular circumstances we do not 

         21                   propose to extend the Rule beyond three 

         22                   days.  There has to be a balance in the 

         23                   interest of justice which includes the 

         24                   interest of the Accused, Judicial 

         25                   economy, the interest of protected

          1                   witnesses, the interest of an expeditious 

          2                   trial to avoid undue delay.  

          3                   

          4                   There are difficulties with bringing the 

          5                   witness from the Rwanda.  In the present 

          6                   circumstances the witnesses are already 

          7                   here.  It would not be desirable to have 

          8                   them sitting around for a week without, 

          9                   not making use of their testimony, nor 

         10                   would it also be desirable for them to 

         11                   return to Rwanda.  

         12                   

         13                   The protected witnesses expose themselves 

         14                   to great danger, and therefore we have to 

         15                   take into account the totality of all 

         16                   these competing interests.  

         17                   

         18                   Rule 71 deals with depositions, and in 

         19                   cases of depositions the Judges are not 

         20                   present when the witness give evidence.  

         21                   The Judges only see the transcript later 

         22                   as well as the video.  

         23                   

         24                   Rule 98 provides -- make certain 

         25                   provisions, and if Judge Ostrovsky wish

          1                   for any reason, to have any of the 

          2                   Witnesses who give evidence in his 

          3                   absence recalled, he would be free to do 

          4                   so.  

          5                   

          6                   Judges in these cases ask very few 

          7                   questions of witnesses and sometimes none 

          8                   at all.  The Judges in these chambers do 

          9                   not carry out prolonged questions of 

         10                   witnesses as occurs in the civil system.  

         11                   

         12                   We do not see any prejudice that would 

         13                   occur to the Accused in these 

         14                   circumstances when the totality of the 

         15                   circumstances is examined, and therefore 

         16                   the objections are rejected.  

         17                   

         18                   The Prosecution may proceed.

         19    MS. MOBBERLEY: 

         20                   Your Honour, do you wish to take a 

         21                   morning break at this time or do you wish 

         22                   to proceed with the next witness?

         23    MR. PRESIDENT:

         24                   Yes, I think we will take the break now 

         25                   and then we resume in 15 minutes and

          1                   proceed to hear the witness. 

          2    MS. MOBBERLEY:

          7                   Resumed at 1140.

          8    MR. PRESIDENT:

          9                   The proceedings are resumed by 

         10                   Ms. Mobberley.

         11    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         12                   Your Honours, the next Prosecution 

         13                   witness, is Witness LCG.  The witness to 

         14                   follow that is Witness LCB; she arrived 

         15                   yesterday afternoon and she is ill.  It 

         16                   may not be an issue if LCG's testimony 

         17                   takes the balance of the day, given that 

         18                   there are only three and half hours left 

         19                   for the testimony of witness LCG.

         20                   

         21                   Accordingly, the Prosecution calls 

         22                   Witness LCG, who is the next witness on 

         23                   the Prosecution witness list, and I make 

         24                   application for the testimony to begin 

         25                   with a closed session.

          1     MR. PRESIDENT:

          2                   Yes, Mr. Bagambiki, you may proceed.

          3    THE ACCUSED:

          4                   Thank you, Mr. President.  I was saying 

          5                   that you just mentioned the decision made 

          6                   by the Registry.  This decision is 

          7                   something which I have not yet received.  

          8                   I therefore do not know the contents of 

          9                   the decision by the Registry.  

         10                   

         11                   In any case I have not worked with 

         12                   Counsel Boutin for almost four months.  

         13                   We have not prepared anything together 

         14                   with regard to this witness or the 

         15                   witnesses who will be called here later.  

         16                   So questions which will be put by Boutin 

         17                   in cross-examination will not arise from 

         18                   my comments or observations, and would 

         19                   not correspond to the line of defence 

         20                   that we strategised together with the 

         21                   lead counsel.  So I would respectfully 

         22                   request you, if the need be, to authorize 

         23                   me to cross-examine the following 

         24                   witness.

          1                   Now with regard again to the decision by 

          2                   the Registry, I believe that as soon as I 

          3                   actually see the decision I think I have 

          4                   the right to see if there are any 

          5                   thoughts -- recourses which I can take, 

          6                   but so far I have not yet seen the 

          7                   decision, thank you, Mr. President.

          8    MR. PRESIDENT:

          9                   Well, Mr. Bagambiki your lead counsel 

         10                   would have been working in cooperation 

         11                   with co-counsel.  So your lead counsel 

         12                   would have conferred with co-counsel and 

         13                   he would have conveyed whatever views are 

         14                   necessary to him.  

         15                   

         16                   Secondly, we are going to have the lunch 

         17                   break before the issue of 

         18                   cross-examination arise, and it is up to 

         19                   you in those circumstances to properly 

         20                   cooperate with your co-counsel.  If you 

         21                   chose not to, then that's a matter for 

         22                   you.  You will have adopted a certain 

         23                   course and you will live by that course.

         24                   

         25                   So those are the issues and we will now

          1                   proceed with the case.  We are not going 

          2                   to have a situation where we have accused 

          3                   constantly asking questions of the 

          4                   witnesses while Counsel is available for 

          5                   that purpose.  Let us proceed with the

          7

          1    MR. PRESIDENT:

          2                   Yes, Madam Mbida.

          3    MS. MBIDA:  

          4                   Thank you, Mr. President.  My client has 

          5                   pointed out to me that he cannot hear the 

          6                   Witness.  Is it possible for the Witness 

          7                   to speak nearer the microphone?  

          8    MR. PRESIDENT:

          9                   Would you kindly -- Interpreter, would 

         10                   you ask the Witness to come closer to the 

         11                   microphone, and to speak up so that he 

         12                   can be heard. 

         13    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         14                   Witness LCG, is the person you have been 

         15                   talking about alive today?

         16    A.             No, he is no longer alive.  He is dead.

         17    Q.             Would the Interpreter please indicate to 

         18                   the witness that in order to secure 

         19                   confidentiality, I will refer to that 

         20                   person as the deceased?

          1    MS. MOBBERLEY: 

          2                   Could the Interpreter please confirm for 

          3                   the Witness that I will be referring to 

          4                   that person as the deceased.  

          5                   

          6    Q.             Witness LCG, have you seen the deceased's 

          7                   corpse?

          8    A.             Yes.

          9    Q.             What date did you see the corpse? 

         10    A.             I saw the body of the deceased on the 

         11                   28th of April 2000.

         12    Q.             Where were you when you saw the corpse?

         13    A.             I was at the pit.  I was present at the 

         14                   septic pool.  That is the septic pool 

         15                   from where the corpse was retrieved, and 

         16                   in fact that septic pool was a 

         17                   pit-latrine situated on the property of 

         18                   one Gafumo.

         19    Q.             Which sector and which prefecture was the 

         20                   pit-latrine located in?

         21    A.             The latrine was situated in the Cyangugu 

         22                   prefecture in the Mutongo sector.  I will 

         23                   spell Mutongo.  M-U-T-O-N-G-O, in the 

         24                   Kamarebe cellule.  Kamarebe is spelt 

         25                   K-A-M-A-R-E-B-E.

                                                            4 JUNE 2001

          1    Q.             How did you recognise the corpse?

          2    A.             After the exhumation of the corpse I was 

          3                   able to recognise his corpse because of 

          4                   the clothes he was wearing especially the 

          5                   blue T-shirt, and I also was able to 

          6                   recognise him because of his beard, and 

          7                   his fingers and toe-nails as well as the 

          8                   scar on his chest.  

          9                   

         10                   I also recognised him, thanks to the 

         11                   wound that he had on his wrist.

         12    Q.             You said that you recognised the T-shirt.  

         13                   What was it about the T-shirt that you 

         14                   recognised?

         15    A.             Among other things I was able to 

         16                   recognise the T-shirt because of a design 

         17                   which was in the form of a circle which 

         18                   was on the front part of the T-shirt, 

         19                   that is on the chest.  There was a circle 

         20                   and in the circle there were some 

         21                   letters.  There were also some prints 

         22                   next to that circle, and all those 

         23                   allowed me to recognise the T-shirt.  

         24                   

         25                   Obviously the blue colour in question was

          1                   no longer clearly visible because six 

          2                   years had passed.  So it was a blue which 

          3                   had been worn out a bit.

          4    Q.             Was the corpse dressed in other clothes 

          5                   when it was exhumed apart from the 

          6                   T-shirt?

          7    A.             It no longer had other clothes apart from 

          8                   the T-shirt and a swimming costume which 

          9                   was worn as an underpant, and which was 

         10                   red in colour.

         11    Q.             You said that you recognised the 

         12                   Accused's beard, his toe-nails and his 

         13                   fingers?  What was it about his toe-nails 

         14                   that were distinctive?

         15    A.             What was special about his toe-nails is 

         16                   that -- his toes -- was that they were 

         17                   long but the small toes were slightly 

         18                   turned up.  

         19    THE INTERPRETER: 

         20                   And at this point the Interpreter would 

         21                   like to make a correction and say that 

         22                   the swimming costume in question was 

         23                   actually a singlet.

         24    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         25                   Then would the Interpreter please explain

          1                   why he is correcting the interpretation?  

          2                   What was the word used in Kinyarwanda by 

          3                   the Witness, to describe the swimming 

          4                   costume? 

          5    THE INTERPRETER:

          6                   Counsel, could you please repeat the 

          7                   question because I didn't understand you 

          8                   well.

          9    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         10                   Perhaps the first thing to clarify is 

         11                   which set of Interpreters are correcting 

         12                   the translation?  Is it the Kinyarwanda 

         13                   interpreter, or the French interpreter, 

         14                   or the English interpreter?  

         15    THE INTERPRETER: 

         16                   That was the English Interpreter, 

         17                   Counsel.

         18    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         19                   Then we will retake the question for the 

         20                   Witness.  

         21    Q.             Witness LCG, was the red swimming costume 

         22                   a singlet or underpants?

         23    A.             It was an undergarment.  They had removed 

         24                   his trousers.

         25    Q.             Was the undergarment worn underneath his

          1                   trousers?

          2    A.             Yes, it was worn under his pair of 

          3                   trousers.

          4    Q.             You have said, Witness LCG, that you 

          5                   recognised the beard on the body of the 

          6                   deceased other than the beard, was there 

          7                   any other facial hair on the corpse?

          8    A.             He had sideburns as well as short 

          9                   moustache, a short moustache.

         10    Q.             What was the state of the decomposition 

         11                   of the body?

         12    A.             After the exhumation of the corpses since 

         13                   we knew that the bodies had no longer had 

         14                   hearts in them, I rushed in order to look 

         15                   at the chest on the torso, and I saw 

         16                   wounds.  I also noticed that there were 

         17                   cuts.  In other words the cuts -- the 

         18                   fingers had been cut but not completely 

         19                   chopped off.

         20    Q.             Was the flesh on the bones?

         21    A.             Yes, there was flesh on the bones.  One 

         22                   could see the configuration of the 

         23                   person, the features of the person. 

         24                   Nothing had changed but apart from the 

         25                   fact that the heart was no longer in its

          1                   place because it had been removed.

          2    Q.             You said that in relation to the 

          3                   deceased's face you recognised his beard, 

          4                   his moustache and his sideburns.  Did you 

          5                   recognise anything else about his face?

          6    A.             I also recognised the corpse of the 

          7                   deceased because of his teeth.  The upper 

          8                   jaw -- I mean the upper jaw, there were 

          9                   gaps between teeth and his teeth were 

         10                   very white.

         11    Q.             And when you say gaps do you mean they 

         12                   were teeth missing or just that there 

         13                   were spaces naturally between the teeth?

         14    A.             No, I am not talking about missing teeth.  

         15                   I am talking about space between his 

         16                   teeth.  Between, in particular two teeth.

         17    Q.             Witness LCG, you said you saw a wound on 

         18                   the torso, and that the heart was no 

         19                   longer in place, did you check for 

         20                   yourself to see if the heart was no 

         21                   longer in place or is this something that 

         22                   somebody had told you?

         23    A.             No, I did not go there to check to see 

         24                   whether the heart was missing because 

         25                   that would have been cynical behaviour

          1                   towards the deceased.  What I noticed was 

          2                   simply, was that there was a wound on the 

          3                   chest, and there was this wound there as 

          4                   I said on the chest, but I learnt that 

          5                   when these people were killed their 

          6                   hearts were removed from their bodies, 

          7                   but otherwise I did not personally check 

          8                   to see whether the heart was still in 

          9                   there.

         10    Q.             Which side of the deceased's torso was 

         11                   the wound on the chest located?

         12    A.             The wound was on the left side of the 

         13                   torso.  With regard to the wounds on the 

         14                   hands, the wound was on the right hand.

         15    Q.             Would the Courtroom Assistant please 

         16                   produce to the Accused, Prosecution 

         17                   Exhibit 51, which is photograph Exhibit 

         18                   No.4, photograph No.9. 

         19                   

         20                   sorry, Your Honours, I meant the Witness, 

         21                   not the Accused.  And please project this

          1                   you have been -- the corpse of the person 

          2                   you have been talking about in the 

          3                   photograph that is in front of you?

          4    A.             Yes, I can identify the corpse of the 

          5                   deceased.

          6    Q.             There are three corpses in that 

          7                   photograph what is the corpse of the 

          8                   deceased wearing?

          9    A.             It is this body here.

         10    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         11                   The Witness is pointing to the body that 

         12                   is wearing the red underpants and this 

         13                   coloured blue T-shirt.  

         14                   

         15                   Your Honours --

         16    MR. PRESIDENT:

         17                   Let the record so reflect.

         18    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         19                   Would the Courtroom Assistant please 

         20                   produce to the Witness, Prosecution 

         21                   Exhibit 52, marked H1.

         23                   Witness LCG, do you recognise the sample 

         24                   of clothing that's being shown to you? 

         25    A.             Yes.

          1    Q.             What do you recognise that as?

          2    A.             This is a sample which was taken from the 

          3                   T-shirt and -- but this sample was taken 

          4                   in my absence.

          5    Q.             Would the Courtroom Assistant please show 

          6                   the Exhibit to Defence counsel and to 

          7                   Your Honours.  And the record to reflect 

          8                   that the Witness has identified 

          9                   Prosecution exhibit 52, marked H1?

         10    MR. PRESIDENT:

         11                   Yes, let the record so reflect. 

         12    

         13    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         14                   Would the Courtroom Assistant please 

         15                   produce for the Witness, Prosecution 

         16                   Exhibit 52, marked H2.

         17    Q.             Witness LCG, please look at this sample 

         18                   of clothing?

         19    A.             This is a sample which was taken from the 

         20                   underpants that I pointed out to. 

         21                   

         22                   And once again this sample was taken in 

         23                   my absence.  People had come to look at 

         24                   corpses and took the samples.  They 

         25                   subsequently asked me questions.  I was

                                                            4 JUNE 2001

          1                   not even aware that photographs of these 

          2                   corpses existed.  

          3                   

          4                   When these samples were taken, I was not 

          5                   there.  I had gone to sleep because we 

          6                   had spent a long time by the fireside and 

          7                   I was tired.

          8    Q.             Were you subsequently shown both of these 

          9                   samples and asked to identify them?

         10    A.             On the 11th the people in question came 

         11                   to take the samples.  I was not present.  

         12                   I only spoke to them on the 12th with the 

         13                   person who had taken the sample and 

         14                   during the interview they asked me how 

         15                   had I been able to identify the corpse in 

         16                   question.  They asked me to go and select 

         17                   from among other samples these two 

         18                   samples which we have just seen and which 

         19                   actually were taken from the clothes that 

         20                   were on the body of the deceased, and 

         21                   this is how I was able to identify the 

         22                   samples from the T-shirt and the 

         23                   underpants.  But I have to say that when 

         24                   they were taken I was not there.  In fact 

         25                   if during the interview I had not been

          1                   able to identify these samples from among 

          2                   other samples then I would not have been 

          3                   telling the truth.

          4    MS. MOBBERLEY:

          5                   Let the record reflect that the Witness 

          6                   has identified Prosecution Exhibit 52, 

          7                   marked H2.

          8    MR. PRESIDENT:

          9                   Let the record so reflect.  

         10                   

         11                   Ms. Mobberley, I think we have probably 

         12                   got into a convenient point.

         13    MS. MOBBERLEY: 

         14                   I do have one more question and then that 

         15                   is the end of the questions for this 

         16                   witness, Your Honour, but I will have to 

         17                   take it up after the break.

         18    MR. PRESIDENT:

         19                   No, it's okay if you only have one 

         20                   question. 

         21    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         22                   Witness LCG, are you certain that in your 

         23                   absence the clothing samples were taken 

         24                   on the 11th of May, or could they have  

         25                   been taken on another day?

          1    A.             I am sure about that because it was on 

          2                   the 11th of May that is on the day where 

          3                   I was absent -- during which I was 

          4                   absent.  I was interviewed on the 12th 

          5                   and by the 12th I know that for certain 

          6                   the samples had been taken without my 

          7                   knowledge.

          8    MS. MOBBERLEY:

          9                   I have no further questions, Your Honour.

         10    MR. PRESIDENT:

         11                   Ms. Mobberley, 11th of what month?  We 

         12                   are not clear whether he did mention that 

         13                   or not.

         14    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         15                   In what month and in what year did you 

         16                   identify the clothing samples for the 

         17                   people that you spoke to.

         18    A.             The people who interviewed me asked me 

         19                   the questions on the 12th of May 2000.

         20    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         21                   That completes the direct examination, 

         22                   Your Honour.

         23                   

         24    MR. PRESIDENT:

         25                   Yes, Mr. Rety.

          1    MR. RETY: 

          2                   Mr. President, I know that it's time to 

          3                   take our break, I was just seeking 

          4                   clarification.  The Prosecutor talked to 

          5                   us about a witness who is ill.  Was she 

          6                   talking about this witness or was she  

          7                   talking about the next witness?  In any 

          8                   event we would like to know whether the 

          9                   Prosecutor intends to call another 

         10                   witness, that is, other than the one who 

         11                   has been programmed to come here.  That 

         12                   is my question Mr. President?  

         13    MR. PRESIDENT:

         14                   We could have done that after the 

         15                   adjournment Mr. Rety, but since you have 

         16                   raised it, Ms. Mobberley?

         17    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         18                   Your Honour, the Witness who is sick, is 

         19                   Witness LCB.  She was the witness 

         20                   scheduled to testify following the 

         21                   testimony of the current witness.

         22    MR. PRESIDENT: 

         23                   Yes.  

         24    MS. MOBBERLEY:

         2     MR. PRESIDENT:

         3                    The proceedings are resumed.  We continue 

         4                    with the Cyangugu trial.  The witness, LCG, 

         5                    is to be cross-examined by Mr. Rety.  

         6                    

         7                    Kindly inform the witness that he is still 

         8                    on his affirmation. 

         9     THE WITNESS:  

        10                    Very well.

        11     MR. PRESIDENT:

        12                    And I would like to inform those who are 

        13                    responsible for bringing the witness here, 

        14                    to make sure that they bring the witness on 

        15                    time, so that we do not have a delay in our 

        16                    proceedings.  

        17                    

        18                    Yes, Mr. Rety.

        19     MR. RETY:  

        20                    Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good 

        21                    afternoon, Your Honours.  As you may have 

        22                    realised, Mr. President, Defence team for 

        23                    Andr  Ntagerura, in the light of the 

        24                    amendments made by the Prosecutor this 

        25                    afternoon, we now have our Lead Counsel, and

         1                    the Defence team for Andr  Natgerura is 

         2                    therefore complete, Mr. President.  

         3                    

         4                    I would also, Mr. President, before 

         5                    beginning the cross-examination of 

         6                    Witness LCG, respectfully submit, without 

         7                    challenging the decision that you have 

         8                    already reached, I would like to submit an 

         9                    application related to Rule 6(C) of the 

        10                    Rules of Procedure and Evidence, 

        11                    Mr. President, Your Honours.  

        12                    

        13                    It is established practice in all official 

        14                    decisions, be it laws, rules, or even 

        15                    administrative decisions, Mr. President, 

        16                    Your Honours, it is established practice 

        17                    that whatever be the case, when new measure, 

        18                    when a new administrative law, when a new 

        19                    law is promulgated -- I have a problem with 

        20                    my headset, sorry about that.  I'm sorry 

        21                    about this inconvenience, Mr. President.  

        22                    So, Mr. President, I was saying that when 

        23                    there is a new law, when there is a new 

        24                    administrative measure, the practice, the 

        25                    rule is that such law, rule, or decision be

         1                    useable only from the moment that it is 

         2                    published.  

         3                    

         4                    Mr. President, Your Honours, the time now is 

         5                    3 p.m., the Defence, or the Defence teams of 

         6                    all the Accused, and our colleagues outside 

         7                    this Chamber, are not aware of the decisions 

         8                    that were reached in the plenary meeting of 

         9                    the Judges.  

        10                    

        11                    Mr. President, I submit respectfully that at 

        12                    the time the decisions were taken at the 

        13                    plenary meeting, the Prosecutor, the Judges 

        14                    and the Registrar participated in that 

        15                    meeting.  The only people who were not 

        16                    aware, and up to this moment, 3 p.m., the 

        17                    only party not aware of the decisions, with 

        18                    the exception of the few Rules that you 

        19                    informed us, were amended, so far, the 

        20                    Defence is not aware, officially, at least, 

        21                    of the decisions that were taken by the 

        22                    plenary meeting of Judges.  

        23                    

        24                    This leads us, Mr. President, Your Honours, 

        25                    to ask for an interpretation of the terms of 


                        HARUNA FARAGE - OFFICIAL REPORTER
                                ICTR - CHAMBER III

          NTAGERURA ET AL                                      4 JUNE 2001



         1                    Article, rather, Rule 6(C) of the Rules.  

         2                    When the Rules provide that an amendment 

         3                    shall enter into force immediately, but 

         4                    shall not operate to prejudice rights of the 

         5                    Accused in any pending case, the question we 

         6                    are asking is to know what does this Chamber 

         7                    mean by the term "immediately"? 

         8                    

         9                    It is therefore -- the question is on the 

        10                    interpretation of "immediately".  In the 

        11                    opinion of the Defence, "immediately" means 

        12                    after publication -- "Immediately means 

        13                    after publication.  "Immediately" means 

        14                    after those changes have been brought to our 

        15                    knowledge.   It is possible that the Chamber 

        16                    may understand that the term "immediately" 

        17                    means immediately from the moment that the 

        18                    Judges have decided that the Rules will be 

        19                    modified.  

        20                    

        21                    I respectfully submit, as generally the Lead 

        22                    Counsel says, I respectfully submit, 

        23                    Mr. President, Your Honours, that if the 

        24                    interpretation of the word "immediately" 

        25                    simply means that from the moment that the 


                        HARUNA FARAGE - OFFICIAL REPORTER
                                ICTR - CHAMBER III

          NTAGERURA ET AL                                      4 JUNE 2001



         1                    Judges have decided in their plenary meeting 

         2                    that a given Rule will be amended, even 

         3                    before the amendment is brought to the 

         4                    knowledge of the public, and, in particular, 

         5                    the knowledge of the Defence, then there is 

         6                    absence of equality of arms, because, in 

         7                    fact, the Prosecutor participated in a 

         8                    plenary meeting of Judges.  And that being 

         9                    the case, the Prosecutor is informed of what 

        10                    was decided in the plenary meeting, whereas, 

        11                    the Defence is not informed.  This is all 

        12                    the more important, as the Rules of 

        13                    Procedure and Evidence is our code of 

        14                    criminal procedure.  We have no other 

        15                    reference, apart from these Rules which 

        16                    guide us in the conduct of proceedings.  

        17                    

        18                    We are therefore of the opinion, that even 

        19                    if the principle is that Rules of Procedure 

        20                    and Evidence can enter into force 

        21                    immediately, or that they could enter into 

        22                    force retroactively, I respectfully submit 

        23                    that we cannot be asked to carry on 

        24                    proceedings on the basis of Rules that have 

        25                    been changed, and which changes are not

         1                    within our knowledge.  

         2                    If therefore, the interpretation that would 

         3                    be given by the Chamber is in line with the 

         4                    interpretation of the Defence, in fact, all 

         5                    the Defence team including, the Defence 

         6                    Counsel, who are not in this Chamber, in 

         7                    fact, they are all wondering what the 

         8                    interpretation is.  If that is the case, if 

         9                    you agree with us, then, I would ask you to 

        10                    really be aware of the fact that we have not 

        11                    yet been inform of the changes that have 

        12                    been made to the Rules of Procedure and 

        13                    Evidence.  And, on that basis, to stay, at 

        14                    least, the application of the decision that 

        15                    was taken this morning.

        16                    

        17                    But, if, indeed, you think that the 

        18                    interpretation to be given to the word, 

        19                    "immediately", must be that, once the Judges 

        20                    have decided what they have decided, would 

        21                    enter into force immediately, then we can 

        22                    continue the proceedings.  This is what I 

        23                    wanted to submit to you, Your Honours.  I 

        24                    thank you.

         1     MR. PRESIDENT:

         2                    Mr. Rety. 

         3     MR. RETY: 

         4                    Your Honour.

         5     MR. PRESIDENT:  

         6                    That may possibly be the situation in the 

         7                    civil law.  But we have to look at the 

         8                    wording of our provision, which is what we 

         9                    are bound by.  And "An amendment shall enter 

        10                    into force immediately, but shall not 

        11                    operate to prejudices to the rights of the 

        12                    Accused in any pending case."

        13                    

        14                    "Immediately", in our view means immediately 

        15                    after it is adopted, not immediately after 

        16                    the publication, immediately after it is 

        17                    adopted.  And it is for that reason why I 

        18                    read the change this morning, so that you 

        19                    could be aware of what the change was.  And, 

        20                    of course, it is always available to you to 

        21                    get copies of the change, but I read that 

        22                    portion of the Rule -- Rule change that was 

        23                    relevant to the issue.  And you will notice 

        24                    that that was the first thing I did this 

        25                    morning before I moved on with the

         1                    proceedings.  So, I tried to bring it to 

         2                    your attention that there was this 

         3                    particular change, and we made a ruling 

         4                    taking all the circumstances into 

         5                    consideration.  

         6                    

         7                    So, our understanding of that "immediate" -- 

         8                    "immediately" means immediately after it was 

         9                    adopted.  So it becomes effective at that 

        10                    moment.  So, I think, we can now move on 

        11                    with the proceedings.  Copies are available, 

        12                    and I'm sure you can get those from the 

        13                    Registry if you want to have a closer look 

        14                    at it, but I read into the record this 

        15                    morning exactly what the changes were, with 

        16                    regard to the particular issue that we are 

        17                    dealing with.  So, you may now proceed to 

        18                    cross-examine the witness. 

        19     MR. RETY:  

        20                    Thank you, Mr. President.  I raised the 

        21                    problem, not to challenge your decision, 

        22                    but, rather, for purposes of the record.

        24     Q.             Witness LCG, good afternoon.

        25     A.             Good afternoon, Counsel.

         1     Q.             Witness LCG, I'm not asking you, and will 

         2                    not ask you to reveal the name, nor the 

         3                    address, I will only ask you questions, 

         4                    simple questions, but particularly, make 

         5                    sure that you do not give names nor 

         6                    addresses.  

         7                    

         8                    Witness LCG, you testified that for 14 years 

         9                    --

        10     MR. RETY: 

        11                    Interpreter, can you already explain what I 

        12                    have said, I'm sorry.

        13     BY MR. RETY:

        14     Q.             Witness LCG, you testified that(A portion of 

        15                    the witness' answer was extracted and seal 

        16                    by order of the Court), didn't you? 

        17     MS.  MOBBERLEY:

        18                    This information was given in a closed 

        19                    session.

        20     MR. PRESIDENT:

        21                    Maybe, Mr. Rety, if you don't make any 

        22                    reference to matters that the possibility 

        23                    might just arise, where the identity might 

        24                    be disclosed.

         1                    So, I would ask that portion be treated as 

         2                    if given in a closed session.  You can say, 

         3                    period of years, as he indicated, or matters 

         4                    to that effect, rather than being more 

         5                    specific. 

         6     MR. RETY: 

         7                    Very well.

         8     BY MR. RETY:

         9     Q.             Witness LCG, so you testified that you lived 

        10                    for a long time with the person that we are 

        11                    discussing here, didn't you?

        12     A.             That's correct.

        13     Q.             Witness LCG, am I right in thinking that you 

        14                    never left Rwanda before coming to Arusha?

        15     A.             I never left Rwanda.

        16     Q.             Am I therefore right in thinking that you 

        17                    have always lived in the same house as the 

        18                    person that we are talking about?

        19     A.             You are right.

        20     Q.             Am I also right, Witness LCG, in thinking 

        21                    that in 1994, at the time President 

        22                    Habyarimana's plane was shot down, that 

        23                    officially, you were a businessman?

        24     A.             Yes, you are right.  But I must specify that 

        25                    on that date during that period, we were not

         1                    allowed to carry on our duties as 

         2                    businessmen.  We were prohibited from doing 

         3                    so by the prefet.  I was carrying out my 

         4                    trade (place of work of the witness was 

         5                    extracted from the transcript and put under 

         6                    seal by order of the Court) in a kiosk.

         7     Q.             Do not give other details, Witness LCG.  

         8                    Witness LCG -- 

         9     MR. PRESIDENT:  

        10                    Just indicate to him, he should not give any 

        11                    information that might disclose his 

        12                    identity.  And he needs to be careful about 

        13                    that.  

        14                    

        15                    And I suggest that where he was working, be 

        16                    struck from the record, be treated as if 

        17                    given in closed session.  Not what work he 

        18                    was doing, but where he was working.

        19     BY MR. RETY:

        20     Q.             Am I also right, Witness LCG, in thinking 

        21                    that in reality, while you were officially a 

        22                    trader, you were also a member of the RPF? 

        23     MS.  MOBBERLEY:

        24                    Your Honours, this is irrelevant.  It's 

        25                    outside the scope of the

         1                    examination-in-chief.

         2     MR. PRESIDENT:

         3                    Mr. Rety, there is an objection that's made, 

         4                    would you like to respond? 

         5     MR. RETY:  

         6                    Yes, Mr. President, I would respond to it.  

         7                    I think, in this respect, you already made  

         8                    decisions which tend to authorise me to ask 

         9                    such a question.  Because, Mr. President, 

        10                    you will remember that we are discussing the 

        11                    circumstances of death -- of the death, and 

        12                    the element of intent is very important.  We 

        13                    are here dealing with a matter of 

        14                    credibility.  

        15                    

        16                    But, in addition to that, this is also an 

        17                    issue, the relevance of which is not to be 

        18                    questioned, because in the final analyses, 

        19                    if the Chamber refuses to hear anything 

        20                    about the circumstances in which the events 

        21                    occurred, the Chamber would be closing the 

        22                    door to knowing what the circumstances or 

        23                    the reasons of the death were.  

        24                    

        25                    And that is why on the basis of Rule 90(G),

         1                    you can authorise me to cross-examine on 

         2                    credibility, and any other issue that the 

         3                    Chamber may find pertinent.  And I 

         4                    respectfully submit that this question is 

         5                    relevant.  And if we cannot ask a question 

         6                    along these lines, then we would not be able 

         7                    to organise our defence.

         8     MR. PRESIDENT:

         9                    I can see the issue of credibility, 

        10                    Mr. Rety, but I can't see the issue of -- 

        11                    because he is not the one who has died.  So, 

        12                    the other point you made, I have some 

        13                    problems with seeing that, but I can see the 

        14                    possibility of some issue of credibility.  

        15                    But not as to how the circumstances 

        16                    occurred, which brought about the other 

        17                    person's death, because that would affect 

        18                    him -- that would not affect him.  But if 

        19                    you want to go in the wide issue of 

        20                    credibility which is so wide open, then we 

        21                    will allow the question, provided this area 

        22                    is not belaboured too much. 

        23     MR. RETY:  

        24                    Thank you, Mr. President.  I would take into 

        25                    account your comments.

         1     BY MR. RETY:

         2     Q.             Now, Witness LCG, am I right in thinking 

         3                    that in reality, you were a member of the 

         4                    RPF?

         5     A.             You are right.

         6     Q.             Very well.  Am I also right, Witness LCG, in 

         7                    thinking that in 1994, the RPF, which was a 

         8                    political movement or political military 

         9                    movement, did not organise meetings like 

        10                    other movements? 

        11     MS.  MOBBERLEY: 

        12                    Your Honour, it's difficult to see how this 

        13                    is within the scope of testing credibility.  

        14                    It seems to me that the Defence counsel have 

        15                    missed their chance to question what is of 

        16                    relevant witnesses of fact on this issue.  

        17                    This witness is only here to testify as to 

        18                    the identity of the corpse he knew about, 

        19                    and this is well beyond the scope, even, 

        20                    taking into account the issue of 

        21                    credibility, Your Honour has allowed 

        22                    questioning on.

        23     MR. PRESIDENT:

        24                    Can you assist us as to how this becomes 

        25                    relevant?  We have some trouble here with

         1                    relevance.  One must bear in mind the nature 

         2                    of his evidence.  His evidence is the 

         3                    identification of a body.  And whether there 

         4                    were particular meetings, or they want 

         5                    particular meetings, how does that help us, 

         6                    so far as relevance is concerned, in 

         7                    relation to his testimony?  Maybe it might 

         8                    be relevant with regard to some other 

         9                    witness, but with regard to this witness, 

        10                    how is it relevant?

        11     MR. RETY:

        12                    Mr. President, I thought that if I ask just 

        13                    two more questions, you would finally 

        14                    understand the relevance of my question, 

        15                    because I have only three questions to ask 

        16                    on this matter.   

        17                    

        18                    Mr. President, however, I just want to 

        19                    indicate that the relevance of this question 

        20                    stems from the fact that the RPF did not 

        21                    organise its meeting.  Its members in the 

        22                    final analyses were clandestine militants.  

        23                    Therefore, if I cannot be allowed to ask 

        24                    this question, it would be very difficult to 

        25                    establish why certain persons, perhaps, had

         1                    to be found or looked for in their homes.  

         2                    But if you think that it is not relevant, I 

         3                    respectfully submit that I would be not -- I 

         4                    would not feel comfortable to continue.

         5     MR. PRESIDENT:

         6                    Yes, we allowed the objection, Mr. Rety.  We 

         7                    don't see how this is relevant in the 

         8                    context of the evidence of this witness.  

         9                    And the earlier question you asked would 

        10                    presumably give you the information which 

        11                    you are trying to seek with regard to 

        12                    credibility.  So, I think you should move 

        13                    on.  

        14                    

        15                    That is why I said that, you know, this is 

        16                    an area that should not be prolonged.  We 

        17                    allowed that particular question because we 

        18                    can see the possibility of its credibility, 

        19                    but this area should not be pursued too 

        20                    much.  So, you may move on. 

        21     BY MR. RETY:  

        22                    Mr. President, you can therefore see why if 

        23                    you were three of you, you may have taken a 

        24                    decision different from the one that the two 

        25                    of you are reaching.

         1     MR. PRESIDENT:

         2                    Please, Mr. Rety, please.  This is improper 

         3                    and inappropriate.  There are limits to 

         4                    certain things.  We have made a ruling, and 

         5                    if you do not like that ruling, then you 

         6                    have other opportunities open to you.  But, 

         7                    please, that is an improper comment, and 

         8                    should not have been made.  And I'm 

         9                    surprised that you've made it.  And maybe, 

        10                    you should consider withdrawing it. 

        11     MR. RETY:

        12                    Thank you, Mr. President.  I therefore 

        13                    withdraw what I said.

        14     BY MR. RETY:

        15     Q.             Witness LCG, could you or, rather, would I 

        16                    be right in thinking that while you were 

        17                    living with the person that we are 

        18                    discussing, you left your personal effects 

        19                    in that person's house?

        20     A.             I do not quite understand the question, 

        21                    Counsel.

        22     Q.             Witness LCG, is it possible that you had 

        23                    your personal effects in the house of the 

        24                    person that we are discussing?

        25     A.             Yes, indeed, there were personal effects, be

         1                    they my personal effects, or the personal 

         2                    effects of the deceased, because when he 

         3                    left, he only left with the clothes on him.  

         4                    That is, the clothes that he was wearing, 

         5                    and I also left only with the clothes that I 

         6                    was wearing.  And all the personal effects  

         7                    stayed back in the house.

         8     Q.             Thank you, Witness LCG -- 

         9     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        10                    You need to wait until we get the English 

        11                    translation before you start speaking, 

        12                    otherwise the court reporters will have 

        13                    difficulty getting down two people speaking 

        14                    at the same time.

        15     MR. RETY:  

        16                    With your permission, perhaps, the 

        17                    interpreter could repeat the answer.

        18     MR. PRESIDENT:

        19                    Please, do so. 

        20     THE INTERPRETER:

        21                    The witness said that:  Indeed, there were 

        22                    personal effects in the house of the 

        23                    deceased.  Those personal effects were my 

        24                    personal effects, as well as those of the 

        25                    deceased because the deceased left only with

         1                    the clothes that he was wearing, and I also 

         2                    left only with the clothes that I was 

         3                    wearing.  All the other personal effects 

         4                    stayed in the house of the deceased.

         5     BY MR. RETY:

         6     Q.             Thank you, Witness LCG.  Witness LCG, am I 

         7                    right either in thinking that it is a 

         8                    soldier who came to take away the person we 

         9                    are discussing, to take him away from the 

        10                    killings?

        11     A.             I wouldn't say that the soldier in question 

        12                    came to take away the deceased from the 

        13                    killings.  I would specify that the soldier 

        14                    in question was called Bikomagu, I will 

        15                    spell that; B-I-K-O-M-A-G-U.  That soldier, 

        16                    therefore, came to our house, he took the 

        17                    deceased with him asking him to go and buy 

        18                    beer for him -- to go and buy beer for him 

        19                    from Hotel DU LAC.  He took him in his 

        20                    vehicle.  And as soon as he took him in his 

        21                    vehicle, our neighbour used a telephone in 

        22                    our house to call Commander Imanishimwe, to 

        23                    inform him that the said Bikomagu, that is, 

        24                    the soldier, had just taken the deceased in 

        25                    his vehicle.  He also asked the commander to

         1                    prevent the soldier from leaving, that is, 

         2                    the soldier who has taken the deceased with 

         3                    him to intercept him at the level of the 

         4                    office of the prefecture, which was close  

         5                    to the military camp.

         6     Q.             I think the witness has answered my 

         7                    question, and I think he should wait for the 

         8                    next question.  Witness LCG, do you 

         9                    acknowledge that you met the investigators 

        10                    of this Tribunal?

        11     A.             Yes, I so acknowledge.

        12     Q.             Therefore, do you admit that you made a 

        13                    statement to the said investigators on the 

        14                    12th of April, or rather, the 12th of May, 

        15                    2000?

        16     A.             I so admit.

        17     MR. RETY:

        18                    I therefore draw the Court's attention to 

        19                    the statement made by Witness LCG, on the 

        20                    date of 12th May 2000, on page 3, the French 

        21                    version, which I believe, certainly 

        22                    corresponds to page 3 of the English 

        23                    version.

        24     MR. PRESIDENT:

        25                    Which paragraph are you referring to in the 


                        HARUNA FARAGE - OFFICIAL REPORTER

         1                    English version?

         2     MR. RETY:  

         3                    Paragraph 1, headed -- paragraph 1 of the 

         4                    page, headed "Identification of the dead 

         5                    body", paragraph 1 on that page.  Page 3, 

         6                    paragraph 1, English version, the second 

         7                    sentence.  In that sentence, the witness 

         8                    tells us, "In particular, I recall that it 

         9                    was on the 12th of April 1994, and I 

        10                    remember it well.  For on that day, a 

        11                    soldier came and took him away to help him 

        12                    escape the killings that had been happening 

        13                    in our area."

        14     MR. PRESIDENT:

        15                    Do you have a copy available for the 

        16                    witness? 

        17     THE INTERPRETER: 

        18                    Yes, Your Honour. 

        19     MR. RETY:  

        20                    Please, can you translate the sentence I 

        21                    just read to the witness?

        22     BY MR. RETY:  

        23     Q.             Did you make this statement, Witness LCG?

        24     A.             Yes, I made the statement.

        25     Q.             Very well.

         3                    Your Honours, I have no further questions 

         4                    for this witness.

        10                    floor.

        12                         CROSS-EXAMINATION

        13     BY MS. MBIDA:

        14     Q.             Good afternoon, Witness LCG.

        15     A.             Good afternoon, Counsel.

        16     Q.             Witness, you just said that a soldier, whose 

        17                    name you gave, came to take away the 

        18                    deceased.  Can you tell us whether the said 

        19                    soldier was a friend to the deceased?

        20     A.             They were not friends, as such.  But I must 

        21                    specify that the said soldier liked to visit 

        22                    our business premises.  It is for that 

        23                    reason that we entered into contact with 

        24                    him, that we were able to know the soldier.  

        25                    That is both of us, that is, I, and the

         1                    deceased, were able to know the soldier 

         2                    because he visited our business premises 

         3                    frequently.

         4     Q.             When --

         5     MR. PRESIDENT:

         6                    Madam Mbida, please, let us get the English 

         7                    translation before you proceed.

         8     MS. MBIDA: 

         9                    Yes, Your Honour.

        10     BY MS. MBIDA:

        11     Q.             When the said soldier asked the deceased to 

        12                    go and buy beer for him, and when he took 

        13                    him away in his vehicle, did you ask any 

        14                    question to the soldier?

        15     MR. PRESIDENT:

        16                    Yes, Ms. Mobberley.  

        17     MS. MOBBERLEY:

        18                    Your Honour, this line of cross-examination 

        19                    which was raised by Mr. Rety, was -- when it 

        20                    was first raised outside the scope, it 

        21                    doesn't appear to contain any credibility 

        22                    issue.  

        23                    

        24                    And for it to be continued by a further 

        25                    Defence counsel, is, in my view, just taking

         1                    it beyond the point at which the irrelevance 

         2                    of the line should be tolerated.  The 

         3                    information that is being sought doesn't go 

         4                    to the core of the evidence led from this 

         5                    witness, which is, as to identification.  

         6                    This is not a witness of fact testifying for 

         7                    the reason for the person's death, nor to 

         8                    the circumstances of the person's death.  

         9                    And in my submission, it is beyond the 

        10                    scope, and it is irrelevant.

        11     MR. PRESIDENT:

        12                    Madam Mbida. 

        13     MS. MBIDA: 

        14                    Mr. President, I had not even prepared 

        15                    questions along this line.  I would agree 

        16                    with the Prosecutor, if, Mr. President, you 

        17                    order that this part of the evidence where 

        18                    the witness refers to the soldier should be 

        19                    deleted or taken away from the record.  

        20                    

        21                    I had not prepared questions on this, in 

        22                    relation to the examination-in-chief, but 

        23                    from the moment that the witness makes 

        24                    statements related to soldiers, I thought 

        25                    that it was necessary for me to have further

         1                    clarifications.  

         2                    

         3                    Otherwise, I'm not opposed to the 

         4                    Prosecutor's objection, but on the condition 

         5                    that this portion of the evidence be taken 

         6                    away from the transcript.

         7     MR. PRESIDENT:

         8                    Yes, we will allow the question. 

         9     MS. MBIDA:  

        10                    In fact, this line of questions concerning 

        11                    the soldiers, I don't know whether you will 

        12                    authorise me to pursue the line of 

        13                    questioning.

        14     MR. PRESIDENT:

        15                    Well, we'll see how far you take it.  We 

        16                    don't want to overdo it, but we will allow 

        17                    these questions as long it's not overdone.  

        18                    Very well, proceed. 

        19     MS. MBIDA: 

        20                    Thank you, Mr. President.

        21     BY MS. MBIDA:

        22     Q.             Witness, I was -- my question was when the 

        23                    soldier came to your house and asked the 

        24                    person concerned here, to go and buy beer 

        25                    for him, and then he took him in his

         1                    vehicle, I wanted to know whether, you, who 

         2                    were with that person, were able to ask the 

         3                    soldier some questions?

         4     A.             We did not ask any question, because we knew 

         5                    that they were used to sharing a drink 

         6                    together, so we thought that he was going to 

         7                    buy beer for him.

         8     Q.             At what point in time did your neighbour 

         9                    call Imanishimwe?

        10     A.             The neighbour phoned Imanishimwe immediately 

        11                    after the soldier left with the deceased.  

        12                    And this was less than five minutes after 

        13                    the departure of the soldier and the 

        14                    deceased.

        15     Q.             Witness, the neighbour in question, was he 

        16                    with you, in other words, were you together 

        17                    at the time that the soldier came to look 

        18                    for the deceased?

        19     A.             He was our neighbour.  Our houses were next 

        20                    to one another.  There was a problem between 

        21                    us and the neighbour, because time has 

        22                    changed.

        23     Q.             Do you mean to tell this Court that the 

        24                    neighbour who called Imanishimwe to inform 

        25                    him that the deceased had been taken away,

         1                    was not in good terms with you?

         2     A.             Yes, in fact, we did not get on well, 

         3                    because at that time --

         4     MR. PRESIDENT:

         5                    Just tell him to be careful.  Just tell him 

         6                    to be careful, that he might disclose 

         7                    identities of, not only himself, but of 

         8                    others.  So, he should be careful.  

         9                    

        10                    We have that; he said that the neighbour and 

        11                    himself were not in good terms.  So, we have 

        12                    that on the record.  But he needs to be 

        13                    careful beyond that point.  Actually, he 

        14                    said he was not in good terms at that time.  

        15                    I believe that is his -- that is how I 

        16                    understood it.

        17     MS. MBIDA:  

        18                    I do not know whether the interpreter has 

        19                    completed the interpretation of the witness' 

        20                    answer. 

        21     THE INTERPRETER:  

        22                    The witness said that we were not in good 

        23                    terms with the neighbour, because at that 

        24                    time, there was war.

         2                    therefore, told you that the neighbour in 

         3                    question, called Imanishimwe?

         4     A.             He came and asked me that he wanted to use 

         5                    the phone and I authorised him to do so.

         1     1600H

         2     Q.             Do you, therefore, mean to say that suddenly 

         3                    the misunderstanding between you 

         4                    disappeared? 

         5     A.             There was still misunderstanding; in fact, 

         6                    the neighbour and ourselves, we used to 

         7                    visit one another, but at that time, I did 

         8                    not have the authorization, I did not have 

         9                    the right to disallow him the use of the 

        10                    telephone.

        11     Q.             Why, Witness?

        12     A.             We used to allow him to use the phone, so it 

        13                    was not on that day that I was going to 

        14                    prevent him from using the phone.

        15     Q.             With respect to the exhumations, at what 

        16                    point in time did you identify the body of 

        17                    the deceased? 

        18     A.             Are you referring to the hour, Counsel? 

        19     Q.             I would like to talk about the moment.  Was 

        20                    it just after the exhumations?  Was it after 

        21                    the exhumations?  At what point in time, or 

        22                    rather, when did you identify the hour?  It 

        23                    doesn't matter much.

        24     MR. PRESIDENT:

         1                    month or what?  What is it specifically 

         2                    you're asking? 

         3     MS. MBIDA:

         4                    I mean the site or the place.

         5     BY MS. MBIDA:

         6     Q.             Was it at the exhumation site?  Was it after 

         7                    the bodies had been moved from the 

         8                    exhumation site? 

         9     A.             The pit in which the body was was about 20 

        10                    metres deep and when we reached 8 metres 

        11                    down the pit, we started noticing bodies.  

        12                    In the meantime, we had built a house in 

        13                    which we had to deposit the bodies.  I 

        14                    recognized the body of the deceased after 

        15                    the bodies had been deposited in the house 

        16                    referred to.

        17     Q.             Therefore, if I understand you correctly, 

        18                    you identified the body when it left the 

        19                    pit; is that right? 

        20     A.             There were many people taking part in the 

        21                    exhumation, that is people who were exhuming 

        22                    the bodies.  So when the body was exhumed, I 

        23                    was not able to identify it.  I identified 

        24                    it when it was already deposited in the 

        25                    house I've talked about earlier.

         1     Q.             For it to be clear to me, Witness, which 

         2                    house are you talking about?  Was it a house 

         3                    in which the body was put after it was 

         4                    transported in a vehicle, or it was the 

         5                    house in which the body was put as soon as 

         6                    it was taken out of the latrine? 

         7     A.             I am talking about the house which we built 

         8                    near the pit.

         9     Q.             Does that mean that you identified that body 

        10                    before the latrine -- before it was cleaned? 

        11     A.             Yes, I was able to identify the body from 

        12                    the clothes that he was wearing because the 

        13                    day the deceased was taken away, we had 

        14                    spent the night together; therefore, I knew 

        15                    the clothes that he was wearing.

        16     Q.             Thus, you identified him as you told us 

        17                    today on the basis of the blue singlet he 

        18                    was wearing and also on the basis of his 

        19                    fingers, his scars on the finger, the 

        20                    goatee, the beard.  You also identified him 

        21                    on the basis of the wound he sustained on 

        22                    the wrist.

        23     THE INTERPRETER:

        24                    The witness specifies that it was a red 

        25                    singlet.  It was a red singlet and not a

         1                    blue singlet.  It was rather the T-shirt 

         2                    that was blue in colour.  

         3     THE WITNESS:

         4                    Yes, I was able to identify the body on the 

         5                    basis of what you just enumerated, counsel.

         6     BY MS. MBIDA:

         7     Q.             Witness, can you tell us when the person we 

         8                    are talking about here sustained a wound at 

         9                    the wrist, were you with that person? 

        10     A.             In fact, I was not present when the deceased 

        11                    sustained injuries.  What enabled me to 

        12                    identify him -- to identify his body is the 

        13                    blue T-shirt, his underwear, his beard and 

        14                    his teeth.  As concerns the injuries, I 

        15                    noticed them when the body had been exhumed 

        16                    from the pit.

        17     Q.             Am I, therefore, right in saying that you 

        18                    could not identify him on the basis of 

        19                    injuries? 

        20     A.             You are right, counsel, because I was not 

        21                    present when he sustained the injuries. 

        22     Q.             Witness, can you tell us what was unusual 

        23                    about the deceased's beard? 

        24     A.             His beard was quite thick because for a long 

        25                    time he did not shave.

         1     Q.             Did you see all the bodies that were exhumed 

         2                    on that day? 

         3     A.             Yes, I saw them.

         4     Q.             Did some of those corpses also have a beard 

         5                    on them? 

         6     A.             I did not seek to check whether all the 

         7                    corpses had a beard.  I dealt only with the 

         8                    body that concerned me.

         9     Q.             Witness, I did not ask you whether all the 

        10                    bodies had a beard, but I asked you whether 

        11                    other bodies, that is apart from the body of 

        12                    the person concerning, whether some other 

        13                    bodies also had a beard? 

        14     A.             I do not know.

        15     Q.             You have just told us that the deceased had 

        16                    not shaved his beard for a long time, does 

        17                    this mean that he actually grew the beard 

        18                    when he was with you? 

        19     A.             Yes, he always had a beard when he was with 

        20                    us.

        21     Q.             On the day of the exhumation, did his beard 

        22                    -- was his beard the same length at the time 

        23                    when you saw him alive for the last time? 

        24     A.             I think that his beard was the same length 

        25                    because he was killed -- he was dead

         1                    immediately after he had been taken away.

         2     Q.             Witness, how do you know that he died only a 

         3                    short time after he had been taken away? 

         4     A.             Could you please repeat the question, 

         5                    Counsel? 

         6     Q.             You just told us here that the concerned 

         7                    person here died a short while after he had 

         8                    been taken away.  I am asking you, 

         9                    therefore, how do you know that that person 

        10                    died only a short while after he had been 

        11                    taken away? 

        12     A.             In order to make you understand this, I am 

        13                    going to give you an example.  Supposing 

        14                    that I am taken away today on Monday and 

        15                    that I die on Wednesday, the length of my 

        16                    beard will remain the same.

        17     Q.             Witness, could you please tell this Court on 

        18                    what date was the person concerned taken 

        19                    away? 

        20     A.             I think that when he was taken away by the 

        21                    soldier -- are you referring to the date on 

        22                    which he was taken by the soldier that we 

        23                    referred to? 

        24     Q.             Yes, that's exactly what I want to know, 

        25                    because we spoke about only one abduction or

         1                    taking away of that person.

         2     A.             The deceased was taken away on the 12th of 

         3                    April, 1994.

         4     Q.             So if I look at it practically, according to 

         5                    how you presented it to us, does this mean 

         6                    that that person would have died on the 14th 

         7                    of April, 1994? 

         8     A.             No, he did not die on the 14th of April.  I 

         9                    spoke of the date of the 12th because it was 

        10                    on the 12th that I saw him alive for the 

        11                    last time and it was on that day that he was 

        12                    taken away by the soldier in question.

        13     MS. MOBBERLEY:

        14                    Your Honours, I believe there is an issue 

        15                    with the translation.  I understand the 

        16                    Kinyarwandan to be that he saw him at home 

        17                    on the 12th of April for the last time.

        18     MR. PRESIDENT:

        19                    Can the translator help us as to what he 

        20                    said?

        21     THE INTERPRETER:

        22                    The witness said that he saw the deceased 

        23                    alive for the last time on the 12th of 

        24                    April, 1994, when the soldier came to take 

        25                    him away.

         1     MR. PRESIDENT:

         2                    Yes, very well.  Thank you. 

         3                    

         4                    Just so we can probably put an end to this, 

         5                    ask him:  Did he see when the deceased died? 

         6     THE WITNESS:

         7                    No, I did not see him when he was killed.  I 

         8                    saw him when he was taken away.

         9     MR. PRESIDENT:

        10                    Okay, very well.  Thank you.

        12                    Yes, Madam Mbida, maybe we can move on.

        13     BY MS. MBIDA:

        14     Q.             Witness, you told us that you recognized the 

        15                    body, among other things, from the 

        16                    moustache.  Can you tell us what was 

        17                    peculiar about his moustache? 

        18     A.             He had sideburns and his moustache was not 

        19                    very thick.

        20     Q.             He had a thick beard, but he did not have a 

        21                    very thick moustache; is that correct? 

        22     A.             The sideburns were also not thick.

        23     Q.             Witness, I am not talking yet about the 

        24                    sideburns.  I am still talking about the 

        25                    moustache and the beard.  The beard was

         1                    thick, but the moustache was not very thick, 

         2                    is that what you're telling us? 

         3     A.             The moustache was not thick, nor were the 

         4                    sideburns.  His sideburns had a circular 

         5                    form, roundish.

         6     Q.             Witness, since you want to talk to us about 

         7                    sideburns, what do you mean exactly when you 

         8                    talk to us about sideburns? 

         9     A.             I know that he had sideburns which were not 

        10                    thick and which were roundish in form.

        11     MS. MBIDA:

        12                    Mr. President, I am going to ask for the 

        13                    assistance of the Chamber.  I would like the 

        14                    witness to indicate to us on the face of a 

        15                    man where are the sideburns situated because 

        16                    I have a problem here differentiating 

        17                    between the moustache and the sideburns.  

        18                    That's why I want him to actually clarify:  

        19                    What does he mean when he talks about 

        20                    sideburns? 

        21     MR. PRESIDENT:

        22                    You don't know when a man has sideburns?  

        23                    You don't know what that is?  We're getting 

        24                    so tedious here with these 

        25                    cross-examinations.  Point out on your face

         1                    where the sideburns would be.  Tell him to 

         2                    come forward and just point out on his face 

         3                    where the sideburns would be.  Put your hand 

         4                    on your face where the sideburns were.  Show 

         5                    us.  Yes.

         6     THE WITNESS:

         7                    This is the part I am referring to.

         8     MR. PRESIDENT:

         9                    The witness has pointed out.

        10                    

        11                    Maybe we can move on.  We're getting bogged 

        12                    down here with all sorts of little 

        13                    technicalities.  Where the sideburn is?  

        14                    What is a sideburn?  All these sorts of 

        15                    stuff.  Let us have some regard here for 

        16                    judicial time.

        17     MS. MBIDA:

        18                    Mr. President, I am going to pray that you 

        19                    be more patient.  Because when I asked about 

        20                    the sideburn, this is what I thought about, 

        21                    but the same witness awhile ago said the 

        22                    beard was thick.  So in this case, where was 

        23                    the beard?

        24     MR. PRESIDENT:

        25                    You don't know where a beard is on a man's

         1                    face, Madam Mbida?  He said the sideburns 

         2                    was thin, the moustache was thin, but the 

         3                    beard was thick.  You're asking me to have 

         4                    patience, I have had a great deal of 

         5                    patience with this line of 

         6                    cross-examination.  Everybody should know 

         7                    where a beard is on a man's face. 

         8     MS. MBIDA:

         9                    Mr. President, this is because I thought 

        10                    that when -- it takes time for the beard to 

        11                    grow.  I am not a man, but this is what I 

        12                    know about beards.  When a face has a thick 

        13                    beard, can it really have sideburns as well?  

        14                    If this is feasible, then I'll continue. 

        15     MR. PRESIDENT:

        16                    These are common sense issues, really.  

        17                    These are common sense issues. 

        18     BY MS. MBIDA:

        19     Q.             Witness, you said that you recognized the 

        20                    deceased from the wound that he had, or at 

        21                    least the scar he had on his chest, can you 

        22                    tell us for how long the deceased had had 

        23                    that scar on his chest? 

        24     A.             I did not dwell on the scar and I will not 

        25                    insist upon it.  However, I have to point

         1                    out that it was not the scar that allowed me 

         2                    to identify the deceased, so I do not think 

         3                    that it is necessary for me to ask myself 

         4                    questions on this aspect. 

         5     Q.             Witness, if I am asking you the question of 

         6                    that aspect is because you mentioned a 

         7                    number of things which allowed you to 

         8                    recognize the deceased, and in among those 

         9                    things there was the scar, so I am asking 

        10                    you for how long did the deceased have the 

        11                    scar on his chest? 

        12     A.             With regard to the scar in question, I'll 

        13                    have to repeat what I said.  I do not have 

        14                    much to say about it because I do not know 

        15                    when he had this scar on his body.  

        16                    Furthermore, it was not the scar that 

        17                    allowed me to identify the body in question 

        18                    because the elements that allowed me to 

        19                    identify the body are as follows, as I have 

        20                    said:  the T-shirt, the underpants, the 

        21                    beard, the  teeth and his toes.  The scar 

        22                    and other signs were observed when the body 

        23                    was exhumed from the pit, but it was not the 

        24                    scar that allowed me to identify the body 

        25                    and I have nothing to add with respect to

         1                    the scar.

         2     Q.             You told us that the body no longer had a 

         3                    heart, who told you about that? 

         4     A.             With regard to the heart in relation to the 

         5                    body, I cannot assert with certainty that 

         6                    the heart was not there.  But, at the 

         7                    exhumation, I saw that on the torso where 

         8                    the heart normally is, there was a wound, an 

         9                    opening, and I started wondering whether, 

        10                    actually, the heart was in the body, but I 

        11                    did not personally check to see whether the 

        12                    heart was in its place.  But I noticed that 

        13                    the other bodies had the same wound on the 

        14                    same place. 

        15     Q.             So you're saying that all the bodies had 

        16                    such a wound on that spot, what spot are you 

        17                    talking about? 

        18     A.             On all of these bodies there were wounds on 

        19                    the torso where normally the heart is. 

        20     Q.             Witness, you told us that you recognized the 

        21                    deceased immediately after the exhumation; 

        22                    mainly, if I understand you well, from the 

        23                    clothes that he was wearing, that is the 

        24                    T-shirt and the underpants, I believe.  Were 

        25                    you able, after the exhumation, were you

         2                    clothes? 

         3     MS. MOBBERLEY:

         4                    Your Honours, that is a misrepresentation of 

         5                    the evidence.

         6     MR. PRESIDENT:

         7                    Yes, I was just about to bring it to the 

         8                    attention of Madam Mbida.  He speaks of the 

         9                    clothes, he speaks of the opening between 

        10                    the teeth and he speaks of a certain thing 

        11                    with regard to the little toe, so it's not 

        12                    fair to put it in a manner that you put it.

        13     MS. MBIDA:

        14                    Yes, Mr. President, I am going to rephrase 

        15                    the question.  It's because I had already 

        16                    given the list of things which allowed the 

        17                    witness to identify the deceased.  Among 

        18                    other things, there was the singlet and what 

        19                    you call, rather, the T-shirt. 

        20     THE PRESIDENT:

        21                    The issue is when you said "mainly," mainly 

        22                    from the shorts and the T-shirt.  That is 

        23                    the point I am addressing.  It's not a 

        24                    question of mainly.  Those two questions 

        25                    issues is not a question of mainly because

         1                    there is the opening of the teeth and there 

         2                    is the condition the little toe was in. 

         3                    

         4                    But while I am on this, Madam Mbida, I want 

         5                    to sort of remind you of Rule 90:    

         6                    Testimony of Witnesses. 

         7                    "Rule 90(f) The Trial Chamber shall exercise 

         8                    control over the mode and order of 

         9                    interrogating witnesses in presenting 

        10                    evidence so as to (i) make the interrogation 

        11                    and presentation effective for the 

        12                    ascertainment of the truth and (ii) avoid 

        13                    needless consumption of time." 

        14                    So I would ask you to bear this in mind.  So 

        15                    far a lot of these issues have been very 

        16                    tedious and it is difficult to see whether 

        17                    there is any regard here for needless 

        18                    consumption of time.

        19     MS. MBIDA:

        20                    Mr. President, you also understand that for 

        21                    the Defence, it's disturbing -- I mean it's 

        22                    uncomfortable to want the Tribunal to lose 

        23                    this time.  I have been here for about 35 

        24                    minutes.  I want to use the points that the 

        25                    witness himself presented here in order for

         1                    the ascertainment of the truth.  Now, would 

         2                    the Chamber consider that in 35 minutes I 

         3                    abused judicial time?  If this is the case, 

         4                    then I would stop.

         5     MR. PRESIDENT:

         6                    Unfortunately, I did not take down the time 

         7                    when you started.  I am just dealing with 

         8                    some of the questions you've been asking. 

         9     MS. MBIDA:

        10                    Mr. President, I was looking at the time, 

        11                    because normally you would take note, and I 

        12                    always look at the time when I take the 

        13                    floor.  It was 4.00 p.m. when I took the 

        14                    floor.

        15     MR. PRESIDENT:

        16                    It was an oversight this time not to record 

        17                    the time, but this time I didn't.  Anyway, 

        18                    proceed.  Just bear in mind what I have said 

        19                    and let us move on with the process. 

        20     BY MS. MBIDA:

        21     Q.             Witness, I wanted to know when the body was 

        22                    removed from the pit and when you managed to 

        23                    identify it.  Were the clothes on the body 

        24                    of the colour that you described here? 

        25     A.             Yes, I instantly identified the colour of

         1                    the clothes in question.

         2     MR. PRESIDENT:

         3                    I don't want to interrupt you, Madam Mbida, 

         4                    but I have been informed that you started at 

         5                    1545, which would have been quarter to four.

         6     MS. MBIDA:

         7                    I saw 4.00 p.m., Mr. President, so how many 

         8                    minutes do I still have, so that I can 

         9                    accordingly adjust my questionnaire?

        10     MR. PRESIDENT:

        11                    I am not giving you any specific minutes, I 

        12                    am just asking you to bear judicial time in 

        13                    mind and get on with the meat of your 

        14                    cross-examination. 

        15     BY MS. MBIDA:

        16     Q.             Witness, I am a bit disoriented here because 

        17                    I lost track of my questionnaire because I 

        18                    had not really edited it. 

        19                    Witness, you told us that -- one second, 

        20                    please.  Witness, you specified some points 

        21                    here, unfortunately, I cannot find the 

        22                    question.  When the Prosecutor asked you to 

        23                    identify sample H1, she asked you:  What was 

        24                    it?  And you said that the sample was taken 

        25                    from the T-shirt.  You also added something

         1                    else and you said that the taking of sample 

         2                    was done in your absence and that you did 

         3                    not even know that photographs had been 

         4                    taken.  Can you tell us:  Why did you add 

         5                    all these points; whereas, those things were 

         6                    not asked of you? 

         7     A.             Yes, it's true that I gave specific issues 

         8                    which had not been asked for, but I wanted 

         9                    to say everything that I knew and to show 

        10                    that it was not in my interest to lie on any 

        11                    subject whatsoever with regard to any 

        12                    specific person.

        13     Q.             Witness, in the identification of those 

        14                    samples, you said in your statement to the 

        15                    investigators --

        16                    

        17                    President, Your Honours, I would like to 

        18                    refer to the last page of the statement made 

        19                    to the investigators and the last but one 

        20                    paragraph, which says:  "Today Mr. Ralph 

        21                    Lake has shown me two pieces of material in 

        22                    plastic bags marked H1 and H2.  I have 

        23                    examined those pieces of material and can 

        24                    say that the material marked H1 is similar 

        25                    to his T-shirt he was wearing and that the

         1                    material marked H2 is also similar to the 

         2                    material from which his underpants were 

         3                    made."

         6                    the witness?

         7     A.             Yes.

         8     Q.             And here today you told us, in response to a 

         9                    question by the Prosecutor when you were 

        10                    shown the samples and you said that on the 

        11                    11th the people came to take the samples.  I 

        12                    was not there.  They came back on the 12th.  

        13                    I spoke with them.  They showed me samples, 

        14                    among from which I chose samples which 

        15                    resemble those which were taken from the 

        16                    clothes on the body.  My question is:  How 

        17                    many samples were shown to you, Witness? 

        18     A.             With regard to the number of the samples 

        19                    that were shown to me, there were many.  The 

        20                    samples had been taken from the clothes on 

        21                    the bodies of the 17 persons, but I am not 

        22                    saying they were 17 in number.  There could 

        23                    have been 20 or more because they had taken 

        24                    samples either from shirts, trousers or 

        25                    other types of clothes, which were still on

         2                    among all those samples, I selected the 

         3                    sample of the clothes, which I recognize as 

         4                    having been taken from the body that I had 

         5                    recognized.

         6     MR. PRESIDENT:

         7                    Madam Mbida, how much longer do you think 

         8                    you're likely to be with him? 

         9     MS. MBIDA:

        10                    I still have one and a half questions, 

        11                    Mr. President.

        12     THE PRESIDENT:

        13                    All right, proceed with your one and a half 

        14                    questions. 

        15     BY MS. MBIDA:

        16     Q.             Witness, does it mean that what you stated 

        17                    to the investigators inside is not correct? 

        18     A.             It is correct.

        19     Q.             In response to the question by the 

        20                    Prosecutor with regard to the identification 

        21                    of the samples, after the answer that I gave 

        22                    earlier, you said that if during the 

        23                    examination, if I had not said everything 

        24                    that I might have been lying.  Why did you 

        25                    raise the issue of lying, whereas nobody had

         1                    asked you about lying? 

         2     A.             You'll excuse me.  Normally when one asks 

         3                    you a question, you answer it in a manner as 

         4                    exhaustive as possible without hesitating in 

         5                    as far as giving the meaning and the scope 

         6                    of your words.  If I had added things which 

         7                    were not necessary, then I'm sorry, but I 

         8                    don't think that I said anything wrong.

         9     MS. MBIDA:

        10                    Mr. President, I told you that I still had 

        11                    one and a half questions, I have no further 

        12                    questions for this witness.

        13     MR. PRESIDENT:

        14                    Thank you, Madam Mbida. 

        15                    

        16                    Mr. Boutin, normally we would be near the 

        17                    point of stopping, but since tomorrow is not 

        18                    a day when we are sitting, it might be 

        19                    advisable if we can dispose of this witness 

        20                    this afternoon. 

        21     MR. BOUTIN:

        22                    Yes, Mr. President, I can inform the Court 

        23                    that during the cross-examination -- and my 

        24                    colleagues -- I'll be very short and I would 

        25                    ask you to go in closed session right now,

         2     MR. PRESIDENT:

         3                    Yes, very well.  We'll go in closed session.

         4     MR. BOUTIN:

         5                    In all likelihood, Mr. President, I'll be 

         6                    done by five.

         8                    Yes, very well.
