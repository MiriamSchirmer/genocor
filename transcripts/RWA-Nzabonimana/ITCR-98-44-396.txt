MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR.  HOMETOWU:
Thank you.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 26th of January 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Édouard Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-00-98-44-T. 

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

The appearances are the same.

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  Our witness that's in front of you today is David Biramahire.  He's going to testify without any protective measures, and we're departing slightly from our Ruhengeri evidence to hear his testimony today.  His testimony will concern allegations made by Witness BDX concerning Mr. Nzirorera's travel from Kigali on the 12th of April.

After that, Mr. President, we propose to play the tape of Witness GAP and recall Witness GAP for that purpose.  However, the audio booth has advised us that they will need till 2 o'clock to prepare to play that audiotape.  I think this witness will take most of the morning, but it's possible we have some time in which we are not ready to bring Witness GAP before the Chamber.  And that's what we had in mind for our programme today.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was this witness's number on your list?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I have to check.  It's in the 40s.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin to give your evidence, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by David Biramahire in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  This is Witness 46.  Mr. Nimy will be conducting his examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you'll respond, first of all, to Mr. Nimy, Counsel for Mr. Joseph Nzirorera.
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
DAVID BIRAMAHIRE,
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, before you you will find a form, a form containing your particulars.
A.	You are right.  I have the form in question before me. 
Q.	Now -- so you were born in 1957?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you are male in gender.  You are a man.
A.	You are very right, and by my name, that is obvious.  I am David Biramahire. 
Q.	You are Rwandan by nationality? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You are Hutu? 
A.	Exactly. 
Q.	Your occupation is an evangelist; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  I am an evangelist. 
Q.	And in 1994 you were a businessman; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	You were born in Gashangiro in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In 1994 you were residing in Gatare? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Nyamirambo, Nyarugenge, Kigali?
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And presently you reside in Arusha? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	The name of your father is Nyilimanzi, Nathanael; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, yes.  
Q.	And the name of your mother is Nyirabaziyaka, Martha.  Am I right?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, may I ask you to add the date on that form and append your signature.  Can you do that.  And the date of today is 26 January 2010.  Is that done? 
A.	Yes.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, may I ask you to permit me to tender as an exhibit that form, number 719.  I accept Mr. Issa knows what I'm saying.  Am I right?  
MR. MJUI:
That document will be D. NZ719.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ719 admitted) 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, can you tell the Trial Chamber -- yes.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber exactly what you underwent in terms of education.  
A.	After secondary school started, I studied agricultural and animal breeding in Kibuye, Nyamishaba.  I did secondary school in Ralima, and I did agriculture and animal breeding in Nyamishaba.  And I ended these studies in 1999, and I was a civil servant for two years.  And in 1981 -- it was rather 1979 before.  In 1991 then I came over to study, and I was here until 1994.  I did forestry after which I returned to Rwanda.  That was my academic track record. 
Q.	And after your studies, can you tell us about your professional life.
A.	I was a civil servant at the ministry of forestry within the statistics department and for two months after which I went to Gikongoro where I worked for three months in the forests there within the 
	Muko commune in theCrête Zaire-Nil project.  I went also to work for the Swiss in the Gisovu commune and Gishyita communes and also in the Rwamatamu commune, but I lived at Gishyita. 
Q.	From 1990 to 1994, Mr. Biramahire, can you specify exactly where you resided.
A.	Until 1988 I was working.  That was when I stopped serving the state as a civil servant.  And so from 1988 I started doing business, and I went to live in Kigali, precisely in Nyamirambo, and I was there until 1994.  
MR. NIMY:
I'm sorry.  There's a problem with translation.  It was rather 1988 to 1994.  I'm sorry.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, you are very right.  There was a mistake in the translation.  Thank you very much.

Is it possible, Mr. President, to take over the question?
THE WITNESS:
If I made a mistake, I would have corrected it.  
MR. NIMY: 
I will take over the question.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, from 1990 to 1994, where were you residing?
A.	I was living in Nyamirambo. 
Q.	And what was your occupation? 
A.	I was a trader. 
Q.	And what was your stock in trade, Mr. Biramahire? 
A.	I sold bicycles, sewing machines.  I sold household utensils, flasks, plates, and other articles of the kind.  I would import them from abroad and sell them in my country. 
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, can you tell us whether your trade, your business -- was it prosperous? 
A.	Yes.  My business was very prosperous. 
Q.	And can you tell us whether you had any interest in the political activities ongoing in Rwanda.
A.	No, no.  I know history very well.  I would not tamper with politics.  And by the way, the Bible is full of political stories.  That is enough for me.  I would not go and involve myself in other political issues.  The Bible is enough for me on that. 
Q.	And even as a matter of principle, did you not join any political party? 
A.	At all. 
Q.	Good.  Mr. Biramahire, when did you learn about the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I learnt of the death of President Habyarimana over Radio Rwanda during the newscast on the morning of 7th April 1994. 
Q.	And what did you do after hearing that news? 
A.	It was very sad news.  It involved the death of two heads of states.  We were in a state of shock.  Now, what did you expect us to do?  When you lose an important person, you are affected, and that is only very normal. 
Q.	Well, as a matter of fact, I was about to ask you whether you learnt of the news and you were sad or whether you tried to enquire to know a bit more exactly how it happened.  Can you be more precise exactly.  For example, after you got the news, did you stay in your home? 
A.	Yes.  I stayed indoors.  I was not a politician.  We were waiting for the officials, the authorities, to inform us and give us further information.  And so we remained glued to our radios waiting for the authorities to give us further information.  It is also true that some authorities had died in Rwanda, but losing a head of state -- that was very, very unusual.  That was very, very difficult news to accept. 
Q.	Good.  Now, having heard that, did you spend the rest of the day indoors?  I'm referring to the 7th of April 1994.  Did you remain indoors all day?
A.	Shortly after getting the news, soldiers arrived dressed in military gear.  They came, broke down doors, broke into houses looking for money.  They threw a grenade in my house.  I opened the door, and they asked me for money.  I gave them some money, and they left.  

And then I called a friend, Colonel Setako, and reported to him that I had been attacked and that I had no more money.  In fact, I was seeking help from him.  But he replied that there was nothing he could do; that he could not come to my rescue.  And so all that we could do was resort to praying.  And after that my uncle came along and took me away from there.  It was under those circumstances that I left my residence. 
Q.	What time was it?
A.	It was around 8:30.  I left my home around 8:30. 
Q.	And you said that you phoned a friend, and you referred to Setako.  Why did you call Setako? 
A.	I knew Setako.  He was a family friend.  He was a soldier of importance, a colonel indeed.  He worked at the ********, and we knew each other well.  He's from my area.  That is why I phoned him.  There was no head of state any longer.  So we could only seek to get in touch with personalities whom we knew.  That is why I called him. 
Q.	And after your attackers left, you say that you went out.  Where did you go to? 
A.	I went into town.  I wanted to go to our shop.  As a matter of fact, our shop was split into three parts.  And in the part behind, you had a store where we stored equipment.  So we went to my shop alongside those soldiers indeed. 
Q.	And did you stay in your shop for the rest of the day? 
A.	When I arrived, I realised that the shop had been completely looted.  As a matter of fact, when I saw in what state the city was, I decided to flee, my family and I.  My wife is Tanzanian.  So I decided to take my wife and my children and go to the embassy of the United Republic of Tanzania. 
Q.	At the embassy of the Republic of Tanzania, were you welcomed by the embassy? 
A.	Yes.  The secretary welcomed the children and my wife but refused to welcome me as I'm Rwandan.  I left my family there and left. 
Q.	Where did you go to? 
A.	At that time I wasn't too far from Setako's as the embassy is not far away from Setako's house.  So I went to his house to explain my situation to him. 
Q.	Did you meet him home? 
A.	No, I didn't. 
Q.	Who did you meet in his house? 
A.	I met his family, that is to say, his children, as well as Nzirorera's family. 
Q.	So you met Nzirorera's family there.
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	But did you know Nzirorera prior to seeing him at Mr. Setako's?
A.	I knew Nzirorera.  We had never sat together and chatted, but I used to see him in meetings and during ceremonies.  For example, I can see the President of the Chamber in front of me, but I can't say I know him that closely.  And since Nzirorera is from Ruhengeri as myself, it is in that regard that I am stating that I know him.  I could see him on TV.  He'd come on.  Those are the circumstances under which I know him. 
Q.	And was Nzirorera himself in Setako's house? 
A.	Yes.  I believe he was. 
Q.	So when you arrived Setako's house and you meet Joseph Nzirorera and his family for the first time, what time was that?  
A.	It was around 12:30.  Yes.  12:30. 
Q.	Now, tell me, with respect to Joseph Nzirorera, could you tell the Chamber if in your life you had received any form of service or advantage from him, Mr. Biramahire.
A.	Come on, Counsel.  I told you that I used to see him, for example, during ceremonies on a podium.  I mean he was a high-ranking official, and I didn't need him in my business.  He did his work, and I conducted my business.  He was at the service of the country.  Maybe the only advantage he had was that, thanks to him, we had road.  We had water supply.  But he was at the service of the entire country.  That was it. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Bimenyimana.  Up to when did you remain at Mr. Setako's house? 
A.	I stayed there up till the 12th of April.
Q.	And then? 
A.	Subsequently, we went to Mr. Nzirorera's house in Mukingo. 
Q.	Did you go to Nzirorera's house in Mukingo along with Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  We went together. 
Q.	Did you leave Setako's house together? 
A.	Yes.  We took off from Setako's house together as we both lived in Setako's house. 
Q.	Why did you leave Setako's house?  I mean, you were comfortable there.  Why did you have to leave it to go? 
A.	We left Setako's residence as Setako had been sent on mission to Zaire. 
Q.	Is that what was said to you by Setako himself? 
A.	No.  It wasn't Setako who told us.  Rather, it was Minister Nzirorera who told me so.  
Q.	Very well.  And at the time you left Setako's house, what time was that? 
A.	It must have been around 12:30. 
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, tell me, especially for the Chamber, how were you organised when you were leaving?  What was the convoy like?  How many were you?  Who were you with? 
A.	When we started off from Mr. Setako's house, we were in a convoy of four vehicles, a military vehicle in which a lieutenant and a captain were found as well as other soldiers.  There was another jeep, a Mercedes jeep, which was driven by Nzirorera.  And in that Mercedes-Benz jeep, you had 
	Nzirorera's wife, his children, and his bodyguards.  

Behind that there was another Mercedes-Benz car driven by one ***********.  In that vehicle you had the director of the local VIA, his wife, and one or several of his children.  Lastly you had the vehicle of -- a Dyna vehicle.  3-tonne Dyna was belonging to Setako's wife which I was driving and on which you had my younger brother and the domestic staff.  

So that's it.  We were in a convoy of four vehicles.  So in front you have the military jeep which opened the way for us and allowed us to go across roadblocks.  And when we crossed the roadblocks at the 
Kigali bridge, the military jeep returned while we continued towards Mukingo. 
Q.	Yes, indeed, Mr. Biramahire.  On your trip towards Mukingo, you came across roadblocks you said; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That's correct. 
Q.	And what happened at those roadblocks?  Could you please enlighten the Chamber.
A.	The roadblocks which we crossed were manned by civilians except for the one at the bridge.  I am referring here to the bridge separating Kigali from Gitarama.  It's on that bridge that you had soldiers.  The other roadblocks were manned by civilians.  

For example, there was a roadblock at the banque nationele which I failed to refer to you.  It was indeed.  That one also was a military -- was manned by soldiers.  When we reached civilian-manned roadblocks, the soldiers would talk with the people who were manning the roadblocks, and they would let us through us up until when we crossed the roadblock at the bridge.  Then the military vehicle went back, and we carried on our journey.  As there were always soldiers with us, they discussed with the civilians who were manning the roadblocks, and they would let us through without any problem. 
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, in the convoy, if I understand you well, you were in fourth position; is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Were you in a position to see the vehicle in which Nzirorera was found? 
A.	Yes.  I saw Nzirorera's vehicle, and it was a jeep.  I was in a vehicle which was higher.  So I could see Nzirorera's car ahead because I was only two cars away from the vehicle in which Nzirorera was.  
Q.	Very well.  Did you notice at any of those roadblocks if there was a movement, gesture, or action made by Nzirorera towards the people who were manning those roadblocks? 
A.	Indeed.  It was not difficult -- it wasn't easy to recognise Nzirorera because he was wearing military uniforms, and in the vehicle there were other soldiers.  And it wasn't easy to recognise him, and he was like camouflaged.  He was driving the vehicle as if he was a driver.  So he couldn't leave that vehicle.  It was as if he was driving a high personality and he couldn't leave that vehicle. 
Q.	Let me ask the question again.

Did you see any form of gesture, either take his head out of the vehicle to say anything to the people who were outside at that roadblock?
A.	No.  I didn't see him do anything whatsoever. 
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, let me come back to the position of your various vehicles as you described it to the Court.  You had escort number one; you had Nzirorera's vehicle, number two; you had the vehicle drove by Kazungu, number three; and you had your vehicle, number four; is that correct? 
A.	That is, indeed, what I meant. 
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, was there another vehicle found between yours and the one -- the security vehicle which was leading the convoy? 
A.	No.  Our convoy left Setako's house and were close to each other.  We could not let any other vehicle enter our convoy.  Indeed I had been given security instructions that only vehicles in our convoys were to go through the roadblocks. 
Q.	Do you know one David Hakizamungu. 
A.	The David Hakizamungu that I know -- 
Q.	David Hakizimana.  Sorry, Witness.  Hakizimana.  David Hakizimana.
A.	I know one David Hakizimana who is the son of a trader whose parents are traders in Gisenyi.  His father is known as Batera if my recollection serves me well.  That is the person I know who bears that sort of name. 
Q.	That means you know him very well.
A.	Not very well.  
MR. N'DOW: 
I'm sorry, Mr. Nimy.  Could we get the name on the record properly.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Biramahire.  Could you state his father's name correctly.
A.	His name was Batera.  He was a well-known trader in Gisenyi, and I worked with him.  As a matter of fact, he also worked with my father. 
Q.	Are you talking about Batera? 
A.	Yes.  Batera.
Q.	B-A-T-E-R-A; is that correct?
A.	Yes, indeed.  Well, you know, it's been a while, and I've seen things which I won't forget.  Come on.  You just have to correct me if I am mistaken. 
Q.	Of course I would.  You might have noticed I also jumbled up the name.  So the name is Batera.

Now, was that gentleman in your convoy?  
MR. N'DOW: 
I think it's worthy of note, and Mr. Nimy should actually be advised not to tell the answers to the witness.  He's giving him a name, and he's now suggesting another name, and I don't think that's ethical. 
MR. NIMY:	
	Let me rephrase the question to Mr. Biramahire.
BY MR. NIMY:
Q	Did you see that gentleman on the day you were leaving?
A.	I told you that in our convoy there were four vehicles, and I told you who was found in what vehicle.  And I didn't see anyone else joining the convoy. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Did you see him when you were already on the road either behind you or in front of you?
A.	I didn't see him.  There were many people.  
Q.	And when did you arrive Mukingo?
A.	We arrived Mukingo in the evening. 
Q.	In the evening? 
A.	Yes.  At dusk. 
Q.	And where did you go to? 
A.	We went to Minister Nzirorera's house in Mukingo or at his parents' house. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Biramahire, why did you always go to Mr. Nzirorera's house? 
A.	I went to Nzirorera's house because that is where I felt secure.  I had left my property behind in Kigali, and the most important thing for me at that time was security. 
Q.	And for how long did you stay in Mukingo?
A.	We stayed in Mukingo for about three weeks.  When we left Mukingo, we left Mukingo in early May.
Q.	And where was Nzirorera in the meantime? 
A.	Nzirorera was from time to time at his home, or he would go to Gitarama or to Gisenyi.  That is where he was going from what I heard. 
Q.	And during your stay in Mukingo at Nzirorera's house, did you get to hold discussions with Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  We used to chat after having eaten. 
Q.	And what did you talk about? 
A.	You know, a man who has almost lost his father -- you can imagine what state they were.  It is as if he had lost his father.  He would talk about things regarding development projects which had been launched by the president.  So I was also saddened like he was, and we would talk about all the projects which were still being planned which we had to do and which we could no longer do, that sort of thing. 
Q.	Witness, I would like to ask you a question that arises from these other ones.  You left Kigali at midday, and you arrived Mukingo in the evening meaning that you were always on the road; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That's correct. 
Q.	You're a businessman, a very prosperous trader, and you are usually on the road.  Was it possible that on the way between Kigali and Mukingo Nzirorera could be reached by phone? 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I'm not sure whether that is a proper question to ask the witness.  It is calling for him to speculate.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, let me rephrase this question for you.  Did you see or notice in Nzirorera's house any special form of communication equipment when you were leaving Setako's house and when he was boarding his vehicle? 
A.	That type of telephone did not exist in Rwanda at the time.  We had land lines, and we only saw 
	cell phones when we arrived Zaire.  That said, when we left his house, we were cut off from any form of communication, and Mr. Nzirorera did not have any form of equipment that allowed him to communicate with any other person. 
Q.	Now, let us return to Mukingo.  You stayed in Mukingo till early May.  Is that what you said? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who said, "Hmm"?  Was that you?  Does that mean yes?
A.	I did not answer your question.  Let me say I stayed in Mukingo.  
Q.	Where did you go after Mukingo? 
A.	We went to Gisenyi. 
Q.	To whose house? 
A.	To Nzirorera's house. 
Q.	When was that? 
A.	Around the 1st of May.
Q.	And where did Nzirorera live in Gisenyi? 
A.	He lived on the road leading to Zaire, not far from Lake Kivu on the main road leading to Zaire.  As a matter of fact, it is a road that links Gisenyi to Zaire. 
Q.	Before going to Gisenyi more specifically, was Nzirorera with you? 
A.	Yes.  We were together. 
Q.	And he did not leave for Gisenyi to make arrangements for your transfer, to move you over.  If you remember that, tell us.  If you do not remember, let us know.
A.	I told you that he was going to Gisenyi, and eventually, he went there to prepare for the arrival of his family two days before, and I already said that we were going to leave for Gisenyi.  And even before then, I knew he usually went to Gisenyi.  No.  But listen -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness did not complete his answer.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Yes.  Why?  You wanted to complete your answer.  Go ahead.
A.	I said we did not just go to Gisenyi like that.  There were tenants in that house.  We had to inform them ahead of time so that they could evacuate the place and create room for us.  Well, that's what I learnt.  He also had to go and hand over power.  He had to do a handing-over.  It was -- I could imagine that that was what he had to do. 
Q.	Well and good.  So you remained in Gisenyi until when, Mr. Biramahire? 
A.	I stayed on in Gisenyi until the end of the month of May, and to be more precise, until the 30th of May.  When I left Gisenyi, I went via Goma.  I boarded a flight to come over here to Tanzania. 
Q.	And since then you're living in Tanzania up to date; right? 
A.	You are right.  Since the 30th of May 1994, I live in Tanzania, and it's now 16 years. 
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, do you have any judicial pasts, any judicial affairs in Rwanda?   
A.	I have never had any problems with anybody.  So far as I am concerned, the only people who know peace are people who have discovered the good Lord.  So I take my time.  I do it all not to have problems with anybody.  I'm a peace-loving person. 
Q.	And presently, are you not involved -- I may be wrong.  Whether rightly or wrongly, are you not wanted by the Rwandan government for crimes committed in Rwanda in 1994?
A.	Except if somebody has today invented any crimes.  
MR. N'DOW: 
He asked the witness, "Are you not wanted in Rwanda?"  And I think that's very leading.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will rephrase my question.

Are you not involved in any legal matters in Rwanda today?  
A.	No.  I have no problem with whosoever in any court in Rwanda.  I am someone -- I'm as white as snow.  Okay?  If I teach people not to steal, I wouldn't do that.  I am a person who is problem free. 
Q.	Mr. Biramahire, I thank you for your testimony.  
MR. NIMY: 
And Mr. President, I am done so far as this witness is concerned.  On that note, I thank you.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.
Do any of the other Defence teams wish to question this witness?  No.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the examination-in-chief lasted 50 minutes, 5-0.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Witness, you are now going to have to answer questions from the Prosecutor who will now begin his examination of you.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I missed the time, the duration of the direct examination.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Fifty minutes, Your Honours.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Mr. Issa, can you just distribute these papers for me, please.

Your Honours, I will make the usual application.  I may go a bit beyond the time spent by Mr. Nimy in his direct examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I make the usual response.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning.
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	My name is Saidou N'Dow.  I'm a trial attorney in the Office of the Prosecutor, and I will be cross-examining you.

Mr. Witness, as you know, we are under time constraints.  And, therefore, I would implore you to respond as briefly as possible to my questions.  Do we understand each other?  Mr. Witness, it is not your first time in this Tribunal, is it?  
A.	Yes.  It's not the first time. 
Q.	You testified in this Tribunal in the case of Setako on the 18th of June 2009.
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And, Witness, I presume that everything you stated in that testimony is true to the best of your knowledge.
A.	Yes, but -- of course, I took an oath to speak the truth, and consequently, I told nothing but the truth. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've testified that you are as white as snow, that is, you've never had any involvement with the judicial authorities in Rwanda.  Is that still your evidence?
A.	I said so, and what I said is the truth. 
Q.	So, Witness, do you recall testifying in Setako's case that you were in prison in Rwanda, that is, you were taken to prison in Rwanda for actually receiving goods?  How do you reconcile that with your testimony here?  And it was after that that Setako came to your aid.  

You testified to that in Setako's case.  So you are not as white as you are making this Court believe.  What do you say to that?
A.	When questions were put to me, I answered that -- I said that during the multiparty era, there was no authority.  People could do just what they wanted.  Somebody came to my home, bought a machine, and after some time he brought the machine back.  

You are a man of the law.  When you buy a car and you use it, you cannot take it back to the person who sold it to you.  That is what that person did.  And when this person brought back the machine, I refused to accept the machine.  

And when Setako learnt this, he took up my defence and made my case by explaining that which had happened.  So we are here to tell the truth.  We are here to ensure that the truth is brought to the light according to the law.  

So I could not be arrested when I was innocent.  And so Setako simply made sure that I was defended, and he told me that.  And he said that he had arrested me rather illegally.  And so at the time there were people who knew the law and who would tell the truth without getting involved in political interests here or there.

And when you are a trader, people always have things against you and want to pull you down.  If you go to Rwanda today, you will never find any file in the legal department concerning me.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you don't have to be excited.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have translators who are translating your Kinyarwanda language so that we can understand it.  So you have to speak a bit slowly so that they are able to translate what you say.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the fact remains that you were incarcerated in Rwanda, and it was thanks to the intervention of Setako that you were released; is that correct? 
A.	It was a communal jail.  It was not in a penitentiary, a prison as such.  It was rather something tantamount to terrorism.  I was arrested illegally, and I was brought to -- taken to a communal prison.  But, Mr. Prosecutor, now you go to Rwanda, find my file, and prove to these Judges that I was detained.  You will never find any such file.  Okay?

You can never be detained and thrown into prison without a judicial file.  During the period of multipartyism in Rwanda, there was no power in Rwanda, and people just did what they felt right.  You need to carry out proper investigations and know exactly that which was happening in Rwanda at the time.  People felt that if you were maybe rich, you certainly were corrupt or that you got your wealth by unorthodox methods or that you were in a relationship with some political leaders.

I for one lived in Kigali.  You were not there.  I was in Kigali from 1972, and what was happening there?  I was in Kigali when Kayibanda was in power, and I was also there when Habyarimana came to office.  So I know only too well that which was happening in Kigali. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you will try to be as precise and concise in your answers, I would be grateful because we are operating under very strict time constraints.

Mr. Witness, apart from this intervention by Setako there were other occasions when you sought assistance from him.  Yes or no?
A.	It was when I was attacked by soldiers while I was at my home.  I called on him by phone, and that was about 7 a.m. in the morning.  And when you find yourself in a situation like that one, of course you contact an authority that you know and who could be of help.  And so after the president's plane was brought down, my residence was attacked, and I was forced to call Colonel Setako for him to intervene.  That was only very, very normal for me to do.

1015H 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	So we can call him your close friend, can we? 
A.	Yes, he was a close friend.  
Q.	And you would discuss with him everything, anything:  Politics, economics, everything; didn't you? 
A.	Now, a friend -- a friend can be a politician.  While you are not a politician and so you talk about other things.  As for me, I have a message to convey to the world and it's my duty to convey that message.  Every human being is created by God, and it's my duty to be a friend to everybody, and even to you, Mr. Prosecutor.  If you so desire, you can be my friend.  

But during my testimony in Setako, I made it clear that I had gotten to know Setako through the intermediary of Emmanuel.  He took care of me when I lost my dad and when my junior brother died, and even if I -- even if I was not in a position as -- like he was, he could be of help.  

My father lived during the days of Kayibanda and also during the reign of Habyarimana.  There were friends who would come over to our home, and it was under those circumstances that I got to know Colonel Setako.  

Setako was a friend to my brother-in-law who died, and he continued on as a friend of ours, even thereafter.  And whenever I had any problem, I would put it to him, and whenever the family had difficulties, he would come over to help.  He was someone much older than we were and whenever we had any problems, we would turn towards him.  
Q.	And this includes any problem whatsoever, doesn't it, Witness? 
A.	Each time I needed his help, I went to him and I talked to him.  You know, there are problems which are above you and you need to talk to friends to be able to solve them.  That is just what I did.  
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, you said you did not know Nzirorera very well, and I take it that the first occasion you had a face-to-face meeting with him was on the 6th.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	No, it was on the 7th -- the 7th of April, in the morning of the 7th of April.  I told you that I would see him from time to time during ceremonies on the ceremonial grounds, but it was on the 7th of April that I spoke to him face to face for the first time.  
Q.	And, Witness, you would agree with him -- with me that Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Setako are very close friends.  Do you agree with me on that? 
A.	I cannot confirm that.  Since I met Nzirorera at Setako's, I would imagine that they were friends.  
Now, as to conclude or describe the extent of that friendship, that I cannot do. 
Q.	And you know that both of them are charged in this ICTR for genocide.  Do you know that, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I learnt that you have charged them for the genocide.  
Q.	And you hope that your testimony will help their release.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Yes, that is why I'm here.  The truth will set us free.  Read John 8:32.  Read the Gospel.  The truth shall set you free.  If you follow the law, you'll arrive at their acquittal; that is what I have always said.  Just respect the law and these men will walk out of here free.  
Q.	Witness, if I could just enjoin you to try to be as brief as possible.  
MR. N'DOW:
Or maybe I should ask the Court to intervene just to warn the witness to be as brief as possible because he's elaborating on too much in his answers.  
THE WITNESS:
It is you, Mr. Prosecutor, who is wasting time.  You're wasting your time.  Ask the right questions.  Ask your questions very clearly.  But you asked me questions that I cannot understand, and that just gets us going around in circles and we're wasting time here.  If you asked clear questions, you will have precise answers and then we would save time.  You only ask -- answer a question the way it was asked.  There are questions which require long convoluted answers. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, yes.  Now, on the 7th when you arrived at Setako's house, was Setako present?  Did you meet him there? 
A.	No.  
Q.	You met the two daughters of Setako.  Do you know their names? 
A.	No, I don't know their names.  
Q.	So you stayed there for five days in Setako's house without knowing the names of his two children?  
A.	At my age I wouldn't have been interested in the lives of young girls, or young people, for that matter.  Maybe at that time, a long time ago, I knew their names, but by now I've forgotten.  It was not so important to me to know their names, to keep them in my memory, no. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would it surprise you to know that one of Setako's daughters gave evidence in this Tribunal and she did not mention you?  What do you say to that? 
A.	What I said is the truth.  You asked me to say the truth.  I have said the truth.  What else do you want?  She was very young.  It is 16 years ago.  Maybe she's forgotten.  For example, my junior brother refused to come here to testify in one trial before this Tribunal because he is not very -- his memory is not so good.  But for me, well, I -- my memory is not as good as it was before, and after everything, I'm not a computer, am I?  I am virtually 50, and you know that Africans die at age 40.  So as far as I'm concerned, I'm a very old man.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you met Mr. Nzirorera at Setako's house on the 7th, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	You met him and his children.  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	How many children were there? 
A.	I met him there with his family.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President -- says the Kinyarwanda booth -- can you ask the Prosecutor to wait for the 
Kinyarwanda booth to finish his question before asking the next question to the witness. 
MR. N'DOW:
My apologies.  

I didn't get the witness's answer.  If the witness can answer the question.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth interpreter was interpreting the previous question when you put the last question to the witness, so he couldn't get that answer. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	How many of Nzirorera's children did you see at Setako's house on the 7th April? 
A.	Nzirorera had six children, a son and five daughters.  
Q.	You have not answered my question, Witness.  I'm asking how many of his children did you meet at the house or how many kids he had.  
A.	But I told you Nzirorera had six children.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I can see that the time is 10:30 -- half ten -- and I think it's a convenient time for you to take the long -- the mid-morning recess, or you want us to proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take the mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1028H to 1100H) 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, my apologies for coming just now.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your direct testimony you said there were four cars in your commune -- in your -- in your convoy.  Is that correct or is that still your evidence? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	And you said the two cars belonged to Nzirorera, the third one belonged to Setako, which you were driving, and then the fourth car belonged to the director of OPROVIA.  Is that still your evidence? 
A.	No.  I told you that the first vehicle -- there was a jeep, a military jeep, followed by Nzirorera's vehicle, and then Nzirorera's Mercedes-Benz, and the little truck that was -- I drove at the end.  Those were the four cars that comprised our convoy.
Q.	You mean there was no car belonging to the director of ***********; is that your evidence? 
A.	But that is what I said.  Our convoy comprised just four vehicles.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know the director of ************* by name?
A.	I think his first name was Ignatius or ***********, but I can't remember his family name.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, was he driving any of the vehicles, ***********? 
A.	No, he was not driving any of the vehicles.  
Q.	Who was driving the vehicle in which he was on board? 
A.	A certain *********** was driving Nzirorera's Mercedes-Benz.  
Q.	Witness, I'm asking who was driving the vehicle in which the director of *********** was on board? 
A.	It was *********** who was driving that vehicle. 
Q.	Was Setako present when you were leaving? 
A.	I never saw Setako for he was not present.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it your testimony that Nzirorera left at the same time as the convoy from 
Setako's house? 
A.	Yes, it was Nzirorera who told us that we had to leave Kigali, given that Setako had just left.  I already told you that it was Nzirorera who was driving the Mercedes-Benz, the cross-country make of the Mercedes-Benz, and Nzirorera's vehicle was coming second, followed by the military jeep. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, I take it that you didn't stop anywhere to pick up other passengers.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	We never picked up anybody along the way. 
Q.	Nobody joined you in queue; is that your evidence?  
A.	I was looking at the vehicles that were in front of me.  Behind me there were many vehicles, and I was not paying attention to the vehicles that drove behind me.  What I paid keen attention to was the cars ahead of me to ensure that nobody got into our queue, and so four vehicles went one after the other and nobody joined the convoy.  
Q.	So you followed -- you were the third vehicle, you had the military vehicle.  Then you have the car that Nzirorera was driving, followed by the car that you were in.  And there was a fourth vehicle, isn't it, which was behind you?  
A.	Listen, there was the military vehicle in front of us.  There was the vehicle being driven by Nzirorera, I think a 350 Mercedes.  Then there was a limousine Mercedes driven by ***********, either a nephew or a cousin of Nzirorera's.  This was a guy who was working in Cyangugu; he was driving the 
Mercedes limousine.  I was fourth.  And when we got to the bridge in Giticyinyoni, the convoy was no longer just four vehicles, since the military vehicle had left.  Consequently, you had the jeep of Nzirorera, the vehicle in which his wife and children were, and I was driving the Dyna pickup belonging to Setako.  I did not pay attention to vehicles that drove behind us.  When we left from Setako's home, we were driving in a convoy of four vehicles.  
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, then your -- your car was not the third vehicle in the convoy.  It was actually, as you said, the fourth.  So there was a car in between you and Mr. Nzirorera's car; is that correct? 
A.	After the vehicle being driven by Nzirorera, there was a berline Mercedes-Benz belonging to Nzirorera.  
Q.	Yes, and that was the car between you and Nzirorera's car; is that not your evidence? 
A.	At the beginning was the military vehicle; secondly, the vehicle -- the Mercedes-Benz driven by Nzirorera; the third car, a berline Mercedes-Benz belonging to Nzirorera driven by Kazungu; and the fourth car was the -- the Dyna, the little truck or van belonging to Setako, which I was driving.  And 
after -- it was after we had crossed the Giticyinyoni bridge that the military jeep left and we were left with just three vehicles in our convoy.  
Q.	So that was after you've crossed the Nyabugogo bridge.  That was when the military vehicle returned; is that the case? 
A.	I am referring to the bridge over the Nyabugogo river.  You go round the -- the hill.  You go to Gitarama. There's a bridge that was guarded by soldiers.  We were about to climb over the hill towards Gitarama because there were many, many people in town.  
Q.	You said you were trying to climb the hill; is that your evidence? 
A.	It's a road which climbs the hill.  We did -- it was not we who climbed the hill.  I'm talking about the position of the road on the hill.  
Q.	And, Witness, if I put it to you that the situation at that particular junction was tense, what do you say? 
A.	It was as if we were in hell.  There was an immense crowd of people gathered there, and it was even very difficult for vehicles to go among them and come out on the bridge to go towards Kigali.  There were many, many people.  There was a huge crowd, and if we made any mistake of leaving the road, we'd find ourselves in the river.  

There were many people there and, mind you, at the same point there was a bridge, there was these protective rail guards, and there were many people, and the vehicles were sort of touching the persons on the road, and the vehicles and people were like rubbing shoulders.  You leave Kigali, you're going onto a hill, and it was difficult because you had to negotiate your way, wind between the -- the river, the sugar cane farm, people.  It was difficult.  
Q.	So in that chaotic condition, your vehicle was at the same position that it had -- when it left Setako's house? 
A.	Yes.  We were in a convoy that was bound to leave Kigali.  Before us, there was a military vehicle and we were driving at a snail's pace.  In fact, it was bumper to bumper.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...and who were manning the roadblocks at this particular junction? 
A.	The roadblock at the bridge was being manned by soldiers.  But before that roadblock, there were other civilian roadblocks.  For example, close to the house of Kabuga, the road leading to Kacyiru in Nyabugogo, there were people who were ensuring security there by manning these roadblocks.  
Q.	How far was the roadblock manned by the soldiers and that manned by the civilians, how far were they apart? 
A.	Well, it's difficult to give an estimate of the distance.  If you knew the areas, I could -- I could describe to you.  If you knew where Kabuga's home was, I could attempt.  If you knew the way to Giticyinyoni, you'd have been able to imagine the distance between the two.  But the roadblock manned by the soldiers was on the bridge there, at least to ensure the protection of that bridge.  I was on the river that separates Kigali and Gitarama.  

The other roadblocks were manned by civilians and -- who were in civilian clothing.  I think there was a roadblock in each secteur, but I really cannot tell you exactly where a roadblock was found here or there.  
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, David Hakizimana, you said he is the son of a man called Batera.  How did you come to know him, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I knew this boy because his father was a trader, as mine was.  As you know, people who have money always hang out together, so I got to know that this guy was the son of Batera.  I knew his father, and he was an only son.  Batera was a friend to my father.  He worked with my father.  He would come and buy ware, articles for trade from our home, and his son would come to carry them, such as -- things such as soap and other articles to take them to their home.  
Q.	Can you tell us what sort of business he was engaged in? 
A.	He would come to get supplies in soap and Jaribu, and other articles which you'd buy from here and a particular soap known as Asepso, which is made in Kenya.  And it was under those circumstances that I got to know his father -- that is, whenever he came to buy these articles he had to sell from my father.  
Q.	Do you recall any particular occasion when you met him? 
A.	I cannot recall the condition in which I met him, but I know that I know this person.  But I cannot tell you I met him on this occasion or that occasion.  I only know that he would come to transport articles for sale from our home, but I cannot recall the date.  
Q.	How would you describe him? 
A.	He was a well-built fellow, solid.  I don't know whether he has lost weight.  About the time I was 
86 kilograms, but if you look at me today, I'm a shadow of myself.  But I can remember that this young man was solid, very well built, robust in stature.
Q.	Well, Witness, you did not grow in the same place.  You grew up in -- if I looked at your personal information, you grew up in Kibuye and he grew up elsewhere.  So I just want you to tell me a particular occasion when you met him.  
A.	I cannot give you a particular occasion during which I met him.  I lived in Kibuye for only two years.  I left Rwanda at age 37.  Six years, that's not so bad.  I was born in Ruhengeri, I lived in Kigali, and the dwelling place of the father of this boy was in Kigali.  And so sometimes I would go to lend a hand to my father, and there were moments when I would meet him on such occasions.  So if I'm not able to tell you exactly what time I met him -- and may I remind you that I already said that this guy was the only son to his father.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know a person by the name of *********************? 
A.	****************, no, that name does not ring a bell.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, now moving to Mukingo, Mr. Witness, when you arrived to Mukingo you went directly to Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	No, we did not go to Nzirorera's mother's home.  We went to Nzirorera's home.  We went to his own home.  
Q.	I thought you said you went to his parents' home when you testified in direct examination.  
A.	No, I did not say that.  We did not go to Nzirorera's mother's home.  We went to Nzirorera's own home.  
Q.	And you stayed there with Nzirorera and his children; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, with his children and the family of Setako.  
Q.	And you stayed there for three weeks.  
A.	Yes, I stayed there for three weeks.  
Q.	And Nzirorera was also living there at the time; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, he also lived there, but from time to time he would leave, go away, and then return.  He used to go out on trips, which I did not monitor.  He would leave, he would return, he would leave, he would return.  He had certain duties to handle.  
Q.	So, what?  He was there most of the time, that is, from the 12th of April to the 1st of -- April he was there.  He'd spend -- he would spend the night in Mukingo? 
A.	I do not know whether you can specify.  Can you be clearer?  It is true that he would spend the night at Mukingo, but as for his movements, there are days that I would not see him.  And I can recall that at some times -- some moments I did not see him for a number of days.  Then he'd reappear in Gitarama.  But I was not sort of monitoring his movements, but sometimes he was there, at other times he wasn't there.  He had the schedule for work and he followed it.  But it is true that at 6 p.m. in the evening he would be in Mukingo.  
Q.	So he would spend the night most of this period in Mukingo? 
A.	Yes, most often he would sleep at Mukingo.  And as a matter of fact, I would say each time -- each time he would spend the night at Mukingo.  
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, you said you had several discussions? 
A.	Nibyo. 
Q.	Did you ever discuss the killings --  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- by the Interahamwe in Mukingo? 
A.	I do not know whether the Interahamwe killed any persons.  I did not see the Interahamwe killing anybody.  I can only talk about events which I witnessed personally.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	We never discussed any massacres.  
Q.	Did you at any time discuss with Nzirorera the killings in Mukingo? 
A.	No.  No, he never talked to me about that.  
Q.	And it was obvious, wasn't it, Witness, that there were killings in Mukingo during this particular period? 
A.	No, I did not witness any such thing.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, two days after your arrival, the Ruhengeri court of appeal was attacked with grenades, bombs, and thousands of Tutsi refugees who sought refuge there were killed.  You did not hear of this? 
A.	Well, I never heard any such thing.  
Q.	Did you notice roadblocks in Mukingo when you went there? 
A.	No, there was no roadblock at Mukingo.  On the road that we took in our convoy, there was no roadblock there.  There was a roadblock instead at -- there was a roadblock -- well, there was just only one roadblock.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you did not hear the noise of guns all over Mukingo during this period? 
A.	No.  While I was in Mukingo, I never heard any eruption of gunfire.  
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, you did not smell the stench of decaying dead bodies in Mukingo when you were there? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that Mr. Nzirorera must have known about the killings and just deliberately failed to take any action about these killings.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I have no answer to give you on that issue.  If he spoke to you about it, put the question to Nzirorera.  But as for that, I know nothing about it.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, we also have evidence in this case, a report authored by Mr. Karemera and members of the interim government, reporting about the decaying bodies in the streets of Mukingo on the 19th of April.  What do you say to this? 
A.	Now, let me tell you this.  I did not receive any information on that report.  If someone authored a certain report, well and good.  That person should talk about it, for he was a witness to that.  But as for me, I did not see any bodies, any corpses.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, it was obvious, according to the report, to see these things in Mukingo at the time.  That's what the report said.  
A.	I do not agree with you.  The author of that report is the only person that should speak about it.  
My grandmother, who was living in Kinigi, and my uncle and many relatives of mine died.  I was told that they died, but I was not a personal witness of their deaths.  

Now, if someone has done a report thereto, well, let that person talk about it.  As for me, I know that I was -- I was told that people had died, but I was not a witness to these corpses.  I never saw this report and so I cannot talk to you about this report which I have not read.  And so Nzirorera did not talk about it.  And when I was in Mukingo I did not see these corpses.  
Q.	And obviously you ventured outside Nzirorera's home; didn't you? 
A.	I remained within the vicinity.  I just stayed around the residence.  I did not go far away from there.  
Q.	How far did you go, Mr. Witness?  Did you ever go to the market or the church?  You're a Christian.  You must have gone to church; wouldn't you have? 
A.	I went to Mukamira and to Gisenyi, but I returned to Nzirorera's home.  
Q.	And yet you did not see the dead bodies.  You did not hear of the killings.  Is that your evidence, Witness? 
A.	I already told you that I did not see any corpses any time each time I was going past that road.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I do not intend to perturb the work of the Prosecutor, but I -- I would simply just want to recall that I did 50 minutes.  I don't know how far he has done already. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the Prosecutor has one more minute to go, so he should be wrapping up his cross-examination by now.  Thank you.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I would need at least 30 minutes to finish my cross.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. N'dow, what are the issues that you wish to cover?  It is not apparent to us that you need 30 minutes with this line of questioning.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I just want to be on the safe side and not to promise you something that I will not be able to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  My question is what are the issues that you wish to cover? 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honour, I want to talk about issues in Gisenyi, the arrival -- the arrival in Gisenyi.  I also want to talk about other issues which I thought I would not have covered when we adjourned, which are issues relating to the departure of the convoy from Segatwa's house, which I think is crucial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you've covered that already. 
MR. N'DOW:
I have not covered that.  I only covered the aspect of them leaving at Setako's house.  I didn't go into that.  But, Your Honours, to be honest, I will need at least 15 minutes -- nothing more than 15 minutes to wrap up my cross-examination if that will make you -- if that would be convenient for Your Honours.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, let me assist the Prosecution because he's talking about Segatwa.  I believe he's going to waste his time, and he's going -- not going to get anything out of the witness because he did state that they left from Mr. Setako's house.  He didn't talk about anyone else.  

I believe that in time management I would like to be of assistance to the Prosecutor.  If he's thinking about Segatwa, he's going to waste his time because the witness talked about Setako.  They left from Setako house.  They left from no other place.  That is to be -- to help the Prosecution, if that's of any use.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. N'dow, we will allow you to wrap up with a maximum of 15 minutes.  
MR. N'DOW:
I am most obliged, Your Honours.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, sorry for the interruption.  Mr. Witness, when you were in Mukingo, did you notice any visitors to Nzirorera's house? 
A.	*********** and his family arrived. 
Q.	Did you, by any chance, go to his mother's house during this period? 
A.	No, I don't even know her -- his mother's house.  
Q.	But you must have known his family.  You must have known Dusabimana, François.  He must have paid a visit to Nzirorera's house.  
A.	I told you that the only people I saw in Nzirorera's house who were visiting him were *********** and his family members.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, apart from the dead bodies which were obvious, didn't you see the houses destroyed? 
At least you must have seen them; wouldn't you? 
A.	I saw no house that was destroyed apart from our shops, which had been looted and damaged.  I saw no damaged houses.  The doors of our shops in Kigali had been broken in.  As for everywhere, I'd gone to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, I saw no destroyed houses.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you agree that during this period, that is, April 6th, and the time that you were there, nearly the whole Tutsi population of Ruhengeri had been liquidated?  Do you agree? 
A.	No, I don't agree with you.  Tutsis comprised 3 per cent of the Rwandan population.  It is Hutus who were killed for the most part.  You only had 3 per cent of Tutsis.  You had 3 per cent of Tutsis and the Twas were zero zero.  When you talk about -- about the millions of people who were -- people killed, that's not up to 3 per cent.  My uncle was killed.  My grandmother.  I do not agree with you.  

In any event, I did not -- I was not an eyewitness of anybody who was killed.  Some people were killed, but I can't tell you I saw people killed in churches or elsewhere.  No, I was not an eyewitness.  

When I left the Rwankeri church where I used to go and pray, I didn't see any corpses.  I left on the 30th, but I never went through a roadblock where there were corpses.  I said I saw corpses in Kigali and I was able to save my skin.  
MR. NIMY:
Witness, would you be so kind as to speak slowly, because I imagine that the interpreters are finding it too difficult to follow.  You're saying some very useful things and it is all the more -- this is a more -- a better reason for you to speak slowly.  

THE WITNESS:
What I'm saying is history.  I did not see any corpses at the roadblocks where I went through.  The first time I saw corpses in my life was in Kigali.  In any event, I did not see corpses close to roadblocks.  

In our home in Ruhengeri, you had a few roadblocks, but there were no corpses.  It is possible that people had been killed in the countryside, but I didn't see corpses.  If you have documents and witnesses came and told you that, that is your business.  But as far as I'm concerned, I did not see those corpses where I was in Ruhengeri.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, with a yes or no answer, do you agree that there was a mass slaughter of Tutsis in Rwanda in the period 1994?  Just a yes or no answer.  Do you agree or do you not? 
A.	No, I don't agree, and I'm never going to believe that.  Rwandan statistics only show -- show that there were 97 per cent Hutu, 2 per cent Tutsi, and zero zero Twas.  Now, people are saying you had 
one million Tutsis who were killed.  Where did they come from?  

You had two and a half million Tutsis in Rwanda.  So according to the percentages, what you imply is that there would no longer be Tutsis in Rwanda.  But I told you that you have at least 100 people who were killed in my family.  

Now, if people say that Tutsis were killed and Hutus were killed -- but the majority would be Hutus and not Tutsis.  Rwanda had 7.5 million inhabitants and Hutus comprised 97 per cent of that population, and the Twas were zero zero, while the Tutsis were 2.5.  Where did you get this five million? 

The majority of people who were killed were Tutsi -- were Hutus.  I never got the chance to bury my grandmother and my uncle.  Lots of Hutus were killed.  People were killed in Rwanda.  But you're talking about genocide.  Now, if there was a genocide in Rwanda, there'd be no Tutsi as we speak.  Check out the statistics and the census office -- or, in the ministry of the interior in Rwanda, go and refer to the statistics.  We would want this Tribunal to apply the law and seek the truth.  

If this Tribunal is not going to be able to see what happened in -- in Rwanda and seek solutions, then problems will continue.  Only those who have accepted God will survive.  The rest are condemned.  

I was impoverished by the war.  Then you come here and say whatever.  There were lots of roadblocks in Rwanda.  You had corpses, and that's why I returned to Ruhengeri.  You say people killed, but I didn't -- I was not an eyewitness to this and I never discussed these issues with Nzirorera.  Maybe he was aware of that as he was a high-ranking official.  Maybe he had discussed this with other officials. This is a professional secret, but we never talked about this together.  As far as I'm concerned, I just paid my taxes and that is it.  

From 1990 to 1994, no one took me before any court.  I was a major trader.  A côté de Nyilimanzi's shop, you had my shop.  I never had any of the property that I left behind.  It was a Tutsi woman who was a member of my family who's been paid this money.  I can't discuss issues concerning my disagreement with that lady.  

You do not know the problem that Rwanda went through and we await the good God to reveal the truth.  The rest are all lies.  I saw no corpses near roadblocks and I saw none while we were in the convoy.  I never saw whosoever tell anyone that -- to kill other people.  I never saw any of those and -- since I left Setako's to Ruhengeri.  If you have proof, then show them.  

In any case, from the time when I was with Nzirorera up to when we separated, I never saw any corpses.  And Nzirorera told us that we should leave the country because the army can no longer defend the country.  And then he decided to go to South Africa.  The country had been betrayed.  
Read The Three Prophetic Spirits.  This is a book that I distributed to the Tribunal.  God wrote all -- down all of that.  He knows the character of people.  Some people are ambitious who are in search of money, and some are ambitious because of education.  But if you don't accept God, you are bound to face problems.  

I told you how Nzirorera and I separated.  He told me that the army is tired.  He phoned to Zaire and said that the army could no longer defend the country and asked me to flee.  And at that time, we didn't have cellular phones and it was difficult to communicate.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, the witness has spent about seven minutes answering that question.  I just need to ask one question or two questions (inaudible).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you can put them through me.  I might have to get a short answer.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness --
MR. N'DOW:
-- or, Mr. President --  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in answer to my question you said you left on the 30th of May.  Was it the 30th?  You said you left on the 30th.  So you were in Ruhengeri from the 12th to what period?  Just to give an indication when you were there with Nzirorera to the Trial Chamber.
A.	I -- I told you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long were you in Ruhengeri?  What date did you arrive and what date did you leave? 
THE WITNESS:
We arrived in Ruhengeri on the 12th, and we left in early May, around the 2nd, and went to Gisenyi.  And I went from Gisenyi on the 30th of May, Mr. President, and I came to Tanzania via Goma. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	And you were, throughout this period from the 12th -- 
MR. N'DOW:
Sorry, Your Honours -- 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	You were, throughout this period from the 12th to the time you left Rwanda, with Mr. Nzirorera; is that your evidence? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, during that period from the 12th of April to the time you left Rwanda, how much of that time were you with Mr. Nzirorera? 
THE WITNESS:
During that time I spent in Nzirorera's house, I was with him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you with him after you went to Gisenyi? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I stayed in his house even in Gisenyi.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	And how long did you stay in his house in Gisenyi, Mr. Witness? 
A.	But I stayed in Gisenyi, as I told you, up to the 30th of May, and then I went to Goma, and from Goma I came to Dar es Salaam.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Is there any redirect?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, maybe you have to be fair and I think you are -- you are going to be the one to ask all our questions that are meant for the witnesses who appear before you.  That would be equity. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a question you'd like me to put to this witness, Ms. Diagne? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Not this one, Your Honour, but others.  Please do remember what I said.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, if I were to carry on with what Maître Diagne said, I would've liked to have asked you to do the redirect.  But no, more seriously, I don't have questions -- no redirect questions for the witness.  

Quite simply, I would like to apply for the Chamber to allow him to meet Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY:
His Excellency Mr. Nzirorera, to use the terminology that was being used since yesterday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but, Mr. Nimy, we accept that it's from the witness, but I think that you have to use different terminology.  

Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of your testimony, and the Chamber thanks you for assisting the Court with its work.  So you're now excused and you're free to return.  The registrar will make arrangements for you to see Mr. Nzirorera before your departure. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, for having accepted my testimony.  I would like to request -- kindly ask you to do your best to seek the truth.  I told you before, do read the Bible and other books to get a grasping of what is happening in this world.  If you do, you shall see the truth, and that truth is preparing the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Thank you, Mr. President.
(Witness excused)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the reason I'm sitting behind my usual spot is because we are prepared to play the audio tape with Witness GAP, and so if you would like to now bring him in.  The people from the technical booth have been able to put us in a situation where we were able to do that earlier than I had expected, so we can continue with his cross-examination, if you're ready for that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, in terms of procedure, Mr. Robinson, what we were wondering was this, whether it was necessary to play the whole of the tape.  If you played sufficient of the tape for the witness to be able to address questions concerning whether that was the tape or that was a record of the conversation, I don't know if the Prosecutor has indicated whether there is a problem with it, how much of it is necessary for us to be able to admit it? 

Mr. Webster, do you have a position on that?  It's a question of procedure.  Do we need to hear the whole tape in open court?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think we need to hear the whole tape.  I think Mr. Robinson can direct us to the portions that he thinks are relevant for his -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He mentioned approximately 38 minutes.  I wondered whether we needed to hear all of that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I certainly don't need to hear it.  I listened to the tape last night.  It's very difficult to follow.  I suggest that if we played it in court, we'd all be struggling, even though I'm sure the technicians have tried to facilitate matters, but it's very difficult to hear.  But he can try to elicit from the witness if this witness recognises it, and we can take it from there.  I have no objection to an abbreviated playing of the tape. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Do you have an objection to the tape being admitted in evidence?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we need more foundation from the witness himself.  I think we just have to hear the 
witness's response, Your Honour.  My concern is whether the tape has any probative value because, as I review the transcripts from yesterday, the witness actually mentioned the issue of recording before Mr. Robinson volunteered the tape.  And so it's -- it's -- the whole tape is problematic.  I don't -- in principle, I'm not opposed to its admission, but we need more foundation from the witness.  

The Court is not satisfied with that response? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, it's your response.  

So, we'll -- we'll call the witness in and --  
MR. WEBSTER:
I mean, at some point the tape is going to come into evidence, but we'll still need to have questions put to the witness.  That's my -- my concern.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  What -- at some stage we are going to have to listen to the tape, or we might have to listen to the tape in its entirety.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I just wondered whether it was something that we needed to do in open court.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Once -- once the witness identifies the tape and has accepted that this tape is a record of the conversation that's taken, we can then admit it and both yourself and Mr. Robinson can use it for the purpose of (inaudible) examination.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it was only my question of the modality of getting it admitted into evidence that I was concerned about. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we will start and see what happens. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, and I think the Court has restated my concern, which is simply that the witness has to give us additional foundation, and the Court just said that.  The witness has to acknowledge that that is a record of the conversation he had with Mr. Robinson.  If that happens, then there's no problem with it being moved into evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you bring the witness in, please. 
(Witness entered courtroom)
(Pages 15 to 30 by Jean Baigent)
















1200H
 MR. PRESIDENT:
It's now midday, Mr. Witness.  We welcome you back to our courtroom.  Your testimony will continue now.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began.  
Mr. Robinson will continue his examination of you.  He has been permitted to use the tape during your examination.  And after that, it is likely that the Prosecutor may have some questions to ask as well.  But your testimony will continue now, and you will have to respond to Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

Robinson is about to ask me questions, and I told you the agreement that bound me to Robinson.  He prepared the questions and suggested answers to me.  Subsequently, he told me, "Be careful.  I am going to record you."  So there's an agreement between him and myself, and that is why when I was entering the Chamber I told you that I was not his witness and that I was no longer in a position to answer his questions as he desired.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the procedure that we have to follow is that Mr. Robinson now has the right to ask questions which you have to answer.  Subsequently, the Prosecutor may also have an opportunity to put questions to you.  But we have to follow that procedure.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Let us move on now.  
WITNESS GAP,
RE-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GAP, muraho?  Amakuru ki?
A.	More or less I'm okay. 
Q.	Witness GAP, we are going to start by playing the first five minutes of the recording that was made of our conversation in the room next to the courtroom.  And after those first five questions I'm going to ask you some questions about that.  So at this time I ask that you simply listen carefully to the recording, and then I will ask you questions.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that we play the first five minutes of the recording.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Just for confirmation, Mr. Robinson, is this a video or an audio?
MR. ROBINSON:
Audio.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Only audio.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  You may proceed.  
(Audiotape played)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, that's the portion that I wanted to play before putting questions to the witness.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness GAP, can you tell me whether or not those were, indeed, the words that were spoken by yourself, my investigator and myself in the room next to the courtroom here? 
A.	Mr. President, I will tell you the circumstances under which I made the following statements.  Robinson had given me a sheet of paper indicating the lines along which I was supposed to answer to corroborate the statements made by ***************** -- rather, *********** and **********, because Robinson had told me this document, which was going -- he was going to show that document to the Trial Chamber. I did not tell Robinson that I was going to do another statement before the Judges because Robinson had promised to pay me $500 before answering his questions according to what he desired.  And so what you just listened to were statements that I made after having come to an agreement with Robinson who was supposed to pay me $500.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  

Now let me ask you then why, if that was the case, that when you gave your testimony on Thursday, the 21st of January when you were in front of the Judges and I asked you the following question, beginning on line 24, page 31, whether, when we were meeting on the 18th of November 2009 in the room next to this courtroom, you told me that Joseph Nzirorera never called the *************** during that time.  And on line 33 my question to you is, "Did you tell me that Joseph Nzirorera never called the ****************** during that period?"  And your answer was, "I never told you that he did not telephone."  Why did you give that answer in this courtroom? 
A.	My testimony is to the fact that Nzirorera made the phone call.  All that you are going to produce before this Tribunal is only responses which you prepared for me. 
Q.	My next question, Witness -- and I am referring now to page 34 of the transcript on Thursday of last week -- and on line 24 I asked you, "When we met, did you tell me that you did not go to *********** and stayed in the commune office on the 7th of April?  Did you tell me that?"  

And you said, "I never stated that I never went to ************ on the 7th."  

Now, why did you give that answer? 
A.	The answer I just gave you is most appropriate, if not what I told you in the room close by here was what you instructed me to give.  It is proof that you buy testimony, and, in addition, the other person to whom you paid money for him to come and testify in public in order to inform the Rwandan people about their testimony. 
Q.	And can you tell us why you did not reveal to the Chamber that I had told you what to say on this recording or during this meeting until you found out that I had, in fact, recorded you?  Why didn't you tell the Chamber that when you first came in, instead of denying these statements?  
A.	When I appeared before the Judges, I said it was a way of denouncing the testimony that you made.  I said I was not a witness of the Defence.  I said I was a witness of the Prosecutor.  It was in order to predict what you were going to say before the Tribunal and what you are going to say before the Tribunal and the Judges.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would offer the recording as Exhibit D. NZ720.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER:
No objection, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ720 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I would offer the will-say statement that he signed as Exhibit D. NZ721, under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I have a different position with respect to the will-say statement.  Mr. Robinson had offered that his investigator would be testifying, and the witness didn't acknowledge the statement.  Only one sentence of it was written.  And I have no doubt that the statement will come into evidence at some point, but I think it would be more appropriate to admit it through Mr. Munyashuti, and I would have questions for him about how this statement was taken.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine, Mr. President.  
Mr. President, in light of the witness's answers, it seems likely that he would simply acknowledge what is contained on the rest of the tape and, therefore, there is basically no -- nothing to be gained by playing the tape simply to obtain that acknowledgment.  So I think I have no further questions at this time.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Do any of the other parties, Defence parties, wish to put any questions to the witness?  

Okay.  Mr. Witness, we are going to have to -- 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I beg your pardon.  I did not have any questions to ask.  But, once more, on behalf of the robe that I wear rather ceremoniously, I wish to protest against the fact that each time there is a difficulty with a witness who recalls pressure under which he is in coming to be a Prosecution witness, we -- each time an attack is put against the Defence, please, this is inadmissible.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we note your remarks.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I was actually curious about the remarks.  Is the offense to the witness's evidence or to something that the Prosecution did?  Because he characterised the witness as a Prosecution witness.  My recollection is that he was called by the Defence and he was responding to questions put to him by Mr. Robinson, who was the calling party.  But I will meditate on that issue over the luncheon hour, Your Honour.  I don't think it needs any further response from Mr. Weyl.  

On the issue of proceeding, I do have questions --

May I continue with the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I was about to invite you to put some questions to the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I do have questions, but I also have documents that I'd like to distribute.  I have nine statements which I will be using with the witness's recross-examination, and the Defence have not seen these statements yet.  So actually my suggestion to the Court is that I distribute this bundle, and then we take our luncheon recess and I can commence it at 2 o'clock.  But I am at the Court's disposal.  I can certainly put questions to the witness.  I'm simply trying to be as reasonable as possible in terms of how we proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long do you intend to be in your recross, Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am shooting for between 30 minutes and 40 minutes, Your Honour, but it's impossible to say.  It depends on how the witness answers. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think it should start now.  We lost 10 or 15 minutes this morning when Mr. N'dow was late, and we have about 11 minutes now, which makes some compensation for that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  If I could, with the assistance of Mr. Issa, distribute these materials.  They are actually in the order that I will be using them, and not all of them are numbered, so if the parties could just simply keep them in the same order.
FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	We are at the tailend of your examination, and I would expect that after perhaps another hour of questioning, or 40 minutes of questioning, that we will be done.  So kindly bear with us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, 30 to 40 is no jump to an hour. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sure Mr. Robinson will have some re-redirect or cross.  That's why I'm putting an outside figure of an hour.  But I don't know.  But it certainly will be as brief as I can make it.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you clarify for us that since your arrest in December 1996 that you have never been provisionally released?  In other words, unlike ************************************* and the others, you have remained in prison continuously since **********************.  Is that so? 
A.	Yes, I have remained in detention for all this while.  
Q.	Okay.  And when you made your last statement to the Office of the Prosecutor on the 
28th of March 2008, that's the statement that was admitted in evidence as P. 414, at that time back in March of 2008 you had been sentenced to ***********in prison and you had already served ****of those years.  Right? 
A.	I was sentenced, but the ******************* court decided to detain me, and that of ********** also refused to release me, saying that the people were accusing me for having held meetings in collaboration with Nzirorera.  That was why I remained in detention. 
Q.	Thank you for that, Mr. Witness.  But what I'm trying to clarify with you is that back on the 
**********************, at that time your sentence was *******************, if I understood you correctly,
back in 2008.
A.	Yes, I was sentenced to a ********** term.  I remained in prison, even though I had already spent 12 years of the said *************, for the reasons I already indicated. 
Q.	Thank you.  And according to your testimony, I believe, of last Thursday, you tell us now that after your appeal that you currently stand sentenced to **********; is that right? 
A.	I was sentenced to *********, and I was never liberated, and I was placed under category 1.  And when I moved to category 1, I was condemned to perpetual -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, Mr. President, can you tell the speaker to slow down.  I missed the last part of that sentence.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are going to have to take your answer again because probably both of us are speaking a little bit too fast and we are cutting each other off.  So from now on could you speak a little bit more slowly and I will make an effort to wait for your answer to be translated before I ask the next question.  

So tell us again, what is your current sentence? 
A.	I was sentenced to 20 years by the appeal court of the *******************. 
Q.	The last portion of your answer mentioned something about perpetuity.  Was there any sentence to 
life imprisonment?  I'm not contradicting you.  I am simply trying to clarify matters for the record.
A.	Yes, the appeal court of *********** sentenced me to 20 years.  The Gacaca court of ******* sentenced me for life.  But the appeal court of the ********* Gacaca court sentenced me to ********* imprisonment. 
Q.	Okay.  So I think I am with you now.  But in any case, your sentence has actually increased since you last spoke to the OTP back on the 28th of March 2008, right?  So in spite of all of your confessions in Rwanda and your favourable Prosecution evidence and four ICTR trials, you have actually gotten more jail time recently.  Is that an accurate statement, Mr. Witness? 
A.	No.  The time has rather decreased.  The appeal court of the Gacaca court of ********** accepted my guilty plea.  
Q.	Okay.  But in relation to the information you gave us in March of 2008, in March of 2008 when you were interviewed, you had been sentenced to **********.  Subsequently you were resentenced to life imprisonment, and then that was reduced to *********.  Right? 
A.	Yes, I was sentenced for life and now I was sentenced to *********.. 
Q.	So it would seem to me that over time your sentence has increased from ******************.
A.	I said I was sentenced to *********of imprisonment.  After that I was sentenced to -- for life.  But the appeal court of *************** sentenced me to *********.. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  It's clear for us now.  

Last Thursday you testified that Rwandan authorities did not pressure you or coerce prisoners to confess or to fabricate evidence against the authorities.  That's what you told us last Thursday.  Do you maintain that evidence? 
A.	Yes, I maintain my statement.  I was under no duress exerted by the Rwandan authorities, and the proof of that is that I am testifying against former authorities of Rwanda.  It was the same accusations that were levelled against them, and they were placed in category 1.  
Q.	And is it still your testimony that you were never induced, never given benefits, in exchange for 
false evidence against the ICTR prisoners here in Arusha? 
A.	No inducement was given to me or promised me.  But it's only Robinson who promised to give me something so that I testify against his witness -- testify for his witness.  But I refused. 
Q.	And simply for purposes of the record, Mr. Witness, I have to ask you these questions:  Has the ICTR or the Office of the Prosecution promised you anything or pressured you in any manner to get your testimony before this Tribunal? 
A.	No.  Nobody has coerced me to say whatsoever.  I speak the truth when I testify, and I'm not the only one to do that.  We are doing -- I did the same thing during the Gacaca sessions.  I do not lie.  What I say is the truth. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, did you ever conspire with any other prisoners to give false evidence against any of the ICTR detainees? 
A.	No, no such thing ever happened.  As for myself, a ****************, I was accused as an individual.  There is no one else who is accused along with me.  There are no co-accuseds.  I am a single accused person. 
Q.	All right.  Now, Mr. Witness, I'd like to ask you about three -- or at least witnesses that I think are known to you.  The first is GFA.  Did you ever agree -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, how long are you going to be on this line?  It's about 12:30 now.
MR. WEBSTER:
It's only one line of questioning.  I'm only going to deal with the issue of fabrication of evidence.  But we can stop now and resume at 2 o'clock.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that might be better.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will take our luncheon break now.
(Court recessed from 1228H to 1408H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I have a legal issue that I would like to raise concerning the recross-examination and the documents which were provided to us.  And if the witness could please be asked to take off his headphones during this portion of the discussion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the Prosecution has given us copies of interview reports by the OTP in which they have interviewed various prosecutors and other officials in Ruhengeri and some prisoners in 
late January of this year, this may be last week, and all of them essentially say in one form or another that there was no fabrication of evidence in ******************.  And as I understand it, Mr. Webster intends to read portions of these statements to the witness and ask him whether he agrees with them.  And I think that that would be improper.  It would be smuggling into the record evidence from people who are not cross-examined who the witness himself is not familiar with the contents of their statement, and I believe that that kind of recross-examination would not be proper and I move that it not be allowed.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the issue of fabrication of evidence in Ruhengeri is still a live issue, and it's live at this stage of the examination of the witness.  Mr. Robinson went into this very issue.  He finished -- he concluded his cross-examination of the witness on this very issue and I plan to deal with it appropriately.  We have been -- we, referring to the OTP, have been investigating the Defence allegations of fabrication of evidence in ******************, and we do have nine statements, or actually more than that because we haven't even sorted through all of them, but I have nine that I have distributed to the parties earlier this morning.  And what I intend to do is to put to the witness a proposition of some of the information that various individuals have been providing and asking the witness to respond, in other words, to comment on the various propositions, which is certainly a legitimate way of approaching the issue in cross-examination.  

I'm not trying to introduce these statements in evidence.  I take Mr. Robinson's point, and I am actually conforming myself to the practice we have adopted in this trial, which is simply to mark those types of documents for identification, and if at a later time these individuals can be brought to testify, then at that point they can be cross-examined on the substance of whatever they have to say.  But Mr. Robinson can object to the form of my question as I go along, but I don't think it would be appropriate at this time for the Court to restrict me in how I approach this issue in my recross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Just, Mr. President, so that you understand, these are all consistent statements with the witness's testimony that Mr. Webster has elicited.  I don't know of any practice that we've ever adopted or any court has ever adopted to allow a party to introduce what other people have said on other occasions that supports the witness's testimony and ask him to confirm that.  That's simply not proper.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
As I recall, Your Honours, that was the practice adopted with great frequency during the 
Prosecution case when Mr. Robinson was cross-examining Prosecution witnesses and introduced contrary views of the evidence through statements of other persons and put the proposition to the witness.  It was done repeatedly.  So I don't see how this is any different.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the language you use highlights what is different.  You say that he introduced material which was contrary to what the witness was saying.  He is complaining that these documents are consistent with what the witness is saying.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My suggestion is that he did both, Your Honour.  Ultimately it's a question for the Court.  It's a question of the form of the question.  But this is a witness that is still being cross-examined.  He was called by the Defence.  We both -- we all understand how things have developed.  But notwithstanding, my suggestion is that we take it step by step and if there is a basis for an objection Mr. Robinson will make it at the appropriate time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we agree that we should not at this stage limit your method of cross-examining the witness.  But I should tell you that we have some concerns as a matter of law as to whether prior consistent statements -- we have already ruled that prior consistent statements of a witness are not admissible, and we are concerned that this same principle ought to apply if all that he is being asked is, "Did somebody else say the same thing that you said?"  So we wonder about the probative value of that, and we are -- so I just mention that at the moment before we proceed.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I can assure the Chamber that I'll try to be as short as -- I will go as quickly as possible.  This shouldn't take more than 10 or 15 minutes.  And if it has little probative value, that's certainly a determination that the Chamber can make at the conclusion of the trial.  And taking 15 or 20 minutes to go over this will not do us any harm, even if the Chamber decides to disregard both the question and the response when the evidence is concluded.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	When we left off I was beginning to ask you about GFA, Mr. Witness, so I will put that question to you again.  Did you and GFA ever get together with the intent of concocting false evidence against Nzirorera?  
A.	No, we never met.  When GFA was released in 2003, he had already started to testify.  And I was in prison throughout that time.  We did not have occasion to meet to fabricate any evidence whatsoever. 
Q.	What about if I put the same question to you about GBU?  Do you know who I am referring to if I use the pseudonym GBU?  
A.	No, I do not know that person.  Please kindly provide his name and I may be able to identify that person. 
Q.	What if I said the pseudonym GAO?  Would you know that person? 
A.	Yes, I do.  I know GAO.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could ask Mr. Issa to assist me, and if you could just show this bit of paper to the Court and to the witness so that we are all on the same page.  If you could show it to the Judges first and then to the witness.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've seen something written on a piece of paper that was handed up to you.  Is this the person that you identify as GAO? 
A.	Yes.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And for the benefit of the record, let me simply indicate that GBU and GAO refer to the same individual.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  With respect to GAO, tell us if you ever got together with him and compared notes and accounts and tried to fabricate evidence against Joseph Nzirorera.
A.	No, I never met him.  And he returned at the same time as ***********, and I know that he testified against Kajelijeli.  But we never met to fabricate our testimony.  We only met during the Kajelijeli trial when we came to testify. 
Q.	Yes, but when you say you never met, this is someone that you know.  Isn't that so?  I can understand you saying that you have not met with him to fabricate evidence, but this is someone that's familiar to you otherwise, right? 
A.	Yes, I know that person. 
Q.	Okay.  With respect to both GFA, GAO or any other prisoner, did you ever agree with them to harmonise your evidence against Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	No, that never happened. 
Q.	Did the Rwandan prison authorities ever try to get you to do that? 
A.	No, the authorities do not know the persons against whom we come to testify. 
Q.	Do you know a man by the name of Rukira wa Muhizi?  M-U-H-I-Z-I is the last name.
A.	Yes, I know Rukira wa Muhizi.  He was the deputy at some point in Ruhengeri, deputy prosecutor in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor met with Mr. Muhizi sometime last week, and he explains that he was the substitut du procureur in Ruhengeri from 1998 to 2002.  Does that sound right to you? 
A.	He was never prosecutor himself.  I know he was the first deputy prosecutor at some point. 
Q.	But does the period 1998 to 2002 comport with your recollection of when he was the deputy in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I do not know the exact period, but I know that he was still in Ruhengeri in 2002. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Muhizi explains that he never encouraged prisoners to accuse the authorities in exchange for leniency.  Is that consistent with your experience? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going object to that.  Number one, it does have no probative value; number two, it's improperly putting into the record what Mr. Muhizi says, which is not evidence.  And you can't simply violate the rules and say, "Well, no foul, no harm, because you can give it whatever weight you want to," otherwise the trial will be chaos.  So let's obey the rules.  This is not admissible, it's not proper cross-examination, and it shouldn't be allowed.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have already explained the Prosecution position.  I don't think I need to repeat it.  So the Chamber can rule if it thinks the question was improper.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we think we have to disallow this.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, for the benefit of the interpreters, please kindly repeat, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I say that we have to disallow this.  And I was about to explain that we do not think that we would be able to utilise this to support any finding of fact that we would make.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Angélique Habyarimana? 
A.	I do not know her. 
Q.	What about an Aline Batsinda, B-A-T-S-I-N-D-A, Aline Batsinda? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Where do you know Aline Batsinda from, please?  
A.	I knew her when she was prosecutor in Ruhengeri. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, before any question is put to this witness as to what she had said, I think that, unless there is a significant difference between what Mr. Webster is going to do now and what he did before, we ought not to pollute the record with any of her statements.  And I would ask that you not put any questions to this witness concerning what this person has said unless we have some kind of different purpose that's a legitimate one as opposed to simply repeating what you have already ruled is not legitimate.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll ask my question, and the Chamber can rule if there is an objection.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you ever complain to ***************** that you were receiving threats from the family of Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you ever complain to her that the family of Joseph Nzirorera was manipulating the Gacaca judges and influencing them to be more severe toward you because of your willingness to give favourable prosecution evidence? 
A.	No, I never said any such thing to *********************. 
Q.	Well, beyond the issue of whether you said that to her or not, is that the case?  Do you have anything to say about the issue of whether the family of Joseph Nzirorera have been able to influence Gacaca in your locality? 
A.	No member of his family can influence the decisions of the Gacaca proceedings.  It is only the 
Kajelijeli family members who could or who can influence Gacaca decisions.  So is your question about the Kajelijeli family?
Q.	Well, let me reformulate my question to you, Mr. Witness.  Have the families or friends of any of the accused in Arusha, which would include both Kajelijeli and Joseph Nzirorera, have those persons been able to influence or manipulate the Gacaca process in a way that disadvantages you? 
A.	If someone is not your friend, they can plot against you.  When I was sentenced to 15 years, members of the Gacaca court of his secteur decided that I ought to be placed in first category, and they didn't want me to be released, and they didn't want my guilty plea to be admitted because they didn't want my testimony to be taken into account. 
Q.	And how were they able to influence Gacaca? 
A.	They wrote a letter based on which I was placed in the first category, and, hence, there was no way for me to be released. 
Q.	Do you know if that has happened to anyone else in the Ruhengeri prison?  And here I am referring to Gacaca being wrongfully influenced by friends or family members of the accused here in Arusha.
A.	The members of the Gacaca court in my area are under the influence of Kajelijeli and Nzirorera.  And none of the people who were also accused in any case as far as authorities are concerned in these Gacaca courts returned to the country. 
Q.	Well, tell us how they are able to influence the Gacaca courts.  That's what I'm trying to understand.
A.	They seek witnesses which they take to Gacaca court sessions and they come and testify and tell lies.  And in the event where an accused were to be released, the Gacaca court would change its decision and the accused would no longer be released. 
Q.	And what is it that makes you think that that has some link to the accused here in Arusha?  What's the basis of your suggesting that? 
A.	In Ruhengeri prison, you know, there's someone, a man whose nickname is 1 and 3.  These are important people in Ruhengeri prisons.  And the witnesses with the nicknames 1 and 3 are those who provide all the information. 
Q.	What do you mean, the nicknames 1 and 3?  What are you referring to, Mr. Witness? 
A.	They are witnesses in this trial. 
Q.	But what list are you referring to?  Are you giving them a number or is this something that -- I am a bit confused by your reference 1 and 3.
A.	I know them, and I got these numbers or these pseudonyms while I was here, so I know them and I know their pseudonyms. 
Q.	Well, just tell us -- pardon me, but just repeat what you want us to understand about those two -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  If I can assist you, Mr. Webster, both of those people testified without protective measures so there is no problem to mention their names.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you for that, Mr. Robinson.  I didn't recall that we had listed anyone.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, you are able to just say the names of the persons you are trying to -- 
A.	Ndisetse, Assiel and Niyoyita, Jean Damascène.
Q.	And what is it that you were telling us about those two individuals?  
A.	They are in charge -- they are capable of influencing what happens in the Gacaca courts in Busogo.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know a man by the name of Moïse Mugabo?  
A.	I have heard about that person. 
Q.	Is this a Gacaca coordinator in Ruhango district?  
A.	Yes, I know that person.  Yes, he was a coordinator of the former Mukingo commune. 
Q.	This person has suggested that there are family links between Ndisetse and Niyoyita and some of the judges in the *************** Gacaca.  Do you know anything about that?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have come to the end of my recross-examination.  I have one last question for you.  Now, you and Mr. Robinson have traded very serious allegations against each other on the issue of fabricating evidence, and I'd like you to have the opportunity to explain anything that needs to be explained about those allegations to the Chamber.  So if you could briefly comment if you need to add anything to the record in regard to that issue, the accusations that you and Mr. Robinson were trading with each other about fabricating evidence.
A.	What I have to say is as follows:  Counsel Robinson pays to witnesses.  I made a statement for the Prosecution, and Mr. Robinson cannot explain how I could change and become his witness and that I could change my -- recant my testimony.  When he met me he told me that "I am the one who will tell you what you have to say in your testimony."  You know, everything I say and which was recorded was prepared by someone who is an intellectual.  He told me, "You have such and such a pitfall, and this is how you are going to behave, and this is how you're going to answer."
So, Counsel Robinson gave witnesses $100, and after the testimony a further $100, so in all he gave them $200.  As far as I am concerned, he had to pay me $500 before I testified and $500 after my testimony.  So it is incumbent upon Counsel Robinson to explain how he got to discuss with me and how he wanted me to come and testify for the Defence.  I accepted his proposal and signed the will-say.  But what I wanted to do was for the Judges to be in a position to understand the manoeuvres which Robinson does by paying witnesses before they come and testify.  And that is why, after I took the oath, I stated that I no longer wanted to be a Defence witness for Robinson and that I continued to be a Prosecution witness.  

I, therefore, believe that it is Robinson who will explain to the Chamber why he wanted me to recant my testimony and testify on behalf of the Defence.  But ever since I started testifying in 1999, I have never made any statement whatsoever to Robinson for him to use in the Defence case.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I have no further questions, but it certainly would be appropriate for the Court to make its own enquiry of the witness if there are issues that have not been brought to light by the examination of the parties, but thank you for your patience with me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, are you soliciting instructions to advise the Court in how to proceed?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour.  I was inviting the Court to ask questions of the witness if there were any lingering curiosities because the witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We know what our powers are, and if we find it necessary we will do so without any prompting.
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
(Pages 31 to 44 by Claudette Ask)











1445H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, I know you are not actually entitled to such, but were there any issues you wanted to put to the witness?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, that has come to the end of your testimony, and we thank you for coming to the Tribunal and assisting us with our work.  

We thank all the witnesses who support the Tribunal in this manner.  But you are now excused and free to go.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
There is one issue I wanted to address.  It doesn't require anything from the witness.  I did rely on at least three different statements to formulate some of the questions I put to the witness, and I would like to identify them for the record if the Court will allow me to.  It's a statement from Mr. Muhizi, a statement of d'Aline Batsinda and the statement of de Moïse Mugabo, three officials with the justice system in Rwanda.  The last -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, with the blinds being pulled, it is difficult for the interpreters to work from the 
French booth. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, could you just repeat -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
With the Court's permission, I'd like to have three statements marked for identification so that we can identify them on the record.  It would be the statement of Mr. Muhizi, the statement of d'Aline Batsinda, and the statement of de Moïse Mugabo.  And I draw on the content of those three statements to formulate questions that I put to the witness.  

And the Prosecution may make an application at some point to hear from these witnesses.  So I'd like to have some indication on the record of how it arose in the context of our trial. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No objection, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa, identification numbers, they're marked for identification. 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Document number 1 will be P.  ID52, the second document will be P. ID53 and the third one, it will be P. ID54.  Thank you, Your Honour.
(Exhibit P. ID52, marked for identification)
(Exhibit P. ID53, marked for identification)
(Exhibit P. ID54, marked for identification)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  At this time before calling our next witness, I would like to make a very brief motion, pursuant to Rule 91, that you appoint an amicus curiae to investigate the false testimony of 
Witness GAP.  

I think it's apparent since he gave his testimony on Thursday that that testimony is false, and that testimony he's given in other trials is also false.  And I think it is now incumbent upon the Chamber to pursue that.  

It wouldn't be appropriate, as you've already ruled with respect to BGH, that the Office of the Prosecutor be the ones to investigate to determine whether or not the witness should be prosecuted for false testimony.  

So I'm asking under Rule 91 that you make an order that an amicus curiae be appointed.  Let him investigate and then you can decide -- or another Chamber can decide -- whether or not a prosecution for a false testimony should be commenced against Witness GAP.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I think this is the type of application that should be in writing.  I certainly feel comfortable responding to it, and I will make some comment.  But I think it would be more appropriate for this to be documented and a bit more researched, quite frankly.  

My suggestion to the Chamber is that the witness was trying to avoid giving false testimony.  That he had an opportunity to repeat to this Chamber some of the evidence that he offered in other trials that did not go to the issue of culpability of the persons that were on trial and decided to be forthright and to correct portions of his testimony that were not accurate in the three previous trials that he testified in.  

He was not giving evidence against Joseph Nzirorera when he testified in the Bizimungu trial, the Casimir Bizimungu trial or the Augustin Bizimungu or the Setako trials.  When it came to actually testifying in a forum that could lead to criminal penalties to the accused on trial, he corrected his evidence.  So I'm not quite sure that the elements of false testimony could be established on this record.  
We could look into that issue and submit something in writing, or the Chamber could simply decide the motion.  But I have doubts whether there's a legal basis for it on the record that we have, thus far, just given, the fact that the issue of Nzirorera's presence at that meeting was ancillary in the other 
three trials, even though it is central in this trial, and his testimony in this trial was consistent with his further examination from Mr. Robinson, which is the only basis for suggesting that it was deliberately false.  The evidentiary issue hasn't been resolved.  

So that's my submission.  But I think the Court could do with written submissions from both parties before making a decision that could lead to the consequences of launching a whole other investigation by a separate amicus. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I don't know mind doing that.  I can make a motion in writing.  But while this evidence is fresh in your mind, I don't see there's any legal principles that are in dispute.  And I think you've heard that -- the witness claim that Mr. Nzirorera was present by telephone during that meeting.  

And that is contradicted by a host of prior testimony and prior statements that he's given.  So on that basis alone -- but you also have his testimony that Mr. Nzirorera called the commune office, which is totally inconsistent with the testimony he'd given before in other trials, and his testimony as to what he denied saying when he was interviewed by myself, which is now contradicted by what is on the tape.  

So we can put something in writing, if you prefer.  But simply based on what you've heard in the last few days, I think you're able to decide whether or not it rises to the level of warranting an investigation for false testimony. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I wanted to stand up before Mr. Webster answers Mr. Robinson to inform the Chamber that I second the defence of -- defence of Ngirumpatse to Mr. Robinson.  

I would also like to express my disappointment with regard to the last question raised by Mr. Webster during his recross, because bar insisting on what has happened this morning, he forgets that by attacking the Defence they comprise the integrity of the Tribunal. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to respond to Mr. Robinson, I think -- my concern in terms of the allegation of false -- deliberately false testimony -- excuse me.  Let me rephrase it.  My understanding of the law is that it has to be established that the witness intended his testimony to exculpate the Accused or to inculpate the Accused and that testimony was given specifically for those reasons.  

And this is the only time that he has testified as a witness in the trial of Joseph Nzirorera and the evidentiary point that Mr. Robinson makes is specifically with regard to Joseph Nzirorera.  
So I'm not 100 per cent sure, but I think we have a legal issue that would prevent a prosecution for 
false testimony going forward on the basis that Mr. Robinson suggests.  

Then with respect to Mr. Weyl, I certainly would not -- perhaps I was unartful in the way I put the question, or Mr. Weyl may have misunderstood me, but I'm certainly not attacking the Defence or 
Mr. Robinson by asking the witness to address the Court and explain himself in regard to all of the testimony that has come before.  

So it was simply an attempt to give the witness an opportunity to explain himself.  I'm certainly not vouching for the witness or trying to support anything he said.  The witness is independent, and it was a witness that Mr. Robinson called, and I'm not attacking the Defence at all.  So let me just clarify that for the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question of timing here, we -- we have considered that it might be sensible to wait for the 
Appeal Chamber decision with regard to the last amicus report which has been submitted.  

So we would want to defer until the completion all deliberations until that time.  

The question is:  Do we receive your application now?  Or do we make a scheduling order and give you the opportunity to meet for the submissions yourselves after the decision has been rendered?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, mister -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think the issue is not going to -- to -- to -- let me say this:  I think it would be more sensible to wait for the Appeal Chamber decision before we make any submissions on the issue, and the issue is not going to go away with the passage of time.  So I don't think Mr. Robinson would be at any disadvantage by waiting for the Appeal Chamber judgement.  We certainly wouldn't --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We understand your submissions.  But we weren't sure if had wanted an opportunity to make further submissions once the Appeal Chamber decision has been made.  If you thought it would be of assistance to do that, then we will make a scheduling order to that effect. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, respectively, I think the issues are different.  The issue of the current appeal is not whether an investigation should be commenced by an amicus curiae, but it's whether a prosecution, having been recommended by the amicus curiae, ought to be commenced and then the timing of such a prosecution.  
Now if you were to find that there were grounds for false testimony here, you could order the investigation, and then you can decide later what the timing of the prosecution of that is, depending on how the Appeal Chamber rules.  But delaying the investigation, the Appeal Chamber's decision is not going to speak to that, one way or the other, whether you should allow an investigation.  

So I don't think that the Appeal Chamber's decision is going to be of any assistance to us on the issue that's right before the Court.  Maybe later, at a stage where you're deciding whether to go any further after you receive an amicus curiae report, the Appeal Chamber's decision will come into play.  But at this stage I don't see how the Appeal Chamber's decision will affect your decision on whether to make an investigation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ultimately we are going to be the deciders of that.  

But what I understand from you is that you do not wish us to make a scheduling order to allow you to make submissions at a subsequent stage. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's correct.  I prefer you simply decide the matter now. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We'll decide the timing. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's only my request. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I understand.

And the same goes with you, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I have a different recollection of the issues on appeal, quite frankly, because it wasn't simply the timing of the investigation.  There was also the issue of whether the scope of the enquiry of the amicus should be broadened.  

And if that happens, then the amicus could conceivably investigate this issue as well.  Because somehow I would assume from Mr. Robinson's perspective they're all linked in so much as the Defence is alleging a broader conspiracy in Ruhengeri.  

So I don't think it hurts us to wait for the Appeal Chamber's decision.  But, of course, the issue's in his hands because he could file the motion, and then we'd simply have to -- to respond within the time periods allowed by the Rules. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But we already have a motion before us.  And Mr. Robinson has indicated that he doesn't wish to make any further submissions.  So -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
In that case the Chamber can simply decide the application. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you.

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  We will defer our decision. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Or consider -- take time to consider it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President.  We're prepared at this time to call our next witness who is 
Dick Prudence Munyeshuli. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Number 21.
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  I'm sure you don't need directions about the procedures of our -- our trial.  So you know that the first thing is to take an oath to tell the truth.  And we'll ask the registrar to administer that now.
(Declaration made by Dick Prudence Munyeshuli in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you now proceed to give your evidence.  

Mr.  Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

We've distributed a personal information sheet, as well as a copy of the witness's report which had previously been disclosed.  

At this time I would ask that the information sheet be placed before the witness. 


DICK PRUDENCE MUNYESHULI,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Mr. Munyeshuli, directing your attention to the personal information sheet, is the information there correct? 
A.	Yes, they are correct, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that that personal information sheet be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ721. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ721 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber your occupation?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Has the question been translated for the witness?  

Mr. President, I'll put my question again. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber your occupation? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Presently, I am a private detective. 
Q.	Are you assigned as investigator for the Defence team of Joseph Nzirorera at the ICTR? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And for how long have you been so assigned? 
A.	I have been an investigator in this team since April 2003. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time when I asked you to prepare a report on your -- the results of your investigation concerning the whereabouts of persons who had been mentioned by 
	Prosecution witnesses as having been present at certain important events in this case? 
A.	Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
May that report be now placed in front of the witness?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Is that a copy of the report you prepared? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this report be admitted under seal as D. NZ722.  It contains the names of some protected witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit D. NZ722 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now turning to the first page of that report, there is the name of Witness ZF.  And then it refers to Exhibit D. NZ103, meeting at Butotori camp.  And then there's three columns, the names, the current whereabouts and information from.  Can you explain for the Trial Chamber how you prepared this report and what it means? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  For those three colonels, the first two, it was easy as it is a well-known fact that they are in the United Nations prison here in Arusha.  

As for third one, the task was a little bit more complex, as I had to ensure where he originated from.  Then I went there, that is to say, Gisenyi préfecture.  When I arrived where he lived, I found that he no longer lived there.  So I asked neighbours about it.  And they confirmed that this Colonel Buregeya fled into exile in 1994 and I carried on to try and locate members of his extended family.  I succeeded in locating -- locating his nephew called Népomuscène, who confirmed to me that that colonel had fled into exile in 1994, in the month of July, and that he had heard that he allegedly died in Congo.  

I didn't stop then.  I tried to locate a closer relative.  And I was able to reach his daughter, who presently lives in Brussels, through an investigator known as Innocent, and that girl whose known as Claudine did indeed confirm that Colonel Buregeya died in Congo. 
Q.	And using that approach, were you able to compile this information for all of the names that I had given you of the people who were listed as having been present at these various events, their current whereabouts and the source of your information? 
A.	Yes, I did the same for all the people whose names are found in my report.  Thank you. 
Q.	Okay.  Now putting aside that report which the Chamber can review, I want to now ask you about another topic, and that is concerning an interview of a person we know as Witness ANU.  And I would ask that you be shown Exhibit D. NZ300.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we know that you're normally very well prepared, but advance notice to Issa, or a copy, might have been helpful in this instance. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  I neglected that, and I apologise.

And for Mr. Issa's information, the next document we're going to deal with is going to be the will-say of Witness GAP, so if he could get that ready. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now concerning D. NZ300, which is a report concerning an interview with Witness ANU, did you participate in that interview? 
A.	Oui. 
Q.	And after that interview were you sent this report to determine if its contents were faithful to what had been said? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness's previous answer, Mr. President, was "yes".  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	On the second page of that report, it talks about the swearing-in ceremony of Juvènal Kajelijeli.  And I'll read the one sentence.  It says: "Joseph Nzirorera was present, but Witness ANU does not recall him making a speech."  

Is that what Witness ANU told you on that occasion and you interpreted and told me? 
A.	Yes, that is what the witness told us. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Now if the witness can be shown the will-say statement of Witness GAP. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now directing your attention to that document that's in front of you, can you explain to the 
	Trial Chamber the circumstances that led to Witness GAP placing his initials on each page of that document? 
A.	After the interview with witness -- with the witness in June, last June, we again met the witness and had a discussion with him at the UNDF this January.  Lead counsel had prepared a statement, and I was with Léopold, the legal assistant, lead counsel and myself and the witness at that meeting at UNDF.  

Lead counsel asked me to read and interpret the statement to the witness to have the witness confirm the accuracy of the content of the statement.  

I proceeded to comply reading paragraph after paragraph.  And the witness acknowledged the accuracy of the content of the document.  Then at the end of the exercise, lead counsel asked him to sign the document if its content was accurate.  The witness then agreed that the content was accurate and proceeded to sign each of the three pages.  Thank you.
Q.	And did you faithfully record -- or faithfully translate from English into Kinyarwanda that entire document to the witness? 
A.	Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
Q.	And the information that was in that will-say statement, you received a translation that said that that meeting from the witness was in June, was that correct?  Or was that meeting in November when we obtained the information from the witness? 
A.	I am sorry.  I was mistaken as to the date.  It was in November of last year. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, could you clarify from the witness what was the translation process, from which language to which language. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	When you were reading this document to the witness, from which language into which language did you read? 
A.	The document was drafted in English, and I translated into Kinyarwanda for the witness.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now at any time did me or any other member of our team offer this witness any money or any other thing of value? 
A.	No, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
Q.	Did we ever provide the witness a script from which he was to answer questions? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was Witness GAP aware that we were recording his interview on the 19th of November 2009? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Was the witness aware that we were recording his interview in November of 2009? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Where was the recorder? 
A.	I was the one in possession of the recorder. 
Q.	And was it visible? 
A.	No. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that the will-say statement be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ723 since it bears the witness's name. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit D. NZ723 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no further questions of this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do any of the other Defence teams wish to ask this witness any questions?  

Mr. Witness, you are now to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor.   
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, can we have the time, since I think I set some kind of a record here?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, 18 minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
In fact, I think the record was set with the testimony we heard from -- was it Witness G with a 
	video link?  It took all of two minutes, if that much.  But maybe in our rebuttal case, we'll beat that record, Your Honour.  

In any case, I wanted to alert the Court that the cross-examination of this witness is going to take place in two parts.  My colleague, Saidou N'dow, will conduct the major part of cross-examination.  But there is an issue that I would like to cross-examine on, and I will do that tomorrow morning.  I think it will take the ten minutes we have remaining.  But it concerns the will-say statements from GAP and statements from ANU.  That's something that I will ask questions on Thursday (sic).  

So if the Court does not mind, we'll have a joint examination of this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That will be permitted. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Good afternoon.  Mr. Witness, you have been present in these proceedings since you were engaged as an investigator by the Nzirorera team? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you were present when most of the Prosecution witnesses testified in this case.  And so were you when the Defence witnesses testified, is that correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it safe to conclude that you are fully conversant with the issues in this case?  Is it a safe conclusion to draw? 
A.	Yes, I know this case very well. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Mr. Witness, you were engaged by the Nzirorera Defence in 2003.  Can we agree that prior to that engagement you had no formal qualifications in investigation; can we agree on that? 
A.	Not trained as an investigator as such.  But as a -- an individual involved in legal defence, I had opportunity to gather evidence and to produce same before the courts. 
Q.	Witness, you agree with me, or you disagree with me, you did not have any formal qualifications in investigation -- in private detective work; am I right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you belong to no professional body regulating the conduct of investigators; am I right or wrong? 
A.	That is correct.  The fact of the matter is that the profession is still being introduced to my country at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. N'dow, which channel are you listening to?  
MR. N'DOW:
It seems I am on channel 1, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, then you should wait until the translation is finished before you begin your next question. 
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, you're right, Your Honour.  There's a problem. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Yes, Witness.  
A.	Please kindly repeat your question. 
Q.	You do not belong to any professional body regulating investigators, do you? 
A.	My answer to you clearly was that the -- such an organisation does not yet exist in Rwanda and we are in the process of setting up one in my country. 
Q.	So one can conclude that you are not answerable to anyone for any misconduct that you may have done in the course of duties as a private investigator; am I right? 
A.	I do not agree with you. 
Q.	Witness, to whom are you answerable to? 
A.	Well, let's take an example.  It all depends.  For the investigative work that I do for the ICTR, the answer is very clear, isn't it?  Now, whatever work I do for other persons is done with due respect to the rules that apply in the jurisdiction or area where I discharge my work or my duty. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, there have been several allegations made by witnesses in this trial alleging that you misrepresented what transpired at their interviews, is that correct? 
A.	I do not agree, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm not sure whether you get -- got me or not.  What I'm saying is that there have been allegations; have there been allegations or have there not been?  That's my question.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
But, Mr. President, that actually wasn't his question.  It was whether there were several allegations.  

But perhaps, given the time, we can take our recess and resume on -- tomorrow. 
MR. N'DOW:
Mister -- Your Honour, I will leave that to your discretion.  It's already 3:30.  We'll take the recess.  
But my question actually was whether he was aware that there were several allegations made against him.  And perhaps he should answer that before we take our recess, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you answer that, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I was not aware of any such allegations against me. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honour, we can take the recess. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, I think I must remind you of what I think you ought know.  That while you are a witness in the trial -- while you're a witness before us, you should not discuss your testimony or the case with anyone.  You understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take the adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1531H)
