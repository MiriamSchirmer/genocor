MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday the              5th of December 2005 for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecution versus Rwamakuba, Case Number ICTR 98-44 CT.

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Appearances?  Appearances are the same.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you hear me, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your evidence will continue this morning.  Mr. O'Shea will continue his examination-in-chief.  And I should remind you that you remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began on Friday.  

Mr. O'Shea, in view of the comments that were made just before we adjourned on Friday --  
MR. O`SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think I should tell you that we do agree that the issue of the split in the MDR, and the Accused's role in the MDR are relevant material issues. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I was not suggesting that they were irrelevant.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But what I had thought was and what the import of my comment was that I had difficulty in appreciating why it needed such a detailed and extensive history 
MR. O'SHEA:
	Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	To address those issues. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the only comment, the point of my comment. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I understand, Your Honour.  It was simply -- just shortly, it was simply that by providing the detail it provides the truth of what is being said.  Thank you.
JEAN-MARIE NKEZABERGA,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Good morning, sir. 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Now we were -- yesterday, we were talking about circumstances surrounding the division in the MDR.  And we reached a point where you had explained that there had been meetings with bishops -- with a committee of bishops to try to bring the parties together.  And, ultimately, you said that the result was that the list of ten names from the MDR would be submitted to Mr. Twagiramungu.  

Now, do you remember, or do you know whether Dr. André Rwamakuba was or was not on that list of ten names? 
A.	Yes, I do.  He was on it. 
Q.	What about Agathe Uwilingiyimana? 
A.	No, she was not. 
Q.	What about Ngulinzira? 
Q.	Ngulinzira was on the list? 
Q.	And what about Dismas? 
A.	He was also on the list. 
Q.	Can you remember other people who were on the list? 
A.	I can remember Kambanda, Eliezer Niyitigeka, Jerome Bicamumapaka.  It is a long time ago, I don't remember the others. 
Q.	Well, Kambanda is K-A-M-B-A-N-D-A, Bicamumapaka is B-I-C-A-M-U-M-A-P-A-K-A, Niyitegeka, I believe is N-Y-I-T-I-G-E-K-A (sic); is that correct? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Now, in terms of the broad-based transitional government, which ministries, if any, were envisaged for the MDR? 
A.	Ministers or ministries?  
Q.	Ministries? 
A.	There was the ministry of external relations; ministry of information; ministry of primary and secondary education, and prime ministry. 
Q.	And in terms of the compilation of this list of ten names; did you play any role in that or not? 
A.	The only role that I played was like the role played by every member of the political bureau.  I took part in the vote that led to the creation of this list. 
Q.	And before this vote took place, were there discussions that took place as to who should be the candidates? 
A.	Yes, of course.  First, there was a discussion to determine whether the political bureau would accept the proposal by the Bishops to give a list.  The political bureau accepted, and then we decided how to draw up the list and how to vote.  This was by secret ballot.  And we also decided that we would take account of the wishes that we had taken account, that we had expressed to choose, first, three candidates to be proposed to the position of prime minister.  

So the idea was to determine the political influence of each region, and use that as a basis for making the nominations on the list. 
Q.	So, if I am to understand you, correctly, the region where individuals came from was a relevant factor: is that what you are saying? 
A.	It was a very important factor; we had to take account of it. 
Q.	Were there any other factors, important factors, which were taken into account, or which it was decided should be taken into account? 
A.	It is difficult to say that we did not take account of other factors, but we also considered that candidates should have the skills to run these ministries.  Since we have several candidates, the most important factor was that of the political influence that the person would have in the region where he would be working in relation to other parties active in the region, and also taking account of future elections. 
Q.	Now, was the question of a person's views on ethnic groups within Rwanda, was that in any way a factor in the decision-making process, as far as you know? 
A.	No, not at all.  In our party, this problem did not exist.  We did not take account of regional and ethnic origin. 
Q.	And in terms of the choice of those persons who would be on the list, to what extent, if any, did ethnic origin play a role? 
A.	No, none.  In my view, nothing. 
Q.	And to what extent, did the list incorporate both sides of the division, or did it only incorporate one side of the division? 
A.	It could not take account of that, because for others who had been expelled from the party we couldn't say that they existed any more for us.  We couldn't propose them as candidates.  The only person we agreed to work with was Faustin Twagiramungu, but the other nominations could only be taken from members of the party, not from expelled parties. 
Q.	And what was the position with regard to Faustin Twagiramungu, in terms of what role he would play in a future government? 
A.	As for Twagiramungu, the political bureau had decided to follow the recommendations of the committee that was in contact with the bishops, which was to agree to work with him as prime minister without considering him as a member of the party.  He also agreed -- had agreed to accept a list of ministers presented by the political bureau; that is members of our party. 
Q.	Now, you mentioned skills as being an important factor in the decision-making process for the compilation of this list.  Are you able to elaborate upon that? 
A.	The skills to run a ministry -- if we took someone who had no skill, he would have made mistakes and the party would have suffered from it in the elections.  So, we had to choose someone who was able to run the ministry in question. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I'm sorry.  There is an urgent matter in relation to the witness, is the reason. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, in terms of skills, are you able to comment at this stage, do you remember sufficiently to be able to comment, at this stage, with respect to the position of Dr. André Rwamakuba and his skills for the purposes of being on this list? 
A.	Of course.  It is a long time ago, but I can remember the main points.  First, for all of these candidates we often took accounts and mostly of the fact that since the party was divided, there was a need to select people who would force the dialogue.  So that from the time the government was set up, and the time elections were organised, these people would be able to gather the party together under one banner once more.  

In the case of Rwamakuba, it is that we knew that he was, obviously, a very calm man.  In the area of Kigali, he had been director of sanitation, so he knew all of Kigali préfecture.  In his commune, also, there was Anathase Gasana who also wanted to be minister on the side of Twagiramungu.  So we wanted to find someone who would make sure that the people of that commune would not feel frustrated at having lost two ministers. 
Q.	Now, Gasana and André Rwamakuba were from the same commune, correct?  I think you just said that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm this; Gikomero commune it was. 
Q.	Now, to what extent was there a pool of skills in that commune, or in Kigali-rural to the level of Gasana and André Rwamakuba?  How big was the skill pool, if I could put it that way?
A.	I don't quite understand the question. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, if we began with Gikomero commune:  Anathase Gasana and André Rwamakuba were viewed as people who were sufficiently skilled to hold positions of minister.  Were there any other people within the Gikomero commune who could be considered as being sufficiently skilled to hold a position of minister? 
A.	I don't think so, from what I remember.  I must also say that in our view Gasana even before the schism had not had enough skill to be minister.  In any case, he lacked a certain political wisdom, so that most of the members of the political bureau thought that he was not qualified.  
Q.	Well, how does André Rwamakuba stand in that position? 
A.	I recall that there was a vote based on a list, it is not I who took the decision, but the selection was based on his obvious calm manner, and also due to the fact that he had been director of the Kigali sanitary region; so he knew the entire secteur of Kigali.  So it was important for us.  

He was -- he had a close knowledge of people in all of the communes of Kigali because of his job. 
Q.	Okay, moving away from the question of the list.  Now, in terms of the running of the MDR, you have explained that, basically, I think, almost for the whole history of the party, until the Cyarwa-Sumo meeting, Mr. Twagiramungu was chairman of the party.  Who was the vice president of the party? 
A.	I must correct something:  As chairman, he did not have the reigns of the party in his hands, because it is the steering committee that ran the party.  So the vice president, vice chairman, to answer the second part of your question, there was a first vice chairman, who was Dr. Nsengiyaremye, I believe you know the spelling.  The second vice president was Karamira.  And the executive secretary was Murego, M-U-R-E-G-O, Murego.
Q.	Now, do you remember from which dates, approximately, Karamira became second vice president of the party? 
A.	He became second vice president during the first ordinary congress of the party, whose exact date I cannot remember.  But I think -- I know that it was at the end of the August, 1992. 
Q.	And when he was chosen for his post at the end of August 1992, do you remember whether the question of his ethnic views played any role in his selection or not? 
A.	The question of ethnic (unintelligible) had nothing to do with it.  If I remember the party statutes, each préfecture would propose a candidate.  Out of the two -- then the 270 or 280 members of the congress would chose from amongst the candidates, from the 11. 
Q.	And what do you think was the reason why Karamira was chosen, at that time, in 1992? 
A.	He had been very dynamic when the party was being created.  He had given his all.  I think it is mostly his dynamism that led to him being chosen. 
Q.	And you have explained that Donat Murego was the executive secretary of the party.  Do you remember on which date, approximately, he was appointed executive secretary of the MDR? 
A.	Actually, all four members of the steering committee were elected on the same dates, during the first congress of the party.  Before that date, the party was managed by six committees and each president of the committee was part of the organisation that managed the party.  All of the four members of the steering committee were elected during the congress at the end of August 1992. 
Q.	And do you know to what extent, if any, Donat Murego's ethnic views played any role, if at all, in his appointment in 1992? 
A.	In 1992, during that congress, the ethnic question was not used in relation to any of the candidates.  
Q.	Now, do you know the whereabouts of Mr. Twagiramungu at the beginning of April -- or, rather, after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	He was in Rwanda -- no, no.  He stayed in Belgium for some weeks, then he returned to Rwanda for the formation of the government in July, I believe. 
Q.	Do you know to what extent Mr. Twagiramungu was participating in the activities of the MDR after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I know after the 6th of April 1994, the MDR usually have activities, even if it was said that MDR was members of the government, but it was some members of the government.  In particular, Twagiramungu and Gasana had been excluded from the party.  The others that Twagiramungu had appointed, and contrary to what had happened before, were not presented by the political bureau, because it never met.  And yet the congress never met either.  From that time up to now, there has never been a congress of the MDR party in Rwanda.  And there have never been any elections to replace those who had left.  

So I consider that the party hasn't been operating, because a party without a congress, a party which doesn't hold a Congress, is not operating, as far as I am concerned.  
Q.	Do you know to what extent Mr. Twagiramungu was able to enter into negotiation in the days following the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I know that the time before his return to Rwanda from Brussels -- well, during that time, we contacted him to ask him to propose certain conditions to the RPF before accepting to come back and assume the post of prime minister.  But to my knowledge, much of the advice that was given to him wasn't heeded by him either. 
Q.	Do you know the whereabouts of Mr. Ngulinzira in the days following the fall of the president's plane?
A.	I know that Mr. Ngulinzira had taken refuge in the Kicukiro technical school.  And that is where people came and looked for him and killed him, subsequently.  He had tried to seek protection from UNAMIR, who had protected him some time before.  But on that day, UNAMIR refused to give him protection, even though they knew that he was under threat and that he was important, insofar as the Arusha Accords were concerned, since he had been in the negotiations from the very beginning.  
Q.	Do you know the whereabouts of Mr. Gasana in the days following the fall of the president's plane? 
A.	If my memory is correct, Gasana had gone to Tanzania with the president, and he didn't return.  So, on the day following the downing of the plane, he was outside of the country. 
Q.	And are you able to comment on the whereabouts of Mr. Twagiramungu in the months of February and March of 1994? 
A.	February, March 1994, he was in Kigali, in Rwanda, because between January and April, attempts were being made to establish the institutions decided on by the Arusha agreement.  Twagiramungu was in Kigali at that time. 
Q.	Now, during the course of this trial, we have been shown documents produced during the course of 1994, post 6th of April, with the signatures of Karamira and Murego on them.  Does that cause you any surprise that those two names would sign for the MDR, during that period? 
A.	But I also know that there were many documents that were signed by the three, including Nsengiyaremye, Karamira and Donat Murego.  At the level of the party -- when a decision was taken by the political bureau, usually it was the executive secretary who signed, accept where it had to deal with something that concerns relations between the party and the government, or the other parties.  In such cases he would sign it, sometimes as the president.  Otherwise, since the steering committee used to steer the party as a panel, what usually happened was to have the members that were present sign the document before it was made public; for instance, Karamira -- and since the party was renting a room, or a hall in a building owned by Karamira, he was usually present.  And the other person was not always available, but Karamira was always there because the prime minister of the party was in a building that was owned by Karamira, so he was always around. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O`SHEA:
Can we have the full name and spelling of Karamira, please?  
MR. O`SHEA:
Yes, it is Edouard, E-D-O-U-A-R-D. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Correct, sir? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And Karamira, K-A-R-I-M-E-R-A (sic), correct? 

MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay, perhaps the witness will correct you.  We have a bit of a misunderstanding.  I understand it is Froduald Karamira or Edouard Karemera.  Can you please confirm which you were referring to? 
THE WITNESS:
What I was going to say is, R-A-M-I-R-A (sic).   
MR. O`SHEA:
(Microphones overlapping).  There is an accused person before this Tribunal with a similar name, but quite different.  And that is not the person I am referring to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are certain the person you are referring to is Edouard?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Froduald. 
THE WITNESS:
The name is Froduald. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Froduald.  Could you spell that please?  
MR. O`SHEA:
F-R-O-D-U-R -- U-A-R-D (sic), right.   
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Do you know where Mr. Karamira is today? 
A.	I beg your pardon. 
Q.	Do you know where Mr. Karamira is today? 
A.	He was killed.  He was executed, so he is dead. 
Q.	Do you know who he was executed by? 
A.	This was after a judgement that was rendered in Rwanda; so he was condemned to death. 
Q.	Do you have any knowledge of the whereabouts of Dismas Nsengiyaremye in the days following the fall of the president's plane on the 6th of April? 
A.	At that time, he was in Rwanda.  He hid himself for a long time, up until when he was executed by, I think, by the soldiers of the Operation Turquoise, and he went to live in France.  And that is where he still lives today.  
Q.	With regard to the bishop's committee.  How many bishops were there in that committee? 
A.	I don't quite remember, but I know that there were Catholic bishops, bishops from the Baptist Church or representatives from the Baptist Church, from the Anglican (unintelligible) the churches, but I don't remember the exact number any more. 
Q.	Do you know what happened to those bishops? 
A.	I know, in particular, that amongst them were at least two Catholic bishops who were killed by the RPF at Kabgayi.  As for the others, I don't know where they are.  There is one Catholic bishop, a vicar, who is in Belgium. 
Q.	Now, when was the expression "Hutus Power" born? 
A.	I wouldn't say the expression was "born" as it were.  It was used once.  That is, it was Karamira who used the expression.  But up until when the presidential plane crashed, that term wasn't used in Rwanda.  It was only after April 1994 that the word had come back -- was used again by the media.  Otherwise, Karamira used that term just once.  And it was after President Ndadaye's death, during a march of support that was organised in Kigali, that it was used. 
Q.	Now, we are all familiar with Mr. Karamira's speech.  When he had used that term, what was your personal reaction, if any?
A.	Well, I had a personal reaction, but before talking about that reaction, allow me to speak a bit about that demonstration of support.  This took place after President Ndadaye's assassination in Burundi.  I myself -- since Karamira was a member of the steering committee and as vice president of Kigali town, I was virtually the person who managed the day-to-day political affairs in Kigali.  

I requested that we organise a demonstration at a level of Kigali town by our party.  And I wrote to the préfet asking for authorisation to organise a demonstration.  In the days that came before the demonstration, the préfet of Kigali town wrote to me and we exchanged about three letters in the same day, but he refused to allow -- to give authorisation for that demonstration.  

In the afternoon, we were preparing a fourth letter, that is at about 5 p.m., when I received an envoy of the préfet who asked me to go and see him in his office.  I went there, and he told me that he was granting authorisation to organise the demonstration, if the other parties, in particular, the MDR were to participate in demonstrations.  Now, being aware of the press release that we had prepared, I said, "Well, well and good," and I said this to myself.  But I told him that I agree but on condition that we don't make public -- a joint public release, that each party should publish its own press release.  Now, he accepted this.  

The demonstration, therefore, took place the following day, beginning from the central roundabout up Kigali, right up to Nyamirambo.  And this is what usually happened.  I was the person coordinating the demonstration -- or the march.  And so we prepared a press release that had to be read out, as was customary, and it had to be read by the president of the party in the préfecture, that is to be read by Karamira.  There was a communiqué, or a press release that was read by the president of MRND or chairman of the MRND when he was there.  

Now, when I gave the prepared press release to Karamira to read it, he said, "Since you are the ones who prepared it as a team, you'd better read it.  I am going to make a different speech in order to wrap up the event."  So I read the press release, which, in brief, said the following:  "What happened in Burundi where after the democratic elections, somebody who was elected democratically by the people, was assassinated by people who were against democracy.  This could happen in Rwanda within a party where the party takes decisions democratically, and the president refuses."  So I was saying that this could happen if, after elections, the person we selected is refused.  And this was the purport of the official press release of our party in Kigali town.

Now, Karamira took the floor and gave a long speech, and started by talking about the role of the president, or the chairman in multi-party politics.  Like he said, there were certain personalities or officials of the MDR that came out.  And at the end, he completed by saying, "MRND Power, MRND Power, Hutu Power."  

This was disastrous for us, because we didn't understand it.  Since, generally, I am the person who had to close the event, and since I was the one who was organising it, I said -- I told people to think of what our press release had said, democracy is meant for everyone.  And I even recalled that with the advent of the second republic, there were many officials or key figures that had been killed, people from the first republic of who more generally were Hutu.  

So the democracy didn't mean ethnicity.  And I recall this, after the event I was leaving some 200 -- 100 to 200 metres from the stadium, but generally when there was a political event in that stadium, people used to pass through my house to take a beer or to have a drink.  So, at that -- so we went there as usual.  And that Karamira was also there with other members of the party.  And we told him that first of all, if we are fighting against the MRND, and if he wants the MRND to have power, this would mean that they will be stronger than us.  So, we told him that we didn't quite understand what Hutu Power had to do with democracy.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, could you get the witness to speak just a trifle bit slower. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	And did you hear that comment, sir? 
A.	Yes, I have understood. 
Q.	So, I won't recap everything that you said, but just to go back to these drinks, which I think you said was at your house; did you say it was at your house? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You have explained that there was somewhat of a negative reaction towards what Mr. Karamira had said.  And if I understand you correctly, you had a difficulty with the use of MRND and MDR together.  Is that what you said? 
A.	I said that we told him that to use a slogan "MRND Power" meant that he wanted MRND to be power which means that if MRND was strong, we be beaten.  So we said the term "Hutu" and that power has nothing to do with democracy -- since I had said, at the end of the meeting, that the people of the first republic who were Hutu, in the majority, had been killed and I added that the next day there was a political bureau meeting, and we addressed the issue of the political bureau, once again. 
Q.	Now, to what extent were your views on what Mr. Karamira had said in concordance with the views of the other members of the political bureau? 
A.	In the meeting of the political bureau that was held the following day, we broached the subject.  And Karamira gave his apologies to the party. 
Q.	Now, coming onto another subject, to what extent were there political meetings or rallies in Rwanda from the MDR between September 1993 and March 1994, at a communal or secteur level? 
A.	From what I can recall, there weren't many, because after that Cyarwa-Sumo congress, there were mostly préfectural congress meetings meant to replace people that had been excluded from the party.  And then there were few meetings or rallies, in certain préfectures and sous-préfectures, organised other by Twagiramungu or by us.  And these rallies were rallies where people get explanations to the ministers of the party.  For instance, Twagiramungu wanted to make people to understand that he was the legitimate leader, whereas our political bureau wanted to say where legitimacy lay in the party.  

Generally, rallies at communal levels, before problems (unintelligible) the party, were meant to sensitise the militants or people to come and join our party.  But after Cyarwa-Sumo, initially there were internal conflicts, so the rallies were rather rallies where Twagiramungu was being attacked, and he himself was attacking us.  So, I cannot quite recall rallies that were organised at the level of communes after that period.  Now, from December 1993 -- 
Q.	Just pause there.  I just want you to pause for a moment so that the translators can catch up.  

Now continue. 
A.	I was saying that between December and March, and here I'm sure that there was no other rally or meeting that was held, because the RPF had entered Kigali in the end of December, and then from the beginning, from early January, attempts were being made to set up the institutions and to swear in the president of the republic.  And there were other -- there were three other attempts for the swearing in of parliamentarians.  

So, during that period, there was no way of organising rallies.  We were expecting the establishment of the institution and the parties had to organise themselves in order to prepare for future elections. 
Q.	Just to clarify, why -- why would you not have rallies to get supporters?  I think you have explained in broad terms, but perhaps you could clarify that.  Why would you not want to have rallies at the beginning of 1994 to get supporters for the MDR? 
A.	No, at that time in any political -- in the life of any political party, there were priorities.  And the priorities at the time were the establishment of the institutions following the Arusha Accords.  The entire population was expecting this, and there is no way that rallies could be organised to recruit supporters or members.  Even if there was criticism to be levied on anybody, there was nobody to be criticized because nothing was moving well at that time.  So we are not organising rallies that were meant to enlist members or supporters.  
Q.	Now, we have discussed the division in the MDR at some length.  Did there come a point when a political division occurred within the Parti libéral? 
A.	Yes, within the Liberal Party, as well.  One or two weeks after the Cyarwa-Sumo congress, they had a problem between the president -- or the chairman of the party, Mugenzi and one of the vice chairman, Ndasingwa Landouald, N-D-A-N-S-I-N-G-W-A, (sic) Landouald, also known as Lando. 
Q.	Now, do you know the reason for that split or division of opinion? 
A.	Yes, I know them, because I took part in the Congress organised by Lando.  I was a representative of our party in Kigali because he was accusing Mugenzi of what we were accusing Twagiramungu; that is that he was working outside of the party.  So I went to support him.  And this congress supported our position in respect of Twagiramungu.  So I took part in that congress, and I know that he often accused Mugenzi of working outside of the institutions of the parties. 
Q.	And at the beginning of your evidence, you mentioned the MRND's or Habyarimana`s wish with respect to other parties.  Do you know whether or not the MRND had any role in this division, in the PL? 
A.	I do not know whether the MRND or the president had a role to play before, but after the Congress of the PL, they took the same decisions against Lando as the ones that were taken against the political bureau of the MDR.  For example, they could no longer use the radio.  Only Mugenzi was allowed to make releases or communiqués from the Parti libéral which could be broadcast on the radio.  That was the case for us.  They said that only communiqués signed by Twagiramungu could be read out on the radio. 
Q.	Now in this division in the PL, who did you support? 
A.	As I said, I took part as a representative of my party in Kigali, in Lando's congress.  I gave a small personal contribution to this organisation of this congress, because congresses are expensive to organise. 
Q.	And my question was who did you support between Mugenzi and Lando, and who did your party support? 
A.	So, as I said, since I took part in Lando's congress, it means that we were supporting Lando.  We could not support Mugenzi, because at the time he had taken part in the plot that set up                            Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  He signed the document to set up the government, which extended government's action for one month, from July to August 1993.  So, we were against Mugenzi.  And he was actually amongst the members who convinced Agathe to say that she had not resigned. 
Q.	Do you know the ethnicity of Lando? 
A.	Yes, he was a Tutsi.  I know this because -- cause I know -- I knew Lando for a long time; we went to the same secondary school. 
MR. O`SHEA:
If you could just grant me one moment, Your Honour.  Thank you? 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Do you know what subsequently happened to Lando? 
A.	Up till April 1994, or after that?  
Q.	After that? 
A.	Yes.  He was also killed on the night of the 6th to the 7th -- or in any case between the 6th and the 8th of April he was killed. 
Q.	And do you know who killed him? 
A.	For a long time it was thought that it was people of the Presidential Guard.  But now people have written things; RPF officials who say that it was the RPF who did that.  So, we don't know what to believe right now. 
Q.	And one last question.  Where were you after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I went to Belgium on the 4th of April 1994, and I stayed there up to now. 
Q.	Thank you very much, sir.  You will receive questions from the Prosecution, but my questions are finished for now.  Those are all of my questions, Your Honour.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  I noticed that you stuck to your hour, more or less. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I tried; thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will now be examined by the Prosecutor.  And you will have to answer their questions.  
THE WITNESS:
No problem. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Nkezabera.
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	You have just testified that you left Rwanda on the 4th of April; is that correct, 1994? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So, you were absent when the interim government was put in place; is that correct? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	You were also absent when André Rwamakuba took oath of office as minister of primary and secondary education; is that correct? 
A.	That is also true. 
Q.	It is your position, as expressed during your testimony in chief, that post Habyarimana's death, the MDR was not operating as such, as you were not able to hold -- or they as you were not there, they were not able to hold congresses and the like; is that correct? 
A.	I didn't say that.  That is not quite it.  I said that there was no reason to organise a congress, first of all.  As I said, in the examination-in-chief by the Defence, I said that the next congress had been scheduled for August of 1994.  Meetings were not organised between -- because between December 1993 and April 1994, we were waiting for institutions to be set up; so there was no need to organise rallies or congresses. 
Q.	So, would it be your position then that those MDR members who were part of the interim government were acting as MDR members, or not? 
A.	What I would say is that to be part of that government they were chosen from a list that we presented to Faustin Twagiramungu to determine whether all people -- all members of that government were representatives of the party; I would say, no.  Why would I say that?  Because it was in war time.  There was no party that was able to meet to invest these ministers with their powers.  But I know that all ministers with other parties who took part in this interim government were known, in advance, to be potential ministers of the broad-based transitional government that came from the Arusha agreements. 
Q.	So, as members of the interim government of April, May, June of 1994 before they fled whose behalf were they acting on, would you say? 
A.	I do not understand the question. 
Q.	Perhaps I can give a scenario.  As an MDR political party member and a, say, for instance, minister in the interim government, would a person be furthering the interest of the MDR, or would they simply be acting on behalf of the interim government, which is apart from what the MDR stood for? 
A.	I shall perhaps emphasis what I said:  Before the institutions were set up, no political party was advertising its own actions.  In this crises government, as I would describe it, during wartime, I think everybody was trying to see that the war should stop.  So that the real institutions that came as a result of the Arusha Accords could be set up.  

The problem of the parties themselves was not a priority.  I think the priority was that the war should be ended and life should go on normally.  
Q.	So, would I be right in concluding that the interim government had its own priorities based on what you described as, "the crises of moment"; is that correct? 
A.	"Its own priorities" -- well, I don't know.  That is not what I said.  I said that the parties in terms of crises, in time of war.  And you will see this in other countries.  We saw this in the United States.  You know, before the Iraqi war started, all of the parties were behind the president.  Not even the democrats criticised the president when he went to war.  

The government that was set up was -- the government that was set up only aimed to stop the war; that was its sole purpose, so that the individual interests of parties were no longer of moment. 
Q.	I think we will have to agree to disagree on your conclusions about the American situation.  I will move on nonetheless.  So, would it be fair to conclude that you were not in Rwanda at all during the genocide? 
A.	I said that I had not been in Rwanda from the 4th of April, and that I never went back there.  
Q.	You hold a view, however, don't you that what took place between April and July of 1994, was not, in fact, a genocide, the massacres where Hutus and Tutsis were killed; is that correct? 
A.	I never said that. 
Q.	I would like to refer to your testimony in the Niyitigeka case.  Do you recall giving testimony in the Niyitigeka case? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you recall testifying that it was your aim to find the truth of what had happened in Rwanda, in April to July 1994? 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can you give a reference, please, when you are quoting?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Page 101 to 102 on the 14th -- just one moment; 14th of November 2002. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Do you recall saying this at all that you were looking for the truth of what had happened between April and July of 1994?
A.	Yes.  I think this was in response to an answer (sic) put by the Court, or the Prosecutor to the effect that I was coming to support my friend in this trial.  And I said that I hadn't come there to support a friend, and that I was seeking the truth. 
Q.	Do you hold the view that there was a genocide in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, you talk in your statement about a split into two factions in the MDR.  Could you tell us what the names, if any, were of these two factions? 
A.	There were no names.  They were people who were expelled from the party.  The people who supported them, especially the president of the republic and the RPF, continued to consider that they were members of the party; and we thought that we were the party.  If you look at the letters that were signed, you will find amongst them one signed by the steering committee, which was presented to me during the Niyitigeka trial, this was towards the end of March, signed by the MDR at -- requesting that our rights be respected by the president of the republic.  So you had on one side the MDR, and on the other side those who were expelled from the MDR. 
Q.	And how did one recognise the two factions, Mr. Nkezabera? 
A.	I continue to say there are no factions, in my view, if we were under the rule of law.  As Rwandan courts had said that Twagiramungu had lost his trials, there was only one party; as a result, there were no factions.  The other ones were expelled members of the party. 
Q.	Do you recall, prior to coming to testify here, meeting with Defence investigators or lawyers, in order to give a statement? 
A.	Yes; the current Defence counsel, yes. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court when this was, if you can recall the date? 
A.	It is a long time.  At one time I thought that I would no longer have to come and give testimony here; but I really don't remember the date any more. 
Q.	Do you remember giving a statement, making a statement, a written document? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you recall whether you signed that statement? 
A.	I am hesitant about that.  I don't know whether it was prepared and sent to me by e-mail.  But I'm hesitant as to say whether I signed it or not. 
Q.	Well, what has been served on the Prosecutor is an English document headed "Witness Statement", and it isn't signed, so perhaps you are right in that it was sent to you by e-mail.  Does that sound right, would you have seen an English document of some four pages -- five pages? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you recall saying to the person you met, the member of the Defence team that "It is correct to say, that by mid-1993, the MDR had split into two factions." And then going on to give further explanation; do you recall saying that? 
A.	If it is in English, then perhaps my thoughts expressed in French were not well translated.  It is true that the MDR split, one part stayed outside of the party, and the rest of it remained the party. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Can I, by way of information, say that we have never been spoken to in English by this witness?  So everything has been through translation. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I don't think I need dwell on that point. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	So, you are saying that it is split into two parts.  We can call them the parts of the MDR.  Can you tell me who represented these two parts after the split? 
A.	If I give figures, first there is the political bureau.  Out of the 44 members of the political bureau who were elected for their préfecture, only 8 or 9 left; so 34 or 35 were left.  So that is an overwhelming majority, I would say.  The Cyarwa-Sumo congress, I told you, had nearly 80 per cent of participants who almost agreed unanimously on the necessary votes.  So, that was the party.  The other people were expelled. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say that the person associated with those who remained would have been Jean Kambanda or Froduald Karamira? 
A.	I didn't quite understand the question. 
Q.	After the split, you say some of those people were expelled.  Eight, for instance, out of the 44, I believe or something like that, members of the political bureau; of those who remained, who would you refer to as the leader or the prominent figure in that part of the MDR that remained, to avoid using the word "faction"? 
A.	The point man, as indicated in the conclusions of the Cyarwa-Sumo congress, was first the steering committee, which was running matters pending the new congress.  And this steering committee was run by the first vice president, Dismas Nsengiyaremye. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the position of Froduald Karamira was? 
A.	The position in regard to?  
Q.	In the MDR party? 
A.	He was the second vice-president, or vice-chairman. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the position of Jean Kambanda was? 
A.	Kambanda was chairman of the party for Butare préfecture. 
Q.	And this is the same group of people -- the same part of the party which you belonged to; is that correct? 
A.	Well, I didn't say -- it is not a faction; it was the party.  Each party can impose sanctions; some are expelled, some others stay.  They had not yet been expelled.  They are still in the party.  I don't know why they are set aside in relation to the other 35 who remained, and in relation to the other 260 who were in the national congress. 
Q.	And those who were expelled, did they retire from politics, Mr. Nkezabera? 
A.	Is there anyone who does politics in Rwanda these days?  The RPF has taken over everything.  Well, the other ones, either they shut up or they get killed. 
Q.	I'm referring to July 1993, after they were expelled did they continue to practise politics or not? 
A.	Well, they went on with the blessing of the president to weaken us, because Twagiramungu became prime minister.  Agathe remained prime minister.  So they made sure that there was the split. 
Q.	So, there was a split?  A simple yes or no will suffice; if you can't answer yes or no, please let me know.
A.	No. 
Q.	There was no split, yet a few lines ago you just said, "They made sure there was a split," unless, of course, there is a translation problem.
A.	I said there was no split, because the party remained strong, with a strong majority. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Can I just -- the French translation which is coming through is "eclatement".  That might assist you, Counsel, in understanding what is happening here. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Perhaps the English translators can help with the translation of "eclatement". 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Eclatement", I believe it is a split, a schism, any of those. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Q.	Now, Agathe and Faustin Twagiramungu, who had been expelled, but yet were still practising politics, did they now align themselves with the MRND, or did they still maintain that they were MDR members? 
A.	If the congress expelled them, then they are expelled.  They went on to say with the support of the MRND, that they were members of the party, but they had been expelled.  So the court supported that.  I would add something.  The candidacy of Twagiramungu that would have put him in the BBTG, the broad-based transitional government, where in relation to that, there is a letter signed by 34 members of the political bureau, which suggested some people.  Twagiramungu wrote a letter where he said, "Mr. President, I have met people of the MDR who told me that I was supposed to be candidate."  The president accepted, and that is how politics is.  Somebody says, "I met some people."  Who are these people?  There was a party.  He wasn't in it. 
Q.	Did Twagiramungu have supporters from amongst the Rwanda population? 
A.	As long as there were no elections, I would say that support could be evaluated on the voting processes that took place.  If there was a congress which brought together two people from the commune all over the country, and that 80 percent of these people expelled him; he didn't have any support, because these people were representing their communes. 
Q.	Are you speaking in theory, or are you speaking in practice?  Did he have support from amongst the Rwanda population; yes or no? 
A.	At that time, no. 
Q.	And Agathe, did she have any support from amongst the Rwanda population? 
A.	No.  If the congress in Butare elected somebody in her place, then she wasn't supported. 
Q.	So, it is your position that not a single person followed Faustin Twagiramungu and Agathe when they left the MDR, when they were expelled from the MDR; is that correct? 
A.	That is not what I said, sister.   I said that at the level of the political bureau, there were persons who were excluded.  And there were even people who had accepted to be ministers, or members of the cabinets of those people.  So there were people that followed them, but as far as I am concerned, it was a minority that I think were less then 15 percent of the MDR membership. 
Q.	Aside from those of the political bureau that followed them, were there ordinary MDR members who followed them? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  So, to reiterate my point, they did have some support, whether you agree with it or not.  I think it is a convent moment, Your Honour, if you would like to take the break now? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 

MR. HOOPER: 
I would like to indicate that Witness 1/5 is, contrary to our belief and expectation, not present, just to indicate that difficulty.  That is the next witness on the list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John, how much more time do you have?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
	I would like to say about 45 minutes, 30 to 45 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Wouldn't that be enough time for the witness to be brought, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
No, he is a long way away.  He is not in the country. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, who is going to be the next witness?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, in fact, I indicated in an e-mail on Friday night that there was concern as to what the precise position was with this witness.  And I wasn't able, in fact, to clarify it until shortly ago in court, in fact, that we have made allowance for calling a further -- another witness.  And we have another witness after that witness.  I just hope -- and we have a witness at 2 o'clock, fixed, as it were, for tomorrow afternoon.  So, we think that would be sufficient to occupy the Chamber today and tomorrow.

We were going to be pushed if, in fact, 1/5 had been here:  But we expected him to be here.  And his not being here may lead to a slight gap, but anyway, we can sort this out as we go along.  I have --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but, you see, it is important that the Prosecutor knows who the next witness is -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, we let them know that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I expect that will be discussed during our break. 
MR. HOOPER: 
They know that.  We sent an e-mail on Friday night indicating what the position was, and what the contingency position was.  And that e-mail was sent as soon as I knew the difficulty, which was half past 6 on Friday; but I see Ms. Fall may disagree. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I believe that we have a serious problem with the Defence counsel concerning the appearance of witnesses.  The mail that was sent on Friday, well, unfortunately, I only read it this morning since it was sent on Friday.  And I think I had two mails, I have them before me.  I have one on Friday, at 6:08 p.m.; and another at 10:10.  And in the mail of 6:08 p.m. we're only briefed about Professor Mercenier who had to be there.  And in the second mail, we -- it was indicated to us, still again about Dr. Mercenier, we were talking about Marie-Ange and (By order of the Court this name has been extracted and filed under seal) but at no moment -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Please, we are in an open session.  Could that be redacted, the last name? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, order for redaction. 
	
Ms. Fall, I have a copy of the e-mail before me. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  And I am sorry for having read out that name, but I was rather surprised by certain attitudes that made me forget to exercise discretion.  So, I know that even 1/5 -- since you have a copy of the mail, 1/5 was not even on that list.  This morning when I got to the office, my colleague gave me another list, a new list of witnesses where we were being told that, indeed, the one that was expected, that is 5/13, was expected to appear here this morning; and would be followed by another witness and that is -- and, please, give me a moment -- would be followed by 9/17.  And today, and a short while ago, Counsel Hooper, once again, is changing the scheduling order of appearance of witnesses.  

So, Mr. President, with all of the goodwill that we have, in order to avoid wasting time, and given all we have done to give the best of ourselves in order to meet the expectations of the Chamber, it is impossible for us to continue under these conditions.  And this is not the first time that I am mentioning this before the Chamber.  On several occasions, I have said, and this, for the record, I have requested that this attitude of the Defence should be ended.

Mr. President, we have 15 witnesses, whose names were there for a long time.  And there is also 9/17 with whom there is no problem, they are present here.  And I don't see why they cannot appear before the Chamber.  So, once again, and I would like to repeat this for the record, we would like to be very conciliatory.  We would like to be in a position to assist the Chamber in order to expedite the proceedings.  But we also have the duty to prepare our cross-examination well.  And under these conditions, and I am saying this once again, it is virtually impossible for us to do.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  I think this would be the last time that we would have to address this matter, because we need a list of -- a list of witnesses, as they would appear; and a list that we can depend on.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, are you calling 9/17 after this witness?  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, 5/13. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long is that witness?  
MR. HOOPER: 
An hour and a half in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was the Prosecutor notified of that?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Of the timing or about -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Both. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I didn't about the timing.  As far as I know, the e-mail that was sent is the same as the document I'm holding.  What happened on Friday, I mean, we were in the safe house on Friday afternoon.  We came back -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper - 
MR. HOOPER:
	This document was produced --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, that is not important at this stage; I want to try to move forward.  I just want to make certain that the next witness, adequate notice has been given to the Prosecutor. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I believe it, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, are you ready for 5/13? 
MR. FALL:
Mr. President, if 5/13 is 9/17, because on our list we have 9/17.  And on the sheet of paper that          Mr. Hooper gave me on Friday, it is 9/17 that is written therein.  I think there is another problem, because we have just received this morning what would appear to be what is referred to as 8/6 by the Defence, and who gave a statement of three pages, but which we haven't been able to examine.  

Under these conditions, I would say this; again, it would be difficult for us to deal with that witness today.  No matter our goodwill, we won't be able to do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, what I suggest, we are going to take our break now; could you work this out with the Prosecutor during the recess?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, yes, but you know throughout the Prosecution case, we had to play three to four witnesses ahead, as a matter of routine.  I think that could, at least, be expected of the Prosecution.  As far as 5 - 1/5 is concerned, he is not here.  We hoped and thought he would be, but he's not and that is all I can say about that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
With respect to the other two, the reason that was put back, was because I saw her Saturday at the safe house and as a consequence of that have provided the Prosecution with a two or three-page statement; and so I put, brought 5/13 ahead of her, for the convenience of the Prosecution.  

And the other final comment I make is this in this organisation, and in the difficulties we face, to leave your e-mail from Friday night to Monday morning suggests, perhaps, little is amiss. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, what I -- Ms. Fall, please.  Ms. Fall, we are spending too much time discussing administrative matters when we should be taking evidence.  We are going to rise now for a morning recess.  Please resolve this during the break. 
(Court recessed at 1043H)
(Pages 1 to 22 by Donna M. Lewis)















(Court resumed at 1115H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now resume.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like to go back to the issue of the MDR camp, or part of the MDR that remained after the split.  It comprised of, you told us, Dismas Nsengiyaremye, a Hutu; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Froduald Karamira, also a Hutu?
A.	After his death it was discovered that he was a Tutsi.
Q.	During his life, however, you thought he was Hutu?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Jean Kambanda, he was also a Hutu, wasn't he?
A.	Yes.
Q.	André Rwamakuba, a Hutu?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Donat Murego, also a Hutu?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And yourself.  Can you tell us what ethnicity you are?
A.	I am a Hutu.
Q.	Is it not true that Karamira's camp or part of the MDR opposed the Arusha Accords?
A.	First, there was no camp Karamira faction; there was the MDR.  We were not opposed to the Arusha Accords, whereas Dr. Nsengiyaremye, who was the Prime Minister during the negotiations, and Ngulinzira, Boniface, the Minister of Foreign Relations, were with us.  We weren't opposed to the Accords.
Q.	It is our position that you were opposed to the Accords, because you felt that the Arusha Accords did not address the fundamental issue of the conflict between the ethnic groups.  Now, if I can move on, when Karamira pronounced the words "Hutu Power", he didn't simply say "Hutu Power" and leave it at that, did he?
A.	I do not agree when you say that we did not support the Arusha Accords; I cannot accept that.  Whereas we have showed to the very end that we supported them and our ministers negotiated most of the Accords but for one or two points.  When Karamira said "Hutu Power", he was criticised several times, and that was his problem.  If he made a mistake, it wasn't the entire party that made a mistake.  It was he alone who did.
Q.	My question was, and I'll repeat it again, in the hope of getting a straight answer:  when he said "Hutu Power", he did not simply say "Hutu Power" and leave it at that, did he?
A.	No.  He said "MRND Power, MDR Power, Hutu Power", and we sanctioned him for saying "MRND Power" and "Hutu Power".  We didn't accept that.
Q.	He also said that all Hutus should unite and take appropriate action, did he not?
A.	I do not remember that.  In any case, it's been ten years.  We were mostly revolted by this term "Hutu Power".  We listened to the whole speech, but we criticised him the most for using that term.  That was not our goal.
Q.	You are aware, however, that the speech was recorded and broadcast on Radio Rwanda, I believe it was, are you not?
A.	Yes, we know that, but it was not difficult -- it was not fully broadcast.
Q.	Will you take my word for it when I tell you that he pronounced the words that Hutus should unite and take appropriate action?
A.	Well, if you have the speech, then perhaps he said that, but believe me I said that at the closing there were Hutus who were against each other during the second republic.  Democracy is not about ethnic belonging.  I am the one who closed the meeting, and that was not the focus of it.
Q.	He also said that you were not simply there to talk, but to take action.  He reminded Hutus of the 1969 revolution, did he not?
A.	I don't remember.  I am telling you what I remember of that march.  It is those three expressions that he used.  The rest of the speech I don't remember, but I said that we -- the next day in the political bureau meeting we criticised him for that.  I don't know what else I might add.
Q.	My question to you is, if I told you I had the speech before me, would you take my word for it that he said these things?
A.	I would believe you, but you believe me that I spoke out against this in this meeting.  What is bad is that those who used this for propaganda later on never mentioned my communiqué, which compared what was happening in Burundi to what was happening in Rwanda where democracy was denied.  The real communiqué was never mentioned.  They only mentioned one highlighting the fact that someone made a mistake.
Q.	So we only have your word with regards your communiqué, is that correct, as it was not broadcast anywhere?
A.	Yes.  But I think it would be found in the records of the national radio station.
Q.	I wish you had brought it with you.  Now, it is true, also, that he linked the MDR with the MRND, your one-time rival, with the word "power", did he not?
A.	No.  What I remember is that he used the slogan "MDR Power, MRND Power, Hutu Power".  First, we said we couldn't agree that the MRND Power should not be talked about (sic), because this is what was trying to split our party.  So if he was going to be -- support the MRND, he was forgetting that we were born to fight the MRND.  I shall not return to the matter of Hutu Power, because I have explained this at length.  We criticised him for that and he apologised.
Q.	So you felt at the time that he was supporting MRND, did you?
A.	I don't say that he was supporting it.  These are people who like to talk at rallies without preparing notes.  You know, with the excitement, the crowd, they make mistakes.  It happens often, so he made a mistake.  That's it.
Q.	Indeed.  Do you also recall that this meeting at Nyamirambo was held shortly after Ndadaye's death, the first Hutu president of Burundi, killed by Tutsi rebels?
A.	I remember, because I said that I am the one who asked for the authorisation to organise this rally.
Q.	Do you remember that, alluding to this, Karamira talked about this assassination, stating that Hutu -- not Rwandans, that Hutu should come to the rescue of their brothers in Burundi; do you remember that?
A.	Madam, all Karamira said that was wrong we criticised him for it.  I tell you under oath that I said something to correct that, that the official communiqué of my party compared what was happening in Burundi with what was happening.  We said that a democratically-elected president had been killed in the country, and our party has appointed a prime minister through its congress.  The president has refused it.  We said, "This is our chance to organise elections and, people, it is not working."  

This is what I said.  I'm telling you what I said under oath, unless you're saying that the oath means nothing.  So, in regard to Karamira, I said that what he said was criticised and he apologised.
Q.	Was Karamira expelled after this speech?
A.	He was not expelled, but he was sanctioned.  You know, at the time, with the problems with Twagiramungu, we had to be careful not to criticise too much, because it might weaken the party.
Q.	Indeed, you'd have to be careful not to criticise, especially someone who shared the same views as you.  Was a public apology made by Karamira?
A.	He apologised to the political bureau, and the transcripts or the report of the political bureau meeting were spread out or distributed to the préfectural offices.  So all the party members of the party, all the party members had knowledge of this apology that was presented during the meeting.
Q.	This document which we have no knowledge of, is this something that you would have in your possession, Mr. Nkezabera?
A.	Madam, I don't have any document, because I left two days before the attack on the president's aircraft.  I had to return two days after in the hope of taking the oath because I had been appointed a deputy in the transitional assembly.  I didn't return, so I didn't leave with any document.
Q.	So, once again, we simply have your word for the existence of this document.  

Did the MDR attempt to correct the population who were excited by Karamira's words in October 1993?
A.	The first correction we did is what I've told you about.  Before we closed the meeting I recalled that democracy is not based on tribal affiliation; the president has not been elected only because he's Hutu.  I said that democracy had been denied us, and I said that Hutus of the first republic had been killed by a majority Hutu regime.  So ethnic origin was not democracy.  That was in public.
Q.	Why do you suppose that none of this was documented or broadcast, unlike Karamira's speech?
A.	Because after '94 -- after April 1994 the entire campaign was geared to show that all those who were not Twagiramungu -- with Twagiramungu, who said that he was a moderate Hutu, were extremists.  Twagiramungu said that -- you know, afterwards he said we were the Hutus who were there who were working.  I was not doing anything else.  No, he was not talking about moderate Hutus; he was talking about Hutus who were there, who were working.
Q.	Can you please clarify for us, what do you mean by "Hutus who were there, who were working"?
A.	This is not how I said it.  This is Twagiramungu.  These are the people who agreed to work with the RPF without the agreement of the party.  There was he and then there was part of his team and they couldn't continue.  He didn't last one year.  He had to flee.  Other people stayed, but they were imprisoned or removed afterwards.  They were called the Hutus who were there to work, because Kagame used them for his own ends.
Q.	And Twagiramungu thought of himself as a moderate, did he?
A.	No.  He found a word to show that he was moderate to display why he was there, and he said that others were extremists, but then he changed his mind.  He no longer said that he was moderate; he said he was a Hutu who was present, who was in service.
Q.	And the others who were extremists, would he be referring to your camp?
A.	When he talked about moderate Hutus, and the others -- and referred to the others as extremists, the extremists were the rest of the MDR.  He just wanted to show that he was a good person, whereas he had not respected the statutes of the party.
Q.	Can you remind us of the position that Jean Kambanda held in the MDR party in 1993?
A.	Kambanda was chairman of the MDR for Butare.
Q.	And he was later appointed Prime Minister in the interim government; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  This was the candidate put forward by the party.
Q.	So having put him forward as a candidate, would it be fair to say that he's someone who was involved enough in the MDR and had first-hand knowledge as to how the party functioned?
A.	Yes, he was a member of the congress and member of the political bureau.
Q.	So when he talks about the fact that the MDR had a power wing which practised extremist ideology to which you, the likes of André Rwamakuba, Froduald Karamira belonged, it would be logical to assume that he knows what he was talking about, would it not?
A.	Why should I believe Kambanda and not what I am saying (sic)?  If he says that the MDR are extremists, this should be in documents, because documents document the meetings of congress and the political bureau.  We have always referred to the documents that we, as the MDR, wrote in March 1993.  He is saying what he's saying.  That's his problem.  I'm saying what I believe.  I am in a better position to know what happened in this party, because it was born in my house.
MR. O'SHEA:
Can I just ask a question of clarification from counsel?  Are you looking at a particular document when you used the phrase "André Rwamakuba and the like"?  Were you quoting from a document? 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
No.  My question was that he stated that the MDR had a power wing which practised an extremist ideology.  The issue of -- to which he, Nkezabera, Rwamakuba and Co., belonged to is our position.  It is not Kambanda's position, but it is his position there was a power wing which practised an extremist ideology.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	So you were in a better position to know how the MDR ran than Jean Kambanda because the party was born in your living room; is that what you said -- in your home?
A.	I know the party better than he does and, since I am free, then I can make more statements than he who is in prison -- more freely.  I can speak more freely, I mean.
Q.	Can you speak more freely than André Rwamakuba?
A.	I suppose.  I have no restraint.  I have no restraint.  I can tell the truth now, because history is showing us what's going on.
Q.	Yet if you were accused of being associated with an extremist part of the party, wouldn't that suffice to be a motive for you to not tell the truth?
A.	Nobody's accusing me.  They say that there was an extremist party.  A document has been shown to that effect, but nobody has said that I personally -- I am an extremist.  Those who said they were moderate and then said they were Hutus in service, well, you see, that's how it went.  You must understand.
Q.	It is your position that, as there was no document indicating that there was such a wing as MDR Power, aside from Karamira, the vice-president's speech, that therefore no such thing existed.  Are there documents indicating that a genocide was to be committed between April and July 1994?
A.	To my knowledge, no.
Q.	Did a genocide take place?
A.	Of course.
Q.	Now, how would you describe the Interahamwe, the MRND militia wing?
A.	You need a bit of history with that.  In September 1992 --
Q.	I don't mean to interrupt you.  I don't require a history, just a simple -- would you refer to them as an extremist organisation involved in criminal acts, or not?
A.	If I don't give that explanation, this historical explanation, which is brief, you will not understand my answer.
Q.	Go ahead.
A.	Well, in 1992, inside my party, when we saw young people going around town, we tried to gather them in an association, which was JDR.  We thought that if we helped them to create cooperatives according to their vocations, it would help to mobilise membership for our party.  We organised a meeting on the 25th of September 1992.  This was the only party youth (sic) in Rwanda which had statutes, which were filed with the competent ministry.  
When they marched, it was a huge crowd.  And then the MRND said, "I must do this too," and set up the Interahamwe.  Now it is thought that the Interahamwe were an anti-Tutsi militia, but they were actually an anti-MDR militia.  I had a leg broken, a fractured foot because of them.  

In my house I had -- apart from the fence, I had barbed wire to make sure that grenades would not be thrown in and that they would not get in.  I did that against the Interahamwe.  When I was in Kigali, I was always going to court with young members of the MRND whose homes had been destroyed by MRND militias.  So they were not only ethnic extremists; they were extremists against democracy.
Q.	So would it be fair to say that the operative word is "not only"; they were not only extremists against Tutsis but they were also extremists against political parties?
A.	They were extremists towards everyone who was against Habyarimana.
Q.	Did this involve the Tutsi population?
A.	The Tutsi population in the other parties, the Tutsis in the MRND were not in danger from the Interahamwe.
Q.	Are you aware of a document entitled "Interahamwe za Muvoma" written in 1992 by Anastase Gasana, "Attempts to root out evil," where he describes the objectives of this organisation as, amongst others, "to carry out criminal acts and terrorise the population"?
A.	I don't know the exact title of the document, but I'm aware of a document that was published by Anastase Gasana on the Interahamwe that he knew very well, since he was the one who had created them while he was chairman of the political commission in MRND.  So it was Gasana; he was a member of three parties at the same time in the same year -- MRND, MDR, and he was a member of the RPF in 1992.
MR. O'SHEA:
Can I -- I've been corrected, I'm sorry.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I didn't hear the intervention, I'm afraid.  I guess it was resolved.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	So what was the MDR position towards the Interahamwe in 1993?
A.	We were in permanent conflict, virtually.  Many press releases were released denouncing our actions, and they refused us in Kigali from participating in the security missions, because each time there were people who were attacked by Interahamwe.  So our position was that of a constant fight.  I can tell you that every two weeks I was in the prosecutor's office with people who had been attacked by Interahamwes.
Q.	Yet by October 1993 Karamira, who depicted Gasana as an traitor, associating his wife with the Inkotanyi, Karamira who you associated yourself with within the MDR, pronounced the words "Interahamwe Power" in the same breath as "MDR Power"; isn't that correct? 

MR. O'SHEA:
Can I ask --
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
The interpreters would like me to repeat it.
MR. O'SHEA:
Also, can I just ask, are you referring back to the Karamira speech now, or are you referring to another document?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
No, I'm referring to October 1993, the Karamira speech.
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, I have no recollection of Interahamwe Power there.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Would you like to refer to your document, or would you like me to find my document?
MR. O'SHEA:
We will come back to that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would also help us.  Do you have -- if you have a reference, it would help us.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I do.  Just a second.  

I will -- perhaps to save time, I can keep looking for it and come back to it before I end the examination.  That would make it easier, or would you like me to look for it now?  It might just take a couple of seconds.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not pressing you one way or the other.  If at some stage we have to evaluate, we would like to know -- have the reference, otherwise we can't check what you're saying.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
No problem, I'll give you the reference.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	The words used were "MDR Power, Interahamwe Power" to the chants of the population "Power, power, power"; do you recall that?
A.	I have said that I remember the term "MDR Power, Interahamwe or Hutu Power", but for the others I think I will be surprised to learn that he even added "Interahamwe Power".  I would also say that what I'm surprised about -- what surprised me in all of this is that I had a prepared speech that was written.  That speech no longer exists.  And then he's the one who gave a speech off the cuff, and then he's the one who has been written about.

MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry, Counsel, Mr. President, I don't have this speech here.  I didn't know it was going to be referred to in the cross-examination.  No criticism there, except to say that it would have been helpful had I been told that it was going to be referred to, because I could have gone and got it.  We're a little shorthanded here.  I'm just wondering --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where do you have it? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, we have it in the office, but only Mr. Hooper or myself knows where it is.  I'm just wondering if the Prosecution might have a spare copy of it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which speech is this?
MR. O'SHEA:
This is the speech of Froduald Karamira on October 1993.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
For clarity of the record, and for the Judges, I can submit a hard copy, but obviously that would have to be done after the break.  But suffice to say, you did refer to Hutu Power and spent quite a bit of time on it during your examination-in-chief.
MR. O'SHEA:
No dispute on that.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
No, no doubt.  As it was born or linked to the Karamira speech, it was logical that I would be referring to it.  But I can certainly get you a copy, or if we would like to break, and then I'll get a copy.  Whatever is convenient for the Chamber.
MR. O'SHEA:
If you could provide us with a copy before re-examination, and also tell us if there are any other documents that you intend to refer to now, then we can go and get them.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
No, there are no other documents that I intend to refer to, and I'll do my best to see if a copy can be provided for you.
MR. HOOPER:
Can you give us a list of documents you're going to refer to, and we can adjourn for a few minutes and go to our files and get them, please?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I believe I've just been asked that question by Mr. O'Shea, and I've just indicated that there are no other documents apart from this one.

MR. HOOPER:
We can carry on and make do without it.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, unfortunately you don't have the document before you.  I don't know if it helps the Chamber.  The reference is K0245610.  I don't know if you have it on your laptops. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, can you be a little slower when you are reading out numbers for the interpreters.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, this raises a point.  You're saying this document has already been admitted in evidence. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
It was referred to by Alison Des Forges.  I believe it's already been admitted in evidence.  I need to confirm the number, but it's in the contents of Madame Des Forge's examination.  The document was actually used and quoted from by her, so I would imagine that it would have been admitted as a result.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, I believe it was.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I apologise for not having the reference.  Alternatively, I can show the copy I have on the laptop to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's go forward.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Let's move forward.  Okay.  We should be able to get you a copy of that.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were saying that you do not recall him saying "Interahamwe Power".  Once again, would you be confident in trusting me if I say that, looking at the speech in front of me, that the words "Interahamwe Power" are in fact pronounced by him?
A.	I may believe you, but I will repeat what I said, that I am surprised that we will find a document that is written as a result of a speech that wasn't prepared and written, whereas speeches that were written and are documented are not mentioned.
MR. O'SHEA:
As a matter of fairness, if you are going to say to the witness, "Will you believe me when I tell you," I think at that point you've got to put the document in front of him.  So if you just avoid saying "if you believe me", then we can move on without it.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I would have thought the witness would be free to say "Yes" or "No".   I have the document and I can produce the document.

MR. PRESIDENT:
It is not really fair, because how can the witness say Counsel is not telling the truth?  If you have --
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
They do it all the time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you have the document, you should show it to him.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Certainly.  I think that would perhaps resolve the matter.  If Mr. Issa can help me and I can show him the electronic version that I have here.
MR. O'SHEA:
In fact, we've found a hard copy.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay.  Great.  I think they are going to give you a copy.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, there is a level at which a lot of this doesn't justify the time being spent on it, because if the speech is put in evidence, it is not his speech.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If it's a matter of evidence, we're going to look at it in any event.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I completely agree with you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it doesn't require so much time.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I don't wish to spend so much time, but as the issue, Your Honour, is this is not what was said, there is a dispute, that is the reason why we're showing the document.  Okay. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	I think perhaps if we can go to the last page, the end of the speech.  Mr. Witness, can you see where it states "Interahamwe Power"?
A.	Yes, I can see it.
Q.	Can you read the words immediately preceding "Interahamwe Power" -- sorry, before "Power, power, power," can you read the words of Karamira immediately preceding "Interahamwe Power"?
A.	"MDR Power".
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you talk about a meeting held at Kabusunzu on the 23rd of July.  Do you remember telling us and the Court about that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you also told us that you came back the following day in order to adopt the certain decisions.  That would be the 24th; is that correct?
A.	Probably.
Q.	And on this first occasion, on the 23rd, is when Agathe left the MDR; is that correct?  She resigned, I believe.  
A.	No, she wrote nothing to resign from her position of the Prime Minister so she had to be reabsorbed into the MDR, since there was a suspension that was being carried out by the political bureau.
Q.	Did she remain at the meeting throughout on the 23rd?
A.	Yes.  The better part of the meeting was devoted to her case, because she came to explain things, and there was a session where she had to admit Butare congressistes and she was there up to -- and this lasted quite some time.  I think it ended about 2 a.m. in the morning.
Q.	So at no point did she leave the congress on the 23rd?
A.	To my knowledge, no.
Q.	And the following day, when you came back, was she present?
A.	No.
Q.	Was this the day that she was expelled from the party?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So perhaps I misunderstand or misunderstood your examination-in-chief.  At what point then did people go and try and convince her to come back to the congress?  When was this?
A.	No, they didn't try to convince her to come back to the congress.  What happened is that the political bureau had decided to expel her, along with others.  And to provisionally expel them, the congress had to meet very quickly in order to agree or not on a decision.  And that is according to the statutory rules and regulations.  And she was the one who had to come and defend herself.  She came, made her defence for a long time, and then there was a request for a suspension so that she could discuss with congress members of her préfecture.  

It was then that she said she understood the reasons of the party and accepted that she was going to resign from her position of Prime Minister.  And then we said, since she was going to resign from that position, and that since that is the reason wherefore she was expelled from the party, she was going to be reabsorbed into the party.  

So she requested that we suspend for some time, but then we are the ones who went out, but the congress members from Butare remained with her and it was when we returned, we came back to the plenary session, that it was announced that Agathe Uwilingiyimana said she was going to resign and she tendered a letter that was typed, so she had to resign from the position of Prime Minister and not from the party.
Q.	Can you tell us when this was?
A.	That was on the first day of the congress and I've told you that we left the congress at about 2 a.m. in order to continue and to resume the following day at 10 a.m.
Q.	So when you came back and received her letter, was she still there?  I'm a little confused.  Was she there when you came back?  You had convened, went off, came back.  At that point she submitted the resignation letter, did she remain there at this point, at the congress?
A.	I think we don't understand each other.  She didn't have to give us a letter.  This is a letter that she had written to the president of the republic in order to resign as Prime Minister.  In the morning it was announced that she hadn't resigned, and that we had forced her to write the letter, so her resignation was no longer something topical for us.  

The congress therefore had to carry on and to confirm or not the sanctions that were meted out to the other expert members.  So now she was in the same situation as the others, since she had refused to confirm her resignation.
Q.	And the "others" that you refer to, who are they?
A.	At that time it was mostly ministers, those who were ministers in the Agathe cabinet.  There was Gasana of course; Mbonimpa - M-B-O-N-I-M-P-A; there was Rucogoza -- R-U-C-O-G-O-Z-A.  Those were the main ones.
Q.	And were they all present at the congress on the next day when you started again, when you continued the meeting?
A.	No, they had even refused -- as I said, especially Twagiramungu had sent them letters -- or registered letters, but they refused to come and take part at the congress, or to attend the congress.
Q.	So on the first day, they all participated, did they?
A.	No, they refused to attend the congress.  Only Agathe Uwilingiyimana came right from the first day.
Q.	But Agathe was also absent on the second day; is that correct?
A.	But he (sic) had made his defence.  He (sic) had accepted the advice of the congress of his préfecture.  He (sic) resigned in front of the national congress, and the next day she announced that all that was done the previous day was null and void.
Q.	And it was on this next day that you expelled her from the party; is that correct?
A.	Actually, she had already been provisionally expelled by the political bureau.  It was the next day that the congress confirmed their decision that had been adopted by the political bureau.
Q.	You referred to a list in your examination-in-chief comprising of 10 names that were put forward by the political bureau for the ministries that were allocated to the MDR.  Do you recall this?
A.	Political bureau?
Q.	Perhaps it was my misunderstanding again.  You referred to a list comprising of 10 names that was submitted to Twagiramungu -- I thought by the MDR political bureau.  Perhaps not.  Do you recall talking about a list of ten names?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	Can you tell us who it was submitted by?  Who composed this list of ten names?
A.	The political bureau met, candidates were proposed, a vote was conducted in writing.  The ten names were the result of the steering committee, of which I only sent this list to Twagiramungu.
Q.	Can you tell us when this list was sent to Twagiramungu?
A.	Really, I couldn't tell you; I don't know.  I don't know exactly.
Q.	Was it after the split or after some people left the MDR, or were expelled from the MDR?
A.	Yes ...
(Proceedings interrupted while sound problem rectified)
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Thank you.  I don't know if you recall what your answer was.  The question was in relation to when the list of ten names was drawn up, and you had said it was certainly after certain members had been expelled.  Do you recall what you were telling us?
A.	Yes, about that list I remember all I said.  What I did not say, which I can say now, is that in my view this list was drawn up either between mid February and mid March 1994.  And I can say why, if you wish to hear it.
Q.	That's okay.  I just wanted to know the date.  So this was after moderates like Agathe had been expelled from the party.  It was also during a period when André Rwamakuba was absent from Rwanda; is that correct?
A.	I do not accept the term "moderate".  These are the people who were wrong in terms of party doctrine.  They were not moderates, because you are going to call us ethnocentric or regionalistic.  This list was drawn up because Twagiramungu did not want to accept that the party should give (sic) its ministers.  He wanted to use his own ministers.  After the meeting with the committee of bishops he accepted that the political bureau should appoint the ministers.  

Another requirement was that the other parties -- actually, the other parties gave a name for each minister, for the ministries they had received from Arusha.  But instead of giving three names, he wanted to have a list of ten from which he would select the three.  We accepted.  

I do not accept the term "moderate", but the list was done in February or March -- mid February and mid March I think I would say -- between mid February and mid March.  People returned -- many people returned.  If Rwamakuba returned or whether -- even if he were not there, we knew that he was a member of the party and he had influence in Gasana's commune and it was important to us that this commune goes on to have a minister.
Q.	Was Gasana ever in competition for the post that Rwamakuba's name was put forward for?
A.	No.  Gasana, to say that he was in competition, that's not true.  He was represented by Twagiramungu in terms of ministry, so this commune had a ministry and suddenly, if someone had been brought in from somewhere else, there would have been much frustration amongst our party members in the commune, which is why we looked for someone in the commune to replace the person that Twagiramungu had designated.
Q.	You alluded to the importance of the geographical area from where the candidates came from.  Other than André Rwamakuba, there were some 20 MDR candidates from Kigali-Rural, were there not?
A.	No.  How could there have been 20 others when there were ten ministers as candidates?  How could we have 20 more?
Q.	Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.  Were there other MDR politicians from Kigali-Rural, or not?
A.	Surely, because Kigali-Rural had 12 or 13 communes there were other influential persons, certainly.
Q.	You also talked about the importance of the skills of the candidate that you put forward, yet the only skill you refer to as Rwamakuba having is his sense of calm nature, I believe, and his knowledge of Kigali-Rural; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I said that.
Q.	And were the names attached to the different ministries, or were they just placed randomly?
A.	As I explained, for the other parties, they had the right to appoint the person for a ministry, but for us Twagiramungu had refused that we should give three names, and he refused that we should not attach people to positions.  He wanted a list of ten people from which he would choose three and appoint them to the ministries that he wanted.
Q.	And can you remind us of these ministries?  One, of course, was primary and secondary education; is that correct?
A.	Foreign affairs, and information.
Q.	So the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Information.  And Rwamakuba, former Director of Sanitation for Kigali-Rural was an ideal candidate for which of these ministries, would you say?
A.	I said nothing of the sort.  He -- well, before there were three candidates who were appointed to each ministry.  After the meeting with the bishops and Twagiramungu, he agreed that we should have candidates -- ten of them.  It is he who would then appoint them to the ministries.  He would take three and then appoint them to the various ministries.
Q.	And from Kigali-Rural were there any other candidates on that list, other than André Rwamakuba?
A.	I don't remember.  Since there were 11 préfectures that we were trying to distribute, some préfectures had two, but it was not normal that a préfecture would have more than one.
Q.	So it would be logical to assume that he was the only candidate from the Kigali-Rural préfecture.  So being a doctor, former Director of Sanitation for Kigali-Rural, his name was put forward as the only viable candidate for Kigali-Rural for either a post of Minister of Information, Minister of Foreign Affairs, or Minister of Primary and Secondary Education; is that correct?
A.	Not quite.  It's not as clear in politics.  Ten candidates were given.  I told you they were going to -- we were trying to distribute according to regions and according to the action of the MDR and other parties in the regions in relation to us.  On this list I cannot say that Rwamakuba was going to be such-and-such a minister, because Twagiramungu had taken away that prerogative from us.  We thought that he could be minister, then Twagiramungu would appoint him to where he wanted.  We had nothing to say with what portfolio he took.  We had a list of ten people who could be ministers taken from around the country, and so Twagiramungu had to make his decision about who the three would be.
Q.	But I thought it was your testimony that the MDR were able to put forward candidates for three ministries only, or did I misunderstand you?  Were there other ministries that an MDR candidate could hold?
A.	No.  The Arusha Accords gave us the three ministries I have referred to, so we could only propose candidates for those ministries.
Q.	So, in your mind, when you proposed these ten candidates, if chosen, Rwamakuba would have to be -- would be given one of these three ministries; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Final point.  When rallies were held in the different parts of Rwanda, did MDR members always have to seek permission from the steering committee or the political bureau?
A.	No, but the custom was that they would announce their intention in the hope that members of other regions would come to support their rally.
Q.	But it was not necessary, was it?
A.	It was not necessary, but it was the custom.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I have no further questions, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The Defence counsel will re-examine you briefly.
MR. O'SHEA:
I don't mean to contradict Your Honour, but I have no re-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, that's a good contradiction.

Mr. Witness, we thank you for coming to testify before our Tribunal.  Your testimony has now come to an end and you are free to leave.  Thank you very much.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  
(Witness excused)
MR. O'SHEA:
No exhibits for this witness, either.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Ms. Cummings-John, that also applies to you?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
No exhibits, Your Honour.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming to testify here at our Tribunal.  The first thing that will happen, as you prepare to give your testimony, is that the registrar will give you an oath to tell the truth during your testimony.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
(Declaration made by Witness 5/13 in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, the procedure at our Tribunal is that you give your testimony by answering questions put to you by the people designated for that purpose.  The first person who will question you is the lawyer for the Accused, Mr. Hooper.  So you'll now have to answer his questions.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:
I understand.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, are you ready now?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Can we go into closed session now until lunchtime?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will go into closed session now.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 39 to 41] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 23 to 38 by Maureen Dunn)









(Court resumed at 1408H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  We can now resume our sessions.  

Mr. Witness, I shall advise you that you're still under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began your testimony this morning.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And I'm reminded to invite you to sign the identification document.  Can you do that, please?  We've been through it already.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
While that's being done, Mr. President, can I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I just confirm that we are in open session now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Thank you.  Can I invite you, Mr. President, the Chamber, to give permission to the last witness to visit the Accused?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we do.  
MR. HOOPER:
I've raised with WVS a small problem that arose, and that is those witnesses who went to see him were only granted 15 minutes, which given the history of the detainee and the rest of it, it seems rather short, but I'm told by WVS that they're looking into that and they hope to give a more reasonable period of time for the visits to take place.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So you signed that document.  And if I could be assisted by the registry as to the Defence exhibit number that that will now bear, under seal.  It is?  
MR. FRY:
183, Your Honour. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
 (Exhibit No. D. 183 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER:
And I think a document has also been circulated which -- excuse me, not necessarily circulated -- if those could be circulated, too, Mr. Mjui -- which I've referred to earlier.  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	This is a Human Rights Watch extract of plan of map of Butare, and I'm not going to trouble you with it, Mr. Witness, but we can see on the left-hand side of the -- of the left-hand map, we can see towards the top it's got a centre with "Butare-ville" and just below there, well, we can see other areas there and I think we can perhaps see a place that features in your earlier evidence.  So let me not burden you with that.  

Now, you were telling us about a relative who had been injured -- nothing to do with the genocide -- and had been given a bed in the hospital and that you attended that person.  Can I ask you this?  We know that President Habyarimana was killed on the night of the 6th of April.  In relation -- do you remember that event yourself?  I see you looking at the plan.  
A.	Yes, I heard about President Habyarimana's death over the radio. 
Q.	And in relation to that death, was your relative -- did he have his injury before or after that date that you can remember? 
A.	Before; my cousin was injured before the death of the president. 
Q.	Now, we know that the death of the president was the 6th of April, and it may be you're not particularly good on dates, but can you help us as to how long before the death of the president your relative suffered the accident?  
A.	No.  He had his accident about a week before the president's death. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you, we understand, went to the hospital to help him.  When did you first go to the hospital in order to fulfill that function, to do that?  
A.	In fact, my cousin had a sister, so she was a cousin, too, who was also caring for him.  I and that sister would take turns. 
Q.	Now, before the president was killed, as far as you could see, as a young man in Butare, how were things between Hutus and Tutsis?  
A.	The Hutu and Tutsi lived in harmony in Butare.  There was no problem between them. 
Q.	And how did things vary after the president was killed?  What happened then? 
A.	After the president's death, the people turned against each other.  I don't know why, but the fact is that the Hutus started killing the Tutsi after the death of President Habyarimana.  
Q.	Now, where did you stay -- after the death of the president, did you stay at home, or at the hospital?  
A.	When he died I was at home.  The next day we were told to stay home, so my mother told me to go to the hospital.  It was -- she said I was a young person, no one would touch me.  But when I reached the road, I saw that there were roadblocks and they were stopping cars, and I crossed a vehicle that was carrying people.  They asked me if I was Tutsi.  I said I wasn't Tutsi.  And the vehicle continued on its way and I continued on my way to the hospital. 
Q.	Now, having got to the hospital, roughly for how long after that day were you still going or staying at the hospital?  How long before you stopped having any association at that time with the hospital? 
A.	I think it was about two weeks I was at the hospital, and after those two weeks my cousin was taken away, and that's how I started hiding in the maternity ward.  And when I was there, there was a soldier who was caring for the injured soldiers.  His name was Placide.  He was the one who fed me, provided me with food.  And subsequently Placide evacuated me, got me out, and that's how I left the hospital. 
Q.	So we know that there's an event when your relative is taken -- taken and killed; is that right?  Your relative is taken and killed? 
A.	Yes, he was taken away and killed.  There was a Labophar Hiace that came, it was carrying other people, and that was the vehicle that took him away.  Placide informed me that my cousin and other people in the vehicle were killed at Kabutare.  He also informed me that they had been killed at Kabutare.  He also informed me that he tried to give the killers some money to spare my cousin, but it was in vain. 
Q.	Now, if I can, if I may, take the day that your cousin is taken from the hospital.  And I want to talk about the period before then, between the death of the president, Habyarimana, on the 6th, and the day when your cousin is taken away.  Now, during that period of time, were you at home or were you at the hospital?  
A.	The day after the president's death, my mother sent me to the hospital.  That is why I set off for the hospital and that's when I passed a roadblock.  And then I stayed at the hospital until he was -- my cousin was taken away and killed.  
Q.	Now, where did you stay in the hospital; do you remember? 
A.	We were in the surgical ward.  We were in the surgical section, where people who had been wounded, injured, were, but after the hospital was attacked I stayed in the toilets that were faulty -- could not be used.  That is where I was hiding. 
Q.	Well, let's start with that first period of time.  And you have in front of you a sketch of Butare hospital which is taken from Prosecution Exhibit P. 2, page 47 of that bundle of exhibits.  Now, I haven't had the opportunity of going through that document with you.  

So you have it in front of you.  Are you quite good at plans, or not?  A lot of people aren't very good; some people are.  Looking at that plan, do you recognise it?  Do you recognise what it represents?  It's the plan that I'm holding up, and you may be able to see, if you look towards me, just to make sure.  This one here with the -- yes.  And, in fact, we'll take the other plan from you, the map, because that's just a distraction at the moment.  Take that one away.  Thank you very much.  

So we're looking at the plan of the bird's-eye view, as it were, of the hospital.  Does that bird's-eye view make sense to you, looking at it?  Can you find the -- 
A.	Yes, I can see some places, for example, the maternity ward, paediatric ward, and the parking area.  I see other numbers, but I don't know what they stand for.  I don't know what sections or departments are depicted by those numbers. 
Q.	Well, that's a fair comment and indeed criticism because I haven't provided those numbers and I perhaps should have.  But we have -- this comes from a book, you see, where we have the numbers, and I can help you with some, and I'd better, I think.  For example, if you look at number -- can you find No. 20 there on the plan?  That's described as the kitchen; 21 is described as a laundry, or the laundry.  
A.	I see.  I see.  
Q.	And No. 14 -- where's No. 14, 14, which is slightly to the top, right.  Can you find that?  That's described as the mortuary.  Twenty-eight, just down from maternity, is described as dermatology.  I think that will be getting along there.  And No. 3 is stomatologie.  I don't think the details necessarily help.  Very well.  

Now, looking at that plan, can you help us as to where your relative -- where your relative was in bed?  Where was he?  
A.	If you leave the maternity, you go all the way up to building No. 8.  That is the surgical ward.  I think 8 means -- it depicts the surgical ward.  I don't know if I'm mistaken, but it should be 8. 
Q.	Let me ask you this.  The ward that you were in, how far was that from the -- do you know the area with avocados?  Do you know that area in the hospital, where there's avocado trees? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I know the place. 
Q.	When you were at the hospital, at any time did you notice any tents or sheeting, and if you did, do you know where they were?  
A.	Well, I'm speaking into the microphone because I think you don't seem to be understanding me -- to be hearing me.  You see where the paediatrics is.  There you have the radiology or the x-ray unit.  And when you go down, there's a large courtyard and below that is where people who were suffering from malaria go to be treated.  And down there you have the association -- you have what -- Médicins sans frontières had established tents that you refer to as sheeting, and that is where you have the plastic shelters. 
Q.	And how far was the ward, where you had your relative in, from the plastic sheeting? 
A.	It wasn't far.  It was a bit below.  You had to go down from the sheeting shelters so I think you had to move about -- for about 20 metres; that is, you had to move no farther than 20 metres from where the sheeting shelters were.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, when you were at the hospital looking after your relative, were you given any authority or authorisation to be there, or not? 
A.	There's a woman who used to work in the surgery unit whose name was Thérèse and who was a neighbour.  She had assisted me by asking the hospital management to grant me a written authorisation.  I therefore had a written authorisation, authorisation that was issued by the hospital management.  
Q.	When did things change at the hospital, and what did you witness yourself?  
A.	What change are you talking about?  Are you referring to the period prior to the war, or to the period after the war, or during the war?  What do you mean by "change"?  
Q.	Well, you've told us how your relative was in hospital before the president was killed and that he remained in the hospital, and you were looking after him.  After the death of President Habyarimana, did things remain the same at the hospital, or not?  Were there any problems at the hospital, or not?  
A.	The situation changed.  The refugees who went to the hospital, some of those hospitals (sic) were taken to the préfecture and others were killed at the hospital and yet others were sent to other locations to be killed.  It could be seen that the hospital wasn't operating as usual.  There was a bit of disorder.  The hospital wasn't functioning normally. 
Q.	Now, you've raised people being taken away or going elsewhere.  Is that something you saw yourself, with your own eyes?  
A.	You asked me if there was any change after the war.  I said there were changes.  When the war broke out, the refugees who came to the hospital, now, these ones were evacuated later.  These were refugees from Mpare.  They were taken to the préfecture in order somewhat to reduce the disorder that was reigning at the hospital with the arrival of the refugees from Mpare.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mpare is spelt M-P-A-R-E, a spelling by the Kinyarwanda booth interpreter. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You just tell us in your own words what are the things that you saw, and let me ask you this:  You spoke about refugees from Mpare being taken to the préfecture.  Do you know who -- right.  Did you see anything else? 
A.	Something else that might have been related to the war situation or refugees during that period, before or after?  I don't quite understand the question. 
Q.	Let me ask you this:  Did you ever see any soldiers at hospital, for example? 
A.	Yes, I saw soldiers at the hospital. 
Q.	Were these soldiers doing anything at the hospital? 
A.	Yes.  For instance, the soldiers were the one who took away my cousin or put him in a vehicle. 
Q.	Did you see anybody being hurt at all at the hospital? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Would you like to tell us about that?  
A.	I can give you the example of a man amongst those who remained at the hospital.  He hid there so that he shouldn't be evacuated, since he was afraid of dying.  

Actually, I saw three persons and those persons were killed where the association Médicins sans frontières had installed plastic shelters in order to give them treatment.  One person was wounded at the neck and the wound was stitched.  At a certain point soldiers were brought to the hospital.  I'm referring to wounded soldiers.  And in order to create room or space for those soldiers, it was necessary to take away certain wounded civilians in order to give room to the soldiers, and those civilians were killed or attacked.  These civilians were ill.  And I saw people come in with the list.  I don't know where they had gotten the list, but they brought this list and on this list were the names of persons who they later took away to kill. 
Q.	Now, you've mentioned your cousin as being someone who was taken away.  Can you give us a little detail about the circumstances?  Who took him away?  
A.	He was abducted by about 12 soldiers who had come from Butare town in a black vehicle belonging to Labophar.  They were accompanied by young people, and they came from the central town, from downtown.  I don't know if it was in the programme or plan to take away my cousin, but he was taken away at about 3 p.m.  But at 10 o'clock other soldiers came and checked the identification papers of patients, including that of my cousin.  They also asked him to show them their (sic) shoulder.  He had a scar on the shoulder, and the comment the soldiers made was that he must have had to carry a gun.  

At about 3 p.m. the soldiers came back and took him away, accompanied him, right up to the ophthalmology room where there is a pear tree or an avocado tree.  Indeed, it is at that location, towards the middle of the hospital buildings, that I left him.  The soldiers were saying that they were going to question him.  

At that point I went and saw Thérèse -- I have talked to you about and whom I said made it possible for me to have an authorisation to mind my cousin.  So I went to the hospital, and thanks to Placide, I was able to continue to hide myself.  Under those circumstances, therefore, I saw soldiers who took away my cousin.  

I went to the reception.  I went back to the surgery unit, went and looked for Thérèse in order to tell her about the situation and to see if I could obtain a document that will allow me to stay in the hospital.  It is in the process of moving around or going to and fro that I saw what was -- what the soldiers were doing.  And they are the ones who took away my cousin. 
Q.	Thank you.  That's -- now, before your cousin was taken away, were you hiding in the toilets or did that -- what was your position before he was taken away? 
A.	Before he was taken away, I was with him in the surgery section where he was ill.  I was there with him during the day. 
Q.	And before he was taken away, do you know if any others were taken away in the days or week or so before that? 
A.	I don't have proof of that, but the soldier whose name was Placide had informed me about what had happened, and he had asked me not to lose sight of him and I needed to try to be around where he was.  He had forbidden me from going out without his having to accompany me.  The toilets were inside the surgery -- were within the surgery section where my cousin was, so I did not need to go out in order to go to the loo. 
Q.	What did you do for food, if anything, during this time, this period? 
A.	There is a reverend sister whose name was Mameya, and in her premises food was prepared for patients, and we used to go to her house to get food.  

Subsequently, the soldier named Placide had food and used to give me some because he was a person minding soldiers that were patients, and in that respect, in that capacity, he could have food which he could also share with us.  

Subsequently, when he had to go away, that is, for instance, to take soldiers to Kigali, I wouldn't be able to eat his food, but the reverend sister whose name I just mentioned whose name was Mameya would give me food. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mameya is spelled M-A-M-E-Y-A, interpreter's spelling. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	After your cousin was taken away, as I understand what you say -- correct me if I'm wrong -- it was after that that you started to hide in a place or places; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And after your cousin was taken away, how many days or weeks, or whatever, did you spend at the hospital while hiding? 
A.	I think that I remained there for about two weeks.  You see, I did not count the days and, besides, it was impossible for me to know whether it was Sunday, Monday, or another day of the week.  But I think I stayed at the hospital for two weeks after the departure of my cousin. 
Q.	And during that time did you hide in one place or more than one place? 
A.	I would say that I hid at two different places, but not exactly.  After my cousin's death the woman called Thérèse took me to room 6 of the surgery section, where there was a man who was her relative, and she asked me to stay there, pretending to be that relative of hers, a patient-minder.  

And when the soldiers came, some people were evacuated from the room, and when those soldiers came, I was not able to spend the night in that room.  That night when I saw the soldiers I went and asked this woman who was working at the maternity what I had to do.  She asked me to stay with her.  And the following day the soldiers mentioned before came.  

The soldier I mentioned before came and took me into a toilet which had a hole.  He used bricks to cover the hole in the toilet and wrote in front of the toilet that the toilet could not be used, that it was out of order.  So I remained hidden in that toilet and that is where I spent most of the two weeks that I spent at the hospital.  That is before I left the hospital. 
Q.	Were you alone when you were hiding, or were you with anybody else? 
A.	I was alone.  I was alone. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Repeats the witness.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you mentioned witnessing people being attacked while you were there.  You mentioned three people.  Were those three people attacked at the same time or on different occasions? 
A.	Those three people were killed during the day.  I would say in the afternoon at about 3 p.m., but I am not sure of the precise time.  They were killed with small axes near the place called Gatemeri, where death -- or corpses were kept.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Gatemeri is spelt G-A-T-E-M-E-R-I, spelling by interpreter. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is Gatemeri the same as a mortuary, Mr. Witness?  When we look at No. 14, is that Gatemeri, or is it a different place? 
A.	Yes, you are right, that is also called the mortuary. 
Q.	And these three people who were killed, who killed them? 
A.	The soldiers are those who killed them. 
Q.	Now, all the time that you were in the hospital or over the 11 years since, against that background, I want to ask you this:  Do you know if doctors ever killed people in the hospital? 
A.	Personally, I didn't see them there.  I don't know -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, did we lose the translation on that?  I think we did.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Actually, the witness said, "I didn't see him there," which is what doesn't make sense to the interpreter.  
THE WITNESS:
I answered your question by saying that, personally, I did not see Rwamakuba at that location.  It is true that while I was at the hospital I tried to avoid all people who came there, for fear of being harmed, but I did not see him and I did not meet him at that location. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Very well.  That wasn't the question I asked, but it's an answer which I'm keen to hear you say because you know you're here to talk about -- or not talk about, you're here in a case about a man called André Rwamakuba.  And obviously, you and I have discussed that.  But I want to come, as it were, fresh to that position.  Is it right that in our discussions you've been shown a photograph and asked if you know that person?  Is that right?  
A.	Yes, that is true.  At a certain point you showed me a photograph. 
Q.	I'm going to pass that photograph up to you again.  I had a photograph that's been exhibited in this case, and I'll get the number, the exhibit number.  And I'm showing you that photograph.  Among the people you saw or noticed at the hospital during the weeks you were there, did you ever see that man, that you remember? 
A.	You do not need to show me this photograph.  I've already answered you, and I said I never saw him at the hospital.  I never saw him there.
Q.	Yes.  Thank you very much.  But it's important, you see, Witness, that everyone knows that we're talking about a photograph of that man rather than, say, a photograph of my uncle, do you see?  So that's why you have to be shown it here, and you're looking at that photograph.  It's a photograph of André Rwamakuba taken six years ago, here in Arusha.  You've not seen him.  Did you ever hear of a man, a minister -- a minister -- coming and participating in the genocide at the hospital? 
A.	If my memory is good, I've never heard of a minister having come to take part in the genocide at the hospital.  Rather, I heard of soldiers who came to the hospital, accompanied by this famous woman from Butare.  I no longer recall whether she was a parliamentarian or not.  But she came to that hospital and was accompanied by soldiers.  As for the minister, I never heard that a minister came to the hospital. 
Q.	Do you know who this famous woman, what her name was? 
A.	From what was said, this woman's name was Nyarimasuhuko. 
MR. HOOPER:
The spelling's on the word list that's been distributed.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Have you ever heard of doctors killing at the hospital? 
A.	Are you talking of doctors, medical doctors, of the hospital?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Or doctors who might have come from outside the hospital?  The only doctor that I saw was Dr. Gatera, but I never saw him kill anybody.  However, before taking patients or other persons to the hospital, Dr. Gatera -- or the patients were shown to Dr. Gatera or his staff before being taken away from the hospital to be killed. 
Q.	When you left the hospital, do you know if the sheeting or tents were still there, or not, when you left? 
A.	Before leaving the hospital, soldiers who had come from France arrived and were settled or installed at where you had the plastic tents before being given a room inside the hospital.  But at the time the organisation Médicins sans frontières had to remove the tents in order to make it possible for the soldiers to install their own tents where the plastic sheeting shelters had been installed by Médicins sans frontières. 
Q.	Just wait there, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have completed, Mr. Hooper?  Thank you.  

Mr. Witness.  Yes, you are now going to have to answer questions put to you by the Prosecutor.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, are you ready?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, madam. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court how many times you've met with members of the Defence team? 
A.	I think I have met them twice. 
Q.	Would that be twice in Rwanda, or both in Rwanda and here in Arusha? 
A.	I met them in Rwanda two times. 
Q.	Do you recall whether you gave a statement on these occasions? 
A.	They put some questions to me concerning the events that occurred at the hospital and I answered their questions.  Later, the person who had met me the first time around came back and we held another discussion or interview. 
Q.	Do you recall whether this person wrote anything down whilst you held these discussions?  
A.	That person asked me what my name was, and I told him, and he asked me to give him my address, my place of residence, my place of birth, et cetera, in short, personal details concerning me and which I gave to him.  And I realised that the person was taking notes of what I was saying. 
Q.	Do you recall ever signing a document during your meetings? 
A.	I remember that person asked me questions about the hospital, which I answered, and then the person insisted to know whether I was capable of repeating the same thing, if I was put the same questions in respect of the hospital.  And I answered in the affirmative. 
Q.	Did you ever sign anything? 
A.	I remember the person asked me whether I was ready to sign the statement I had made, was I prepared to do so at the very time or at some future date, and I answered in the affirmative also this question. 
Q.	But you never actually signed anything? 
A.	I signed the document he placed before me after the interview, and that was the circumstances under which the person asked me if I was ready to sign a document that would bear my testimony and answer the questions put to me.  And I did answer yes, but I remember that I signed once a document shown me by that person who was questioning me. 
Q.	Do you recall if this would have been in 2003 -- 2004, rather, last year? 
A.	Yes, it was last year. 
Q.	And -- sorry, go ahead.  
A.	I think it was a year ago, if not two, that I met that person. 
Q.	And what about this year, in July, do you recall meeting a member of the Defence team? 
A.	Yes, I remember.  I remember the July meeting. 
Q.	Did you provide any information on this occasion? 
A.	The person came to tell me they were reminding me of my first statement, whether I recollected it or whether I had anything to add.  We spoke together and I said I had nothing to add.  I made it clear that I did not pay much attention to all the toings and froings at the hospital when I was there.  They asked me if I was ready to give testimony in respect of what I had stated and I answered yes.  That person told me to be ready and added that I would be coming to testify in October, I think.  And when they didn't call me in October, I thought I wasn't to come any more at all, yet today I am here before you. 
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Witness, just to help you understand why I'm asking you this questions, we have received a document, a short passage, which are basically accounts of your meetings, so I want to be able to quote certain things from these documents and you can tell me if they're right or wrong.  Is that okay?  

Can you tell us whether your cousin was admitted immediately after his accident?
A.	Yes.  The accident occurred just outside his place of work.  ******************************************* and he was taken directly to hospital.  Then after he was admitted, there were the events that ensued after the death of President Habyarimana, and he was at the hospital. 
Q.	Now, I'd like to clarify something in relation to your July -- to the account of the meeting that you had with the Defence investigator in July -- sorry, yes, in July of in year, and also to what you said earlier in your evidence-in-chief.  In your evidence-in-chief you stated that your cousin had the accident one week before the president's plane crashed.  In the account of your meeting of July 2005 it states it was two weeks.  Can you just confirm which of the two is correct? 
A.	To tell truth, it's only an estimate.  I can't be specific, but I think it's a week or maybe just a bit more.  
Q.	So you wouldn't be able to recall the date at all, would you? 
A.	If I were to lie to you, I would say it was 10 or 12 or 15 days before the president's death, but I don't want to do things that way, which is why I give you an estimate as to the length of time. 
Q.	That's fair enough.  And you testified that you remained with your cousin for two weeks after he was injured; is that correct? 
A.	Quite. 
Q.	So two weeks after you arrived is when he was taken away by the soldiers; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  As I explained to you, the soldiers came and took them away with him -- with them.  Took him away with them. 
Q.	I'd also like to clarify a point.  In your testimony, in your evidence-in-chief, you state that you were sent by your mother to take care of him on the day after the president's plane crashed.  However, in the account we have of your July meeting it states that you learnt about the president's plane crash whilst you were at the hospital.  Can you just confirm for us which is correct? 
A.	No, I remember that I left my parents' residence after the radio announcement requesting everyone to stay home, and they also stated that Agathe and the others were dead.  And my mother did not want to send my big brothers to the hospital, since older people than I might encounter trouble on the way, which is why she sent me, because she thought I would not encounter any difficulties on the way. 
Q.	And this was on the 7th; is that correct, the day after the plane crashed? 
A.	Yes, I think it was the following day, but in the evening.  The radio had announced during the day the news of the president's death, and no one moved.  They said that no one should leave home.  And even when I left home I did not meet anyone else on the road, except the soldiers and perhaps a few other people.  I saw that roadblocks had been set up, and more precisely, that tree trunks or branches were placed in the road to prevent vehicles moving -- using it. 
Q.	So did your mother not think it a little dangerous at the time to send you, a 16 year old, just after the president's death had been announced?  
A.	Maybe my mother didn't understand the dangers there were on the road.  I myself did not realise the danger there was.  I myself didn't know that I could meet someone who would try to kill me.  It's subsequently that we learned that in fact there was danger and I could have died.  I think she herself realised a while later -- when people started killing each other off, then she understood the sort of difficulties I might encounter on the road. 
Q.	And by this time your cousin had been in hospital for how long?  Would you say a week or two weeks? 
A.	I think I had already been to the hospital only four times when the president died because, as I told you, I took turns with my cousin.  I think I'd already put in four stints at the hospital. 
Q.	But your injured cousin had been there for a week or two weeks by the time you went there on the 7th? 
A.	I don't remember very well.  I couldn't tell you whether it was 10 days or more, or less.  I don't know the date he was admitted to the hospital.  I think it was about a week.  Let's proceed on the basis of the figure of about a week. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, can we come to the car that took your cousin away, the black Hiace.  In your account of your meeting with the Defence investigator of the 23rd of March 2004, you say that the driver was a man that people said -- 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
What?  What is it?
MR. HOOPER:
The earth is shaking. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Earthquake?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the recess now.  We will take a short break.  
(Court recessed from 1530 to 1600H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
After our earthquake scare, we can now resume.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Before we were interrupted, I was just asking you, Witness, we were talking about the black Hiace -- I think my pronunciation is correct -- that took your cousin away.  In the account of your meeting with the Defence investigator of the 23rd of March 2004, you stated that the driver was a man that people say is in Arusha.  Can you tell us what man you're referring to?  
(Pages 42 to 54 by Karen Holm)




























1550H
THE WITNESS:
I don't know that person.  I can tell you that I saw him.  Even all the people who came in that vehicle and those taken away by the vehicle, I don't remember their faces.  I don't recall anyone.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	And what do the people say he's doing in Arusha, this man you don't know?
A.	They see -- they say that the person responsible for the massacres is in the prison in Arusha, in prison in Arusha. 
Q.	And when you say "they" say, who are you referring to? 
A.	Locals in Butare, inhabitants of Butare.  I don't know even why the investigator wrote that down.  I told him not to record things that I didn't -- I was not personally an eyewitness to, that I could only sign regarding events I witnessed.  I know I spoke to him of it, but I told him not to write down events that I was not an eyewitness to. 
Q.	And when they tell you, these people, the inhabitants of Butare, that this man, who was driving the car is in custody in Arusha, are they referring to the national prisons of Tanzania or are they referring to the UN detention facility, i.e., of the ICTR?  Is he being held by the ICTR? 
A.	No.  Butare locals know that it is the United Nations, not the Tanzanian government.  
Q.	But you didn't see this man, though, did you? 
A.	No, I never saw him.  I know I saw the vehicle that was parked there, that was stationary, but I'd be lying if I said I had seen that person.  
Q.	You did, however, see the soldiers who asked your cousin to show them the scar on his shoulder, did you not? 
A.	Yes, I did see those soldiers. 
Q.	You were even able to count their number and give an account that there were 26 of them, were you not? 
A.	Yes.  They had come in a vehicle, but those who took him from his bed were 12 in number.  
Q.	So who were the 26 you referred to in your statement -- in the account, rather, of your interview with the Defence investigator of 2004?  You referred to 26 soldiers who came suddenly to the surgery room.  Who were these soldiers that you're referring to? 
A.	Are you talking of 12 or 26?  I am telling you that they are soldiers. 

(No interpretation) 
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping)...the only line I've got in the -- in that statement, which is in French, dated the 23rd of March 2004, is, "Suddenly came six soldiers, V-I-N-T."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	So there were six soldiers.  My apologies.  There were six soldiers who came to the surgery; is that correct?  Or were there 12? 
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping)...correction, please, in fairness to the witness. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
(Microphones overlapping)...could the witness please be asked to remove his headphones. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I -- I don't need to do that.  I merely invite you to put his statement to him fairly, what he says.  I don't need to make any comment.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Mr. President, I don't want to have to read the entire statement, but I think we will have it to refer to. 
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping)...well -- 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Can I just finish, Mr. Hooper?  Can I just finish?  
MR. HOOPER:
You don't need to read the entire statement.  Just read the bit where he deals with numbers of soldiers.  That's the only bit.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
The line which has just been quoted by Mr. Hooper states, "On one of those dates at about 1 p.m., we had gone out to sit on the sidewalk in front of the surgery room.  Suddenly six soldiers came."  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness -- 
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping)...no, I'm sorry.  You have to then go down the paragraph where he says, "About one hour later came more -- or, many more soldiers."  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
With all due respect, Mr. President, I think this is an area that counsel can clarify during his re-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Miss -- no, Miss Cummings-John.  If you're putting to the witness that he made a prior inconsistent statement, you have to put fairly to him what he says. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:  
I believe I am putting fairly to him what he says because I'm quoting word for word from the statement. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you're taking only small part of what he said.  There's a (unintelligible) and you're asking a question which suggests that he didn't see the second part. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:  
That is not my intention.  My intention is to put this -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...I know, but why can't you read the whole paragraph to him so he knows -- he can understand what -- what is -- what is the inconsistency that you are suggesting? 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Noted.  Thank you.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in the account of your meeting with the Defence investigator in 2004, when you were at -- in the corridor outside of the surgery room, you state that six soldiers first came, and these six soldiers asked your cousin about the mark, or the scar, on his shoulder; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  The time was about 2 p.m.  We were sitting on a bench in front of the surgery.  I don't know from where the soldiers were coming.  They said that my cousin usually went to Mulindi.  I don't know who had talked to them about my cousin.  They asked him to produce his identity card, and he explained to them that his ID had been taken along with his clothes -- in the pocket of one of his clothes.  And my cousin became scared and said we had to go back inside the building of the hospital.  He was sweating because he was scared.  He said we should pray a lot because the situation was becoming dangerous.  

And that is how subsequently 12 soldiers came in -- or, there were another group of soldiers that was close or near the vehicle.  But the 12 soldiers were the ones who took him away and put him in the car, the black Hiace car that I mentioned to you a while ago. 
Q.	So the six soldiers first came.  Then they left.  Then 12 soldiers came, and they're the ones who took him to the car; is that correct? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...you referred to a man -- 
A.	That is correct.  Actually, the six soldiers are the ones who gave his -- who asked for his identity card and who made reference to the scar on his shoulder and that he must have had to carry a gun sometimes and that is what has given him the scar.  Now, they went away, and then later 12 soldiers came, and they took him away in a car.  
Q.	In this same account of your interview, you refer to a man who is the head -- or, the boss of the soldiers having a conversation with Dr. Gatera.  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	I do not know if that man was the commander of that group of soldiers, but that man held a discussion with Gatera.  Gatera was there, and he came out of his office with that soldier.  And when my cousin was taken away, he was, first of all, shown to Gatera, since nobody could be allowed to leave the hospital without being presented and introduced to Gatera.  I do remember that quite well. 
Q.	And where were you situated when your cousin was being shown to Gatera? 
A.	I was near my cousin, or by his side. 
Q.	So he was being taken away and you were by his side, but nobody bothered you or no one attempted to take you away? 
A.	He is the one who was being sought.  He was the one that was targeted.  It's as if I didn't count for anything.  

And, by the way, I put on his sandals because he -- his other foot couldn't wear any shoes.  I held him and accompanied him right up to the vehicle.  He was walking with the help of crutches.  When he got to the vehicle, he said that he was feeling pain, and he was asked to -- you know, to move and sit well.  A soldier asked me what was my place of origin, and I told him I was from ******** (sic), and then he hit me with the crutch of his gun.  He asked me to go away, and I went and saw the woman I talked to you about earlier on and whose name was Thérèse.  And she's the one who made it possible for me to obtain a document that authorised me to stay in the hospital.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Can I kindly ask the assistance of Mr. Issa?  Because I can't actually see the witness's face.  If we can just have the curtain moved back a little.  

That's fine.  Thank you.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	So whilst Dr. Gatera was talking to the man you presume to be the chief, the head, of the soldiers, was this when your cousin was shown to him? 
A.	He did not show my cousin to him in actual fact.  He talked to Dr. Gatera, and I (sic) pointed to my cousin with a finger, and I thought he was trying to designate him.  The soldiers escorted my brother.  I accompanied him, passing by where the avocado tree was.  We passed through the surgery room, and we got to the car park where we had the soldiers' vehicle.  And that is where my cousin was put into the car and taken away.  
Q.	You also mentioned a third man in Gatera and the head of the soldiers' group, a civilian.  Do you recall mentioning a civilian, also talking to them? 
A.	Yes, I recall that there were about three persons who were holding a discussion.  
Q.	Do you recall how this civilian was dressed? 
A.	I merely remember that that man was in civilian clothing. And the soldier was wearing military uniforms, and the doctor was wearing the jacket that doctors usually wear.  That is what I saw.  
Q.	Do you recall testifying that people came with lists and those whose names were on this list were taken away and killed?  Do you recall saying that in your evidence in-chief? 
A.	Yes, there were lists.  Lists were prepared.  I don't know where.  And those who came and abducted patients did so using lists.  I think they had informers who told them the number of persons that were in the hospital.  And when the assailants came, they had lists with them.  That is why I am saying that there were suddenly people who gave them information.  

Before taking anybody away from the hospital, he had to be shown, or presented, to Dr. Gatera, as I said before.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If this was another type of weather problem, I would have said -- if this was a weather problem, I would have said it never rains but it pours.  

But the registrar has just been informed that in Courtroom 2 they have discovered a crack in the courtroom.  And they've requested that all matters be adjourned for the day while they investigate the situation.  So we are going to have to take the adjournment now as a security precaution.  

Mr. Witness, we are going to have to take our adjournment for the day at this time.  You will resume your testimony tomorrow morning.  I should remind you, as I did at lunchtime, that during this or any adjournment you are not to discuss your testimony or -- or the case with anybody at all.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we -- we take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1616H)
