MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MS. KOUO:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, 
today, Monday the 6th of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the                           Prosecutor vs Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began, and Mr. Robinson will continue his examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President; and good morning.  First, I would like to have the witness shown two exhibits, ID. NZ1 and ID. NZ9.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, from the booth, if the video technicians can come over to the booth and sort out a number of difficulties.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted.
WITNESS ALG
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness ALG (Kinyarwanda spoken)? 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I am okay. 
Q.	There are two documents that have been placed in front of you, one which has a mark of ID. NZ1, is entitled, "Party Politics".  And I would ask you if you recognise as being the law on political parties that was enacted in Rwanda on 18 June 1991? 
A.	From what I can see, that is the case. 
Q.	And I think you made reference to Article 4 in your testimony earlier, and the prohibition against militias by political parties.  Now, do you find that in this text?
A.	That is right. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, sir, I have seen it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would like to move the admission of this document as D. NZ180. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ180 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, directing your attention to the photograph which has been placed before you, were you familiar with the offices of the MRND in Kimihurura, and if so, does this photograph appear to depict those offices? 
A.	I can't remember very well, but the office depicted on the photograph looks like the MRND office. 
Q.	Okay.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this be admitted as D. NZ182 -- excuse me, 181, sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ181 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, turning away from those exhibits and turning back to the subject that we were discussing on Thursday, which is the meeting at the Diplomat Hotel, or series of meetings which you testified about as having taken place on the 10th and 11th of April 1994, and we were discussing, in particular, a second meeting which you indicated that you had been informed about, at which      Colonel Bagosora, General Dallaire and the Interahamwe had met.  And you testified on Thursday that the purpose of this meeting was to request the assistance of the Interahamwe in evacuating the orphans from Gisimba orphanage.  And Gisimba is G-I-S-I-M-B-A.  

Now, I would like to ask you, first of all, whether or not you have read the book of General Dallaire entitled, Shake Hands with the Devil? 
A.	I haven't read that book, Counsel, but I would like to make a correction.  I did not say that the Interahamwe had to evacuate those children; rather, it was Dallaire who wanted to evacuate the children.  In that connection, the militias were asked to ease the evacuation of those children.  It was not the Interahamwe who evacuated the children.  That is the correction I would like to make to your proposition earlier on.  It is not the Interahamwe that wanted to evacuate the children from the orphanage.  

Furthermore, Counsel, I have not read that book. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG, and your correction is noted and you are absolutely correct.  And, perhaps, it was in the translation that that came to be a difference.  But I accept what you say completely.  And I want to ask, with respect to the book of Dallaire -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have taken excerpts from this book, which is number 32.  It is in my packet of material that was distributed this morning.  And in particular, I have copied pages 284 to page 291, which -- in which General Dallaire details his activities on the 10th and the 11th of April. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And I would like to put it to you, for your comment, Witness ALG, that in General Dallaire's book, when he speaks of the activities of the 10th and 11th of April, he makes no mention whatsoever of having met with the Interahamwe on those days.  And, in fact, the UNAMIR daily situation reports which were completed on those days also make no mention of any meeting between General Dallaire and the Interahamwe.  So, I would like to give you the opportunity to comment on that. 
A.	Counsel, if he didn't mention that, it is perhaps he did not deem it important to mention that point of detail.  Well, it depended on what he wanted to do.  I do not know what was his feeling when he wrote this book.  I'm really not in a position to tell you why he did not mention that point.  But that is something you can take up with Dallaire. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness ALG. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time, I would like to have this excerpt -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry for interrupting, but I would like to place on record that there is a problem in the interpretation into French.  Because the question interpreted was really the opposite of what           Peter Robinson said.  Because in the interpretation it was said that - at -- in Dallaire's book the meeting was mentioned, whereas, what counsel said regarding the pages excerpted from Dallaire's book was opposite, that there was no meeting on that date.  

I'm sorry for interrupting, but this is just to clarify the record. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.

I understand the witness is receiving Kinyarwanda interpretation, but I am going to ask the whole question again because I don't want there to be any doubt about it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What I said, Witness ALG, in the book of Dallaire, he details his activities during the days of the 10th and 11th of April.  And he makes no mention of attending such a meeting.  And is that how you understood my question? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  And I have answered it. 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Yes, that was my understanding of the question.  And I answered immediately. 
Q.	Yes, you did.  Thank you very much.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer the excerpt of president -- of Dallaire's book as -- to be marked for identification as ID. NZ39. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have been considering your applications for admitting documents through this witness.  And we have come to the conclusion that we should apply a consistent rule with regard to the issue of laying adequate foundation.  We have, in fact, been applying that rule fairly strictly with the Prosecutor and we think that we should also apply it to the Defence.  

Now, this witness has no foundation, because he has not read the book.  And there is no adequate foundation which would permit it to be admitted through him.  Now, we had -- because we had not made up our mind how to approach this problem, we had resorted to the concept of putting in 
the -- marking them for identification as an intermediate step.  But that is cluttering up the record again, and I'm not quite certain that there is any value in doing that.  

And it may very well be that if you intend to put them in through a witness who has a basis for admitting them, it might be better to just wait and do it properly at that stage. 

There is one other thing that -- one other point that I thought was useful to make at this point because there is a level at which if all parties, that is, the Prosecutor and the three Defence teams, have considered the legal implications of certain documents, and they think that there would be no legal objection to their admission, it might be that you could, in fact, submit a list.  I know you attempted to do something on Friday, which did not succeed.  But this also might be possibly the subject of a joint submission from all parties to the trial.  And we would be considered -- we would have considered that if that were done, we would be willing to admit the documents, using the consent of all three counsel as a legal bases for -- instead of insisting on any other formalities of foundation laying.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I think I understand and I don't know whether it would be possible to reach those kinds of agreements because I think they require context from the witness before we can agree to whether a document would be admitted.  For example, to agree that the Prosecution could admit documents which otherwise look like they would be admissible when we don't know for sure whether they will call that particular witness.  Maybe they will run out of time, maybe they will decide not to call them.  So, I don't see that we can accomplish much in advance of the testimony of the witness.  But it may be possible during the witness's testimony to expedite the admission of exhibits by agreeing not to object to some of them.  

But also, Mr. President, I think that by ruling that some exhibits should not be received because they are cumulative to the witness's testimony also makes it difficult for us to agree to admit exhibits until we have heard the testimony, because if the Prosecutor's exhibits appear to be cumulative to the testimony that is heard from the witness, we would probably want you to apply the same rules to them as you are applying to us.  

So, I don't hold out a lot of hope for agreement on exhibits.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, my comment was not intended to be a directive.  But it was just another opportunity of addressing these issues.  But that indicates how we are looking at it.  And if the parties can agree, then we will probably be applying this rule if you did submit a joint submission. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand.  And also, Mr. President, one thing that is actually very important to me and is that when documents are referred to during the course of the trial that they somehow be part of the trial record, whether -- if you don't chose to admit them, I understand and I would like to have them marked for identification, which doesn't obligate you to consider them.  In fact, until they are admitted, you don't -- you are not really allowed to consider them.  Nevertheless, however, if the document is referred to, it ought to be part of the record.  

And, for example, this particular document, I am going to come back to this with another witness.  And we will get it admitted just as I upgraded those two exhibits today that had ID numbers into actual exhibit numbers.  So, I would really -- I would strongly ask you to allow me to put documents in as marked for identification.  And if it turns out that they are never admitted, then you need not be concerned with them; but they are, at least, part of the record. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, if I could offer just one additional comment and I think I mentioned this before; with regard to this book by Romeo Dallaire, it is trans -- it is available in French.  And it would be helpful to us, and probably for the witness who does speak French if we had the French translation of the portions that Mr. Robinson is going to refer him to.  I know both are available in the ICTR library.  But I'm making that as a comment in reference to all of the exhibits or documents tendered by the Defence.  I notice that many of them come in in only one language when they are, in fact, available in several of the languages that we use.  

In terms of preserving the record, Mr. Robinson has already given us the page numbers for this particular book.  So, I think on the record, we have a clear idea of what was being discussed.  So, I just offer that as a comment. 

Could I make one other comment?  I know that with regard to this particular item, the book by      Romeo Dallaire, the entire book was offered in evidence in the Bagosora trial.  And we do have it in electronic text, both in French and in English.  So, if it assists Mr. Robinson and the Court, 
I can make that available to the Court in electronic form in both languages.  And then we can give an identifying number to the entire text.  I'm sure Mr. Robinson is going to want to come back to this book with several other witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, your request is creating a lot of problems for us, as did Mr. Webster's comment.  The one issue on which we do have concerns among us, though, is that if you do have extracts in more than one language, that would be the appropriate way to approach it.  

Now, our problem with the exhibit, or the marking for identification, you see, if it is not marked for identification -- if it is marked for identification, never admitted into evidence then what is the use of having it marked for identification?  It is just making our record more bulky and more difficult to manage without having a comradely value of any sort.  Now, if it is marked for identification because there is a witness who has a more proximate connection with it and would, therefore, be able to pull it in to testify, then you lose nothing if it is not marked for identification at this time. 

Now, on the other hand, we are wondering about the purpose of admitting a record -- a book of this nature.  Now, if -- is it really appropriate for it to be admitted for the truth of its contents without the author being a witness?  And even though there might be, perhaps, an aspect of the book which the -- which you might think might be favourable to your client, what about the other aspects of the book?  Do they have the same weight or not?  I mean, how do we assess the factual statements in the book?  You know, we are a little bit worried about that.  Particularly, for example, if we accept Mr. Webster's offer to offer the book as a whole.  What aspects of it do we read?  How do we treat the factual statements in it?  

We are not -- we are unsure at the moment how to address that.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, for this particular document, you note that I offered it for identification only.  So, the second part of what you said, how you assess it, how you weigh it, is not relevant -- I mean, it is not coming into play at this point because it is not being offered for anything other than to be marked for identification at this time.  

Now, General Dallaire is on the Prosecution's witness list.  It is my intention when he comes, if he comes, to ask him about the events of the 10th and 11th of April.  And I expect he will testify that he never met with the Interahamwe.  And, in fact, that is corroborated by these portions of his book.  I think it could be admitted, that portion of his book could be admitted to corroborate his testimony at that time.  

So, now since we've referred to the document, and I put this to the witness to give him the opportunity to comment on what I think is going to be favourable Defence evidence coming in, albeit through another Prosecution witness.  So, there is a link between what is being asked of this witness, and what I expect will happen later in the trial.  So, it seems to me, logical that the document being referred to be made part of the record, and, hopefully, converted into an exhibit.  And if it is not, what harm has there been?  

But you ought to be consistent.  Why -- we are doing things inconsistently now to change the rules of identification -- of documents being marked for identification.  We have gone through three sessions of marking documents that were referred to in court, but didn't rise to the level of admissibility.  For identification, why do we need to change that rule if you are telling us that you are trying to be consistent?  Because it seems to me to be inconsistent with our practice before.  

Otherwise, the documents that are marked, I believe, maybe the last six or seven or eight documents that were admitted as ID numbers, those are documents that I asked that be admitted; and you rejected that.  Frankly, I think that that was an error because I think there is an adequate foundation and also that the records are authentic, self authenticating.  

How would the Appeals Chamber deal with my assignment of error concerning the admission of those documents if they are not somehow part of the record?  So, that they need to be -- we need to have this category of documents with ID numbers for a number of reasons.  And so I would ask you to just -- to just -- you are making more trouble for us all than whatever saving there would be by having a less bulky file.  

I think good management of this case and the archives of this case, and again, not only for this trial, but for future historians and scholars and people who look at this case, would be to allow documents which are referred to in court to be somehow part of the record.  And if they have not sufficiently made foundation for admissibility, then they become ID numbers.  So I would ask you to apply those consistent principles.  And I think they would make much more sense in the overall management of the documents of the trial than to leave documents hanging.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, mister -- I think we are just going to move on.  Mr. Robinson, we are not abolishing the category of ID documents at all.  This document does not normally come in the category of ID documents because there is nothing that this witness has said or done about this document which makes it necessary at this stage for it to be marked.  

The purpose for which you express a desire to use it will not be affected by not marking it for identification at this stage.  And most importantly, we wanted to -- we wanted to distance ourselves from the proposition that the issue of future historian, or scholarly research, we don't think that is a basis for making matters part of our record.  You know, if they are part of the record, then it will be a basis for future historical and scholarly research, but as for a reason of admitting it, we are not in support of that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, Mr. President, I will move on.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, you have testified that the purpose of this meeting shared on the 10th and         11th of April by Bagosora and attended by Dallaire and the Interahamwe was to discuss or to request the assistance of the Interahamwe in evacuating the orphans from Gisimba orphanage.  And I want to put it to you that, in fact, the meeting between UNAMIR, General Bagosora and the Interahamwe concerning the evacuation of orphanage -- orphans from Gisimba orphanage took place on the 16th of May, not on the 10th or 11th of April.  

And in putting to you that proposition, I would like to have the Trial Chamber refer to number 33 in my packet, which was distributed today, which is an UNAMIR report from General Dallaire to Kofi Annan, dated the 18th of May 1994.  And it attaches a report of the 16th of May 1994 which has as its subject, The Meeting Between the UNAMIR Operation Officer, the RGF Representative and some 30 Members of the Interahamwe and Various Self-Defence Forces.  

So, what I would like to put to you for your comment, Witness ALG, is that, in fact, the meeting between UNAMIR and the Interahamwe concerning the orphans from Gisimba orphanage did not take place on the 10th or 11th of April, as you have testified to, but took place on the 16th of May.  Do you have any comment to that? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
One query, please.  Is it the Defence contention that there was only one meeting to discuss the Gisimba orphans?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, it is the Defence contention after looking through all of the UNAMIR documents that the first time the Interahamwe met with UNAMIR concerning these orphans, and I'm talking about the Interahamwe as a group, was on the 16th of May.  So I hope that clarifies for Mr. Webster. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ALG, would you like to comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, I have told you that it is often hard to remember dates.  But as the Prosecutor has just pointed out, if it is said that on such and such a day a meeting took place, it isn't then impossible that on another date there was a discussion regard the evacuation of those children.  I have told you UNAMIR and the offices -- and the Interahamwe held a meeting.  But it is quite possible that they met on several occasions, but that the date mentioned is that.  I don't think we need to dwell on it.  All I know is that it did take place at one point in time. 

Among the information imparted to me, I heard that when they met for the first time they were not allowed to evacuate the orphans.  On the very first time the proposal was not accepted.  That is what I told you.  And I said that it was the information imparted to me, and they were not allowed to evacuate them.  I have also said that after all of those meetings I did not participate in those meetings, but I did participate in the evacuation of the orphans; but before that, there was much to do about it.  It was -- it was -- it was lengthily discussed before the actual evacuation took place.  Thank you, Counsel 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you intend to apply for this document to be admitted?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Don't you think it would be appropriate for the witness just to look at it first?  We think that if you are going to use it to contradict him, it should -- that's the basis for admitting it into evidence.  But maybe the witness ought to have a chance to comment on it, to have his memory referred to the contents of the report. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I am happy to do, Mr. President, but the document is in English and the witness doesn't read English.  But if it is of any value, I can place it in front of him and we can translate portions of it that deal with the subject, but that would take some time.  And I'm not sure that is a valuable use of the time. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, this is the type of document that should be the subject of consent.  And I respect the Court's suggestion earlier this morning that the parties should sit down and come to some agreement as to what documents are of historical relevance for one reason or the other and consent to their admission.  

I don't see this document as one that hurts the Prosecution, but I don't -- I also do not see it as contradicting the testimony of this witness.  Mr. Robinson has already stated that his position or the Defence position is that this was the first meeting where the evacuation of the orphans was discussed.  There is nowhere, nowhere in the document where the document itself purports to be a record of the first time that this was discussed.  And in view of the witness's response, I don't see how we can take this document as bearing any indicia that would contradict his testimony.  

So, on that basis, there's really no ground to admit it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but see the problem of that argument is that we would have to read the document to conclude that, you see, that is a problem.  So we think it should be admitted as a contradictory document, but as we skimmed through it we thought there were factual issues on it which the witness should have commented; for example, the identity of the persons who attended the meeting which are recorded in this meeting.  And there were other factual issues which could have assisted in assessing its value as a contradictory or not a contradictory document.  But we could not come to those conclusions without reading the document. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I agree with Your Honour and that is precisely why there is insufficient foundation to admit it for any reason.  Mr. Robinson should bring the Court's attention to those portions of the document that demonstrate that it contradicts the witness's testimony.  If he has not done that, then there is no basis to admit it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, are you completed with your examination of the document, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  You may continue. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, just so we are clear, what I am putting to you for your comment -- well, first of all, let me explain to you that it is part of the fairness of the trial to allow a witness to comment on evidence that the Defence intends to bring later, after you are gone.  And so what I am trying to do here is to give you a chance to explain yourself fully about the evidence that we expect we are going to elicit during later testimony.  So, I just want you to understand what we are doing first, okay.  So, do you understand that? 
A.	Counsel, I do understand what you are saying, at least, in part.  I think you want to contradict me in saying that it never happened.  But I don't think that is your position.  If you said that it never happened, that there was no evacuation of orphans that I could understand.  But, Counsel, the important thing is to discover the truth; we have to know what happened and what never happened.  We must distinguish between what was said and what was actually done.  We can speak of various dates for an event.  But the important thing is that the events, indeed, occurred. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I apologise, but may I interject for one other point.  If I can direct the Court's attention to paragraph 6 on the -- what appears to be the second page or the third page of the document.  And if we look at the middle of paragraph 6, the report from the UNAMIR official states as follows, I can read it into the record or the Court can read it for itself, I will await the Court's direction, but starting with "however" I think that should be reflected in the record. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm sure after that comment that anybody reading this record, the Appeals Chamber or anyone else would have no idea what we were referring to unless this document were somehow made a part of the record, which is simply my purpose at this point.  But anyway, we -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have already come to the conclusion that it needs to be admitted, but we thought that there were other issues on it, which could have assisted us if the witness commented on them.  If we are either in cross-examination, or in re-examination or, perhaps, the Court itself might ask one or two questions, but we intend to admit it into evidence. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I asked whether you had completed your examination on it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And I haven't. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
In that case, Your Honour, I would like to have that sentence reflected in -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mister -- you can do it in re-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, you -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
You have suggested to counsel --
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He may or may not accept your suggestion.  If he doesn't, you can do it in re-examination or the Court itself may ask these questions. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  My -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We raise this question because one of the things which we noticed ourselves which we thought it would be useful to have the witness comment on. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
But -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand you, I already said that. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have already said that.
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  My concern, Your Honour, is that we don't want extensive re-direct examination and if we ventilate an issue completely during the cross, then we won't extend our re-direct by going into things that are really not that important, but that needs to be preserved on the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 

Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I just want to express one concern that we are having.  And that is, I think that if 
Mr. Webster is going to inject the points that he wants to make in re-examination in the presence of the witness during my cross-examination, it is going to be necessary for the witness to be excused during these proceedings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Robinson, Mr. Webster did not say -- make the point, he drew your attention -- he drew our attention to it.  And what we rule is that you have the opportunity to address it now or not.  He can deal with it in re-examination or not.  And the Court itself has the option to address it if it wishes.  So, you can continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, let me tell you the position of the Defence to give you a clear picture so you can comment before we go on to something else.  It is our position that there was no meeting on the 10th or 11th between Colonel Bagosora, General Dallaire and the Interahamwe.  And as evidence that there was no such meeting, we have proposed that General Dallaire, in his recollection, in his book as to how he spent his time, makes no mention of this meeting.  And we have also proposed that the subject of the meeting, as you have reported it, was, in fact, discussed at some later time and was not discussed on the 10th or 11th of April, at which time there was no such meeting.  And that is the purpose for discussing with you the documents relating to the meeting of the 16th of May.  

So with that in mind, knowing what our position is about this meeting, would you like to comment on that before we move on? 
A.	Counsel, when I put forward that date, I spoke of information imparted to me.  You yourself, moreover, have referred to it.  Dallaire went to that meeting to discuss the orphans at Gisimba.  Now, if his proposal was rejected and he left and, subsequently, I told you that after his departure arms were distributed to the Interahamwe.  I can confirm that.  Arms were issued to the Interahamwe, and then they went about their business.  I told you how those arms were used. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness ALG. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would like to admit -- have this document admitted as Exhibit D. NZ182.  And I just wanted to tell you that as tempting as it is to explore the contents of this document with the witness, I think that sometime tomorrow or Wednesday you would be asking me when I am going to finish my examination.  So I am making a strategic decision on the basis of time not to do that.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ182 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, you said that -- that weapons were distributed to the Interahamwe after this meeting on the 10th or 11th after Dallaire had left.  And isn't it true that you learned of this distribution of weapons only when you were in prison? 
A.	Counsel, I spoke of the distribution of weapons because I had information before I went to prison, in the month of May -- April, sorry, I was given that information, other information, it is true, was given to me when I was in prison.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we consider -- we are obviously at a great disadvantage as we are seeing this document now for the first time.  But as we have skimmed through it, we don't see reference to Dallaire's attendance.  Could you point to it, sir? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, that is correct.  And at the meeting of the 16th of May, General Dallaire was not in attendance, in -- and it is possible -- I believe -- I am trying to look to see if he was in attendance on the 17th.  It is correct that Dallaire was not in attendance.  UNAMIR was represented by Colonel Nyatche (phonetic).
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, but if that is the case, Mr. Robinson, the way you have been putting your questions suggests that the meeting with Dallaire did take place, but it did not take place on the 10th or 11th but, rather, it took place on the 16th. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think, actually, Judge Short, you are very correct.  And I think I was in error to -- I think that I did say the meeting with Dallaire and I should have said the meeting with UNAMIR concerning these orphans.  I think that it was my error, because it is correct that there is no -- no evidence from this document that General Dallaire was present at the meeting of the 16th of May. 
JUDGE SHORT:
This is why it is important that documents which are intended to contradict the witness should be put before the witness.  And I believe that the witness should have an opportunity to read it, even though it might take some time.  And also I think the Bench should have the opportunity to see this document beforehand, especially documents which are not in evidence already, but documents which you are introducing for the first time; and so that errors like this will not occur. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I agree with you, Your Honour.  And I apologise for the error.  And I also would prefer to have documents discussed with the witness, and have them be shown to the witness.  And I am -- in fact, that is my great preference to do that as opposed to working under time constraints.  And so in the future, if that is how the Bench would like us to proceed, I would be happy to show each of the documents to the witness.  

It was one of my experiments with this witness to try to save time that I decided not to show these documents to the witness as a time-saving measure to enable me to meet the estimates that I had made.  But if it is important to the Bench, I would prefer actually to have all of the time that I need and to show the documents to the witness.  And I can proceed in that manner in the future.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we are going to move on.  I should make a comment that we are a little bit -- we feel that we ought to be entitled to rely on what you put to the witness.  And it was just by chance that we had the chance to skim through the document and noticed that the question to the witness was not quite accurate.  So we would expect a higher standard of accuracy when matters of this nature are addressed in the future. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Understood, Mr. President.  I apologise again for that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, I'm going to go back because I'm not sure the Trial Chamber got the last question.  And that is that you told us that weapons were distributed after the meeting with Dallaire, after he had left, to the Interahamwe.  And I asked you if you had -- isn't it true that you learned of that fact only when you were in prison.  And you had said, no, you knew of that even back in April of 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I told you how that information was imparted to me.  It is not the first time the question is put to me.  The question as to the issuing of weapons to the Interahamwe, you asked me if I learned of that when I was in prison, and I answered that that -- I obtained that information, that it was imparted to me even in the month of April, and after the month of April, I have spoken of that. 
Q.	And I'm going to ask now that you take a look at Exhibit D. NG, that is Ngirumpatse Exhibit D. NG27.  And if you can be shown the Kinyarwanda version of that, I'm going to ask you about your statements on the ******************************on this subject. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Does it have a number in your bundle?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, this was an exhibit that was admitted during Mr. Weyl's examination.  It is D. NG27. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, what has been placed before you is a copy of your interview on the********************* ***********, before Emmanuel Rukangira -- that is R-U-K-A-N-G-I-R-A -- the prosecutor for the            supreme court.  And I want to direct your attention to the bottom of the second page of this interview.  And I will ask you whether or not at the time you were asked the following: "You are accused of having distributed firearms to the Interahamwe to kill people."  And your answer was, "I never distributed firearms."  And then you were asked, "So who distributed them?"  And then it makes reference to your position within the administration, which I won't quote directly.  And your answer was:  "I do not know who distributed the firearms.  I do not know the people who did that." 

In fact, is that what you told the prosecutor of the supreme court of Rwanda on the                             *********************************?  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm sorry, but if we read the next question and answer, things take on a very different light.  And I think it is rather deceptive to put to the witness those two questions and not the third. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness be excused, Your Honour, for this discussion, because I don't agree with that statement at all.  And I don't want the witness to know the substance of what we are discussing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But has the document been given to the witness?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, it has.  So you are right, the damage has probably been done, but I nevertheless would like to point out why I don't think that particular part of it is relevant.  And I don't think it is fair to do that in front of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have access to the document.  If it is necessary, another question can be put to him by the Prosecutor or the Court. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think that these comments by Mr. Webster serve to tip the witness.  And I think that the Trial Chamber needs to direct the Prosecutor that when he has material in a document that he thinks is being withheld, that his duty is to deal with that in re-examination and not to tip the witness off in the middle of cross-examination.  And I ask that you make that direction at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not yet.  Let's see what happens first. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, my question to you, Witness ALG, is, did you tell the Prosecutor on the *************************** that, "You do not know who distributed the firearms?  I do not know the people who did that." 
A.	Counsel, I have answered these questions on several occasions.  As you can see, those questions concerned me particularly.  And as I have told you, those were questions concerning me particularly.  So when I was answering them, I answered them in relation to myself.  And I believe that I told you the way we answered questions, questions which concerned us.  At that time there were certain answers which we did not want to give whereas we were aware of the information.  

And then we realised that it was necessary to say the truth.  So gradually we started saying the truth.  So I think you should not put this document to me and claim that I did not know the people who had carried out that operation.  If you refer to the next question, you would see that there is mention of my position.  And the question was asked about how I could claim to not have been aware of that.  So, if you look at the entire document, you would see that I answered those questions and, subsequently, I made another statement in which statement I mentioned everything.  And I clearly stated that this time around, I would say the truth.  I believe I had explained this the last time.  But from what I can see, you are still putting questions in that connection. 
Q.	Well, just so we are clear, Witness ALG, when you made the statements, "I do not know who distributed the firearms" you were telling a falsehood, correct? 
A.	As you can see, it was a deliberate question.  He was convinced that I was the one who distributed the weapons, but he did not want to refer to it directly.  He did not want me to mention other people who had distributed weapons.  He simply meant that I was the one who distributed the weapons.  So, I gave him that answer which, as I told you a while ago, I said that I recorded other statements, because as you can see, this statement was recorded in 1999.  So I gave other statements in which I gave all of the information.  I said the truth, so that the truth can come out in the open.  So I believe this is a question that I have answered on several occasions. 
Q.	Well, since you have insisted that you knew in April of 1994 that weapons were distributed to the Interahamwe by Colonel Bagosora and others at the Diplomat Hotel, when you made the statement on 1999 that, "I do not know who distributed the firearms," that statement was not true; is that correct? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, you have asked this question.  And the witness has explained the circumstances under which he made that statement.  Whether we accept or believe that explanation is another matter.  But I don't think you can continue asking the same question, because we are only going to get the same answer. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
But, Your Honour, respectfully, I think the witness is not giving a direct answer to the question.  He is avoiding a direct answer to the question.  He is saying that, while on the one hand, we were not wanting to say the truth because of our own situation at the time.  And on the other hand, the questioner was actually asking me about some different topic, so it didn't call for the answer.  So, I really don't know whether this witness gave an intentionally false answer to that question or not.  I don't think that that is clear.  So, my question is intended to make that clear. 
JUDGE SHORT:
He indicated that when he made that statement, he wasn't telling the whole truth.  But, subsequently, he decided to tell the whole truth.  I think that came out very clear in his testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I agree that that was one part of his testimony, but I also feel that he added to that the fact that the question that was asked of him didn't call for an answer that would include making this particularly a false answer.  But, in any event, I can move on.  We can -- it is not a problem. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, I would like to direct your attention to Exhibit D. NZ29, and ask that that be shown to you as well.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
What is the date on that one, please, Mr. Robinson?   
MR. ROBINSON: 
Which was submitted in February 2000. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, what has been placed in front of you is a document that I believe you prepared in February -- excuse me, February 2000 at the request of the Prosecutor, in which you explained your own activities during the war; is that correct? 
A.	Correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And do you have the Kinyarwanda version in front of you? 
A.	No, Counsel, what was shown me was the French version. 
Q.	Do you prefer to work with the Kinyarwanda version? 
A.	Since my testimony is in Kinyarwanda, then my preference would be for the Kinyarwanda version if at all it is available to be shown to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, is this on the database?  Do you have a tab number for it? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It is -- was not part of the tabs.  There was -- I believed it was one of the documents admitted by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  But, perhaps, the Kinyarwanda version was not among the versions of this statement, because the English and the French are admitted as D. NG29, but, apparently, the Kinyarwanda was not included.  So, I would ask that the Kinyarwanda version be made a part of the Exhibit D. NZ29.  And I have provided my copy to the registry for that purpose. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  There is no challenge to the accuracy of the document?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No.  We do have the document in our Prosecution bundle as one of the statements that was disclosed.  So, if the Court does have that electronic file, the document is dated the 21st of February 2000.  So, if you don't have it as an admitted exhibit, you can also refer to the Prosecutor's bundle and it is the statement of the 21st of February -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we -- they are admitted. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I thought the Court wanted a reference on -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  We wanted you to respond, first of all, to Mr. Robinson.  We wanted two things, to respond to Mr. Robinson, that is, the Court exhibit be updated to include the Kinyarwanda.  So, we needed a confirmation of accuracy for that.  

And secondly, if you could access it electronically, we would appreciate that.  We don't have access, as yet, to the electronic database of exhibits that are admitted. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sir. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry.  If the Court could give me a few minutes, I can find it and send it to CMS and they can transfer it to the Court on Lotus notes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, we will allow the proceedings to continue. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, I would like to direct your attention to the second paragraph, under the sub-heading number 1, which is entitled:  "The time I arrived in the commune during the war."  And in that second paragraph, is it not true that you yourself wrote that, "In the morning of the 11th of April a communiqué issued by the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture, and broadcast on Radio Rwanda requested all civil servants of Kigali-ville préfecture and of the communes of the préfectures to go back to their posts as quickly as possible.  That was when I left my house around midday to go to the Kigali-ville préfecture.  The préfet told me that he thought I was dead, and that he was about to appoint my successor.  On the way, I saw roadblocks, some of which were manned by soldiers, and others by civilians.  Some of the people manning the roadblocks had firearms.  Obviously, I do not know how they obtained them."  

Now, was that your statement in February of 2000? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to tell you that there are certain errors in this document which I would seek the correction of.  From what I can see, the document is in the present, reference is made to the 11th.  You have always mentioned that date, but I do not think your question concerns the date.  

I said some of the people manning the roadblocks had firearms.  I said, I do not know.  It was at that time I did not know the people who had distributed the weapons, but that does not mean that subsequently I did not get that information.  So, when I arrived at the roadblocks, I did not know the people who had distributed the weapons; but I got the information subsequently. 
Q.	But, Witness ALG, are you telling us that when you wrote, "I do not know how they obtained them" that you were speaking as if you were in 11th of April, as opposed to on the 21st of February 2000, when you used that present tense? 
A.	Counsel, I was referring to the date when I had left my home to go to the office.  So, it was not on the 21st of February.  What I said there was, I do not know.  I think I ought to have said, I did not know.  So on that date I did not know the people who were distributing the weapons.  So it was not on the         21st of February. 
Q.	Well, Witness ALG, I'm going to prove to you that you are playing with words instead of telling the truth.  And I'll prove that to you by asking you to look further in the document and find the number 6 where it begins, "Circumstances of the departure of the persons who had taken refuge at the Kigali-ville préfecture office." 

Now, if you look one paragraph above that number 6, the first sentence that you have written after a very long explanation that does not include any mention of the distribution of weapons at the     Diplomat Hotel, you say:  "This is what I know or what I heard regarding the distribution of firearms in Nyarugenge commune during the war in 1994."  And we know that the Diplomat Hotel is in Nyarugenge commune."  

Now, did you say that or didn't you?
A.	Counsel, please give me a few moments for me to locate that passage.  Is your question in connection with the distribution of weapons?  I don't know the information, which, according to you, does not appear on that passage, because from what I can see under number 6, the words you just uttered do not appear there, so I would like you to refer me to the passage in question.  Are you, rather, referring to number 5 in connection with the security issue, because from what I was told, the passage you referred to was number 6. 
Q.	Witness, what I -- I wanted you to locate number 6.  And then what I asked you to do, and, I apologise if this wasn't clear, was to look to the one paragraph before number 6, which is actually the last paragraph of section number 5.  And what it says is that:  "This is what I know or what I heard regarding the distribution of firearms in Nyarugenge commune during the war in 1994." Have you found that sentence? 
A.	Yes, I have found the passage.  That is correct, that is what I wrote.  But, once again, I'm going to give you the answer I had given you earlier on.  You see, when I was asking -- when I was answering the questions put to me on the 21st of February, I said I did not know it.  On that date, I did not have that information, but, subsequently, other pieces of information came to my mind.  By the way, I made another statement after this one.  And I mentioned the weapons distribution.  I believe, I had explained this; I have always said that it is very difficult to remember all what happened during the genocide.  It is very difficult to say everything in a single statement.  I think that even in 2010, if questions concerning the genocide are put to me, I will still come up with new information.  

So I can still add information which I had forgotten regarding the genocide.  I believe I had explained this, Counsel.  This is something which happens often.  Even writers, when they write books, there are pieces of information which they forget and which they can subsequently correct. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry to interject.  If I could ask Mr. Robinson to reformulate his characterisation of the portion of the statement that preceded the sentence that he is putting to the witness, because I'm not sure if I got it correctly.  I don't have the -- the daily transcript, but my understanding is that he characterised the witness that the witness did not say anything about the distribution earlier that week, or earlier in April in the first part of his statement.  If that is what I understand, I'm not quite sure if that's accurate.  So, could he reformulate that and if not -- if so, perhaps the witness should be instructed to read the entire content of the section above the statement to which his attention was drawn. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President, if you wish me to respond favourably to that which I am inclined to do, I think the best thing to do would be to take our recess at this time and to let the witness read the entire section concerning distribution of firearms and I could put some additional questions to him when we come back. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take the recess now.  We will take the mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1024H)
(Pages 1 to 21 by Donna M. Lewis)





















(Court resumed at 1050H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, have you now have an opportunity to read the document which you wrote in February of 2000? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I have been able to read the document; although, I did skim through it rather quickly. 
Q.	Well, can we agree that in the document you did not mention the distribution of weapons at the Diplomat hotel on the 10th or 11th of April by Colonel Bagosora? 
A.	Yes, I do not mention that anywhere in that document. 
Q.	And the reason for that is?  
A.	I think I did explain, I did not narrate everything I knew in that document.  As the subject indicates, it's what concerned me myself, what I did during the war.  In fact, I was narrating what concerned me personally and not other people, and I should like to say that I did not say everything I knew about other people.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness ALG.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	I think we can now move on to the topic of the authorisation for the erection of roadblocks.  And you testified on the 26th of October in this trial that it was the leaders of the MRND at the national level who gave the Interahamwe authorisation to set up roadblocks after the death of the president.  And you told us that you had some sources of information for that statement, and one of them was the bourgmestre of Kacyiru commune; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that -- he was one of the people who informed me, but there's something I should like to correct, Counsel.  I said that -- I did not say that it was only the MRND officials or authorities.  They were among the people that allowed the establishment of roadblocks, but it wasn't only MRND officials.  There are others who authorised the erection of roadblocks.  
Q.	Can you tell us what the bourgmestre of Kacyiru commune told you about this subject, and when? 
A.	Thank you.  Similarly, two other people informed me, and some people I can't remember.  On the subject of roadblocks, I shall repeat so that it be clearly understood.  In fact, after the president's death, roadblocks were erected on the 7th by soldiers and the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe who had been trained -- who had undergone military training, they went around setting up roadblocks.  And I should like to add that they had lists of people and would enter residences and kill people.  

Subsequently, there was a meeting of the Interahamwe with their leaders.  He also told me that on the 7th -- on the 7th, MRND officials -- top officials -- top officials of the MRND held a meeting with Bagosora.  And after that -- and after that, there was a meeting with the Interahamwe leaders when they were asked -- at which they were asked to erect roadblocks, to man them and strengthen them, in order to combat the enemy, and they should do that in conjunction with the military and organise patrols in order to prevent the Inkotanyi from finding a way in so as to attack the town.  They were told also -- they were also told that they should obey any order from the soldiers -- implement any order from the soldiers.  That is what he told me, and he was not the only one to tell me that. 
Q.	And just so that we're clear, the meeting that -- you talked about two meetings:  MRND top officials met with Bagosora, and you told us that that occurred on the 7th of April.  And then -- 
A.	Yes, indeed.  That is one of the meetings he talked about to me.  Indeed, he mentioned that meeting to me. 
Q.	And then you said that the MRND top officials then met with the Interahamwe leaders and asked them to man the roadblocks; and on what date did that meeting occur? 
A.	It was the meeting we are talking about, the meeting of the 10th. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	So any instruction to the Interahamwe to set up roadblocks, as far as your information was concerned, was conveyed on the 10th or 11th of April, correct? 
A.	No, as I had said, the Interahamwe did not start setting up roadblocks on the 10th and the 11th.  No, by the 7th they had already started doing so.  The Interahamwe, in the company of soldiers, moved around setting up roadblocks as early as the 7th. 
Q.	And did you receive any information as to upon whose instructions the setting up of roadblocks on the 7th by the Interahamwe were executed? 
A.	I wouldn't know about that, but what is obvious is that the Interahamwe could not operate without the approval of MRND chieftains.  The Interahamwe belonged to the MRND.  They could not engage in any activity whatsoever without the knowledge of MRND officials.  I did not have any doubt about that.  I did not wonder about that at all.  It is so clear. 
Q.	Now, you also testified on the 26th of October that you received information concerning the authorisation to set up roadblocks from Jean Baptiste Butera; is that correct? 
A.	Please repeat your question.  I lost something, Counsel.  Kindly repeat it. 
Q.	You also testified on the 26th of October at this trial that you received -- you received information concerning the setting up of roadblocks by the Interahamwe from Jean Baptiste Butera.  Is that correct? 
A.	That's right, indeed.  That is what I said. 
Q.	And Mr. Butera was one of the assistants to the préfet in Kigali, correct? 
A.	Yes, Kigali-ville préfecture, that's correct.  By the way, he was the one acting in the absence of the préfet. 
Q.	And can you tell us what he told you about the erection of roadblocks by the Interahamwe? 
A.	Excuse me.  He told me practically the same thing as Nyirigwaya.  He talked to me of a meeting which took place at the Kigali-ville préfecture office, during which meeting the préfet requested the conseiller de secteur to arrange for the setting up of roadblocks to avert the infiltration of Inkotanyi in the town.  He told me that the people had to support and assist the Interahamwe who, it was said, were few in number, so as to fight the Inkotanyi.  He told me the Interahamwe had started setting up roadblocks as early as the 7th.  
Q.	And did Mr. Butera give you any information about the leaders of the MRND having given instructions to the Interahamwe concerning roadblocks? 
A.	He didn't give me names. 
Q.	When was your conversation with Mr. Butera concerning the setting up of roadblocks? 
A.	What I would like to tell you is that Butera had his residence at the Kigali-ville préfecture office.  I always saw him there.  We were together, so it was not a conversation which took place at a specific time.  It was amongst the very first pieces of information which I tried to gather so as to know what was going on in town.  Amongst those who informed me about happenings in my absence was Butera. 
Q.	And did Mr. Butera tell you anything about the meeting that you claim occurred on the 
	10th or 11th of April at the Diplomat hotel, chaired by Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I can't remember that.  I can't remember whether he mentioned anything whatsoever to me regarding that meeting.  
Q.	Now, did you also receive information about the setting up of roadblocks from André Nzabanterura?  That's spelled N-Z-A-B-A-N-T-E-R-U-R-A? 
A.	Yes, he also gave me information. 
Q.	And was he a member of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, he was an important Interahamwe. 
Q.	And where -- where and when did he give you information about the setting up of roadblocks?  
A.	He gave me that information at the Kigali main prison in 1999, in 2000, or in 2002.  I cannot remember the specific year, but in any case, it was within that period. 
Q.	And what did he tell you about the erection of roadblocks and the leaders of the MRND? 
A.	I can't remember whether he mentioned MRND officials.  Actually, I was asking him for information in connection with the events at Kimihurura,******************************.  He was the Interahamwe president in Kimihurura.  I cannot recollect whether he told me anything whatsoever about the meeting during which MRND officials reportedly gave instructions. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness ALG.  And now I would like to speak with you about the letter -- I'd like to speak with you about the letter in which you claim Mathieu Ngirumpatse wrote requesting the Interahamwe to comply with the orders of soldiers, and I understand you have three sources of information about that letter.  So, first I would like to ask you, who was the first person to tell you about that letter? 
A.	Actually, it is not easy to remember such a point of detail, but when I try to reminisce about it, I think it was actually Bernard Maniragaba who first mentioned that letter to me. 
Q.	And where were you and when did that happen? 
A.	He had stopped by the préfecture office.  I'm referring here to Bernard Maniragaba.  He wanted to go to Murambi to see the senior MRND leaders.  That was in late April, early May 1994. 
Q.	And what did he tell you about the letter, and when did he tell you that he had seen this letter or become aware of it?  In other words -- actually, that's a bad question.  Let's start -- well, let me start over.  Just tell us what he told you about the letter, first of all.  
A.	Actually, I had just asked him who had authorised them to set up roadblocks, and he told me immediately that Mathieu had sent a letter to them requesting them to comply with the orders of soldiers.  That is what he answered, but he was in a rush.  
Q.	And did he tell you that he himself had seen the letter? 
A.	I can't remember that very well, but he answered the way I just said, and he said, well, he had written to us so there was nothing for me to add.  I knew that he was a very influential Interahamwe.  I could not elicit more information than that from him. 
Q.	Now, you've told us also that you received information about this letter from Jean Habyarimana, the president of the president of the MRND for Kigali-ville préfecture; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when and where you received this information from 
	Jean Habyarimana? 
A.	He gave me that information when we were together at the Kigali main prison.  We were talking about those events, and it was somewhere around 2000.  It's not easy for me to mention the specific year.  We were often together, so it's not easy for me to say whether it was 1999, in 2000, 2001, or 2002.  In any case, I think it was around 2000 or the subsequent years. 

Concerning Habyarimana, I would like to add as follows:  He said he did not see the letter but that he had learned of that letter from the Interahamwe.  Even though he was the MRND chairman for Kigali-ville préfecture, he said he did not see the letter, that he learned of it from Interahamwe.  
Q.	And did you also receive information about this letter from Joseph Setiba? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	And can you tell us where and when you received that information about the letter from Setiba? 
A.	We were at the Kigali main prison within the period I had already mentioned, that is, somewhere between 2001 and 2002.  I'm unable to remember the exact year, but it was during that period, 2001, 2002, 2003.
Q.	I just want to go back for a second to Jean Habyarimana, because you told us now that he did not see the letter that had allegedly been written by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And I want to read to you from the testimony that you gave last week on the 31st of October 2006.  I'm reading from the official transcript at page 34, and you were asked:  "Witness ALG, did -- Bernard Maniragaba, Joseph Setiba, and 
	Jean Habyarimana, did they say that they he had seen a letter written by the hand of 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse?"  And you said, "They did see that letter."  And then it said, "Witness, did they say to you they had read the letter?"  And you said, "I don't really remember, but I think that in view of the fact that they gave me that information, they had read the letter." 

Now, you told us last week that Jean Habyarimana had read the letter and you're telling us today that he had not read the letter.  Which is true?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  You certainly have understood the way the question was put to me.  It was couched in general terms, and I said that, generally speaking, the letter was read.  But regarding Habyarimana, I remember that he did not read it; however, the answer I gave was couched in general terms.  You should understand that it is necessary for you to note the point of detail I just raised regarding Jean Habyarimana, who said he did not see the letter. 
Q.	Did Joseph Setiba tell you whether or not he had seen the letter? 
A.	He told me he saw the letter, but he did not tell me whether or not he read it.  He told me he saw it. 
Q.	And did he tell you the circumstances under which he had seen that letter? 
A.	If my memory is not failing me, he told me he saw the letter when Robert Kajuga met him at a roadblock at Gitikinyoni.  It was Robert Kajuga who had the letter.  He was in the company of other important leaders, but it was Robert Kajuga who -- who held the letter. 
Q.	And Gitikinyoni is spelled G-I-T-I-K-I-N-Y-O-N-I.  

Did Setiba give the date when he had seen that letter from -- in the hand of Kajuga?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth did not quite understand counsel's question, and they send their apologies for that.  If counsel could repeat.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you.  It probably wasn't the most clear question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did Mr. Setiba tell you on what date he had seen the letter in the hand of Robert Kajuga? 
A.	What he told me was that he saw that letter around the 8th of April 1994 in the morning. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I'd like to turn to the 11th of April 1994, and on that day you were still remaining at home, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And were you aware that on the 11th of April 1994 the international community was evacuating the expatriates from Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, that was going on, and I was aware of it. 
Q.	And were you aware that the RPF, also on the 11th of April, refused to agree to a ceasefire because it did not recognise the interim government? 
A.	I was not aware of that, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm going to direct the Trial Chamber's attention to exhibit -- to document number 10 that is in my packet of exhibits.  This is an UNAMIR situation report -- daily situation report dated 12th April 1994, and in that, UNAMIR is reporting, in the first paragraph, that the evacuation of expatriates was taking place, that the RPF did not agree to a ceasefire because this would include recognition of the new government and that two RPF battalions had arrived and they were taking control of Kigali.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Is that the situation, as you understood it, on the 11th of April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, regarding the areas in Kigali under RPF control, I did not think there are explanations given in detail, but it was obvious that a greater part -- or a large part of Kigali was under RPF control. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time, with respect to the UNAMIR daily situation report of the 11th of April, dated 12 April, I would ask that that be admitted into evidence under D. NZ183 -- sorry, 182, or if you wish to follow the practice you've been following, that it at least be received as ID. NZ39. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we're going to do something that's fairly novel, ask for the interpretation of your silence. Does that mean you don't object?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Not at all.  Your Honour, we do object, for the reasons that I've placed on the record previously, but I don't know where to go at this stage, because I don't -- I don't think it's appropriate to bring the document in in this way on the -- for the same reasons we've discussed previously.  

Actually, the practical matter, we don't know what the accuracy of these reports are, and if Mr. Robinson is so concerned about the historical record, what we should do is just make a big exhibit of all the sitrep reports that we have from UNAMIR and characterise them as what UNAMIR was sending back to UNHQ in New York, and the ones that he feels are favourable to him, he can refer to; and the ones that we think are favourable to the Prosecution, we can refer to.  But to selectively take them here and there and offer them as if they are actually probative of the witness's credibility on these points is not -- is not appropriate.  So if we're going to characterise them as "this is what UNAMIR was saying," and leave it at that, then fine, put in all of the sitrep reports, and then we can refer to the ones that are helpful -- or the Trial Chamber can refer to the ones that it deems helpful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  I must tell you we're having difficulty at the moment on this issue.  You see, on the one hand, right, we are of the view that the UNAMIR reports have a special category, but we also don't think that we can rely on them as being evidence of the facts that they contain.  But they are useful as a background reference to some of the testimony that's being granted.  Now, in that context, it's illogical to let in some and not others.  
On the other hand, how do we let them in, if they are not being put in by -- either by an arrangement where all the parties for the trial say the UNAMIR documents come in as UNAMIR documents or we have them put in by somebody who has knowledge of them?  It's giving us difficulty at the moment and -- and we understand the purpose why you want it in, as a contradictory instrument, that's the basis for it, to some extent, except that once you admit it in in that capacity, it means that we are going to look at the content of the material, and we've been worrying about that.  

Many of these things are double-edged.  They have facts which would support what you are saying; they have facts which contradict what you are saying.  How do we evaluate and how do we make factual conclusions on that basis?  It's bothering us.  We don't have a clear answer at the moment.  We think it's a bit dangerous to admit them for this purpose.  At the same time, we are not quite certain where we are at the moment.  We are having a problem with it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand that, Mr. President.  Mr. President, under Rule 89(C) it seems like you have two enquiries, authentication and relevance.  For authentication, I think that for a UNAMIR document, as the 
Trial Chamber held in the Bagosora case in its decision on request to admit United Nations documents into evidence under Rule 89(C) on the 25th of March 2006, that the documents which reflect the views of the United Nations officials, those are admissible as self-authenticating documents.  So I think step one, we can take the position that all UNAMIR documents are authentic, without the need for a witness to authenticate them.  And I believe that position would apply to both the Prosecution exhibits and to the Defence exhibits. 

The next question then becomes relevance.  When a UNAMIR report is shown to be relevant by some connection to the testimony of a witness, then I think the document becomes admissible.  But when documents from UNAMIR have no connection to the relevance of testimony during the trial of a witness, I believe that that relevance foundation has not been met and the document is not admissible, which is why I don't agree to admit all UNAMIR reports.  

This very issue was decided in the ICTY recently in the case called Prosecutor versus Prlic, and it was on a written motion by the Prosecution to admit documents from the bar table.  And the Prosecution said, "Look it, we have this group of authentic -- authenticated documents.  Why don't we just admit them all at the beginning of the trial and then we don't have to deal with individual questions of admissibility during testimony?"  And the Trial Chamber rejected that.  They said that an important question of admissibility is the link between the document, whether authentic or not, and the testimony that -- and the relevance to the testimony of the witness.  They didn't want to have the wholesale dumping of otherwise authentic documents into the record, and they rejected that.  

So what I'm asking you to do, which is pretty much what I thought you had been doing for the whole trial, is when there's a showing of authentication and a showing of relevance, I believe that it's your duty to admit the document.  

Now, the -- if I don't bring anybody from UNAMIR to talk about the provenance of the information, I think you're entitled to give the document less weight for it's truth as you would otherwise do if you had a witness testifying that either they observed these events or these events were methodically recorded as some kind of pattern or practice.  So to me, it's a question of weight, what you use the document for.  

But on the issue of admissibility, which is what we're dealing with right now, I think these UNAMIR documents qualify, both for the test of authentication and the test of relevance, and, therefore, that they should be admitted, and you can decide what weight to give to them at the end of the trial when you've heard testimony from other witnesses, if you have. 
JUDGE SHORT: 
Well, Mr. Robinson, under Rule 89(C) an additional requirement is probative value, not just relevance, so how do you address the issue of probative value?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Your Honour, I think that that was addressed by the Trial Chamber in Bagosora in which they said that the views of the United Nations officials, as expressed in these reports, have probative value, and, therefore, can be admitted without the need for a witness to explain the probative value of the documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in view of what you have both said, we think that we probably should invite you to just make some written submissions so that we can make a formal ruling on the matter.  We think that might be the best way to proceed.  

I don't -- how much time would you need to do that?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I could probably do that before tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, I take it that this is Mr. Robinson's motion, so what I prefer to do is have him make his filing, and then I'll respond to it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it was part -- our decision to invite written response -- a written submission was motivated partly by your suggestion that we consider the UNAMIR documents as a group, because it's apparent that this matter is going to come from time to time both -- from all parties.  And so we thought that it -- that's why we thought that it would be useful to have written submissions, so you could actually get a formal decision which should influence the rest of the trial proceedings.  So, we are interested not only in this particular issue, but the issue of dealing with the UNAMIR documents.  And I think the submissions that would enable us to make a decision which would affect the trial in future could help us. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I appreciate the -- you know, the Court's assistance by suggesting that we -- we do that.  The only problem is that to admit all of the UNAMIR documents is not a legal argument, it's an argument based on practicality and fairness, and it would -- it would take some agreement from the Defence to move in that direction. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we're inviting you to -- to deal with the issue and put -- make written submissions to us, whatever they are.
MR. WEBSTER:
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So if Mr. Robinson would like to do it -- put forward his proposition by tomorrow morning, we assume you should do it by tomorrow morning.  (Unintelligible).  How much time would you require?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Tomorrow morning is fine.  I'll work on it this -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you'll both present tomorrow morning?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Nobody would reply to each other.  That's fair enough.  If it becomes necessary, we can make the order tomorrow.  Thank you.  

We reserve on this matter now, Mr. Robinson, and you should move on. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl, that meant all parties in the trial, so you have the right to do it as well, if you wish.
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, that's exactly what I wanted to say.  And I think we should like to take part in the debate that would result from the written submissions.  I think we will have our grain of salt to add to that.  Thank you, Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, it also includes you.  It also includes you.
MR. SOW: 
Yes, I also wish to be part of it.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Okay.  We think it's probably better to make a full presentation, including procedure of admission, and in that circumstance, we suggest that you -- we will give you until Wednesday morning, all parties.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  And, Mr. President, I would suggest that we proceed at this interim time to mark these documents by identification -- for identification until we can resolve this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So with respect to the situation record dated the 12th of April 1994 that I've just been referring to, I would ask that it be marked as ID. NZ39. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ39 marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, back to you.  On the 11th of April 1994 we have in evidence as Exhibit D. NZ23, a speech that Prime Minister Kambanda made, after holding a meeting with the préfets, in which he announced that Prosecutors had been requested to resume their work and to punish those responsible for the troubles and disorder and that préfets, bourgmestres, and heads of departments had been urged to call meetings to calm the population and that the population should be instructed that the attack by the RPF is not an excuse to incite one another and that no one ethnic group should exclude the other from the country.  Did you hear that speech of Prime Minister Kambanda on the 11th of April? 
A.	Counsel, I did not hear that speech, and even if it was said, it doesn't -- it wasn't translated into facts, unless in the -- it happened in the other préfectures, but it is clear that the prosecutors in Kigali did nothing.  At no time did I see the state prosecution services resume their duties.  That's an example I'm giving. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And I remind you, my question was simply whether you heard that speech, so I think it might be better in the future to confine your answers to the question that's put before you, since you're not the Prosecutor debating with me, but you're a witness here to simply provide information within your knowledge. 

Now I want to turn to the 12th of April 1994, and you told us that you heard the communiqué from the préfet in which officials were instructed to report for work; is that correct?  
A.	It was the civil servants from Kigali urban préfecture and the commune.  It is true, such communiqué was broadcast.  
Q.	And did you yourself hear that on your radio?  
A.	Yes, I think I heard that broadcast over Radio Rwanda. 
Q.	And can you explain to us, Witness ALG, how it is that you didn't hear the communiqué of the five political parties calling for restoration of security on the 10th of April; you didn't hear the interview of Mathieu Ngirumpatse calling people to stop the killings on the 10th of April; you didn't hear the message of Prime Minister Kambanda to stop the killings on the 10th of April; you didn't hear 
	President Sindikubwabo's message to the public on the 10th April to stop the killings; you didn't hear the announcement of the préfet on the 10th of April in which he called for the killings to stop; and you didn't hear the announcement of Prime Minister Kambanda on the 11th in which he asked the people to stop the killing; and yet you heard, on the 12th, the message to come back to work?  How is that possible? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  There's something that you have omitted, which I did hear.  On the 9th it was Sindikubwabo -- President Sindikubwabo's speech when he spoke of the programme of the interim government.  But as regards the other communiqués, I told you in what circumstances I was, which explains and justifies why I didn't hear that.  But regarding the communiqué of the 12th, I heard it in the morning, and I can tell you in the morning there was a sort of calm, and I could hear the announcement being read, the communiqué, at that time in the morning.  
Q.	Well, isn't it true that in the morning of the 12th of April 1994 the situation in Kigali was so dire that the interim government had to leave Kigali and go to Gitarama? 
A.	Yeah, it is -- yes, it is clear there was fighting in the town, but I told you that in some secteurs, in some commune, there was intense fighting, intense combat, but nonetheless, in other places there was -- a sort of calm descended, there was no combat.  
Q.	Witness ALG, I'm going to read to you from the special sitrep of the 12th of April 1994 by the United -- by UNAMIR, and this is number 11 in my packet of materials.  It says that "12 April 1994 was a reasonably successful day for the RPF.  The government has packed in and left Kigali, towards the south.  RPF troops from the north entered Kigali from all directions, also from the south."  Does that accurately explain the -- describe the situation that existed on the 12th of April 1994?  
A.	Counsel, I think you should add Kigali town.  We're speaking of Kigali town.  If the government moved, it's because there was insecurity, because the government had a lot of information on hand.  The problem is that it abandoned the people, abandoned the population of people that were being killed.  That is the problem.  (Unintelligible).  The problem is that the government didn't even say that it had moved.  In some communiqués they were pretending that the government was still in Kigali -- or claiming that the government was still in Kigali.  The problem is you speak of the war, but regarding the killing of the civilians, the Tutsi, in point of fact, you seem to be avoiding that fact.  That government should have been protecting those people.  That is where the problem lies.  Otherwise, a war situation is always a war situation. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that the special situation report dated 12th April 1994, which is number 11 in my package of exhibits, be marked for identification as ID. NZ40.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So marked. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ40 marked for identification)  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, on the 12th of April, can you tell us approximately what time you arrived at the office of the préfecture in Kigali-ville? 
A.	I arrived there around midday. 
Q.	And thereafter **************************************************************people who needed them? 
A.	That's correct.  I got it, but it depends on which document you are referring to.  It is not all types of documents which were issued. 
Q.	Well, for example, did ********************************************************those people who needed to take refuge in other préfectures?  
A.	Yes, ****************************those who needed to move to other préfectures. 
Q.	And were those passes **********************to people, regardless of their ethnicity? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And were **************************************people with a document entitled a "temporary certificate of loss of identity card" if they needed it?  
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	And so if someone had lost their identity card or had claimed to have lost their identity card, ********* issue the certificate, correct? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	And this did not include the ethnic origin of the person, correct? 
A.	Correct, sir. 
Q.	And would you agree that the issuance of these certificates at the direction of the préfet ******** probably resulted in the saving of lives of people who might otherwise have been killed had they presented an identity card with the ethnicity "Tutsi"? 
A.	That is possible, Counsel.  I know that such papers assisted many people. 
Q.	Now, from the time you arrived at the préfecture on the 12th of April, did you remain there until -- did you remain living there until the 3rd of July when you went -- when you fled? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And were there refugees also living in the Kigali préfecture office? 
A.	Yes, there were. 
Q.	And did that include Tutsi? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And were the Tutsi protected at the préfecture office by the préfet and yourself and others? 
A.	Yes, we ensured their security. 
Q.	Was anyone killed at the préfecture office? 
A.	No, not as far as I know. 
Q.	Now, after you arrived at the préfecture, did you begin to attend meetings of an organisation which became known as the security council of the préfecture? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was it true that the objectives of these security meetings was not to perpetrate killings but to restore and maintain peace in the various secteurs? 
A.	Counsel, what you are saying is correct, the purpose of the meetings was to ensure security. 
Q.	Now, at one of these meetings, did the préfet ask the conseiller to set up crisis committees comprised of upright members of the public at the level of the secteurs? 
A.	Yes, he gave those instructions. 
Q.	Did you ever hear the préfet or any soldier say at any of these meetings that children should not be spared because Kagame and Rwigema -- that's R-W-I-G-E-M-A -- had left the country as small children and now they were coming back to fight the government? 
A.	No, I did not hear such utterances. 
Q.	Now, on the 13th April 1994, did you hear the speech of President Sindikubwabo in which he said that the government would do everything possible to end murders and theft in all of Rwanda and called for tolerance and an end to suspicion and asked for the help of the international community?  And this is in evidence as D. NZ25.  Did you hear that address by President Sindikubwabo? 
A.	No, sir. 
Q.	Now, turning to the 14th of April 1994, and directing the Trial Chamber to document number 12 in my packet of exhibits, which is a UNAMIR daily situation report for -- dated 14 April 1994, UNAMIR is recording that the unconditional ceasefire that was proposed by the Rwandan government forces was not effective, probably because the Rwandan army is divided into different factions and there is no overall controlling authority.  Is that consistent with what you observed about the situation on the 14th of April?  Was there no overall controlling authority controlling the behaviour of the soldiers, the population, and the Interahamwe? 
A.	Counsel, there was a government in place, but the government was unable to do that, as you are saying. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would ask that the situation report for the -- dated 14 April 1994, which is number 12 in my package of exhibits, be admitted for identification as ID. NZ41.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ41 marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, after you arrived at the préfecture office, did you ever send trucks around to pick up corpses? 
A.	They were sent by the préfet. 
Q.	I'm going to read to you what was said about you by a witness who has testified at this trial, 
	Witness UB, who was a conseiller.  He said that he kept you informed of all the events, that you sent trucks around to pick up corpses, and that at what point you told him -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Robinson, can we have a page reference and a date for this, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  I'm sorry, I was going to do that.  That is the transcript of the *************2006 at pages 5 and 6.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, this Witness UB, who was a conseiller, testified that he kept you informed of all the events, that you sent trucks around to pick up corpses, and that at one point you told him to forget about the problem of Tutsis being killed, and he deduced that that meant that you supported the plan to kill Tutsis. 

Now, you've told us you did not send trucks around to pick up the corpses.  Did you ever tell ********* conseillers or any conseillers of Kigali-ville préfecture to forget the problem of Tutsis being killed?  
A.	I never said such a thing, Counsel.  And talking about those vehicles, I was not the one responsible for sending them out.  I have told you who sent the vehicles out.  He was the one with such a jurisdiction. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry to interrupt, but I've just read that portion of the transcript, and I don't think it's appropriate to summarise it in the way that Mr. Robinson has done.  The witness does speak French, we do have the transcripts in French, and perhaps what we should do is find some way of putting exactly what was said to the witness, rather than the way in which that summary was made.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President.  If you'll give me a few minutes, I'll put up that transcript on my screen, and I'll read it to him exactly. 

Okay, let me read to you from the transcript of the ************2006, testimony of UB, and I'm going to read it in a way that doesn't reveal your identity.  So on line 20, the question was, "Did" -- your position is given -- "ever tell you that the Tutsi were to be left to die?"  And the witness gave the following answer, that you "were one of the persons who sent vehicles to take corpses of the Tutsi to public cemeteries or burial grounds.  Tutsis were slaughtered like animals along the road.  I can't tell you that" -- and then he gave your position -- "told me to go and kill Tutsis, but I had informed him of the events.  He couldn't, in response, order me to go and kill Tutsi, because there were people already doing that.  Everybody could realise that the Tutsi were being killed."  He goes on to say that "I reported to him once, twice, thrice, and he did not act, which means that he supported that plan.  I can't tell you that you," referring to you, "gave me any specific order, but at one point he did say, 'Mr. Conseiller, forget that problem.'  When I spoke to him of the massacre of the Tutsi, he told me, 'Well, forget that problem,' but I can't tell you -- but I can't say that he gave me the order to go and kill Tutsi." 

Now, having heard the exact testimony, is your answer still the same, that you never said that to any conseiller?  
A.	Counsel, you certainly realise that this testimony contains inconsistencies.  I told you the truth regarding the burial of those people who were killed.  The commune did not have any vehicle.  It was the hygiene service of the préfecture office which was responsible for that activity.  I had nothing to do with the removal of those dead bodies, so I do not see why that witness involved me in the operation to remove dead bodies.  

What I said was, when I arrived there, people were being killed.  I never told anyone to go and kill people.  That person reported to me about the prevailing situation.  As I said, I did not have the means to stop the killings, but I did not order that anyone be killed.

THE WITNESS (continued):
He expressly said that I never ordered him to go and kill, and since I did not do so for that person, I did not do that for anybody else.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But did you tell this conseiller to forget the problem of the Tutsi? 
A.	Counsel, how could I have said such a thing?  I never said such a thing.  And, in principle, I was not supposed to say such a thing.  In my conscience, I did not support the killings. 
Q.	And, Witness ALG, I'll tell you that I also don't believe you said such a thing.  But we have the problem of Prosecution witnesses coming here and telling lies and for that -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry.  I should not have to object for a comment like that.  I've objected much -- many more times than I'd want to today, and it's not my habit to interrupt the Defence counsel; but that's an inappropriate -- and, you know, the Court should -- should direct Mr. Robinson to refrain from asking questions like that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, the witness seemed to be thinking that I was suggesting that he had, in fact, made the statement when, in fact, it's our position that he didn't make that statement, and that the witness, UB, lied when he testified to that effect.  And I thought it was only fair that I inform the witness that I'm not disbelieving his version of events on that point, and that it's the other witness who we believe is falsely testifying. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Our problem is that you can't abuse the fact-finding function of the Court.  We are interested in the witness's testimony, and you will have the opportunity to address us on these issues at a later stage. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, on the 14th of April 1994, did you participate in a meeting at Nyakibanda secteur to introduce the new conseiller, Grégoire Nyirimanzi?  That's N-Y-I-R-I-M-A-N-Z-I.
A.	Yes, that meeting took place.  I attended that ceremony. 
Q.	And did you attend that ceremony at the instructions of Préfet Renzaho? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	And at that ceremony **************the participants, the members of the population, to assist the conseiller in restoring security and to fight against the killings and the troublemakers? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	Now, on that same day, the 14th of April 1994, did you hear the speech of President Sindikubwabo, which is in evidence as Exhibit D. NZ26, in which he called upon the population to forget about hatred, anger, or revenge, and to stay vigilant so that no one is unjustly treated? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, on that same day, the 14th of April, Préfet Renzaho spoke on the radio -- and this is Exhibit D. NZ78 -- that there had been a meeting at the communal level and at the secteur level and it had been agreed at this meeting that meetings should be organised in each secteur to convince the population that the country needs peace and tranquility, and he went on to say that "I would like to warn with all my energy some unscrupulous groups who continue to perpetrate shameful acts," and that instructions had been given to security personnel that whoever was caught in such barbaric acts of looting or killing should be punished accordingly. 

Did you hear that message from Préfet Renzaho on the 14th of April? 
A.	No, sir.  I do not know whether this message was made public.  He knew full well the prevailing situation then, and I find it difficult to imagine how he could have conveyed such a message, because I think he knew very well what was the prevailing situation in the cellules and the secteurs.  I did not hear such a message, because I am at pains to imagine how he could have conveyed such a message on account of the prevailing state of affairs.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, with your permission, I'm going to ask that this witness, over the lunch break, be given access to Exhibit D. NZ78, which is in Kinyarwandan, so that I could ask him some more questions about it when he -- when we resume.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, meanwhile, we can go on a little bit further and discuss the situation as it occurred on the 16th of April 1994.  And I'm going to read to you from another UNAMIR daily situation report dated 16 April 1994.  And in this report it reports that RPF troops continue to enter Kigali.  I'm reading from paragraph 3:  "They are coming by foot and carry luggage and other stuff on their backs.  They infiltrate the city very carefully in order to have no losses or injuries."  

Now, was it true that the RPF was, in fact, infiltrating Kigali during April 1994? 
A.	Yes.  You've said that there was fighting here and there within Kigali town when the RPF was controlling parts of Kigali town. 
Q.	But the parts that they were not controlling, is it not true that they were infiltrating people into those areas? 
A.	That is possible.  But what we could observe was that RPF was occupying one area and was continuing to fight. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that the situation report of -- dated 16 April 1994 be marked as Exhibit ID. NZ42. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ42 marked for identification)  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness ALG -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I know that we will be addressing the matter of these reports on Wednesday, but I'm still concerned about the way the question is being asked.  Because even though this is cross-examination, to me it seems inappropriate that Mr. Robinson should read the text of the document and then put a question.  Because we're going into a new area that is not something that is directly on point from the direct examination, it seems to me it would be more appropriate to ask a question, and then when you -- when he receives an answer, then to go into a document, that may be somewhat different.  

But I'm a bit uncomfortable with the way the questions are being organised because it -- it's -- with this as an example, and only for purposes of example, the way the word "infiltrate" was used in this document I don't think is the same way that it was put in the question to the witness, because we went from the entry of RPF troops into Kigali to a conceptual jump of the RPF infiltrating areas that were not under its control.  So that's my concern, and I'll rely on the Court's guidance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a double-edged sword that we are speaking about because if you look at the document, you see the context of the word "infiltrate."  

Yes.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, the -- the war that went on in Kigali in April 1994 was not a war in which there was one front with a line between the belligerents, but it was a civil war in which various portions of the city were engaged.  Isn't that true? 
A.	That is not true, Counsel.  It was a war.  There was a war front and then there were belligerents.  There were two opposing camps.  Unfortunately, what was observed was that not only the belligerents were those fighting one another, because when there is a war, each belligerent tries to occupy territory.  Unfortunately, in Rwanda there was war and then there was a genocide.  

I'm not denying that there was a war in Rwanda, but what makes me uncomfortable is that civilians who were not involved in the fighting and who were not armed were killed.  You see, a category of the population, an ethnic group, was attacked.  True, there was a war, The RPF was trying to capture power, and the regular army, supported by the Interahamwe, was trying to push back the RPF.  To me, that was not the problem.  The problem was that unarmed civilians were killed during that war, killed by armed men. 
Q.	Witness ALG, we will talk about the issue of roadblocks and infiltration when we return.
MR. ROBINSON:
But perhaps this would be a good time for the afternoon break, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.  

We take the lunch adjournment now.  And, Mr. Witness, I remind you, as usual, about not discussing the case or your testimony. 
(Court recessed at 1234H)
(Pages 37 to 40 by Ann Burum)


























(Court resumed at 1408H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

You may continue, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you and good afternoon, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, you have -- have you now had a chance to read Exhibit D. NZ78, the speech of        Préfet Renzaho broadcast on Radio Rwanda on the 14th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I have read the document, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, you have told us on direct examination on the 27th of August 2006 that you had only heard           Préfet Renzaho call for the killings to stop on one occasion, which was at a security meeting at the préfecture office in May.  And that even on that occasion, he didn't mean it with his heart.  

Now, looking at the speech of the 14th of April, is it not true that Préfet Renzaho very strongly and emphatically called for an end to the killings? 
A.	Counsel, it is true that the words uttered and broadcast over the radio are correct, and that they were well willing.  But if they are not translated in action -- into action, then they are useless; they are nothing but words.  And it is true that some of the actions mentioned in the text were actually conducted.  But the problem is the one that I have just raised. 
Q.	And did you hear on the 17th of April 1994 the speech of President Sindikubwabo where he condemned the criminals who did not abide by the government's instructions and asked that they be punished exemplarily.  And he asked the authorities to act as one and stop the behaviour, and said that any civil servant taking part in these activities would never be pardoned; and that while people were killing each other, the enemy was accomplishing his programme." Did you hear that speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 17th of April, which is in evidence as Exhibit D. NZ27? 
A.	It is very possible, Counsel, that those speeches were broadcast over the radio and I did not hear them.  It is true that I did not hear those words uttered, but it is very possible, however, that they might have been broadcast and that they merely did not reach my ears. 
Q.	Did you hear on the 17th of April 1994, a communiqué from the minister of defence, Augustin Bizimana, in which he called for Radio Rwanda, RTLM and Radio Muhabura to desist from making any remarks which would cause division among Rwandans and to help them cultivate the spirit of tolerance among Rwandans, and for the population to stop killing each other so that peace is restored, and that is from D. NZ125? 
A.	I did not hear that speech either, Counsel.  The problem is that despite the existence of all of these speeches, nothing was actually put into action because they knew that the organs that would be able to put that into action were not functioning, but what was done to punish people.  People talked about sanctions, but who was there to put those sanctions in place?  It was the government who was requesting for this to be done.  But nobody ever sanctioned RTLM, for example.  

And sometimes, in order to free their conscience, people would utter words of this type.  But the problem is that behind all of that lies different intentions entirely, whereas Bizimana, who held -- who gave such a speech.  Do you think that, as a minister of defence, he could be sincere in pronouncing such a speech when people were being killed?  He talks about RTLM, but he does nothing to stop those programmes from being broadcast.  He continues to talk about RTLM frequently.  You know, he can give beautiful speeches at the time, but that doesn't mean that anything concrete was ever done. 
Q.	Did you hear the speech of Sindikubwabo in Gikongoro on the 18th of April 1994, in which he said that each person should be the gendarme of his neighbour and assist in maintaining order and peace, and that everyone should master his temper and chase out the spirit of revenge, which is in evidence as Exhibit D. NZ20?
A.	I did not hear that speech, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, on the 18th of April 1994, the special representative of the United -- of the secretary general, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh sent a cable to Kofi Annan in New York.  And this is number 14 in my package of exhibits.  And in that cable he reported that there was currently a vacuum in the political leadership of the country.  And he noted that, "What is equally baffling is the complete disappearance of the leaders of the political parties.  And, presumably, they too have left the city or are in hiding the city."  Is that consistent with your knowledge of the situation as of the 18th of April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, I know that he is describing the situation as it was, and he talks about a vacuum.  And it is true to say that the political leaders in opposition at the time were killed.  So, I believe that he is describing the situation in an authentic manner, in view of the fact, notably, that that government was set up on the 9th of April 1994.  And excluded from that government was the amajyogi or the people who were also described as no power.  And they were said, as a faction, to be close to the RPF, which meant that no Tutsi was part of that government set up on the 9th of April 1994.  This was set up by pro-power.  

So you will understand that not the entire population was represented within the government.  And I think that Mr. Kofi Annan's special representative describes the situation well.  And it shows, or goes to show that the government was not a strong one. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, you spoke of amajyogi.  What is that?  Is it an acronym, a name?  Could you spell it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, excuse me, Mr. President, I apologise.  I did not spell what I said.  Amajyogi is spelled A-M-A-J-Y-O-G-I, A-M-A-J-Y-O-G-I.  Now, there was schism between the parties.  There was a pro-MRND faction.  That was the L power or the Hutu Power.  And the other faction was called the amajyogi.  It is a Kinyarwanda word that was used to describe those people.  That is the people who had been put to one side.  And they were said to be -- in propaganda, they were said to be pro-RPF. 

That faction that was not Hutu Power, was not represented in the government that was set up on the 9th of April.  It was the faction where the pro-Power factions were represented within the government on the 9th of April.  So that government did not count or not have any Tutsi minister.  However, the people who were qualified as amajyogi were killed.  I do not know if it was necessary for me to tell you that for you to understand the situation better.  Those who were not killed, fled.  And the example that I can give you is that of the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  And I shall spell it for you U-W-I-L-I-N-J-M-A-N-A (sic), Agathe.  The other example would that of Kavaruganda, Joseph.  And he was the president of the cour de cassation.  He was the one who was to monitor the taking of the oath of the ministers in the interim government.  It is spelt K-A-V-A-R-U-G-A-N-D-A.  

And that was one of the Hutus who was a member of the amajyogi factor.  There was also Tutsis.  There was Landouald Ndasingwa who was the vice-president of the PL party.  And that is spelt, N-D-A-S-I-N-G-W-A; and a few other people.  The list can be long if we try and think about it in detail.  Those people who were not killed were hiding here and there.  And amongst those who were hiding was Faustin Twagiramungu, who was the president of the -- Twagiramungu is spelt T-W-A-G-I-R-A-N -- 
THE ENGLISH INTEPRETER:
It is too fast, I'm afraid, the spelling, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, just spell it a bit slower. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  Twagiramungu is spelt T-W-A-G-I-R-A-M-U-N-G-A (sic). 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I remind you that the question that precipitated that ten minute answer was, "How do you spell amajyogi?"  And I know you are anxious to prosecute these Accused and to bring out all of the information that could be used to convict them, but I ask you to refrain from acting in the role of prosecutor, and put yourself in the role of witness and answer the questions that are asked of you.  Otherwise, your time here in Arusha will be very long.
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, Mr. President, I would like to ask you to -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour, I would request that the Court intervene and give the appropriate instructions to the witness.  What Mr. Robinson said was totally inappropriate and, you know, this has been going on for some time and I wish that the Court would say something, because Mr. Robinson's comments are what are inappropriate, not the witness's response.  The witness was responding to an inquiry from the Court to a term that we had never heard before in this case.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, the witness gave an answer that I could actually spend about three-quarters of the day exploring, considering the killing of the people on the 7th of April, and the killings by the RPF on the same day.  And so, I think that someone has to take control of these proceedings.  And I think it would be a good idea to have the witness instructed just to answer a question, otherwise we will have the same problems that we had with Witness UB, who took the session, the second session section entirely to himself.  And I'm trying to avoid that.  And this witness, that was a gross example of how he took a question of simply how to spell a word and turned it into a political speech. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't intend to get involved with this type of issue.  Basically, he is your witness, you have to control him.  He is your witness at the moment. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It was your question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know.  Well, you see, I don't have -- I have not spent months doing research, so these issues I don't know what they are.  I'm like a blotting paper at the moment, accepting information.  I was interested in the spelling.  And if you wish to explore the issue then this is a matter for you.  We don't really want you to go on a wild goose chase which has no reference to the case.  

But what I think Mr. Webster's point was, you made a comment which was sort of like threatening the witness, and I don't think that was appropriate. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Then I would make a motion, Mr. President, to simply strike the last answer, other than the spelling of the word amajyogi.  And I can move on to other things. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  I think the witness's answer was responsive.  If Mr. Robinson wants to spend another        two days or three days in cross-examination, he has that right.  We are here for justice to be done.  And if he thinks it takes that long in order to explore this point, then that is what he should do. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I am ready to do that. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, you know that is not necessary.  He has not said anything that we haven't heard already. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I beg to differ, Your Honour. I think he just brought up the splits within the political parties, the consequences of those splits, the killings of individuals after the 6th of April from the various factions.  And I think that the best thing to do is just to -- that information was totally unresponsive to the question.  And if you are going to maintain some control, include the use of time, the best thing to do is to strike the answer.  But if the answer has to stand, then we have to deal with it.  And it is not fair. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, if you think it is in your interest, your client's interest to go into those matters, well maybe you should.  But, you know, sometimes in cross-examination you might -- it might turn out to be a risk to explore matters which you don't know what the answers will be.  So you have to weigh carefully your decision to go into those matters. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think you know me well enough to know that I am a risk taker.  So, I will take those risks; that is how I am.  And I'm not afraid of the truth either.  And I -- if he says something that is not the truth, I will bring other witnesses to prove it.  So, I think the best thing to do would be to strike the testimony.  Otherwise, I'm going to stop my cross-examination outline, as I have done it, and I am going to go into this area, and we will spend as long as it takes.  But it was a non-responsive answer.  The Trial Chamber is supposed to exclude non-responsive answers as part of its management.  And I'm asking you to do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I may interject one last comment.  We are look at the daily -- at the CaseView.  And as I read it here it states -- my eyesight is very poor.  You get up and say it. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Mr. President, the witness was actually responding to a question that you put to him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We -- 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
You have seen it in the transcript?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Oh, very well then.
MR. PRESDIENT:
We have, in fact, come to a decision on the matter. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we have decided not to exclude the matter.  

MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, speaking of killings that took on the 7th of April, it is true, is it not, that people were killed by the RPF on the 7th of April in Remera and other areas, who would be members of the other faction, not the amajyogi, but what might be considered the power faction; is that correct?
A.	I do not know that, Counsel.  Remera is in Kacyiru -- was in Kacyiru commune.  Kacyiru is spelt K-A-C-Y-I-R-U.  Remera is spelt R-E-M-E-R-A.  Otherwise, no I do not know that, Counsel. 
Q.	Are you aware that the former préfet of Kigali, whose last name was Habarushyaka,  H-A-B-A-R-U-S-H-A (sic), Claudien was murdered by the RPF on the 7th of April in his home? 
A.	I did not know that, Counsel.
Q.	Did you know that the préfet of Ruhengeri, Sylvestre -- Sylvestre Baliyanya, B-A-L-I-Y-A-N-Y-A, was killed by the RPF on the 7th of April in his home in Kigali? 
A.	I was not aware of that, Counsel.  I heard it said that he lived in Remera, but that is not in     Nyarugenge commune.  I did not know of the circumstances of his death. 
Q.	And even after all of this time that you spent in prison and all of the information that you collected over the years, you never learned that these two individuals had been killed by the RPF on the 7th of April? 
A.	Perhaps if I put -- asked a question, I would have been told, or if I heard people speaking on it, I would have heard it; whereas, I never heard anyone ever speak of it. 
Q.	And did you ever wonder why the préfet of Ruhengeri was replaced on the 17th of April 1994, and a new préfet was appointed? 
A.	No, I did not ask myself about that.  I didn't wonder about that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President, for the delay, but since I didn't expect this information to be part of my cross-examination, I'm having to obtain information from my client and my team as we are going.  This may delay things a little bit, but I will try to do the best I can. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you hear that Emmanuel Bahigiki, that is B-A-H-I-G-I-K-I, the secretary general of the ministry of planning was killed on the 7th of April by the RPF in his home? 
A.	I was not informed of the death of that person, Counsel. 
Q.	And would you tell us that you are completely unaware of any persons in the government that were killed by RPF on the 7th of April? 
A.	You are speaking of the 7th of April, and someone was killed -- who could that be?  I haven't really thought about it, but who could that be, Counsel?  
Q.	I have just given you the names of four people. 
A.	You -- the people you mentioned, I answered that I didn't know that they were killed, or were deceased in the way that you have described.  And I think that you seem to have a problem there.  You think it is strange, but those people, unless I am mistaken, did not live in Nyarugenge commune.  I really do not see where they were living in Nyarugenge.  Nyarugenge is spelt, N-Y-A-R-U-G-E-N-G-E, Nyarugenge. 
Q.	Were you aware that the conseiller of Gisozi and the conseiller of Kacyiru secteurs were killed by the RPF in April 1994? 
A.	I did not have this information.  I was not aware of this.  I didn't know of this, because one of the conseiller you mentioned, that one of Gikondo, it was said that it was the Interahamwe that killed him and not the RPF.  You understand yourself that -- I did not know of that.  I think it should be checked out thoroughly, especially regarding the conseiller of Gikondo. 
Q.	Witness, I didn't say of Gikondo, I said the conseiller of Gisozi and the conseiller of Kacyiru secteurs, those conseiller were killed by the RPF, weren't they? 
A.	I did not know that.  You are saying that the conseiller of Kacyiru was killed at that time during the war.  No, you should check carefully, the conseiller of Kacyiru, it was not during the war.  You have to check that thoroughly, I think. 
Q.	Okay.  I think we are having a problem of communication.  I did not say the conseiller of Kicukiro -- excuse me, my microphone just went off.   

We are going to start this all over again because I think we are having some problems with communication.  I asked you about two secteurs. 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	The first was Gisozi.  That is spelt, G-I-S-O-Z-I.  The second was Kacyiru, K-A-C-Y-I-R-U.  So, do you understand which two secteurs I am speaking of, Gisozi and Kacyiru? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I first heard mention of the conseiller of Gikondo.  Second time I heard Kacyiru.   

Now as for the Kacyiru conseiller, he is still alive today.  He is at home, at home, at his place of residence.  So, he is not dead.  I know that well because last month I met him. 
Q.	And this is the person who was conseiller of Kacyiru secteur as of the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, he who was conseiller at the time.  I'm speaking of Kacyiru secteur, K-A-C-Y-I-R-U, K-A-C-Y-I-R-U.  I know him well.  His name is Elie Dusabe.  Dusabe is spelt D-U-S-A-B-E, D-U-S-A-B-E.  He is alive and as I have -- as I have said, I met him last month. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness ALG.  I am going to check on that information.  What about the conseiller of Gisozi? 
A.	Well, thank you, Counsel.  As to the Gisozi conseiller, I was not aware of that information concerning him. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much, Witness ALG.  And now we are going to talk about the history of -- 
A.	Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	I want to ask you some questions about the history of the development of the two factions of the political parties in Rwanda.  And I take you back to 1992, to approximately May or June of 1992.  Were you aware of a meeting that the opposition political parties had with the RPF in Brussels during that period?  
A.	Yes, I did hear of that. 
Q.	And that was very well publicised in Rwanda, was it not? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And is it not true that certain of the political party leaders met with representatives of the RPF and agreed to form a coalition in opposition to President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, isn't it also true that shortly after that meeting in Brussels, even within days, the RPF launched an attack against Rwanda in violation of the cease fire agreement that existed at the time? 
A.	Counsel, when you say of -- speak of "a few days", what do you have in mind?  How much time?  
Q.	I have in mind the attack of the RPF in Byumba on the 5th of June 1992; perhaps five days after the meeting in Brussels with the RPF. 
A.	That is possible, apart from the fact that it wasn't spoken of a great deal.  I mean, that attack in comparison to the attack on Ruhengeri. 
Q.	But it is true, is it not, that when the RPF attacked Byumba in June 1992, it occupied territory in Rwanda which remained occupied by the RPF throughout the war? 
A.	Yes, that is well known, that the RPF occupied a part of Rwanda.  That is well known, Counsel. 
Q.	And it is also well known, is it not, that as a result of that attack on Byumba in June 1992, that people were displaced and they were forced to leave their homes in Byumba, and come into camps, refugee camps? 
A.	Yes, that is common knowledge, Counsel. 
Q.	And so the RPF attack in Byumba in June 1992 caused a lot of human suffering, did it not? 
A.	That is correct.  But it depends on one's understanding.  When you say many people, that there were many people who suffered, it is an exaggeration.  But it is obvious when people leave their property they can't be happy.  And they can't be happy with the state of war, and that is quite understandable. 
Q.	And it is true, also, is it not, that shortly after this attack on Byumba, Faustin Twagiramungu was heard on the radio to say that as far as he was concerned, he didn't mind if the RPF occupied Byumba or part of the territory of Rwanda; is that correct? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	And would you agree that as a result of the attack of the RPF and shortly after -- within five days of negotiations with the opposition, and in light of the statement by Twagiramungu, that members of the MDR party, in particular, began have dissension within the MDR, some believing that an alliance with the RPF was the best way for the party, such as Twagiramungu; and others believing that the RPF wanted to take power by force, and it was not good to be aligned with the RPF.  Is that a fair description of the fissure which took place in the MDR, following the attack in Byumba? 
A.	Counsel, as of 1990, when they started combat in the RPF, it wasn't only then that they started to fight the RPF.  But the fact is that there were negotiations, and then Twagiramungu's speech took place.  And -- but the population did not know why there were different factions in the political party.  The population didn't know where to turn because they couldn't understand the situation prevailing at that time among the political parties. 
Q.	But would you agree that the split among the political parties that ultimately left -- led to the creation of this power wing and this amajyogi wing began when the people in the parties questioned whether an alliance with the RPF was a correct thing to do for the country? 
A.	Counsel, never mind how the people perceived things, understood things, the fact is that negotiations continued throughout that period.  It is known; there was a signing of the Arusha Accords on the        4th of August 1993.  So the members -- the people thought that after signing -- the signing of the accords the situation would improve.  The negotiations were high politics.  But what for the people mattered was that the situation would improve. 
Q.	Now, I'm focusing my questions now on the creation of the amajyogi and power wings of these parties, and so let's stay in 1992 for a moment.  Is it not true that -- 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Did you have something you wanted to say?
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  But I was saying even yesterday and before the Court I said that the formalisation of the factions was in '93.  That is when the people learned of the factions, after the death of Ndadaye, after Karamira pronounced at the speech where he mentioned Hutu Power.  It was in October 1993.  And that was when the public was made aware that such factions existed.  And that is also when they also started speaking of the amajyogi.  That is when the public, the people knew.  It was publicly known that there were a amajyogi faction and a Hutu Power faction.  

But at political rallies from the speeches made, one could see that there was dissension.  I might have a lot to say about that, all of that, but that is the -- what I essentially wanted to say on the topic.  But the problem is that subsequently a genocide took place.  But apart from the speeches made, when we didn't know that it would result one day in a genocide.  

In any case it would not -- one cannot -- to claim that there was a dissension in the political parties is not an excuse.  It is not a justification for genocide. 
Q.	Well, it is true, is it not, that the mandate of the prime minister and the government of                   Dismas Nsengiyaremye was to expire in July 1992, correct? 
A.	No, that is not true.  It was to expire in July 1993, rather. 
Q.	Yes, that is correct, I'm sorry about that.  And now, is it not true that among the factions of the MDR, when they had this split, there was not only political posturing - or, people with different political positions about what is best for the country, but there was also personal jockeying for post at this time?  
A.	Yes, thank you for saying that.  That is the way most people saw it.  That is the way -- that is what we could see.  So you had some people in the MDR that were in favour of -- alliance with the RPF.  And you had some people in the MDR that were against that.  But also you had some people in the MDR that were in favour of the Twagiramungu wing because they thought they could get political post.  And you had some that were in favour of what would be known as the power wing, because they thought they could get a political post; isn't that correct?  
A.	That is very true. 
Q.	And so being in the power wing or being in the amajyogi wing did not necessary -- was not necessarily a question of ideology, but in some cases it was also just a question of personal ambition, correct? 
A.	Well, thank you for mentioning ideology.  Of course, they used the ideology to obtain positions.  Those who were on the Hutu Power side, said that the Hutu were the majority to convince people that they deserved to occupy those post. 
Q.	You know what, now I would like to ask you about an event in July 1993, and I may not have this exactly right, but wasn't there convened for the MDR party what was called the Kabusunzu congress?  And if I am saying the word right, if you can spell it please? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And could you spell Kabusunzu for us please? 
A.	Kabusunzu, K-A-B-U-S-U-N-Z-U, Kabusunzu. 
Q.	And is it true that at that congress, members of the MDR voted to elect new leaders, and to expel some old leaders from the MDR party? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And what was the fate of Faustin Twagiramungu in that congress? 
A.	I think you have just said it, haven't you.  In the course of that MDR congress, not everyone attended.  And Twagiramungu, who was the party president, the participants in the congress said that he was excommun -- ejected from the party.  Other people were also ejected, or expelled.  I don't know if you want me to name them, but, of course, as I just mentioned, especially the case of Twagiramungu. 
Q.	And isn't one of the people who were expelled, the latter to be prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And -- 
A.	She was also expelled. 
Q.	And did that congress take the step of designating Jean Kambanda as the person that the MDR party wanted to see as prime minister? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And isn't it true -- so, this was in July of 1993 before the death of president -- it was before the death of President Ndadaye in October of 1993, so would you agree with me that the party of the MDR was pretty divided even before the assassination of the president of Burundi? 
A.	That is correct, I agree with you on that point. 
Q.	Now, if we are just talking on a question of ideology, you would agree, would you not, that 
	Faustin Twagiramungu would be a lot less acceptable to the MRND than Jean Kambanda in July 1993 as prime minister of Rwanda? 
A.	Counsel, it was a very complicated political game.  And I would say that the MRND was constantly looking for reasons for the MDR party to be divided into two, for there to be divisions within the        MDR party that is.  And I believe that the MRND supported Twagiramungu's candidacy.  But then subsequently the MDR wanted to fight that faction.  It was a very complicated political game.

One day you could see that faction represented by such and such a person, and then another day represented by an entirely different person.  So, that was the MRND party that was playing that game.  One day the MRND party would hide behind Twagiramungu, and then the next day they would be represented by somebody entirely different.

1500H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I think, Witness, we understand each other very well.  That is really my point, that the politics of that time -- the split between the parties and what was going on there, it was not ethnic in nature, would you agree?  It was based on personalities, an alliance, as it was not an ethnic game at that point; don't you agree?
A.	Even if that was the case, the ethnic problem was not entirely excluded.  It wasn't very much on -- on the surface, but the ethnic problem did exist, as well. 
Q.	And since Twagiramungu favoured RPF -- an alliance with the RPF and you seem to say that the MRND was supporting Twagiramungu at that time, that would be contrary to the interests who wanted to exterminate the Tutsi, would it not?
A.	Counsel, you have just said that we agree.  There were political interests.  There was a very complex game in the high political spheres, one -- on a specific day the MRND would be behind Twagiramungu and then at a later stage the parties would abandon Twagiramungu and support somebody else.  The interests were purely political.  People were merely trying to obtain positions, status and some people said that the majority of the population was behind them, but we know that they were seeking a position.  The MRND party did not always get on with Twagiramungu.  They were together with Nsengiyaremye beforehand, but when Twagiramungu was to become prime minister, I shall spell Nsengiyaremye --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
THE WITNESS:
N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-E-Y-E -- sorry for the speed.  Nsengiyaremye had a mandate for one year.  Twagiramungu was in agreement with that.  But we know that he was after the post of prime minister, as well.  And according to the Arusha peace accords that Twagiramungu supported, with a view to being the prime minister of the government, the interim government, he thought that he would be in a strong position if he made an agreement with the RPF, because he wanted to overthrow Nsengiyaremye, and that is why he stayed with the MRND.  That was the first time that I heard of such a situation.  And the peace accords mentioned the future prime minister, and his name was openly mentioned in the Arusha peace accords, and that is why he felt in a strong position, notably that the peace accords had mentioned his name.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In fact, on the 4th of August 1994, President Habyarimana signed those peace accords which called for power sharing; correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And after that, it was just is a scramble for posts, wasn't it, in these opposition parties?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	So let's talk about the PL party for a bit.  Now, it's true, is it not, that Justin Mugenzi was a very virulent opponent of President Habyarimana after the beginning of multipartyism?
A.	Yes, that is true.  At the beginning of the multiparty politics -- I shall spell Mugenzi: M-U-G-E-N-Z-I.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
THE WITNESS:
At the beginning of multipartyism, he did -- he was, in fact, an opponent of President Habyarimana, right from the start.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And do you recall in March of 1992 he made a speech about all of the efforts of his party would go into combating the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, I do remember that.
Q.	And on a regular basis, from 1992 through sometime in 1993, Justin Mugenzi was one of the most vocal critics of the Habyarimana administration; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And in the party, PL, of which he was president, there were many, many Tutsis; correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And for many years Justin Mugenzi was a champion of the rights of the Tutsis or the minority in the country; correct?
A.	I believe he did not talk publicly about the rights of Tutsis and in such a fashion.  He, rather, wanted for there to be political change and he was fighting for political change and a change of political power.
Q.	And would you agree that a large number of Tutsis felt sufficiently comfortable with Justin Mugenzi that they supported him as president of their party, the PL?
A.	That is true, but at the beginning of multiparty politics they supported Justin Mugenzi; however, later on, a problem arose.  I don't know whether you are going to put questions to me on the subject of what happened later, or whether you want me to mention it now.
Q.	Why don't you go ahead and mention it now?
A.	Yes.  Thank you, Counsel.  At a later stage -- or, should I say, it is true that at the beginning, Mugenzi was fighting for a change of power and he would openly say that Tutsis were being persecuted, particularly, in Bugesera where he gave a speech when he was in Kanazi sous-préfecture.  I shall spell that: K-A-N-A-Z-I, Kanazi.  I should also B-U-G-E-S-E-R-A, Bugesera.

So, he gave a speech in Kanazi, in Bugesera, and he said that he regretted the fact that the Tutsis of that region were being persecuted; however, at a later stage he showed that he was fighting in his own interest, and in view of the fact that most Tutsis belonged to a political party, he took fright that they might overthrow him and that he might no longer hold the position of president of that party.  I know that one of your clients talked to me about that specifically.  Mugenzi, then, supported the MRND party because he wanted the MRND party to support him, for him to carry on in his position as president of the PL party, and also for many Hutus to be able to enter the fold of the party.  In view of the fact that one of your clients talked to me about it, he also said that by recruiting a greater number Hutus within his party, he would have more people voting in his favour and that is why I took the side of the 
	MRND party.  He ceased to fight against the MRND party, and he supported the Power party.  And on 16th of January 1994 the MRND held a rally to which he was invited, and he took the floor in order to support the MRND party.  And on that occasion, he said that those who did not accept the revolution of 1959 would come to harm.
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, in the period leading up to the swearing-in of the transitional government, that's the period between August of '93 when the power-sharing accord was signed and January of '94 when the swearing-in was supposed to happen, isn't it true what you had in Rwanda was essentially a jockeying for numbers to see who would have a majority and a blocking minority within the new transitional government; correct?
A.	Counsel, I would like you to specify the question -- the period in question.  If you want me to talk about jockeying for posts or the sharing of power, what period are you referring to precisely, January 1994?
Q.	I am referring to the period after August of 1993, when it was known how many posts each party would get, and the time when the swearing-in of that government would take place.  Isn't it true that during that period what was going on in Rwanda in politics was a making of alliances, the RPF was trying to make their alliances, the MRND was trying to be their alliances; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes.  It is true that there was to be a sharing of posts but, in view of the speeches that were given and the political demonstrations that were organised, that is why the swearing-in did not take place on the 5th of January 1994.  The different parties did not understand each other, and that is why the members of those parties did not attend the swearing-in ceremony on the 5th of January 1994, because there were problems.  And, Counsel, I believe that the day before yesterday you gave to me a speech -- that is, last week -- you gave to me a speech by Mathieu Ngirumpatse and we could see from the content of that speech that there was a problem and that they had not yet reached a compromise and there was to be a further dialogue, so that shows that there was a problem and that that is why the swearing-in did not occur.
Q.	And the problem was that for the MDR party and for the PL party, the leaders could not agree on who would occupy the posts that had been allocated to those parties; correct?
A.	Yes, Counsel, you have put it very well.
Q.	And if the parties allied -- if the wings of the parties, the Amajyogi party, for example -- if the people from that wing were to occupy the posts, it would shift the balance of power in the transitional government to the RPF, whereas if the people who were to occupy those posts for the MDR and the PL were from the other wing of the party, it would shift the balance of power in the transitional government towards the MRND; correct?
A.	That is correct, Counsel, that was the situation as it was.
Q.	And this was Hutus squabbling among Hutus, wasn't it?
A.	Yes, because of the interests involved.  Some Hutus were members of the Hutu Power faction, and when President Habyarimana was sworn in in the month of April, there was another faction that was said to be pro-RPF.  So, everyone was fighting in order to have a majority of posts within the parliament or within the government.  You know the situation better than I do.  There were times when people talked about censorship, but there were problems because the different factions could not reach a compromise.
Q.	Now, directing your attention to the 5th of January 1994, you were aware, were you not, in the morning of that day President Habyarimana was sworn in as the president under the new Arusha Accords power-sharing government; correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And are you also aware the only party that did not appear at that swearing-in ceremony was the RPF?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And then at three o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th of January, the members of the national assembly under the transitional government were scheduled to be sworn in, but that did not occur because of a disagreement over who would occupy those posts, whether it would be members of the Amajyogi wing, or members of so-called Power wing; correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And over the period following from January of 1994, all the way up through the end of March 1994, different mechanisms, negotiations, court cases, were used to try to solve this problem; correct?
A.	I think that the situation was as you described it, but it was a question of political decisions.  We were ordinary people, but we could see, in view of the demonstrations, that some people had been tried in court and that their case was pending, et cetera.
Q.	But could we agree that by the end of March 1994 compromises had been made within the MDR and PL parties and that those parties were ready to form the transitional government by having split the posts somewhat evenly between the two wings? 
A.	That is possible, but we did not have access to that information.  What did become apparent to the members of population was that problems had risen and that the swearing-in ceremony had still not taken place in the months of March (as interpreted) or even in the month of June, come to that, and even on the 6th of April 1994 --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the Kinyarwanda booth.
THE WITNESS:
-- that swearing-in ceremony had not taken place.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But you recall the fact that as of the end of March the only problem that remained to the setting-up of the transitional government was whether or not the CDR party would be allowed to be represented in the national assembly?
A.	Yes.  That problem was discussed considerably, and I remember that the members of the CDR and the Interahamwe organised a number of demonstrations on that subject. 
Q.	And were you also aware that on the 30th of March 1994 the Special Representative of the 
	Secretary General, as well as papal LaSalle, the representative of the Vatican, and the entire diplomatic corps of countries represented in Rwanda issued a press release in which they favoured the granting of the seat to the CDR since the CDR had signed a code of ethics called for under the broad-based transitional government?
A.	That is possible, but I was not aware of that information.
Q.	And isn't it a fact that, as of the 6th of April 1994, the RPF had lost the numbers game with the admission of the CDR and the compromise among the wings of the political party and so they took power by assassinating President Juvénal Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994?
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphones overlapping) ... objecting at this point.  First of all, the first portion of Mr. Robinson's question is factually inaccurate.  Is counsel saying that CDR was actually admitted to the coalition government?  I'm not sure that's accurate.  If he could provide us with a reference for that.  I think we've laboured through this long enough.  Mr. Robinson has stamped his feet enough in terms of prolonging this portion of his cross-examination.  Can we go on to something meaningful now?  It is 3:30.  I think we could all do with a break, and I would hope that when we return we could resume what started out to be a cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, your question was not really a question; it really is too argumentative.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Would you like to take the afternoon break at this time?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think so.
(Court recessed from 1530H to 1600H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, everybody seems to be smiling a bit more than before we took the break. 

Mr. Robinson, you may continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I propose to return to my outline of the events of the 18th 
and 19th of April, unless you have any other words you would like the witness to spell. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible).  You may continue. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  Mr. President, I had before the detour asked that the cable that I had read between Mr. Booh-Booh and Annan be marked as ID.  NZ43. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ43 marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, turning to the 19th of April 1994, I am referring now to document No. 15 in my group of exhibits, and this is a UNAMIR daily situation report of the 19th of April, and it indicates in paragraph 2 that the government is yet to be in full control of the situation.  And in paragraph 3, they report that the RPF troops continue to infiltrate into the city of Kigali, and that the troops carried out rescue operations in the area of Nyamirambo overnight to extricate over a hundred of their sympathisers.  And so I want to ask you, first of all, do you agree that as of the 19th of April, which happens to be the day of President Sindikubwabo's speech in Butare, that the government was yet to be in full control of the situation in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	And did you hear about that rescue operation on the 19th of April where the RPF infiltrated into the Nyamirambo?
MR. WEBSTER:
Can I request a clarification from Mr. Robinson, what he means by "infiltration", as he is putting that question to the witness, so that the question itself can be a bit more precise?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, sir, I could try to read to you again what the UNAMIR reported and you could tell me whether or not you were aware of those facts.  It says that:  "The RPF troops continue to infiltrate into the city of Kigali.  Troops carried out rescue operation in the area of Nyamirambo overnight to extricate over a hundred of their sympathisers."  Did you here about those things? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is the question, because I don't know what the author of this document meant when he used the words "infiltrate", but I am sure that Mr. Robinson or the Defence have their own conceptions of that word, and I am asking the Defence to articulate -- Mr. Robinson to articulate what he means when he is putting that question to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I think that's a matter you should develop in re-examination.  I have read the document, that is the word that is there.  And, in fact, one may be able to make a deduction as to its meaning from its context, but that is the word in the document. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The problem I have, Your Honour, is that if the document is being used to impeach the witness's credibility, there is a presumption we are making that the word -- the contents of the document are accurate and somehow the witness is less than accurate in how he responds to the question.  So well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the problem what I wanted you all to address us on because that's the way I referred to the double-edged sword.  On the one hand, I think if a document is being used to impeach the witness's credibility or reliability, it is very useful for the Court to actually read it so we can actually see the context of the -- in which the phrase is used to impeach the witness.  

On the other hand, without additional testimony, we are going to have some difficulty in assessing what weight to attach to the content of the document without some evidence of the material contained in the document.  We are not going to be -- we are going to have difficulty in determining what weight to attach to the information in the document.  And it was really hoped that when you are addressing us on this issue, that you will address that.  But at the same time, it is a matter, I think, for cross-examination, and if you think the word's meaning can be modified by its context, well, I would think that would be a matter that you would develop in re-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ALG, what I am asking you to do is simply take the words that are written, which I read to you now twice verbatim, and tell us whether or not that was also your understanding of the situation?  So the words are that "The RPF troops continue to infiltrate into the city of Kigali.  Troops carried out rescue operations in the area of Nyamirambo overnight, to extricate over a hundred of their sympathisers."  So can you tell us, did that take place as far as you know?  Was that the situation? 
A.	Before answering that question, Counsel, please allow me to request a clarification from you.  It would seem to me that the UNAMIR report that you have selected seems to be taking sides.  I would like to know whether the UNAMIR actually talked about the killings that were taking place.  I would like to know whether you are selecting specific reports while avoiding selecting others. 

Now, with a view to answering your question, I do not know whether the figures given by UNAMIR are correct, but what I do know is that before answering your question, I would like to say something else.  When talk -- when people talk about infiltration, I would like to know what exactly is described here because Nyamirambo is a vast area.  I would like to know the precise zone people were referring to or area.  The term "sympathiser" is also used here, and I do not quite understand what is meant by this term.  Are we referring here to RPF sympathisers?  I don't know.  Did the RPF have sympathisers in the Nyamirambo district or not?  That is the question that I am asking myself.  I do not know whether you understand what I mean here, Counsel, because I did not know whether Nyamirambo actually had RPF sympathisers.  That area was under government control and we did not know who the RPF sympathisers, as such, were. 
Q.	Well, Witness, I was merely asking whether you had heard of the operation of the RPF in Nyamirambo to extricate over a hundred people, whether they be sympathisers or not, around the 19th of April.  So did you know about that or didn't you? 
A.	I don't know whether that figure is correct, but the population of Nyamirambo said that the RPF had brought a number of people into the area, but I believe that the figure is exaggerated, and I am basing myself here on what the population of Nyamirambo had to say.
Q.	Thank you very much. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that the daily SITREP of the 19th of April 1994 be admitted as -- be marked as ID.  NZ44. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ44 marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I am going to turn back to the beginning remark that you made about a -- that whether I was selecting only the favourable portions of the UNAMIR reports, because I have a bone to pick with you on that topic myself.  First of all, you should know, if it is of any comfort to you, that there is not an issue in this case that many, many Tutsis were killed in Rwanda and in Kigali were massacred, and there is no justification for that, so that is not something that is an issue at the moment in your testimony.  And so to bring documents which prove that so many people were killed is not something that I have deemed to be necessary at this part of the trial.  And so I am selecting those documents that I think are relevant to Mr. Nzirorera's case and the Prosecution can select documents relevant to what they think is their case and that's how the adversary system works at this Tribunal.  But what I don't understand is that you, yourself, have been very selective in your testimony about speeches that you heard during the month of April 1994.  And it seems like a tremendous coincidence that the only time you switch on your little radio is when either you are being called to work on the 12th of April or you are being told to stay at home on the 7th of April - or, magically, you hear on the 19th of April, the speech of President Sindikubwabo in Butare, but you don't seem to have heard the somewhat near 50 speeches in which all members of all levels of Rwandan government, from the president, the prime minister, the minister of defence, all the way down to the préfet, were calling on people to stop the killing.  Now, why is it that you were only hearing those things that help the Prosecution's case, in your view? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I think I responded with reference to those speeches, and I told you how I understood those speeches.  You say that speeches were broadcast.  Let us take the example of the speech given by the president of the republic who repeats the same thing from the 12th to the 18th.  He would repeat the same thing in different speeches.  So, I wonder whether those speeches had, indeed, been broadcast because I did not hear them myself.  And even if they had been broadcast, as you say they were, they were impressive speeches, but they -- but he knew very well that the security organs of the country were not working, which brings me to say that even if those speeches were effectively broadcast, it was a pretext for people to feel good or have a good conscience because I was not the only person to have heard or not heard speeches.  And the speeches that were then made were with a view to inciting the population to kill each other. 

Now, speeches were made, but the truth was something quite different.  People were saying that the judicial authorities had to pursue criminals, but they knew very well that those authorities were not in place.  And other people were saying speeches that the gendarmes should go to the roadblocks, but they knew very well that the gendarmes were not around.  And then other people would say, well, people are being killed at roadblocks.  What do you think about that, Counsel?  Do you think that's correct or not?  I am wondering whether the contents of those speeches is, in fact, correct or whether those speeches were ever broadcast in the first place, in view of the fact that I did not hear them. 
(Pages 52 to 60 by Sithembiso Moyo)























1615H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I question the fact that you -- whether you really heard these speeches at the time and whether you simply don't want to bring any information favourable to the Accused, or whether, really, you didn't hear these speeches and weren't aware of them.  

What I would like you to do, if you could be shown my number 17 in my packet of exhibits that was distributed at the beginning of this week, it's a letter from the minister of interior to the préfets, and I'd like you to look at this letter and see if that refreshes your recollection as to whether or not you are in fact familiar with the contents of some of these speeches during April 1994.  

So if the registry could bring you a copy of that letter, I'd appreciate it. 

Witness ALG, what has been placed before is a letter dated the 21st of April 1994 from 
Faustin Munyazeza -- that's M-U-N-Y-A-Z-E-Z-A -- to the préfets in Rwanda, and in that letter he attaches three messages recently addressed by the president of the republic to the Rwandan people about this prevailing situation in the country, and those three messages are his speech on the 8th of April, which I believe you said was on the 9th, but you've already seen that speech, and on the 13th and 14th of April, speeches that you've said that you didn't hear. 

And then the minister of interior requested the préfets to pass on these messages to people in their districts in order to galvanise them to assure their own security and to keep all troublemakers at bay.  Now, given that*************************************************, can you tell us whether or not you ever were made aware of the contents of these speeches as instructed in this letter of the 21st of April?  
A.	Counsel, before answering your question, I would like to say that this document, as far as I'm concerned, has absolutely no value.  And why is that?  Well, Faustin Munyazeza, who signed this document and who was minister of interior and communal development, never occupied that post.  There is no signature appended to the document, there is no stamp, so I could quite simply believe that this document has been invented, because there is no signature, no stamp, and Munyazeza was not in post at that moment in time as a minister.  So what would lead me to believe this was an authentic letter?  Munyazeza was not even in the country at the time.  The document is not even stamped.  
Q.	So, Witness, the document is not signed, that's correct, and it may well have been that documents were issued in the name of the minister of interior during his absence from the country, but I call your attention to the K number at the top of the document, indicates that that document originates with the office of the Prosecutor here at the Tribunal.  So it's not something that the Defence has created or even had control over, but we received this copy from the Prosecutor.  But the point is -- or my question is whether or not you were aware of this message or these speeches?  Were those distributed to you in April of 1994?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, but just to clarify the record, when a document has a K number, it doesn't mean that it's authentic, it simply means that it was in the archives of the Office of the Prosecutor.  So I don't think it would be appropriate to leave the witness with the impression that somehow a document that bears a K number is authentic.  All it means is that we collected it from one location and moved it to another location. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's fine, Mr. President, I accept that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ALG, did you ever see -- did anybody ever distribute these three speeches to you?  Did you ever see this letter before? 
A.	Counsel, I do not believe that there is any point in responding to your question, because I do not know the existence of this letter, and in my mind it has no value.  It was addressed to the préfets, and I wonder whether a letter can be addressed to the préfets without signing it.  And if I were to answer your question with reference to this letter, I would be doing so despite the fact that it seems to me to be a rather dubious -- or of a rather dubious source. 
Q.	Did anyone make available to you the speeches of President Sindikubwabo on 8, 13, and 14 April during the period of April or May 1994? 
A.	Nobody transmitted those documents to me, Counsel.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time, I would ask that this letter, the French version, be marked as Exhibit ID. NZ45A and the English version as ID. NZ45B.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Robinson, this is outside the scope of the submissions we invited this morning, unless you wish them to be expanded. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, this is not the same situation as we've had this morning, because these are not UNAMIR documents for which authentication.  So this is now being asked to be marked for identification so that the -- we can all know what we were talking about, so in the future, if I'm able to bring a witness such as the acting minister of interior, Mr. Kalimanzira, who could identify this document, then it can be in the record so that we know we're talking about the same document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It can be marked for identification on that basis.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ45A and ID. NZ45B marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, you told us you heard the speech of President Sindikubwabo in Butare on the 
	19th of April.  Did you also hear the speech of Prime Minister Kambanda at the same meeting in which he asked the -- in which he said that the government had asked the political party leaders to stop the killing by their members, and the political party leaders had responded, and in that speech he again asked the population to avoid violence based on ethnic factors, and he called upon the bourgmestres to make sure that the population does not turn against one another and to bear in mind that "it's the RPF that we are fighting against."  And that's -- I'm making reference to Exhibit D. NZ31.  Did you hear that speech?  
A.	Counsel, you just said that this speech was given on the 19th.  I might have heard that speech on the next day, however.  He might have uttered those words, and the RPF was mentioned, but that was -- a portion of his speech that was broadcast.  I don't know whether it was in Gikongoro or Butare that that speech was made.  That's all I can remember.  I do not believe that he said that political party leaders had intervened in order to bring back a peaceful situation.  Even if they did that in other préfectures, they did not do so in Kigali.  
Q.	Now, did you hear the speech of President Sindikubwabo when he returned to Butare on the 
	24th of April at the Gisagara sous-préfecture -- that's G-I-S-A-G-A-R-A -- in which he told the population that nobody should aggress his neighbour, that everyone was responsible for the peace of his neighbour, and that those who don't obey this should be brought to the authorities, and that unknown roadblocks were not acceptable and were for criminals.  Did you hear that speech on the 24th of April? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, do we have a reference to that in our exhibits or anything that is marked for ID?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I'm sorry, I neglected to mention that.  That is D. NZ79. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness just said, says the Kinyarwanda booth, that he did not hear that speech pronounced. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you.  Now, did you hear the speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 27th of April when he returned to Butare and chaired a meeting of the Butare préfectoral security council, and in that speech -- which is Exhibit D. NZ80 -- he said that he had returned to Butare to see if the instructions that he had given earlier had been understood, and he said that he had received reports and seen himself, when travelling the road between Gitarama and Butare, that security was not yet restored in the area, and he had wanted to know why and thought it was perhaps that the population had misunderstood his directives.  And he then announced that the security council of Butare had decided that as of today, anyone caught killing or looting should be immediately arrested and brought before the relevant authority and dealt with accordingly, and the prosecutor was asked to resume the next day and file processes so that all criminals could be published quickly -- could be punished quickly.  Did you hear that speech on the 27th of April in Butare? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm not objecting to the form of the question, because Mr. Robinson has a right to go back over exhibits that were previously admitted, but quite frankly, I'm at a loss, because the bulk of the exhibits that he's referred to over the course of today are all in Kinyarwanda.  They were not translated.  I have no access to them in French or English, so I'm simply relying on his summary of the document which he is now putting to the witness.  So I'm at a disadvantage, and I think the Court is at a disadvantage, and the witness doesn't really see what -- what he's being asked about.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if it would help, these documents were translated orally when they were introduced.  I could give Mr. Webster the reference to the transcript. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I've asked the trial coordinator to make some enquiries about the translation issues.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. President.  And for Mr. Webster's benefit, the -- if he looks at the transcript of the 7th of March of 2006 at pages 36 and 37, he will find the translation that was made of that speech when it was introduced, and I think I have repeated it faithfully.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But, Witness ALG, did you hear that speech on the 27th of April in Butare by President Sindikubwabo? 
A.	I did not hear that speech. 
Q.	And did you hear that in late 1994, after he had been in exile in Bukavu, that President Sindikubwabo was interviewed on television and asked what he meant by the word "work" when he had used that word in his speech of the 19th of April 1994 in Butare.  And he said -- and this is in Exhibit D. NZ30 -- that he had meant that people should resume their normal activities, and he had not meant that people should kill.  Were you aware of his explanation of his speech during that interview in Bukavu in late 1994? 
A.	Counsel, I did not hear that speech, but I'm surprised.  Maybe he wanted people to go and work, if he was saying that people should start their activities again.  He fled the town from Gitarama to Bukavu via Gisenyi.  And if you are reasonable, do you believe his explanations?  Do you believe in the contents of his speech?  How could people start their activities once again in view of the situation that was prevailed at the time?  So his explanation does not hold water. 
Q.	Well, Witness ALG, I think you might have misunderstood me, or maybe I didn't make myself clear.  He was interviewed on television in Bukavu in late 1991 -- excuse me, late 1994, and he was asked what he meant on the 19th of April 1994 when he had used the word "work" or "gukora" in his speech in Butare on that day.  And he was explaining after the fact what he had meant when he made that speech in Butare, and his explanation was that he meant that people should resume their normal activities, and he did not mean that people of Butare should begin killing.  And so I'm asking you whether or not you are aware of that explanation that President Sindikubwabo gave of his own intentions when he made his speech in Butare? 
A.	Counsel, I spoke to you of the contents of this Butare speech that I heard on the 19th of April.  Even if later he furnished that explanation, I know he could not ask people to resume their activities when he knew that everybody was running away.  He couldn't be calling upon people to resume their normal activities.  Counsel, I have understood the reason.  Now, forgive me if I give you my point of view.  

When the prime minister visited Kigali urban préfecture, I know that his visit was broadcast over the radio towards the end of May.  The prime minister visited Kigali urban préfecture.  There was the préfet and the heads of préfectoral bodies.  There was also the political party leaders.  And in his speech, he expressed satisfaction.  He declared he was satisfied with the way the people were combating the enemy.  He was satisfied with the Rwandan armed forces and the work of people who patrolled, as well as on the roadblocks, that the Rwandan armed forces firmly held their positions, that he was satisfied, and he was satisfied that everybody had understood that it was necessary to combat the enemy and that the people had understood that when you refuse to draw blood, to spill blood, your own blood will be spilled and the dogs will lick it up because it is not spilled in a good cause.  

So he was saying that the government was going to return to Kigali, but instead of returning to Kigali, the government left Murambi for Kibuye.  I remember that after that visit to Kigali urban préfecture, there was a communiqué that said that the government was working in Kigali.  You will understand yourself that that was not the truth, and the truth -- yet the truth must be revealed.  He didn't consider Tutsis as human beings, as other people, other members of the population.  Moreover, I lived in a refugee camp in Congo, ex-Zaire.  There was a lot of people there from Kibuye.  He held a meeting -- a rally when he went to Kibuye.  The prime minister himself stood up or raised his hand, holding a gun, a pistol, in front of the people and said that he could not understand how the majority of the people, 
90 per cent, could be beaten by a minority of 10 per cent, that the 90 per cent must be trained in handling firearms.  

Why was he speaking of 90 per cent and excluding 10 per cent?  And we knew that statistically the number of Tutsis were estimated at 10 per cent.  The number of Twa was estimated at 
zero zero per cent. 

So I'd like you, Counsel, to understood -- to understand the terms -- the language being used in those days.  If he is referring to the 90 per cent, it is because he was excluding the Tutsi who were being killed.  The truth must be known.  And thanks be to God, what happened will never happen again in our country.  
Q.	Witness ALG, the problem I'm having is that you are describing speeches and events for which we have no transcript, no record, on the text of the speech, and yet you seem to even be full of information about such speeches.  While, on the other hand, when we do have the text verbatim of the speeches, you seem to never have heard any of them, and they all seem to be speeches in which the leaders are calling for an end to the killing. 

Let me give you an example.  We have in evidence the transcript, Exhibit D. NZ32, which was translated on the 19th of October 2005, at page 30 of the transcript in which president -- Prime Minister Kambanda made a speech on the 22nd of April 1994 that was broadcast on the radio, and we have the transcript of this speech from Radio Rwanda, and that transcript was given by the RPF government to the Prosecutor, who gave it to us.  And in that transcript Prime Minister Kambanda says that the enemy is not the Tutsi, but the RPF, and he asked the population not to kill each other and said that different ethnicities are not a reason to burn the house of your neighbour.  He said that to attack those who were fleeing was the worst crime, and he said that it was the goal of the enemy that the population confront one another on the basis of ethnicity and regionalism, and he said that the enemy is not your neighbour who has nothing to do with the RPF, and urged the population to continue with the culture in Rwanda of assisting one another.  Now, did you hear that speech?  
A.	Yes, I remember that certain extracts of that speech were broadcast over the radio.  Well, yes, those are beautiful words, but the problem is the acts, what one saw in practice.  One could see they were making beautiful speeches, but that was not the reality on the ground.  They would make beautiful public speeches in public, but that wasn't, in fact, true.  You have said that Kambanda said the enemy is not the RPF, I believe that I think I heard that.  But when the Interahamwe were killing people, they say that they were pursuing the Inkotanyi.  They were speaking of the Tutsi when they said -- when they used the term "Inkotanyi".  And when Kambanda used the expression "90 per cent" and 
	"10 per cent", it is obvious he was speaking of the Tutsi when he referred to the 10 per cent, and if you seek out the Kibuye speech, I'm sure you can get a copy of it.  
Q.	Witness ALG, you say that the leaders made beautiful speeches but didn't put it into action.  But you yourself made some beautiful speeches to people at the level of the commune, did you not, where you -- you encouraged people to stop the killing? 
A.	I did not make many speeches, nor beautiful speeches.  I did not call meetings here and there.  I did not call the people together.  I never held any public meeting in view of the situation that prevailed at the time.  In Nyakabanda, when I presented the people, the conseiller of Nyakabanda -- but there weren't many people actually there.  Nyakabanda is N-Y-A-K-A-B-A-N-D-A.  So I didn't call many meetings of the people, and I did not make any speeches to the people. 
Q.	And when you had the opportunity, you encouraged the conseillers to work towards stopping the killing, did you not? 
A.	Yes, that is true, when I met them, but I must say that the people who made speeches at national level, those national authorities made public -- speeches in public to the nation, but even if their speeches were beautiful, it was not the truth.  Even if today they -- if one day they made a beautiful speech, it's not what they repeated the next time.  

For example, the Kibuye speech, I think everybody is aware of it.  It is well known.  Anybody knows -- everybody knows that when the prime minister visited us, just as Nzirorera was at the Kigali urban préfecture on about the 28th of April, they were speaking to the people and calling upon the people not to kill each other but never mentioned what was done by the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi.  He never spoke to the soldiers.  He spoke always of the people, the people.  It's not the people in general who were killing people.  It was the Interahamwe, the gendarme, the soldiers, the people who were supposedly in charge of public safety who were killing.  The security of the people, he should have spoken, rather, to the people who were doing the killing. 
Q.	Well, could it not also be said of you that Witness ALG said all the right things, but the killings in his commune continued all the way through April, May, and June? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	But the point -- 
A.	It's true, Counsel, but I think I told you that at one point I was even afraid to speak out because the soldiers and the Interahamwe were threatening me.  
Q.	And so the point is, though, that despite your good words and your good intentions, you didn't have control over those who were doing the killing and you couldn't stop it, correct?  
A.	Quite.  
Q.	So it was one thing to be willing; it was another thing to be able in 1994 in Rwanda, correct? 
A.	Yes, absolutely.  
Q.	Now, I want to ask you some questions about the civil defence.  You recall a meeting on the 
	22nd of April 1994 when Préfet Renzaho introduced the officers and announced the establishment of a civil defence programme in Kigali?  
A.	I couldn't remember the date, but I do remember the event. 
Q.	And on the 21st of April 1994 -- and this is in reference to document 16 in my packet of exhibits -- in the daily situation report by UNAMIR dated 21 April 1994, it was reported in paragraph 1 and 3 that the RPF troops continued to infiltrate the city of Kigali and that a few shells had landed in the city centre.  Was that, in fact, the situation, as you understood it, in the - the 21st of April 1994?  
A.	Yes, but on the subject of infiltrations, I should like us to be perfectly clear.  Could you specify the locality, the location?  
Q.	Yes.  The report says that the RPF is controlling the extreme north of the country from Kidaho -- that's K-I-D-A-H-O -- through Byumba, B-Y-U-M-B-A, and to the northeast, from Gabiro to the outskirts of Rwamagana, R-W-A-M-A-G-A-N-A.  Fierce fighting was reported a few kilometres east of Rwamagana.  Mass killing reported in Butare, Gitarama, and Gikongoro areas in the south.  The situation in Kigali city is very violent.  Elements of the RPF were observed on the hills overlooking Ghaddafi crossroads -- spelled G-H-A-D-D-A-F-I -- to the west.  RPF troops still infiltrating into the city.  Mortar and multiple rockets fired by the RGF into the CND in retaliation of the RPF shelling of the former parliament building.  Mount Kigali was also heavily shelled by the RGF.  A few shells landed in the city centre.  

Does that accurately described the situation that was occurring around the time of the 
21st of April 1994?  
A.	Yes, one could hear shelling.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that the special -- that the daily SITREP or situation report of the 
21st of April 1994 be marked for identification as ID. NZ46. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ46 marked for identification) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, there was a broadcast on the radio on the 22nd of April 1994, which is in evidence as -- actually, it's at Exhibit D. NZ83.  And the broadcast is Préfet Renzaho addressing a meeting of the bourgmestres, and it was broadcast over Radio Rwanda.  And during this meeting, he introduced an officer as head of the civil defence in Kigali, the new civil defence programme.  And he condemned acts of violence committed by the youth and other members of the population and said that the killings should be stopped as soon as possible.  And he said that if someone commits such acts, he should be shot.  That is the way you will end such acts.  Did you hear him make that speech?  
A.	No, Counsel, I did not hear that speech.
(Pages 61 to 68 by Sherri Knox)















1700H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you attend the meeting of the bourgmestres and other officials of the préfecture of Kigali in which the civil defence programme was announced? 
A.	I took part in that meeting.  It wasn't only bourgmestres; there were conseillers, Interahamwe and soldiers.  However, he never said any such thing.  If they broadcast that over the radio I know nothing about it. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, the civil defence programme was something that was not only initiated in Kigali, but throughout Rwanda at the end of April, 1994.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	Yes, that's what he told us, so I know about that. 
Q.	Do you want to say something more? 
A.	I was saying that that was what the préfet told us, so as a consequence I knew of it. 
Q.	I'm going to ask that you be shown the contents of tab 13 among the Prosecution's binders, which is a letter dated the 27th of April 1994, from Prime Minister Kambanda to the préfets in Rwanda, which has as its subjects the instructions to restore security in the country.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I might add that this -- this document is available in English, French and the original Kinyarwanda, which is quite a different state of affairs with regard to all of the speeches we've been hearing lately, because even though I looked for them in the admitted exhibits, everything we have dealt with over the last hour or so is only available in Kinyarwanda and I've looked at the references that Mr. Robinson gives me to the transcripts and I do not see translations of those speeches there. 

So, I mean there is a reference to the speech but not the text itself.  And, in any case, what I recall from when these speeches were being read into the record those portions that were read into the record, only those portions that Mr. Robinson was interested in reading into the record were actually read and translated.  So, again, I reiterate to the Court that I'm at a disadvantage in following the substance of this portion of his cross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm all in favour of having translations of all of these documents and I would ask that you take whatever measures are necessary that that can be accomplished. 

It was the Prosecutor who chose which documents were to be translated when this case was prepared.  And we're just using material from the Prosecutor.  If it happens that it wasn't translated, perhaps they didn't think it was useful to their case, but in any event we're using the material that was received from the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, not to belabour the point --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, please. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, my request is a list of documents that should be translated and we will gladly forward the request.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
As I mentioned to you, I had already asked the (inaudible) to make some enquiries.  So I think we should leave it at that for the time being and we will see what suggestions or advice is tendered as to how we should proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President,  while the document is being distributed, in as much as it is contained in a tab of Prosecution exhibits, I wonder whether -- request to have this admitted as Exhibit D. NZ184, might be entertained by consent.
MR. WEBSTER:
Gladly, and there are quite a few others that we can do in the same way.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Inaudible) we will tender it on the -- not exactly just because it is by consent, because I don't think that in a criminal trial consent is sufficient, but we are under the premise that both of you have determined the legal justification for its admission, and we act on that basis.  So it will be admitted into evidence.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And that would be D. NZ183, "A" for the Kinyarwanda, "B" for the French, and "C" for the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So admitted.
(Exhibit D. NZ183A, D. NZ183B and D.NZ183C admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, witness ALG, I take it that you have the Kinyarwanda version in front of you; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I have just been given a copy, but I was not aware of the existence of this document. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, that is very helpful because that was my next question.  

And moving on beyond that, I want to ask you about some of the contents of this document to see whether or not these were the things that were implemented as part of the civil defence for Kigali of which you were familiar.  So, if you see the beginning of the letters it appears to give a history of the events after the assassination of President Habyarimana, but going down to the portion where the -- essentially the second page of the document where the number "1" appears for the second time; first, they recite the three mandates of the interim government and then underneath that three more -- four paragraphs down, Prime Minister Kambanda begins to communicate the instructions to be followed by all the levels in charge of security and by the whole population, so that security and calm which have been troubled in all corners of the country return quickly.  And number 1 is that you requested to organize, without delay and frequently, security meetings at the level of the préfecture and each préfectoral security meeting was to try to implement the measures to enable them to follow up the re-establishment of security.  

So, my question to you is whether or not in Kigali that was implemented, the holding of préfecture security meetings. 
MR. WEBSTER:
You know, Your Honours, this is a document that is five pages long.  And to me it seems that it would be appropriate to give the witness 10 or 15 minutes to read its entire contents before he is asked to comment on it.  I don't know how to get around this because my interest is in having a credible testimony from the witness.  How do we do that without giving him an opportunity to appreciate the entire contents of the document?  

If the Court has another suggestion -- or, Mr. Robinson has another suggestion, I am all ears, but this does not seem an appropriate way to cross-examine the witness on the document. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this is the kind -- precisely the reasons why I try to meet with the witnesses in advance, but I think to try to solve the problem at the moment we can move away from this letter and I can ask the witness to read this this evening and then tomorrow morning I can discuss this and in the meantime we can go on and speak about something else. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Mr. Webster, you do not have any other suggestions at this stage?  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Inaudible)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the question has come at last.  How much longer do you think you are going to be?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm hopeful of finishing by the end of the day tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We appreciate that there might be some documents that you may not wish to reveal in advance, but if there are documents that you are going to use tomorrow which it would not prejudice your cross-examination for the witness to see overnight, that might be one way of addressing the issue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, I have no problem at this stage letting the witness review all of the documents that I'm going to refer to or call his attention to.  So, I could provide a list to the registry within the -- before the witness leaves and they can maybe assemble those documents for him.  I have no problem doing that.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:  
Your Honour, what would be the problem with giving the list to all of the parties including the Prosecution?  We cannot have any contact with the witness at this point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, don't you have the list already?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have the list already. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
CMS has served to us --
MR. WEBSTER:
I thought you -- I thought the Court was referring to other documents that were not on this -- that were not on the list of reciprocal disclosure.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  You see, at the commence -- at the close of the examination-in-chief counsel has been disclosing to the Prosecutor and to the Court the documents they intend to use in cross-examination.  Now, they have not been disclosing it to the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we didn't feel that we should give a directive that they should give it to the witness, because we appreciate that the counsel for the Defence may wish to -- to hold information up their sleeves to surprise the witness eventually during cross-examination.  But there are some documents which don't fall into that category.  Now, if documents don't fall into the category they could be disclosed to the witness at the same time they are disclosed to the Prosecutor.  

Now, what Mr. Robinson has said is that he has no objection to making the disclosure now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you. I misunderstood because the -- the last document from Kambanda, the letter of the 27th of April, was not listed in the reciprocal disclosure.  So, I confused the Court's communication with Mr. Robinson.  I thought there were other documents independent of the reciprocal disclosure bundle that may come up that we wanted to provide to the witness and to the parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if there are, I'm not aware of that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, I had intended to do exactly what Mr. Webster is suggesting.  I have some exhibits that are already admitted into evidence, speeches and things like that, that have already been -- I did not put into my bundle because they are already exhibits.  And I can give the list of those to the registry and the witness can then have those in addition to anything in my bundle that may be in a language that he can understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can proceed on that basis. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Okay.  So, Witness ALG, if you put down the letter from Prime Minister Kambanda, that's going to be your homework tonight.  You can read it over the evening and we will discuss that tomorrow.  And we're going to go on and talk about some other things that were occurring at about the time that the civil defence was organised in Kigali on the 22nd of April.  

	Now, on the 23rd of April 1994 UNAMIR in their special SITREP, or situation report, which is document number 18 of my package of exhibits, reported that RGF troops appeared to be taking over control of some of the roadblocks in the city previously controlled by the militia.  Was that your observation as well, that after the meeting about civil defence that the army began to take control over some of the roadblocks that had been manned by the militia? 
A.	I do not know.  I do not know when they did that, but on the basis of what I observed I saw that the roadblocks that were manned previously by the soldiers continued to be manned by the Interahamwe.  But they might have said that because at some roadblocks that were set up in the town, especially in Kiyovu, K-I-Y-O-V-I -- U.  During the day, those roadblocks were manned by a number of civilians, but from nighttime, that is from 1800 hours, those civilians would leave and the soldiers then took over.  That is maybe why this was said.  That took place in Nyarugenge secteur, that I shall spell, N-Y-A-R-U-G-E-N-G-E, and that is maybe why people said that Interahamwe and soldiers would take over from each other at certain roadblocks.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I would ask that the document, the special sit report from 23rd of April 1994 be marked as ID. NZ47 for identification. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
(Exhibit ID. NZ47, marked for identification)
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness ALG, on 24th of April 1994 in another special situation report prepared by UNAMIR, the UNAMIR reported that, "It appears that the chief-of-staff of the Rwandan government forces is not in full control of the situation, even though he is bent on preventing the RPF from capturing Kigali, and that General Dallaire's discussion with the interim government did not give the impression that politicians are in control of the situation".  Was that also the situation as you observed it near the end of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that the document, the special situation report dated 24th of April 1994 be admitted as ID. NZ -- or, marked for identification ID. NZ48. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
(Exhibit ID. NZ48, marked for identification)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, you testified on the 1st of November 2006 in this trial that Mr. Karemera never denounced the killings by the Interahamwe.  Do you -- is that -- do you stand by that statement? 
A.	Counsel, I never heard him say that.  So, that would mean that I confirm what I said. 
Q.	Were you aware of the communiqué issued by the MRND on the 23rd of April 1994, which was signed by Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Karemera, and which is in evidence at Exhibit D. NZ33 and which was read in court on the 19th of October 2005, at page 33, in which they urge the members of the party and especially the youth not to allow the RPF attack to be a pretext to mistreat innocent people who have nothing to do with the war.  And they publicly denounced all criminals who passed themselves off as Interahamwe, and they called upon the population to denounce the activities of all those who harmed their neighbours, and in this communiqué they asked Rwandans not to attack one another and they said that those who attack innocent persons because of their ethnicity, whether MRND members or not, must be denounced.  They said, "We condemn their behaviour and call for them to be punished by the authorities".  Were you aware of that communiqué issued on the 23rd of April 1994? 
A.	I was not aware of that communiqué, Counsel. 
Q.	And were you aware of the communiqué on the 27th of April 1994 issued by the MRND and signed by Mr. Karemera, himself, in which the MRND once again denounced the killings and looting and asked the Interahamwe to arrest such individuals who were doing that, or point them out for the authorities, and it called upon MRND officials at the préfectoral level to carry out these instructions immediately?  Did you ever hear that communiqué? 
A.	This is the very first time that I hear talk of such a communiqué, Counsel. 
Q.	And you were ****************************************************in April of 1994, correct? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Counsel?  I would like to ask you to repeat the question.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	My question was: Were you ***************************************in April of 1994?  In other words, were you************************************************************? 
A.	Yes.  **************************************************************at the time but at that time that body never held a meeting. 
Q.	And is it your testimony that you never received any notice of this communiqué? 
A.	I was not informed of that communiqué.  And at that time, I did not even meet with the president of the party at préfectoral level.  I did not meet with him during that period. 
Q.	Now, in a special situation report dated the 25th of April 1994, UNAMIR described the day's activities that the RPF had fired a mortar directly onto the airport in Kigali; that the RPF had fired mortar shells in the city centre from the north of Kigali, and that two mortar shells had landed around the hotel Milles Collines and that firing -- and that fighting was continuing in Kigali as of the 25th of April 1994.  Is that consistent with your observations? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, it is also reported in this special situation report that on the 25th of April, General Dallaire had visited the chief-of-staff of the Rwandan government army and the préfet of Kigali to finalise the methodology of the evacuation of refugees, and that at that time the chief-of-staff said that he was not prepared to take on the militia for refugees, and that it was not possible, as of that time, to make a transfer of refugees.  Was that the situation as you understand it as well?  
A.	I did not know that that meeting had been convened because it was a high-level meeting, but it is possible that refugees were evacuated because that was what was done at a later stage. 
Q.	And********************************************************************************************************* ******************************************************? 
A.	*****************************************************************************************at the meeting you have just mentioned. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that -- at this time I would ask that the special situation report of the 25th of April 1994 be marked as identification ID. NZ49. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
(Exhibit ID. NZ49, marked for identification) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm about to go into another area.  And I know we have a few minutes, but, perhaps, I could use those few minutes to inform the registry of the exhibit numbers, the documents that can be shown to the witness.  So, would it be possible to adjourn at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take the adjournment now.
MR. ROBINSON:  
Excuse me, also, Mr. President, I did tell Mr. Webster earlier today that I thought I would take up the whole day tomorrow.  But it is possible that I won't.  And so I think he was thinking about whether to bring his witness.  And I don't want to have him stand up tomorrow and say that "Mr. Robinson told me not to bring my witness".  As far as I am concerned there may very well be time during tomorrow in which we have completed the examination of this witness, but it is not a promise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of our day's activities and we will take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.  Now, you're a veteran so I feel it is a bit much for me to remind you once more not to discuss the case or the evidence but I say it for what it is worth.  

We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1725H)
