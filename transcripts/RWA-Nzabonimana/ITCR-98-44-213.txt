P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 6th of December 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue this morning, and the Prosecutor will continue with your cross-examination.  I remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began yesterday.
WITNESS 5/13, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	I'm hoping nature is going to be kind to us today and we'll be allowed to finish our examination.  

I would like to start by asking you, do you recall whether you left the hospital at the end of May or at the end of April?
A.	I think it was in May, but I don't remember the date.
Q.	But it was nonetheless two weeks after your cousin had been taken away; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now, can you tell us, before your cousin was taken away, did you move around a lot in the hospital, or did you remain at the surgery?
A.	Before my cousin was taken away, I practically never left him.  I spent all my time with him, but when he went out to get a bit of sunlight, I'd go outside with him.
Q.	You testified that the man who assisted you, Placide, forbade you from going out.  Was this after your cousin was taken away, or before?
A.	That was before my cousin was taken away.
Q.	And after your cousin was taken away, was this when you were hidden in the toilets that were marked "out of order"?
A.	Yes, that was after he left that I went in there.
Q.	And whilst you were hidden in the toilets, did you move around much, or did you remain, more or less, always in the toilets?
A.	In the morning, Placide would come to give me gruel, porridge.  He went to get the porridge reserved for the hospitalised soldiers, and he would share it with me.  So he would let me out of the toilet to eat the porridge, and then I'd go back.  And then, in the afternoon, about 3 p.m., when things were pretty quiet, Placide would come and let me go out from the toilet.
Q.	And where would you go in the afternoon?
A.	He'd let me move around the area outside, but I couldn't go far.  It was just to stretch my legs, and he'd accompany me, and then I'd go back into the toilet so that he could return to look after the inpatients and feed them.
Q.	So if I can recap, when your cousin was still around, you never left his side, except for when he went out to get some sunlight.  After he left, you hid in the toilets, Placide would bring you food in the morning and in the afternoon he would let you go for walks in the area accompanied by him; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Did you have the opportunity to meet other refugees hiding at the Butare hospital?
A.	Sometimes I'd meet one refugee or another, especially in front of the surgical ward where there was a tap where we would go to wash a bit.  I remember I met a young man and we were friendly, but really we only said "hello".  But later he left, and then, when I met a refugee or another, we'd -- our paths would cross, but we couldn't -- we wouldn't, and couldn't, speak to each other.
Q.	So would it be correct to summarise and say you hardly met any refugees and, when you did, you hardly spoke to them?
A.	We had nothing to say.  Each one minded his own business, but some refugees were taken away to the préfecture.  The refugees I came across were the very few that stayed, that hadn't been taken away to the préfecture, and generally I'd meet them where the tap was where we'd go to sluice ourselves off, to give ourselves a bit of a wash.
Q.	Do you recall testifying about three people who were killed at Gatemari?
A.	Quite.  In fact, you said it was the morgue.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Gatemari -- G-A-T-E-M-A-R-I -- spelling from the Kinyarwanda booth.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Do you also recall testifying about three people who were killed by the tents where they had been found?
A.	The soldiers who set up where Médecins sans frontières had put up the plastic sheeting, those soldiers would kill people, and you couldn't count the number of people the soldiers killed there.  And they did that to have more room so that they could camp there.
Q.	So the three people you testified to seeing being killed at the plastic sheeting set up by Médecins sans frontières, were they different to the other three people you saw being killed at Gatemari?
A.	I personally witnessed the three people being killed at the morgue, or at the mortuary.
Q.	And the ones with the plastic sheeting, you didn't personally witness that?
A.	Those people were stabbed in the neck, and when I saw them, they were lying there, but I couldn't be sure that those people were dead.  In fact, there were people that you could see in the last throes -- agonised.  I can't assert that they subsequently died.
Q.	Were those people also attacked with small axes as the ones at Gatemari?
A.	When I arrived there, I noted that those people were in the last throes, and I saw them all wounded on the neck.  What I saw from the wounds, I couldn't tell you whether they had been caused with a small axe or with a dagger.
Q.	And do you know who was responsible for killing the three people at Gatemari?
A.	I don't know if anybody had plotted against those people.  It was when I went to see that person I called Mameya that I passed the soldiers who were assaulting those people, beating them up.  I don't know if anybody had plotted against them, or not.
Q.	You testified yesterday that you didn't see Rwamakuba at the hospital, but then, also, that you tried to avoid people who came there, for fear of harm.  Do you recall saying this?
A.	I remember.
Q.	So it would be logical to assume that if you were trying to avoid people who came to the hospital, thus not moving around a lot, he could have come without you knowing; would you agree with that?
A.	I told you I'm not certain of having seen everyone who came to the hospital.  I did mention a rather famous lady who came to the hospital, but I didn't see her -- even her, but I heard it talked about.  You know, I had a written permit to stay at the hospital as a carer, but it was only valid for a week, so I had to constantly go and have the permit renewed.  It was when I went to try and get it renewed that I might see some people or meet other people who would tell me that someone or another had come to the hospital.  So it is possible that people came to the hospital without my being aware of it, because I can't claim to have seen everyone who came to the hospital.
Q.	Did you know André Rwamakuba at the time in 1994 whilst you were at the hospital?
A.	When I was shown his photograph, that I saw him in fact.  Before that, I did not know him.
Q.	So in 1994 you didn't know him; is that correct?
A.	Quite, I did not know him.  And, moreover, I knew no one.  I did not know Gatera and the others.  I could see some people passing without knowing who they were and in that -- under those circumstances it's impossible for me to say that I knew this, that, or the other person.
Q.	So can you tell us, when did you learn who Gatera was?
A.	When I was at the hospital I learned that it was Dr. Gatera, who was a surgeon.
Q.	Had you ever heard of Rwamakuba before going to the hospital in 1994?
A.	No, I heard no one say that.
Q.	Can you tell us when you were shown the photograph of André Rwamakuba for the first time?
A.	I don't remember the date -- nor the day, for that matter.
Q.	Was it this year when you met with the Defence?
A.	No, I don't think it was this year.  I think, rather, it was last year.
Q.	So would that have been the investigator who met you in March who showed you that photograph?
A.	Yes, he showed me the photograph and asked me if I didn't know the person in the photograph, since I had spent much time at the hospital.  I replied that I did not know that person, and I didn't see him among the people I saw at the hospital, but I wouldn't want you to think that I saw everyone who came to the hospital, because I didn't go to all the departments, all the sections in the hospital.
Q.	This photograph was shown to you ten years after the events of 1994; that's correct, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you think it is possible that you can see someone that you didn't know at the time and, therefore, didn't recognise, and be shown a photograph of that person ten years later and not recall seeing that person?
A.	I cannot tell you -- I cannot assert having seen that person at the hospital and, moreover, had he come to the hospital, the Butare people at the hospital would have seen him, and it would be impossible for him not to be seen by at least one person at the hospital, if he had come to the hospital.
Q.	Did you speak to all the Butare people about what they saw during the events at the hospital?
A.	No, I couldn't meet everyone, but I want to tell you the following.  I was not alone at the hospital.  I cannot assert having seen everyone who came to the hospital.  If I didn't see someone, others saw them.  I wouldn't use the same corridors as other people, and I couldn't see everything that other people saw.  Other people could have seen what I did not see.
Q.	Do you think it's possible that we have heard from people who did see him at the hospital from Butare?
A.	That's what I'm telling you.  Maybe other people saw him, but I did not, just as those other people did not see what I saw.  Everything is possible.
Q.	You also said that you didn't personally see any doctors kill at the hospital, but you did see people being shown to Dr. Gatera before being taken away.  That's correct, isn't it?
A.	Yes.  In the absence of the hospital director, no one could be taken away without having been seen by Dr. Gatera.  Of course, people were abducted during the night, and in those cases it was impossible to show them to Gatera.  But when he was there during the day, and the director was not present, he was the one who was shown the people being taken away from the hospital.
Q.	How many doctors did you know at the hospital in 1994?
A.	Very few.  I knew Gatera, Mbarutso and another doctor who had a storeyed house.  That doctor lived very close to Giporoso and there was another doctor who was crippled -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think the witness said.
THE WITNESS:
-- and other doctors in the maternity ward.  So I saw doctors, but some of whose names I don't know.  But in the department or sections which I passed through, I saw doctors.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	And would it be correct to say that you were able to identify them as doctors because of the white coats that they wore?
A.	No.  You see, if I spent the night in one of the wards, I could distinguish between a doctor and a male nurse -- a nurse or a male nurse.  I could make that distinction.  It isn't only thanks to the doctors' coats that I can tell the difference between a doctor and another member of the staff.
Q.	If you were to see a doctor not dressed in uniform, would you be able to identify that he was a doctor if you didn't know him before?
A.	Every time I was in a ward of the hospital I knew who was doctor and who was nurse -- a nurse.  When you live somewhere, you know your neighbours.  You know the people staying there, and when I was in one ward or the other, people would speak of the staff saying, "So-and-so is a doctor; so-and-so is a nurse."   So it was easy for me to know who was a doctor and who was not.
Q.	If a doctor who was not from Butare came from outside, say from Kigali, not dressed in the uniform -- dressed in civilian clothes -- would you be able to know that he was a doctor?
A.	If that person had been alluded to as being a doctor, I would have heard it and I would -- and I would have understood, but I wish to emphasise that in those days it was not frequent that doctors should come from elsewhere to work in another hospital, by which I mean the Butare hospital.
Q.	Do you recall telling the investigators during your meeting in 2004 that you witnessed a European woman, accompanied by a European man, talking to Dr. Gatera and Dr. Yotham and some officers in relation to the destruction of the tents at the hospital?
A.	Yes.  They were the white people working for Médecins sans frontières.  They would treat people under the tents they'd set up at the hospital.  As soldiers came very frequently to take away those patients, I remember very well that meeting with the doctor, because I had gone to have my permit renewed -- extended.  I didn't stay there long.  I immediately left again.
Q.	And you stated the European woman -- this is the Médecins sans frontières woman -- was agitated and was basically contesting the decision to destroy the tents.  Do you recall saying that?
A.	Yes, I remember having stated that.
Q.	Can you recall the date that you witnessed this event?
A.	No.  If I tried to specify the date, I'd be lying to you.
Q.	Can you recall if it was in April or in May?
A.	I think it was towards the end of April, beginning of May.
Q.	Did you recall, or did you hear all the conversation that was going on?
A.	No, I couldn't understand the language they were speaking, that they were using in their discussion.
Q.	So how did you know that they were talking about destroying the MSF tents?
A.	I could see -- I could tell from the gestures they were making.  She was agitated and she was pointing with her finger at the tents.  That's how I understood that they were discussing the tents.  And I could see that they were taking away some newly-arrived people.  Those people being taken could not live with the people who had been there before.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Just one moment please.  Just one moment.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Sorry about that.  Mr. Witness, can you tell us, were the tents destroyed after this conversation between the European Médecins sans frontières woman, the man, and the other parties in the room?
A.	All I remember is when they were talking two tents had already been dismantled.  And I was coming from Mameya.  I found subsequently that all the tents had been taken down, so I don't know where the people under the tent disappeared to, where they went after the tents had been taken down.
Q.	Can you remind us where this conversation was being held, where it was taking place between the Europeans from Médecins sans frontières and the doctors?
A.	Near the x-ray unit.  They were standing just at the entrance to the surgical unit, not far from the x-ray unit, in the walkway or corridor leading towards reception.
Q.	Did you recognise all the parties?  During this conversation did you recognise all the people taking part in this conversation?
A.	No, I didn't peer too closely at everybody involved.  Moreover, I wasn't too near them to be able to see each one clearly.
Q.	Now, Witness, I'd like to move to a statement that you gave to the Prosecutor's investigators in June 1996.  This document I think has just been served on all parties this morning.  Do you recall meeting ICTR investigators in June 1996?
MR. HOOPER:
Can I ask for a ten-minute adjournment to allow us to read this statement?  I've flipped through it, but I haven't been able to read it with the attention that's required, as a consequence of which I missed the first five or ten minutes already of the cross-examination.

And may I also mark a note of acute concern as to this statement being placed before us at such a late stage.  We will be moving to have it exhibited in due course, but I'll revisit this later.  I would ask that -- I hope the Judges have got it now.  I'm very, very concerned at how and where this document came from.  I'd like to know when the Prosecution first appreciated they had it.  I'd like to know what steps they took to find it, and when those steps were taken.

But I would just like maybe not as much as ten minutes, Mr. President, but enough time to read it.  It's dated, I think, 1996. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Would you like me to respond to the points raised by Mr. Hooper, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you'd like to.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Simply that we conducted a search, a very simple and rather primitive search, I believe the Defence will think, on our database ZyFIND, and we found this statement perhaps after being informed that the witness was appearing this week.  Subsequently, we read the statement but didn't think that we were going to use it.  Therefore, it was not communicated.  

I don't think it was necessary for it to be communicated had we not been -- had we decided not to use it.  However, in light of the witness's testimony yesterday, we realised that certain points were raised which contradicted elements in the statement, and therefore decided that we would use it in the cross-examination.
MR. HOOPER:
If I can just interpose for a moment.  Am I quite clear in understanding what is being said and that is that this document was found yesterday as a result of "a very simple and primitive search"?  Am I correct in understanding that? 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
You are not correct in understanding that it was found yesterday.  You are correct in understanding that it was found using the ZyFIND database, simply by putting the witness's name in and it came up.  After reviewing it, we decided yesterday that we would use it based on the witness's testimony, but it was not found yesterday.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I think the Prosecution think that these questions I'm asking are solely for my personal benefit.  They are not.  They are for your benefit, the Judges.  So can we please have an answer to the question:  when was this document found? 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
If Your Honour wishes, I can go back and find out the exact date.  I don't have it to hand.  However, it was found after we were told that the witness would be testifying.  I don't quite see the relevance, because we would not have disclosed the statement to the Defence anyway if we were not going to use it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It might be relevant assessing your Rule 68 obligations.  Now, if a statement is exculpatory, and it might be seeing that he's in fact called as a Defence witness, it's relevant to our consideration of that issue.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Perhaps that's where the problem lies, and I think this is an issue that perhaps we need to deal with.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The date is important to us.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I don't have the date to hand -- perhaps a week or two ago -- I really can't remember.  I would be honest with you.  I can't remember when the witness's -- I think it was last week that he was listed, and I did the search myself.

That it's exculpatory, I think this is something that perhaps we need to have deliberated and confirmed, because we have a difference of opinion as to what is exculpatory.  Having looked at this statement, we don't think it is exculpatory.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Difference of opinion with whom?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
With the Defence.  Perhaps the Judges could assist in determining what is exculpatory and what is not.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is going to be an issue which we will have to consider.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I'm just saying that's the relevance of the date when it was discovered.  When we are deliberating on that issue, it would be useful for us to have that information.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Perhaps I can provide that information after the break.

Perhaps I might be in a position to assist.  I think the list with the witness's name was communicated on Friday last.  I have a handwritten list and I recall it being communicated to me by Mr. Hooper on Friday, but I may be wrong.  And that is when the search would have been done.
MR. HOOPER:
So it was not done in October when the witness list was provided to the Prosecution.  They didn't go about researching the names of witnesses when they had their names in October.  It was left until last week; is that right?
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
No, but I believe that's our prerogative as to when we research in preparation for the cross-examination.  It wasn't done in October.  It was done when we knew that the witness was coming.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're going to rise for a few minutes now.  Mr. Hooper, we will grant your request.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.
(Court recessed from 0944H to 1025H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness does not need to put on his headphones.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, thank you for the adjournment.  I've had the opportunity of reading the statement.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's now just about 10:30, and we think that the next thing we should do is take our mid morning break.

Before we do that, though, I just want to say a brief word, because there is a saying that a word to the wise should be enough.  This issue of disclosure has been constantly raised in this trial, and we think it's an important fair trial issue.

Now, with regard to this particular statement which has just been disclosed, we are extremely surprised at the statement made that, despite the fact that the Defence witness list was given to the Prosecutor in October, it is only the weekend before the witness is scheduled to appear in court that any attempt was made to search the Prosecution's database for any statements that he has made, and that even when that was done his statement was not disclosed, because the Prosecutor had decided unilaterally that his statement or testimony was not exculpatory.

We think that if the Defence calls a witness that gives a prima facie suggestion that the statement of the witness is of an exculpatory nature, the Prosecutor ought at least to notify the Defence of the existence of the statement.

Now, the major remedy -- or the only remedy that was necessary in this case, in my view, because we have also had the opportunity of looking at the statement which we only saw this morning ourselves, and the only remedy is time and that also, in our view, affects the efficient and fair administration of our trial process.

Now, we had a statement from the Prosecutor last week that they, the Prosecutor, had examined their database and they gave the Court, from the Bar table, the assurance that all statements that should be disclosed had been disclosed.

We sincerely hope that we don't get any further surprises of this nature, because, in our view, these issues have an impact on the fairness of the trial and we take them very seriously.  We rise now until after our mid morning break. 
(Court recessed at 1031H)



(Court resumed at 1054H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue now.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, just prior to the pause I was asking you whether you recall meeting the ICTR investigators in June 1996.  
A.	I remember that people came to see me and asked me questions about Kanyabashi and the events that occurred in Butare, and I believe that on that occasion a statement was drafted.  However, I cannot tell you in what year and in what month this meeting took place. 
Q.	Do you recall the statement being read back to you in Kinyarwanda and signing the statement? 
A.	It's a long time ago, but I remember that those people met me in Cyarwa at the secteur office.  I was with other people, including the person whose first name is ******.  Then questions were put to me and the statement prepared, which statement I signed afterward.  I remember that, even if it is a long time ago that it happened. 
Q.	Do you understand French at all, Mr. Witness?  
A.	I only understand Kinyarwanda. 
Q.	So it would be of no use to you if I showed you either the English original or the French version of this statement? 
A.	It is possible that the statement was taken down in French or English.  I, for my part, gave my statement in Kinyarwanda; I did not give it in English or in French. 
Q.	Would it help you to have a look at the statement, either a French or an English version, or are you happy to answer questions regarding the statement without looking at it?  
A.	You can show me the statement, or not.  If I have made statements, I remember that.  In any case, I am able to answer for what I said, even if you do not show me the statement.  It is up to you to decide whether or not to show me statement. 
MR. HOOPER:
The fair thing to do is to provide this witness with a Kinyarwanda translation or to have it translated to him so that he can then fairly comment in respect to individual parts of it within the general context of the statement.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Your Honour, my approach was simply to ask the question -- ask the witness certain questions, as I did with regards to his statement which was not really a statement, the account of his meeting with the Defence investigator.  So regarding certain points, asking the witness if he recalls saying this or saying that, if Defence or if Your Honours would rather we have the interpreters translate parts, then I'm more than willing to do so.  I didn't think it was necessary, as I don't wish to delve into detail.  
MR. HOOPER:
The problem is that this is the earliest statement the Chamber has seen.  It was taken in June of 1996, just over two years -- or, in fact, two years after the genocide and when this young man was an even younger young man, eight years ago, and you're asking him to launch his memory back to that time, a young man who'd lost his mom, his dad, his brothers and his family.  You can't, with the greatest respect, fairly expect him to deal with the statement in this way at this time in 2005 in that way.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm at Your Honour's -- well, if you wish to have us translate it.  We've asked the witness to launch his memory back to '94, which is even earlier than this statement of '96.  There are simply certain questions -- in total, seven or so -- that I just wish to ask -- have the witness confirm or to deny, but I'm open to whatever suggestions.  If you would like us to have the interpreter read through it, we can do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will manage the issue of fairness question by question, so you can put your first matter.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, do you remember talking to the investigators about -- in fact, you've just said -- do you remember talking to them about Kanyabashi coming to the hospital in a white Peugeot?  
A.	I remember.  I know very well that I made that statement. 
Q.	Do you remember telling them that you learnt of the president's death whilst you were at the hospital with your cousin -- or your brother? 
A.	I remember that I told the investigator that I left my parents' home the day following the death of the president and that I went to hospital, and Kanyabashi arrived in a white Peugeot vehicle and that afterwards he returned with a bulldozer, with detainees who went to clear up the bodies that were near the morgue.  At that time it was said that these detainees were taken -- taking the bodies below the university campus.  I remember hearing that. 
Q.	Do you remember telling them that in the beginning soldiers and civilians came to the hospital and checked the patients' identity cards? 
A.	Yes.  The soldiers asked the women who were in the maternity to show their identity cards.  Actually, it was only one or two of them who was able to show their identity cards; the others did not have their identity cards with them. 
Q.	Do you recall also mentioning civilians with these soldiers? 
A.	Yes, that happened.  When there was disorder in the hospital and this is when, at the hospital, there were people who had come from Mpare, M-P-A-R-E, Mpare, and who had sought refuge at the hospital. 
Q.	Do you recall telling them that subsequently people were taken away and never came back? 
A.	Yes, that is true, I said it.  People were taken away from the hospital by these people. 
Q.	And these people, you confirm that they were not just soldiers but also civilians; is that correct? 
A.	As regards the civilian attackers, they took people with them from Mpare, saying that they were locals from that place that they were taking back there, and those people from Mpare did not come back to the hospital. 
Q.	Did you know any of these civilians?
A.	I learned that they were from Mpare.  When they came to the hospital, they came from below the maternity and then to go back to their place, they went the same way.  And the attackers came armed with sticks, but I can't tell you that I had recognised any one of the assailants. 
Q.	Can you recall around which date this was? 
A.	No, I couldn't tell you, or I'd be lying.  It was hard to keep track of the days and the dates.  It's difficult for me to tell you whether it was a Monday or a Tuesday or some other day, unless I'd start weaving fantasies, telling lies.
Q.	Do you recall telling the investigators on this occasion that your brother was taken away on the 15th of May 1994? 
A.	I wasn't sure of the date when I put that date forward, and I don't remember actually having given that date at all.  I gave an approximate date at the time. 
Q.	Was that approximate date some time in May? 
A.	At the time when I made my statement my memory was stronger, more faithful than it is now, even if it was vague.  Now, today it's hard to be certain and say that I gave one date or another.  Anything I could have given by way of information regarding dates was approximative. 
Q.	However approximative is your position, it would appear that the statement you gave in '96, two years after the events, would be more accurate than the statement you're able to give us today; is that correct? 
A.	It's true that at the time I could remember some events more clearly, but even today I can remember some things.  For example, it's difficult to remember what I said this morning, today.  When I give information regarding dates, there are always approximations.  I do not remember -- I do not recall the exact dates. 
Q.	Do you recall that when you met with the investigator in 2004 that you told him that your cousin was taken away between the 21st and the 25th of May 2004; that is the Defence investigator? 
A.	Listen, Counsel, I don't remember the dates.  I can remember months.  That's why I spoke of the month of April and the month of May.  It's very hard for me to recall dates on which events occurred. 
Q.	Do you recall in 2004 when you met with the Defence investigator, did you refer to the month of May or did you refer to the month of April in relation to your cousin being taken away? 
A.	I think I spoke of the month of May. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I have no further questions, Your Honour.  I would, however, like to indicate that we will be exhibiting the witness's statements taken by OTP investigators, as well as the compilation or account submitted to us by the Defence.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, under the rules of our Tribunal, you now have to answer some more questions asked by counsel who questioned you at first.  So Mr. Hooper will have the opportunity to ask you a few other questions, and you have to answer him.  

Mr. Hooper. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you recall which surgery ward you were in?  Do you know if it had a number at all? 
A.	Yes, I remember the ward in which we were.  It was ward No. 8. 
Q.	Now, you've been referred to your earlier statement, which we all have, but as you know it's not written in a language you understand, but you accept that you made it.  And am I right in understanding your position in respect of dates that may be mentioned in that statement, that they are always approximate, but that those dates are probably more accurate than your memory of dates today?  Is that your position, or not?  
A.	Yes.  In fact, all things considered, the dates I gave in the course of the first statement are closer to reality or reflect better the period at which the events took place than the dates I give today, because today I've given dates but I can't assert with certainty that they are precisely correct. 
Q.	Now, only a very few bits of your statements were put to you and I just want to put some other bits in here and invite your view in respect of whether it's accurate or not.  You say at page 3 of your statement -- I mention that for the record, Mr. Witness, I know you don't have the statement -- about 12 lines from the bottom, you say -- you talk about going to a barrier and being asked whether you were Hutu or Tutsi and that you then went on to the university hospital.  You say, "I lived in the hospital to watch my brother.  I stayed with my brother from April 1994 until the end of May 1994."  

Just pausing there, does that sound right to you or not, today, April until the end of May?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So you're in the hospital quite a long time, longer than you told us in your evidence; is that right? 
A.	It is possible.  I'm not lying. 
Q.	Now, a moment ago you were asked about civilians who came to the hospital with soldiers, and you told us that those civilians were from, as I understood it, Mpare, and they were seeking out refugees who were from Mpare.  Is that right or not? 
A.	Yes.  The Prosecutor asked me about civilians who came to take people away from the hospital.  Those people were in civilian clothes, did not wear banana leaves as other assailants had before the arrival of the assailants I referred to in civilian clothes.  Those were the ones who came to take the people from Mpare. 
Q.	Now, in the context of those people taking people from Mpare, you have this to say in your statement, and again I'd ask you to listen and tell us whether you agree with this account.  "Some Hutu people of Mpare came to the Butare university hospital compound to take the Mpare Tutsi refugees away.  I saw that Kanyabashi was also around.  I heard the Mpare Hutus say to the Mpare Tutsi, 'Come back home.'  The Mpare Tutsis didn't want to go home because they were afraid of being killed.  I heard Kanyabashi say, 'Tutsi people from Mpare, don't worry --'"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, just a bit more slowly.  Excuse me.  
MR. HOOPER:
You don't have the statements; I am sorry.  Let me go back a bit.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	"I saw that Kanyabashi was also around.  I heard the Mpare Hutus say to the Mpare Tutsi, 'Come back home.'  The Mpare Tutsis did not want to go home because they were afraid of being killed.  I heard Kanyabashi say, 'Tutsi people from Mpare, don't worry, I'll give you people to protect you.'  After that, the Mpare Tutsis moved away from the hospital compound.  I saw Kanyabashi was in front of the group, leading the people, driving his white Peugeot."  

And later you say you saw prisoners at the hospital mortuary unload bodies from a Caterpillar -- with a capital "C" -- and you were told that they were bodies from the group of Mpare Tutsis that had left that morning in the presence of Kanyabashi.  

Do you have any comments?  Is that account correct, or is it not correct, the account you gave eight years ago, or do you want to add or take away anything in that?  
A.	I remember that on that day Kanyabashi was present, but I don't remember him talking to the Mpare Tutsi.  He said, "Mpare people, go home.  Mpare inhabitants, inhabitants of Butare."  He used the word "inhabitants" of Mpare, not the word "Tutsi".  And, moreover, his vehicle was parked near the kitchen and the civilians were collecting the corpses near the maternity ward, and at that time the Mpare people were taken from the hospital, but I remember well that Kanyabashi did not say, "Tutsi from Mpare."   What he said was, "inhabitants of Mpare," and I think I have a clear recollection of those words. 
Q.	I'm not going to go through it all, but on page 4 of the statement, which again I know you don't have in front of you, and which my friends just referred to, you talk about -- mainly in that page, what happened to your cousin, or brother, as you refer to him.  

You say, "Around the 15th of May, in the morning, I saw a white Peugeot come to the hospital.  I saw Kanyabashi, two armed soldiers, get out of the car."  And you go on to say how you saw them go into maternity, and you heard him say to the women, "Why are you hiding men?  This is a place for women."  And the women said that there were no men there.  

And you later saw him come out of there and he came back an hour later, with soldiers, two soldiers, and a few minutes later you say you saw a group of about 12 soldiers in a black Toyota minibus come to the hospital, and you saw them go into the hospital.  And at that moment you say your brother was outside his room and he was asked for identification, with Kanyabashi there.  They laughed at his identity card.  

Later, Kanyabashi leaves, rather, and the soldiers left, and your brother said to you, "Pray a lot," and you saw that he was sweating.  About half an hour later, Kanyabashi came back with his white Peugeot and he waited outside the hospital.  Other soldiers were there in a minibus.  Soldiers with rifles entered the hospital and they took out Tutsis and people who had no identity cards and they were put in the minibus and your brother was, too, about 30 of them altogether, and they left, Kanyabashi leading the way.  

And you were later told by a soldier called Placide -- we'll give his full name -- who you met at the hospital that your brother and some other people were killed that day at the university laboratory barrier, and he named the soldier who had killed your brother, and you give that man's name, Nyibizi -- Niyibizi.  Sorry, I pronounced it wrongly.  And, again, is that account, in general, is that account a true account, that account you gave?  Do you want to alter it or add to it, or is it about right?  
A.	I understand what you just said, but all that didn't happen at once, nor even on the same day.  It's true that the chronology is correct, but it wasn't on the same day.  

I remember that I saw Kanyabashi, with soldiers, who stopped in front of the maternity ward and the surgery.  I think they're very close together, those two wards.  I also remember people taken away in the minibus, and I did say that to the investigator.  And when the minibus drove off, Kanyabashi's Peugeot was parked below, near the maternity.  The minibus was parked next to the dermatology and ophthalmology sections.  

Regarding the 30 people, I say that I saw the minibus full of people, but I don't say they were all people taken from the hospital.  They could have been other people, also, taken from other places.  I think that at that time I saw Kanyabashi when I was going back up, and that was when my brother, my cousin, was taken away.  But at that time Kanyabashi's vehicle left and then came back with a minibus.  

I was asked how many people were in the minibus.  I said that they were crammed in, and all the more so since the seats had been removed and the people were sitting on top of each other.  That is why I said there were about 30, approximately.  I remember having stated that to the investigator. 
Q.	Yes, thank you.  And then you conclude by saying you didn't see Kanyabashi again, and you hid in one of the toilets.  And after two weeks, you asked that soldier, Placide, who you knew, who knew where you were hiding, to take you to the area of your home.  And on the way you passed the barrier at the laboratory, the university laboratory, where he talked to the soldiers, and you were able to pass and you saw that people were killed there with axes and machetes.  And then you end up -- first of all, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  As I was descending, I passed the roadblock, the one near the university, and Placide spoke to the three youths manning the roadblock.  I had just seen them strike down two people and they were getting ready to kill the third one.  Those people were screaming and I saw the others dying, in the last throes of death, and that is how I passed that roadblock, with Placide's help, and I went on my way to Cyarwa. 
Q.	And all that, of course, at the time when you were, I think, 14; is that right? 
A.	I gave my approximate age in answer to a question put to me by the investigator.  I was born in 1978, but when he put the question to me, I told him what I estimated my age to be at the time. 
Q.	Fifteen.  And you end up saying this:  "According to me, the following people are responsible for the mass killings in Butare":  1. Kanyabashi; 2. Munyagasheke; 3. Deputy Laurent Baravuga; 4. a woman deputy in Shyanda commune.  "People said she was responsible for the killings of Tutsi people in Shyanda."  

In respect of those four names that you mentioned there, is that correct; do you stand by that? 
A.	Yes, those four people are the ones I heard people talking about around me.  It is possible that other people played a role in the massacres, but as far as I'm concerned, I learned that those four were actively implicated in the perpetration of those massacres. 
Q.	Now, the dates that you've accepted -- or you rely on now from your earlier statement, if you're in the hospital from at least the 6th of April to the end, it's three weeks, and to the end of May is another four.  That's seven weeks altogether that you're at the hospital, the last two weeks of which you spent hiding in the toilet.  Does that sound about right to you, or not?  
A.	If I wanted to lie to you, I would give you a precise period of time in relation to my stay in the hospital.  I stayed in the hospital till I got tired and I asked Placide to take me to Cyarwa.  It was difficult for me to know for how long I had stayed at the hospital.  You know, during the events, at one point one began to feel that one would rather die than go on living in such impossible conditions.  If I gave a time frame referring to the time I spent in the hospital, it was an approximation. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Those are all my questions.  The only other thing is, Dr. Rwamakuba would like to meet this witness.  If this witness is willing to go and meet him, can he be given leave of the Chamber to do so?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, permission is granted.  

Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of your evidence now.  The Chamber thanks you for coming here to give testimony in this trial.  Now your evidence has ended; you are free to leave and we discharge you.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. HOOPER:
As the next witness is being brought here, Mr. President, can I explain a difficulty?  We have an unprotected witness, Professor Mercenier -- I'm unsure of his precise age, but he's an elderly man.  He arrived from Florence via Schipol yesterday, and I'd gone to the hotel to meet him but he hadn't arrived, I believe, until about midnight so I didn't see him last night.  

I've given him an undertaking that he will be able to leave here by Saturday because his wife, who accompanies him, has appointments on Monday.  And I'd given him that very firm undertaking.  And the difficulty is we're not sitting past today -- at least, we're not at present.  I've raised this with the Prosecution, and as I understand it, there's no objection on their part to me interposing Professor Mercenier at 2 o'clock.  I've arranged to meet him here at 12:30, and I hope to be able to go through with him his expected area of evidence by 2 o'clock in order to call him at 2 o'clock.  And if all goes well, I think that should be achievable.  

I would have thought that I'd be about 45 minutes in-chief and the Prosecution, I would have thought -- well, we'll see, but I wouldn't have thought very long.  So if he can be deposed at 2, though that would be inconvenient to this witness, we can deal with it.  And if I have a problem at 2, and I don't expect I will, but if for some reason, for example, he just doesn't turn up at 12:30, whatever, I can raise that matter, I hope, and receive a sympathetic hearing at 2 o'clock, but I don't anticipate that problem -- or mildly sympathetic reception at 2 o'clock.  I don't expect that that would be a problem.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. HOOPER:  
So I'll call the next witness.  She's there.  This witness will take me an hour and a half in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor?  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think we did agree that the professor could give his evidence this afternoon.  The only question now is the problem of time for examination-in-chief and cross-examination, but we are ready to take that witness this afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Good morning, Madam Witness.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Mr. President, before we commence, would it be possible to resolve the issue of the exhibits concerning the last witness now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I'm sorry, we should have done that, I agree.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
So we have three documents:  one is the compiled document submitted to us by the Defence, comprising of an account of two meetings, one of 2004 and the other of 2005.  That should be under seal, as it's a confidential document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have the recommended numbers?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm afraid I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar.  
MR. FRY:
P. 81, Your Honour.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you.  And the second document can go in as A and B.  They're basically the French and English version of the OTP statement of this witness taken in June 1996, and that will be all for the Prosecutor.  Also under seal, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Numbers?  
MR. FRY:
P. 82A and B, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  The Defence?  
(Exhibit No. P. 81 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. P. 82A and P. 82B admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, the witness identification document, under seal, is D. 184, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
MR. HOOPER:
The photograph that the witness had sight of is already exhibited.  I don't refer to that exhibit, but it is a photograph of André Rwamakuba, taken in 1999.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the personal identification sheet for the witness was already admitted as D. 183. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  We've had some introductory words, haven't we?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  I'm going to go up there so I can see her.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we thank you for coming to give evidence at our Tribunal.  The first step is that the registrar will give you an oath to tell the truth.  The registrar will do that now. 
(Declaration made by Witness 9/17 in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Madam Witness, under the rules of our Tribunal, you will give your evidence by answering questions put to you by the persons designated with that task.  You'll have to, first of all, answer questions from the lawyer representing the Accused André Rwamakuba, and he will now commence asking you questions so that your testimony can commence.  

Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
	Yes.
WITNESS 9/17,
having first been duly sworn,
testified as follows:  
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, I'm the first one to be asking you questions, and I'm standing over slightly to your left-hand side, so I'm over here.  There, you see me.  Very good.  Okay.  You hadn't seen me wearing this hat before, I know.  Don't worry about it; it is me.  We've met before, haven't we?  We met at the safe house and we met, I think, in July this year in Butare, when you were good enough to meet me.  
A.	Yes, it is not the first time we are meeting. 
Q.	And I think it's right, is it not, that you've never been outside Rwanda before; this is your first trip to another country? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	Have you ever given evidence before in any case? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And I think, like everybody else who gets into that seat, you must be feeling very nervous; is that right? 
A.	No, I'm not very nervous.  A little bit, perhaps. 
Q.	Very good.  All right.  And you know that the people in front of you in red are the Judges, and the rest of us all work in the courtroom.  Yes?  All right.  

Now, there's a document -- because you're a protected witness, there's a document that you're going to be provided -- or you may have got already, and which is -- contains your personal details.  It has your name and your address on it, for example.  And we're going to go through that.  We'll go through it in such a way that only the Judges and people who are sworn to secrecy will know about what's in it.  So do you have the -- Mr. Mjui, does -- 
A.	I can neither read nor write, Counsel. 
Q.	I know that.  So what we're going to do is, we'll have to do is to go into closed session and we'll go through it in that way, and closed session will take five minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the public, we have to go into closed session for questions affecting the identity of the witness.  It's anticipated that this will take just about five minutes, before resuming in open session.  We go into closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 21 to 22] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 10 to 20 by Karen Holm)



















BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Right.  So in closed session, basically what we learned is that you come from Butare and you're Tutsi and you're a survivor of the genocide, and you were telling us that before the 6th of April, when President Habyarimana was murdered, that there was peace and harmony, in your words, in your area between Tutsis and Hutus.  Then after President Habyarimana was killed, and we know that that was on the night of the 6th of April -- and may I say we're not bothered with dates here, all right -- but after that, how did things turn out?  
A.	After the death of President Habyarimana, we had three days of calm, but on the fourth day they began to chase us.  Even Hutu civilians were fleeing with us, thinking that they were also under threat.  Afterward they realised that they were not targets and only the Tutsis were being targeted.  
Q.	Did a time come when you left your home and, if so, where did you go? 
A.	I left (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), where my husband lived.  I went back to my home in ***** commune.  I went with my children.  I thought I would be safe in *******, but I did not find safety there, not the safety that I had hoped for. 
Q.	Can we redact, that is to say, obliterate and take out, the name she gave where her husband came from? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the redaction order is made. 
MR. HOOPER:
And I think we're all right in going to ******** commune because it's a large place, and a lot of people went there. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sorry to interrupt you, Madam Witness, we're just keeping your personal details out of the picture at the moment.  So you went to Huye commune, which is spelt H-U-Y-E, which is part of Butare generally, because you had some family there.  And having got there, what happened there?
A.	The day after I arrived in Huye, the bourgmestre Jonathase of Huye, told us to follow him and flee with him, but it was a trap that he had set for us.  We took our livestock, our cows, our personal property, and we left.  We spent three days, and that is how the killings began. 
Q.	Now, the bourgmestre who set this trap was a man called Ruremesha, is that right?  I'll spell it, R-U-R-E-M-E-S-H-A.  
A.	Yes, it is Jonathase Ruremesha. 
Q.	And where did he get you all to go?  Where did you go to?  
A.	He told us to meet him in the commune office so that he could protect us. 
Q.	And is that -- that's the commune office of Huye, H-U-Y-E, which is now, just a bit confusingly, known as the commune office of Ngoma, is that right?  It's now the commune office of Ngoma?  
A.	Today -- today the district is called Ngoma, but before, during the time we're referring to, it was the commune office of Huye commune. 
Q.	And for those of us who aren't familiar with Butare, that is a quite distinct and different place to the préfecture office, which is further down the road and is a different building and place; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, having gone to that place with your livestock and your family, after three days what happened? 
A.	They started taking -- killing the cows and killing the people.  They started with my nephew and my big sister, but my nephew did not die, immediately.  So my brother asked Jonathase for the vehicle.  Jonathase refused.  And there was another professor who lent us his vehicle and we all got in to evacuate the wounded person to hospital.  When we got to Nyiramasuhuko's roadblock, they were pulled out of the car and killed.  I stayed in the vehicle. 
Q.	Just pause there.  When the killings started at the commune office, your sister and nephew were killed, were these killings -- how were these killings done?  Well, let me ask you, was there any shooting at that place?  Were guns used or not? 
A.	No.  I'm telling you that, first of all, the firing hadn't yet begun.  The assailants weren't using guns. 
Q.	Now, you managed to get a vehicle, and in that vehicle did you go straight to the barrier or did you go somewhere else first? 
A.	We first went to the groupe scolaire, the school complex. 
Q.	And what happened there, please? 
A.	The bourgmestre asked us to remove the corpses so that survivors shouldn't cry because of the corpses.  And when we got to the school complex, the groupe scolaire, we dropped off the corpses.  
Q.	And after that, you go to the barrier, and who were you with in the vehicle, when you got to the barrier, who else was with you? 
A.	I was with my brother, the driver and my nephew. 
Q.	And were they all well, or not?  
A.	You're speaking -- you mean the people who came with me or the people that I left at the communal office?  
Q.	No, I'm sorry, it's my fault.  Your brother, the driver and your nephew, were they injured or uninjured by the time you got to the barrier?  
A.	Yes, they were all okay, except for my nephew who had been wounded, who was injured, and who was in fact the reason for which we headed for the hospital.  It is he that we were taking to the hospital. 
Q.	Now, this barrier you told us was at Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's place, or near it -- we have a spelling for that on the word list, of course -- and you've told us they were killed there.  Did you see those people being killed, something you witnessed yourself?  
A.	I was with those people. 
Q.	Now, you managed to survive that attack.  How did you manage to do that?  
A.	We all got down from the vehicle.  My companions were killed and their corpses thrown into the ditch by the road.  And as far as I'm concerned, I was beaten round the shoulders and told that I could die some other way, elsewhere.  They let me go, saying that I would meet my death before me, on the road -- on my way, and I went to the hospital. 
Q.	Now, when you got to the hospital in the first day or two, where did you stay?  
A.	I was staying in the tents, the tents that had been erected.  Those tents were known as sheeting.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Which is quite simply the English word S-H double-E T-I-N-G.  Spelling courtesy of the Kinyarwanda booth, but it is the English word "sheeting".  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And when we talk here of the hospital, so we're in no doubt, this is the university hospital of Butare; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, you arrive alone at the hospital, and as one understands your position, your family, the rest of your family, were back at the commune office; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And would that include, that family, would that include your (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) children?  
MR. HOOPER:
	Can you redact (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the order is made accordingly. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Your children, your husband, your mother and father and other family members; is that right?  
A.	Yes, all of them were there. 
Q.	Did you ever try to go back to the commune office, or not?  
A.	I consistently wanted to, but you know we all fear death, or at least we fear suffering, and when I wanted to go there, I was afraid.  I feared for my life and therefore did not return there.
Q.	And do you know what happened to them? 
A.	You mean the people I left at the communal office?  Well, as regards those people, they are dead. 
Q.	Do you know how long after the time when you got to the hospital it was before they were killed, before they were attacked there?  
A.	I left the communal office on Wednesday and the members of my family and the other people there were killed on Friday, at 3 p.m.  It was on that day at that time that soldiers attacked that place with firearms.  
Q.	And if you can't help us, say so, but do you know what date that was that the attack took place? 
A.	I don't recall.  It was difficult under the circumstances to know what date it was. 
Q.	Yes, indeed.  All right.  Now, you were at the hospital.  Did anything happen on that day or the next day, that you noticed? 
A.	The day my family members died, Nyiramasuhuko came to the sheeting and asked -- with others, and asked whether there were any people from Huye among us.  When we heard that question, we were afraid.  And Nyiramasuhuko declared the sheeting must be removed, dismantled, on the following morning.  And that is what was done the next morning, so that the people who had sought shelter under the sheeting dispersed.  We were in distress as of that moment. 
Q.	Did you see any of your family again? 
A.	Now, where would I have met any member of my family?  The only member of my family that I met subsequently was the child who had himself been injured with a bladed weapon, who in fact had sustained several injuries, and that child found me subsequently at the hospital. 
Q.	And was that a boy or a girl?  That's for the translation.  Perhaps you can -- it came to my ears as a "he" which is not an uncommon problem with our translation.  
A.	It was a girl.  It was a girl. 
Q.	And I have her name, and I can provide that name, if required.  And how old was she at that time? 
A.	I don't recall.  Maybe she was 18.  I think I gave her age in the statement I previously made.  Maybe you can help refresh my memory. 
Q.	It doesn't matter.  Say she's about 18.  Was she -- amongst your children, was she the eldest or not? 
A.	She was the eldest. 
Q.	And can you tell the Judges a little of what injuries she had when she came to the hospital and perhaps how she is today as a result? 
A.	Her Achilles tendons had been cut through and she had been shot in the legs so that today she cannot bend her legs.  Her legs are permanently straight. 
Q.	And do you have any idea how she managed to survive the attack at the commune -- commune office?  
A.	Can you really say she survived or that she escaped from that attack under such conditions as I've described?  
Q.	I take your point.  Let me put it like this, then:  Do you know how she managed to get, or be brought, to the hospital?  Do you know how that happened? 
A.	At the time we had Hutu friends and some of our girls had married Hutus.  A brother-in-law of my daughter's found her and he gave some of the Interahamwe money, and they carried my daughter, who couldn't move, and brought her to the hospital.  That's how she got to the hospital. 
Q.	And having got to the hospital, was she able to get a bed, or not?  
A.	The sheeting had been removed and then I covered my face with a cloth to -- in order to appear as a woman of the same ethnic group as the assailants, the Interahamwe, and in order to survive and care for my daughter, find a doctor to treat her.  And subsequently, luckily, a doctor noted her presence, my daughter's presence, and the state in which she was and treated her.
Q.	And was she placed in a ward, a hospital ward, with a bed, or not? 
A.	There was a section, a ward, where the injured people, wounded people, were.  It was called the surgical ward, where there were beds.  And my daughter was admitted in that ward, so she was given a bed. 
Q.	And how long did your daughter and you remain at the hospital after that?  When did you come to leave the hospital? 
A.	We left the hospital in July, when the Inkotanyi conquered Rwanda, but given that my daughter was still at the hospital, was somehow or another suspended from some machinery that made it possible for her -- which she was being treated with, I stayed by her side at the hospital until the month of September. 
Q.	Now, the ward which you were in, was that just for women and girls or was it also for men?  Which was it? 
A.	Before the war there were wards for women, young girls, children and men, but during the war the essential thing was to find a place.  And at the moment one found a place, one would go anywhere, even with men.  Before, of course, before all that, women could not be admitted in the same ward as men. 
Q.	I'm just going to put two names to you at this stage and I'll come back to them later, but I just want you to answer this, whether the names I mention are names of people who you saw in the ward or not, and the names are Kazasomaho and Mutabazi.  Again, their names are on the list, I hope.  I'll spell Kazasomaho, though, K-A-Z-A-S-O-M-A-H-O, and Mutabazi, M-U-T-A-B-A-Z-I.   

Did you see any persons with that name, Madam Witness?  
A.	We were together.  
Q.	I'll come back to them a little later.  Now, you've told us of the daughter who was brought to the hospital in a very bad state after the attack on the commune office.  Was she the only one -- 
A.	Yes, you are right, she was seriously injured during the attack on the communal office. 
Q.	After the war did you learn that another one of your children had survived? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And perhaps I can just lead on this detail, that is it right that that child who was 10 years old, a daughter, had been effectively adopted by another family and it was only after the war that you were able to rediscover one another, and she is now back, living with you?  Is that, in sum, the brief circumstances of what happened in respect of that second surviving child?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Before we stop for the break, I just have one matter I'd like to deal with now, very briefly.  Did you learn that another one of your children was in fact brought to the hospital from the commune office, and do you know what happened to that child? 
A.	Are you referring to the eldest one or the youngest one?  
Q.	To your twin, to the twin.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, has there been any previous reference to twins?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, you have her statement.  Are you disputing this?  
MS. FALL:
We're in examination-in-chief.  
MR. HOOPER:
There's a time and place for it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, you can rephrase the question.  
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you learn of any child -- well, among your children, did you learn if any other of your children had been brought to the hospital at any time while you were there, and can you just tell the Judges the circumstances, please? 
A.	The Red Cross vehicles will pick -- would pick out from among the corpses the children still alive, so the Red Cross took my child to the school complex known as groupe scolaire, and after the sheeting had been removed where it had been put up, Nyiramasuhuko sent a vehicle and that vehicle picked up children under the pretext of feeding them, but they were taken to a hole in Nyaruhengere, and taken in two buses.  My child died among those people. 
Q.	Was that child a twin child or not? 
A.	Yes, I had twins, in fact, non-identical, a boy and a girl. 
Q.	And do you know what happened to the other twin? 
A.	The other twin died at the communal office. 
Q.	How old were they? 
A.	It was the girl twin.  She was with her sister who survived, and I heard that she received a gunshot wound in the nape of the neck, and she died from that bullet wound. 
Q.	And these twins, how old were they at that time? 
A.	Six years and seven months. 
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, we'll deal with other more general matters afterwards and we're going to have a break now, and I think I'd better explain to you that I've got a witness who's come all the way from Italy, in Europe, to give evidence, and he has to give evidence this afternoon and so we're going to take his evidence at 2 o'clock and then we hope it won't take much more than an hour and a half.  And then we can come back to your evidence.  And I'm sorry for that interruption, but it means this:  That you'll be taken, I hope, by WVS back to the safe house for lunch and we needn't expect you to come back before 3 o'clock this afternoon.  So you have a bit of a break and a rest from your evidence.  Is that all right?  I hope you understand why we're doing it.  
A.	Yes, I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam -- could you put back on her headphones?  

Thank you.  Mr. Hooper, is it confirmed that the prospective witness is here now?  You see, if he is not here and she doesn't come back until 3 o'clock, we're going to be in trouble 
MR. HOOPER:
Can we liaise with WVS?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
Before we let this witness go.  We'll let them know what the position is. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Madam Witness, we are going to take the luncheon adjournment now.  I should advise you that while you're a witness, if there are any adjournments or breaks, you are not to discuss the case or your evidence in the case with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in relation to the -- the remainder of your testimony, you'll have to be on standby to give your evidence even earlier if the witness either is not available or his testimony is cut short, because we would not like to have unnecessary breaks in the testimony.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We take the luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed at 1240H) 
(Pages 23 to 29 by Karen Holm)






(Court resumed at 1417H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  We thank you for coming to give testimony at our Tribunal.  As you may be aware, the first step in this process is for the registrar to administer an oath for you to tell the truth while you're giving your testimony.  And the registrar will undertake that now. 
(Declaration made by Pierre Mercenier in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers in this matter.  And you will be examined, first of all, by the lawyer representing the Accused, Dr. Rwamakuba, Mr. Hooper.  And so without further ado, I'll invite Mr. Hooper to commence his examination. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
PIERRE MERCENIER,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Your full name, please.  
A.	My name is Pierre Mercenier. 
Q.	And your current address, please? 
A.	Eighteen Via San Crispolto, Passignano, Perugia, Italy. 
MR. HOOPER:
And I'll provide the stenographers with the spelling of that address after the completion of your evidence.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you're living -- indeed, now retired and living in Italy.  Is it right that you are Belgian by origin and nationality? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	That you are a doctor, now retired? 
A.	Yes, I'm a doctor.  I started by being a doctor. 
Q.	That you held the title of professor of public health at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp? 
A.	Yes.  I was a lecturer for 24 years and then a professor in the school of medicine. 
Q.	Perhaps I can be permitted to briefly refer to your expertise and your previous studies and positions in summary in this way, that you undertook postgraduate studies in Belgium in the early 1960s and then joined the World Health Organization as a medical officer in India from 1963 to 1965; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  

I probably should specify here that I began my career as a specialist in tuberculosis.  Tuberculosis -- since tuberculosis -- or, the problems with tuberculosis have been overcome, I carried out postgraduate studies in cardiology in order to complete my training as a pneumologist.  When I went to India for the WHO, I went there as a tuberculosis specialist.  But what happened in India has changed me from a specialist in tuberculosis into a public health specialist.  So my career changed from 1965. 
Q.	Between 1965 and '70, after further postgraduate studies which you've alluded to -- 
A.	That is public health. 
Q.	Yeah.  You then had consultantships for the World Health Organization.  And then in 1970, until 1994, you initiated and pursued the development of the unit for teaching and research in public health at the Tropical Medicine Institute in Antwerp, dealing principally with both teaching and with research with specific projects that took you to Kasongo in the Congo from 1971 to '88 and off and on, obviously, and many other consultancies, including in Kigali in 1993 and 1994.  

Is that a fair summary of those years, in your respect? 
A.	I wish to say that, when I made this change in my career from a clinical specialist to a public health specialist, I wanted to focus on public health, which is a global concept.  Public health, for me, is a manner of organising the health of a population coherently.  So I was schooled in Anvers in public health, was not focused on certain areas of public health, but it has a more general and comprehensive concept based on development of research methods, which, by the way, I finished with a compendium, with a collection of articles on the research in public health with operational research and an action-oriented research. 
Q.	I think perhaps the significance of that will -- will become apparent in a moment.  Because, in 1993, is it right that you prepared a consultative report on public health for the development of the health system for the préfecture of Kigali and Kigali rural?  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  And that problem was raised within the framework of the design of a public health system, which is the official concept or design of the WHO.  And we did take part in that design.  And this on -- health districts.  

So the problem for the Kigali préfecture was that -- well, the first problem, I would say, for 
Kigali préfecture is that the administrative divisions, such as the préfectures in the case in point, are based on -- I don't know what to say, on criteria -- on administrative criteria and not on operational criteria for the organisation of public services.  So the first problem that was raised in Kigali was to know how Kigali could -- was to know if Kigali could operate as a health district or if it should be considered that Kigali was too big, which was my view.  Now, Kigali préfecture is too big to be a health district.  We, therefore, needed to see how we could distribute the population over the territory and in various health districts.  Some districts are obvious.  For instance, the south of Kigali district is the 
Bugesera region, which is to the south of the river and which is also a region that was seen as a good health district.  

But on the -- to the north, things were a bit more complicated and required research and studies.  In the west, my idea was that probably this was a territory -- certain territories that were on that Kigali would be covered by districts that were astride other districts, such as the Kibuye préfecture, for instance. 
Q.	Right.  So would it be fair to say that the objective of all this was to provide an efficient and functioning health service within a given area? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, if -- do you know someone called Francois Monet? 
A.	Yes, of course.  Francois Monet was my colleague for a number of years.  
Q.	And we anticipate hearing from him next week, as I think you know, and he can tell us perhaps a little more about things on the ground, as it were, there.  But was he part of the team that you consulted with in respect of this, if I can put it, macro project that you were seeking to put in place? 
A.	Are you talking about the Kigali project?  
Q.	Yes, more generally.  
A.	Yes, of course.  Actually, the Kigali project was a cooperation between the Belgian medical cooperation agency and the Rwandan government.  And Dr. Monet had been appointed by the Belgian cooperation agency as a doctor to work with the doctor of the Kigali préfecture.  Since he had worked with me for a long time, he suggested that I be recruited as a consultant for this project. 
Q.	Now, do you know of a Dr. André Rwamakuba, and did he ever -- did he have any part to play in this project? 
A.	Dr. Rwamakuba, I do not know the exact term, but I think he was the chief doctor of the Kigali préfecture.  In other words, Dr. Rwamakuba -- well, I don't know how to describe it.  I think he would -- was the colleague of Dr. Monet, or I don't know whether Dr. Monet was the colleague of Dr. Rwamakuba, the counterpart of Dr. Rwamakuba.  But I did not know Dr. Rwamakuba before that.  
Q.	I'm going to pass up a CV relating to Dr. Rwamakuba, and I want you to look at it in order for you to comment on his expertise.  
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphone not activated)...one for -- I hope that's complete, for Professor Mercenier.  The bottom one is Professor Mercenier's because it's clearer.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you were able to have a glance at this over the luncheon adjournment when we met and had a brief discussion.  And you noticed what is apparent, I suppose, on it and that is that it works backwards.  So that on the first page we have, as it were, the most recent entry of activity, and on the last of the seven pages, we are back in 1984.  
And, so working from the back, and I don't propose to go in it in detail, the curriculum vitae of André Rwamakuba, as contained in this document, shows the very first entry is a participation in an international hygiene course and of microbiology at Sousse en Tunisie.  And then working from the bottom of the next page from the back, we have various references in '85 of conferences for the environment, hygiene, epidemiology, potable water, drinkable water; in Burundi, meeting there; Nairobi, environment.  

The next page, participation in seminars and meetings for the environment related to Central Africa up to marine pollution.  In fact, then I've got a page that kicks back several years, and we have him -- I'm not sure in what order it has been distributed, but there's then reference to his being a doctor in hospital in 1980.  We have him as the chief of the hygiene division at the ministry of public health from '84 to '89; '86, epidemiology again, lavatories and waste, various other meetings -- other offices.  

I see it's, in fact, a general CV, going back to '62.  And the first page is "formation", which takes us up through his candidature in medical science at Louvain, doctorate in general medicine at Butare in '75 to '78; 1982, a specialisation in hygiene at Louvain, Louvain, sorry; '84, participation microbiology and hygiene that's the Sousse one; '87, studies in America on sources -- natural sources -- resources, rather, and environment; ending in '92 with formational studying in respect of family planning at Bunani.  

And what you've been able to glean, I understand, from that list of studies and expertise, have you any observations to make in respect of André Rwamakuba's expertise? 
A.	Yes.  Undoubtedly, this is a very good CV, which is full of many things.  So it can be said that Dr. Rwamakuba received much training in the area of public health.  I'd like to draw your attention to this:  In public health these -- this training is specialised in our view of public health.  For the most part, I'd say that training in hygiene, environmental hygiene, and so on and so forth, microbiology, leading up to 1992 training of trainers in family planning, are all specialised areas of public health.  And it is because I saw this curriculum that I emphasised the fact a while ago, that what we began as a project in Kigali at the request of the Belgian cooperation agency and the Rwandan government, was to establish the basis for a health system that would be coherent, that is, a global approach to the provision of health services to the population.  

And this was not for areas which are considered -- which are considered as specialisations, such as hygiene, which involves only part of health and family planning, to give another example, which are limited to particular areas of public health -- which are not unimportant, mind you.  I don't want to deny the importance, but they do not give a global idea of what a health system is.  

From that viewpoint, Dr. Rwamakuba, as a Rwandan head of the project which was to be implemented in Kigali préfecture, he did not have sufficient training for that position, which is why I suggested that he pursue further training before going out to obtain field -- field experience. 
Q.	Now, as a consequence of that suggestion, was that suggestion acted upon by André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes.  The recommendations could only be complied with within one year, so rather because of that, he had offered -- I suggested that he follow the training -- he undergo training, and it followed he went for the training.  He didn't -- the rest of it didn't go through because there were these dramatic events that occurred. 
Q.	And the dramatic events, of course, is the war and genocide -- and genocide, I should say, of April of 1994 and onward.  

	And you nod your head in agreement.  

Now, where did André Rwamakuba pursue the course that you recommended was necessary in order for him to have a proper concept of a macro approach to public hygiene?  Where would that course have been? 
A.	At the Institute of Tropical Medicine. 
Q.	And that's in Antwerp, in Belgium? 
A.	That's right, yes.  Actually, the Institute of Tropical Medicine is in Anvers. 
Q.	Yes, pardon. 

And you are away at the moment, as it were, from paper and dates to the extent where you can be specific.  And we may be hearing, as we anticipate we will, from a Professor van Balen and also from a Dr. Monet, who may be in a better position to assist us as to that, but what is your general recollection in respect of the time when André Rwamakuba was at Anvers and studying?  What are the approximate start and finish dates of that course? 
A.	I do not have my papers here with me.  I think Dr. van Balen gave me an attestation, which I had prepared at the end of Dr. Rwamakuba's training in October.  I do not have the attestation here before me, but I believe it began on the 27th of September, and it ended on the 9th of March.  I suppose you do have the documents because I don't.  So I prepared this attestation at the end of his training. 
Q.	I do have the document.  And I'd ask you to look, first of all, at a document that's headed, French, 
	Rapport des stages and, secondly, at a document that is headed attestation.  And these documents will be formally entered into the record, drawing the evidence of a later witness, namely, Professor van Balen, who is the initial producer.  

But I'd like you to look at these documents for your own benefit, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Rapport de stage" is "training report."  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And on the rapport des stages, which is the document that is submitted by the stagiaire, or the student, in this case Rwamakuba, the dates shown on that are, if you can just let us know as you look at it.  
A.	On my attestation?  
Q.	On the rapport de stage.  
A.	Your report, it is indicated 27 September to -- 1993 to 27 March 1994.  
Q.	And, indeed, in terms of your attestation, can you give us the dates there, please.  
A.	My attestation is dated 27 September 1993 to 9th March 1994.  So the dates don't agree.  
Q.	Yes.  The dates don't agree in the sense that your attestation goes to the 9th of March and the 
	rapport goes to the 27th of March.  And we will look for an explanation, I think, elsewhere in respect of that.  

But, essentially, we have a course that is followed from September until March.  And as far as your recollection goes of the nature of the course, would that fit in with your expectations of what would be expected of a student on that -- on that course? 
A.	I think -- yes, I think so.  At that time I was waiting to see the results of that training course in the field.  A training course, in my view, is judged by the results of what the trainee will be doing with his training when he shall return to resume his field responsibilities.  
Q.	And from what you've said, would be -- would we be right or wrong in seeing this course as an important, even essential, prerequisite to André Rwamakuba's being able to discharge his obligations in terms of the structure that was to be set up? 
A.	In any case, the application of all of that did not depend solely on him but also on the collaboration between he and Mr. Monet -- Dr. Monet under some supervision of some kind from me.  I cannot draw any final conclusions from it because I would only have been able to draw such conclusions after a certain period of time. 
Q.	Now, during the period of that course, from September till March, would your expectation be that the student would essentially remain in Belgium on the course, or not? 
A.	This is a full-time course, so normally he would have stayed in Belgium for the duration of the course, with, of course, holidays.  I don't know what breaks he may have had, but there were at least the Christmas holidays during that time.  And during that time, courses are suspended for a fortnight, you'll see, and I myself was absent, as I was on holiday too. 
Q.	Now, from the nature of his studies and from your own functions there, if André Rwamakuba decided to go off, for example, to the North Pole for a visit during the -- during the course, you wouldn't know if he'd gone or not.  Would that be fair to say? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you meet him at any time or times during the course? 
A.	I have no recorded data on the regular meetings that I had with the doctors who were undergoing training in our unit.  I am talking here in general terms.  I used to meet people who were on training once a week or once every two weeks.  But I have nothing precise to say in respect of André Rwamakuba's particular situation.  But I'd say he -- that this training was followed without any particular events taking place.  
Q.	All right.  So an expectation, then, of regular meetings on a weekly or fortnightly basis with you, do you recall, in fact, ever -- any specific meeting with André Rwamakuba?  I know it's a long time ago, but do you have a recollection at all? 
A.	Meeting -- a meeting on the training programme?  No. 
Q.	Did you meet him at all?  Was there ever a face-to-face meeting that you can remember taking place? 
A.	Yes.  I said in my statement that there was one case which did not involve a meeting concerning his training, but it concerned the future of the project in Kigali.  I had this meeting with him; I believe it was on the 21st of February.  I have indicated that in my statement.  

And, as I said, the aim of this meeting was not to test the degree of his training but was mainly aimed as to determine whether I was going to carry out this mission in Rwanda, which was slated for 
April 1994, or whether I wasn't going to go to that mission.  So I had a talk with Dr. Rwamakuba at that time, and I wanted to ask him, "Is it worth my going to Rwanda or not?" 

But it was not a discussion of his training.  It concerned what was going to happen subsequently, that is, my next mission as a consultant in Kigali. 
Q.	And, in brief, what was said concerning that? 
A.	In the month before, or in the couple of months before, perhaps in January or February, I don't really remember, I received a letter from Dr. Monet, who had stayed back in Kigali, indicating that the political situation in Rwanda was extremely tense, and, therefore, he thought that my mission might not be very useful.  Since all energies were being devoted to political debate, he felt that I would be wasting my time, in a way, if I went to a mission -- on a mission to Rwanda at that time.  

The purpose of my interview with Dr. Rwamakuba that I referred to as having taken place on the 
21st of February, if I remember, was to ask him what he thought about it.  And his answer was very clear:  "Yes, you must come."  
Q.	And, indeed, you did go, is this right, arriving in Kigali with your wife at about quarter past 6 on the 
	4th of April 1994, just two days before the president was killed?  Is that right? 
A.	Yes.  I don't really remember the exact time.  
Q.	In any event, whatever the time, you were -- you went and stayed at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  Can I ask you, do you remember or not whether Dr. Rwamakuba met you at the airport?  You remember if he did or he didn't? 
A.	I wrote in my statement that I did not remember whether he came or not.  But normally I would have expected him to be there, but I don't really remember what happened.  From that point, Dr. Monet would be in a better position to give an exact answer.  I do not remember.  
Q.	And over the next couple of days, before the plane was shot down, can you recall if there were any meetings which concerned Dr. André Rwamakuba and yourself? 
A.	I also said that I did not actually remember his presence.  We worked for two days, the day after my arrival and the day after that, this being the day that came -- preceding the air crash.  These were normal working days.  But I do not remember whether he was present or not.  Once more, perhaps Dr. Monet has more precise records of all that.  I am speaking from memory because I had -- I have not been able to find my documents or the records I kept at the time.  
Q.	And, again, I don't think that there will be any dispute about that.  But you and your wife were with Dr. Monet the night of the crash, and, in fact, I understand you actually heard the explosion; is that right? 
A.	We heard a noise, and we wondered what it was.  It is only afterwards that we understood that this noise was connected to the crash in question.  
Q.	And over the next several days, right, you remained in the Hôtel des Mille Collines until you were evacuated on the 11th of April to Nairobi; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And while you were there, did you come to learn from Dr. Monet that Dr. Rwamakuba had been made a minister or member of a new government in Rwanda?  And, if so, what was your reaction to that, please? 
A.	I learnt of it in the -- for a few days, telephone communication was satisfactory, and so I was in regular contact with Dr. Monet.  And when we learned that a new government had been formed, we thought that it was a good response of the Rwandan political areas, or milieus, to restore a certain amount of power in a situation of chaos.  
Q.	And since leaving Kigali, Rwanda, on the 11th of April, have you had any communication with Dr. Rwamakuba? 
A.	None. 
Q.	Finally, can I just pass up to you, please, some documents and ask you if you recognise the nature of the documents and the nature, degrees, and the like.  
MR. HOOPER:
That's for the witness.

I'll show you photocopies and retain the originals I have, which can be inspected, if need be, by the Judges and the witness, please.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And looking at these, I don't intend to go into them in detail -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, would it be possible to give the English interpreters a copy of this, perhaps the French interpreters as well? 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm afraid I don't have sufficient, but I'm going to deal with it in a way which I hope will not be a burden on the booths. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would it be fair to say that there's four documents here, or photocopies of documents, that relate to André Rwamakuba on the face of them and which relate to various degrees or courses, some of which appear in the CV that you've already referred to and which, to your eye, have the appearance of authenticity?  I doubt if they're disputed, in any event.  Can I put it in that way? 
A.	I can say nothing -- I can't say anything about those documents.  I don't have any reason to believe that they are not authentic, but I have no reason, either....  

No, there's nothing I can say about that. 
Q.	Very well.  I think some of those matters appear in the CV; is that right? 
A.	But I notice that the documents have been authenticated.  But I don't have any competence to say anything.  They seem to have been authenticated by a notary public in Louvain.  
Q.	Yes.  You might be right.  Yeah.  

The originals bear stamps and -- and -- authenticating stamps as well from the Canton de vaud and from Namibia.  

Very well.  Well, I don't think I need trouble you any more, Professor, with those.  

Did you ever discuss politics with André Rwamakuba that you can recall? 
A.	Well, we didn't discuss the internal politics of Rwanda because I didn't know the politics there.  As for the external political situation, yes, a little bit during our discussion of 21 February, I think.  In our discussions of 21 February, we did exchange a few ideas on the situation that was prevailing in Rwanda within the backdrop of the Arusha Accords.  And I expressed concern -- well, this was my opinion.  I did express concern on the international imposition of peace that didn't seem to have been accepted by the parties and which resembled -- kind of reflected a tragedy that had taken place in Burundi that I learned of vicariously, probably six months before, with the assassination of President Ndadaye.  So I was somewhat under the impression that the game, the small game that had been played out in Burundi six months before was being replayed again in Rwanda.  
Q.	And what had played out in Burundi in particular? 
A.	Well, under pressure that you could consider as not being negative, I tried to think -- well, now that I remember, the situation at that time, there was a so-called democratic process that had been put in place, a president having been elected, and everyone considered that the situation in Burundi was probably being resolved.  And then, three months later, after a Hutu president had been elected, he was assassinated.  And at that time I had colleagues in Burundi who witnessed the situation. 

And the murder, or assassination, of President Ndadaye at that time was monitored, or was followed, by the same kind of anti-Tutsi massacres that took place in Rwanda six months later.  
Q.	Have you any idea of the numbers of Tutsis who were killed in Burundi in those massacres in October, November, whenever, after the death of Ndadaye? 
A.	Well, absolutely not.  What those colleagues that were in the country at the time told me later was that the majority population, which was Hutu, had said that, if they as much as touched a hair on Ndadaye's head, a massacre would ensue.  

I'm probably exaggerating, and I'm sorry.  Probably I'm exaggerating.  I can't say those were the exact terms that were used.  But, to put things more simply, if anything, any harm, was inflicted on Ndadaye, they were going to pay for it.  In any case, it was something, you know, in the light of those two expressions.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you.  Can you wait there, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now your testimony will continue, and this time you have to respond to questions put to you by the Prosecutor, who will be questioning you now.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Mercenier.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	It's with pleasure for me to see you again this afternoon.  I am going to put a few questions to you in cross-examination, and in order to make the answers easy, I will go along the same line as Counsel Hooper.  

I will begin by talking about your curriculum vitae, which is impressive, I must say.  You are a professor of about 24 years, and I suppose that right now you are retired and you are enjoying your well-deserved rest.  

You did tell us that you were a specialist in public health.  
A.	Can I answer?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	No, I consider myself as general practitioner in public health. 
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	So as any general practitioner, I need somehow to seek the opinion of specialists. 
Q.	But we can say that this is an area that is quite familiar with you.  
A.	Yes, I worked in that area. 
Q.	You also said that you were in Kigali between 1993 and 1994. 

(No interpretation)...you went to Kigali between '93 and '94.  
A.	Yes, I went to Kigali once in 1993 for a first mission within the framework of a development project, and I must have spent about some two weeks there, and then I returned to Europe. 
Q.	Could you tell us if it was possible, even in approximate terms, at what time you got to Kigali in 1993? 
A.	No, but it was more or less the same period. 
Q.	When you say the same period -- 
A.	Well, I'm talking about the same period as in -- well, can you wait a second. 
Q.	Well, if you can just give us the month.  
A.	It would appear to me that I saw a document in the documents that Professor van Balen gave me in October from the archives of the public health unit in Anvers, where I was being requested to delay my 1993 mission, and that my secretary answered that this wouldn't be possible because she had to go on a two-week holiday, whereas I was busy with certain lectures.  That was before or after, I think, I saw that document. 
Q.	Yes, but you are not doing anything to remind us of the period or the month.  
A.	Well, let's say that, if my memory is correct, I have that document, but I don't have it here, since Dr. van Balen gave it to me some two months ago.  The time must have been around the same period as 1993, that is, around the Easter holiday season. 
Q.	Thank you for your answer.  Well, you told us that you stayed for about two weeks in Kigali at that period.  During that period, can you tell us how much time or how many times you met Dr. André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Oh, well, I can't remember at all.  He was my permanent counterpart, as it were. 
Q.	If he was my (sic) counterpart or the person with whom you had to hold discussions, this means you met him several times.  
A.	Yes, probably.  It is obvious. 
Q.	You also told us that you knew Mr. Francois Monet, who was your colleague.  Now, did your collaboration take place before you went to Kigali or after you had left Kigali? 
A.	Well, for a very long time, he was my collaborator for about eight years in the Kasongo (phonetic) -- in the Kasongo project in former Zaire.  And I think he came to Kasongo in 1973 and must have stayed there until 2002 or 2003.  I can't say exactly up to what year.  

He certainly -- I am certain that he spent two -- 4 two-year periods there, but he interrupted his stay there to follow some studies in public health in Belgium.  But I think it was '73 to '82, or '83, maybe.  Well, I knew him for a long time, and very well. 
Q.	And during those 15 days that you spent in Kigali, was Dr. Monet also frequently with you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	We are now going to move on to Mr. André Rwamakuba.  
A.	Could I ask something?  

Yes.  After leaving our project in Kasongo, Dr. Monet was appointed by Belgium cooperation in a project that I didn't work with in Butare.  And he stayed there for three or four years.  I can't say exactly for how long.  And while he was in Butare, upon his request and while I was passing through the region -- through the area to go to Kasungo, I paid him a visit, and we spent a day or two together in order to discuss the situation. 
Q.	Mr. Mercenier, you have been shown a Mr. André Rwamakuba's curriculum vitae, and you did note that the CV was impressing, though he got training in several areas.  Are you in a position today to confirm that all the information on it is true? 
A.	I have no reason to doubt it.  I would tell you that -- and probably this is outside this trial.  I will tell you that it is rather of a burden to (sic) CV, not in its credibility, but, unfortunately, for what it represents, and as -- as certificates for public health.  The training programmes that keep adding to one another and which make it such that authority did not spend enough time on the field.  But, well, it is not Africans who are responsible.  It is the international donors who are responsible for this, so my criticism doesn't concern Rwamakuba's CV but rather it is meant to be on a system that I consider to be vicious. 
Q.	Well, you must have noted that he also had training in very -- in many areas in public health.  Why would you think that he needed this special training in public health? 
A.	I think I've already addressed that issue.  His -- when I look at his CV, I realise that almost all the trainings, except his doctorate degree in medicine, concern hygiene, water resources supply, ecology and hygiene, specialisation in public hygiene in the Catholic University of Louvain, for instance.   

And another specific aspect is the training of trainers in the family planning had been in all of these courses that I would call specialisation courses.  But they are not general public health courses.  In other words, these are courses that teach people -- or, people are responsible to manage the health of a population community because the health is not only the environment, it is not only family planning, it is comprehensive, whole.  
Q.	So if I understand you well, can it be -- would it be true to say that, with respect to his duties in Kigali at that time, as somebody who was responsible for hygiene, he was not quite qualified to carry out those duties? 
A.	No, as is the case with 95 per cent of medical doctors in Africa who are appointed to their positions. 
Q.	Mr. Mercenier, we will come back to the courses or training.  

Well, we know that he received a scholarship from Belgium, cooperation and, therefore, went to Belgium.  Now, at that time it was suggested that probably it wasn't important to give the specific dates, but I will like also to refer to certain dates because those dates are important to us now.  Can you tell us at what precise moment you saw André Rwamakuba in Belgium when he came to begin his training or course? 
A.	No, absolutely not. 
Q.	Now, coming back to the dates of that training course, was it a training course that was undergone by many students? 
A.	Yes, I believe so, yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us the number of students who were undergoing that specific course? 
A.	Specifically for that year, no.  Generally speaking, I would say that these were training courses that involved some 20 students also. 
Q.	It, therefore, was not a training course that was designed for Mr. André Rwamakuba specifically? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us if André Rwamakuba was -- regularly attended the courses that were given? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Mr. Mercenier, you told us that you could not give us a precise date.  However, reference was made to the end-of-course report that was prepared by André Rwamakuba and which talks about a period going from the 27th of September 1993 to 27 March 1994.  I believe you have it.  
A.	Yes, I've just received it.  I didn't have it before, and I haven't read it. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us whether that end-of-course report was sent to you while André Rwamakuba was still in Belgium, or did you receive it after he had left? 
A.	I do not know if I ever received it.  I didn't recall the existence of such a report. 
Q.	Well, you were, I believe, responsible for the course.  
A.	Yes, I think the report was made -- I think the report was prepared for Belgium cooperation.  
Q.	But as the person in charge of the course, of the training course, you didn't see that report; is that what you want to say? 
A.	Yes.  As I said, as far as I'm concerned, and as I said a while ago, the results of the course undertaken is assessed by field work, not by the report. 
Q.	Now, this end-of-course report, you have it before you, and it shows in its introduction that the report was prepared on the 27th -- that the course took place from 27 September 1993 to 27 March 1994.  And when you look at the following page -- 
A.	Are you talking about this next page of the report? 
Q.	Yes, the second page.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	It indicates at the end that is end-of-course report prepared under 25 September '94.  I think that comes immediately after the cover page at the end of the page, that is.  
A.	Yes, I see from the 24th of February 1994. 
Q.	Yes.  This means that, with respect to the date that is written on top of the document, there is some inconsistency.  
A.	Yes, but you should note that I can see this date.  I didn't -- I wasn't aware of the existence of this report now that I see it.  I see the date of 20 February 1994, and I realise that it corresponds precisely with what I referred to -- no, rather, I'm sorry.  I think it is -- corresponds to the eve of the day that I had my discussion with Rwamakuba, because I had that discussion with him on the 21st of February.  I, therefore, think that the course -- or, the discussion that I had on the 21st of February corresponded with the end of his course and, therefore, with the end of my responsibilities over him. 
Q.	Yes, that is what I wanted to address.  Because I wanted us to take up the discussion you had with him.  And did -- and the precise date on which you had it comes to your mind? 
A.	Yes, I have a document here. 
Q.	So you are sure that it was on the 21st of February?  And, to you, the 21st of February was the date on which the course for Rwamakuba ended? 
A.	Probably. 
Q.	So after that course, that date of 21 February, have you had an opportunity of meeting André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I don't believe so. 
Q.	So you wouldn't be able to tell us whether he was still in Belgium or whether he had left Belgium? 
A.	I realise that I signed off his course -- or, the certificate of end of course bears the date 9 March.  I suppose, therefore, that the period of 20 February to 9 March is a period during which he drafted or wrote his end-of-course report.  Probably it was concluded on the 9th of March, but I can't be certain about that.  So this doesn't correspond at all with what is written on the end-of-course report.  
Q.	Yes, 28th March.  
A.	No, I can only explain this in one way.  Probably there are other ways in which this can be explained.  I think that probably the report was not prepared for me or for the course director.  The report was prepared for the administration of Belgian cooperation.  And the length of the scholarship -- the period of the scholarship of Rwamakuba depended on the administrative considerations of Belgium cooperation and did not correspond necessarily with the length of what I considered to be the period during which the -- his course lasted.  And this is only a theory, as far as I'm concerned. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Mercenier.  You also told us you were in charge of Mr. André Rwamakuba's course.  And you talked to us about the regularity with which you saw him, and you said that probably you saw him once a week, maximum, or sometimes twice a week.  
A.	Well, not twice a week (microphones overlapping).
Q.	Well, you said -- 
A.	Well, sometimes once a week, sometimes once every fortnight. 
Q.	Now, today, could you tell us precisely, besides those meetings with André Rwamakuba, can you tell us what he was doing? 
A.	Absolutely not. 
Q.	You also talked to us about the duration of the training or course, which you said was a continuous course, but you also told us that, however, there were some annual holidays and that those holidays lasted about 15 days.  
A.	Yes, I think so.  Normally that's how it was. 
Q.	Would it be possible for you to tell us more or less at what period the holidays began and when they ended? 
A.	No, no.  Generally, I would say that the holidays would go from 20 December to about -- to 4 or 5 January.  But this is general appreciation, and it's not specific that year.  Well, I think this can be known.  It wouldn't be too difficult to look at -- to see the document. 
Q.	You told us that during that period you, yourself, were absent from Belgium.  
A.	Yes, I do confirm that. 
Q.	I think, therefore, that, logically, it would have been impossible for you to know whether André Rwamakuba was indeed in Belgium during that period.  
A.	Absolutely. 
MS. FALL:  
Mr. President, I don't know if you want us to take the brief recess now before I move on to another line of questioning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  How much more time do you think you have?  
MS. FALL:
I can't say, but probably half an hour after the break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Witness, we take a short recess in the afternoon of about 15 minutes, and we take it now.  
(Court recessed at 1529H)
(Pages 30 to 44 by Ann Burum)










(Court resumed at 1555H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can now recommence our afternoon session.  Ms. Fall?
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Mercenier, we are going to both promise to do something about the interpreting because we have been too (unintelligible) too fast.  I shall try to speak more slowly, and you would please wait for the translation to end before you give your answer.  That will make things easier.  

Mr. Mercenier, we shall now come to the time when you were in Kigali on the 4th of April 1994, but before I think you discussed this trip with André Rwamakuba, did you not? 
A.	I don't understand your question. 
Q.	Before you went to Rwanda, when you spoke with André Rwamakuba on the 21st of February, did you mention this visit to Rwanda? 
A.	Perhaps, but I had no specific memory of that. 
Q.	We have a statement that you made for Defence counsel.  I do not know whether you have that statement before you now.  In that statement you say that you talked about it with André Rwamakuba on the 21st of February.  
A.	No, I said that we talked about the usefulness of the mission, not its content. 
Q.	We agree you talked about this visit that you were planning to make to Rwanda on the 21st of February.  That is the question I'm putting to you.  
A.	All right, in that case the answer is yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the circumstances were of your discussion? 
A.	I do not know -- I do not remember who took the initiative to have that talk.  When I look at the training report, or report (unintelligible), which I did not know because I have just received it, now I may have seen it before.  Well, I see that -- I see drafting of training report from the 20th of February, so after the cover page it follows.  So this was probably at the time when his actual training ended, and that is when I had the discussion with him.  I do not know whether it was during this interview or because I organised this interview in order to determine whether my mission would be taking place or not.  I really can't say now.  There were two reasons for me to meet him; one was that the training was coming to an end, and the other was about the usefulness of the mission to Rwanda. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Interpreter corrects:  Not the usefulness, the timeliness. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So why did you discuss the timeliness of this mission to Rwanda? 
A.	As I said in my statement, it is because a month or two before I had received a letter from Dr. Monet, who was telling me that since the political situation in the country was so tense, the possibility that people would be prepared to talk about public health objectives, which was the purpose of my mission, was slim because people were so much involved in the tense political situation that they would be -- they would not be very receptive to my message.  And Dr. Monet wrote -- I don't remember the exact words because I haven't found the letter, but he said something like, "I wonder," or, "I think, if your mission will be very useful in these circumstances."  So there was a question as to my schedule in the coming six weeks, or six weeks later. 
Q.	Can you say that this question was resolved when you talked about it with André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So in his view you had -- there was no reason for you not to go to Kigali even if, from what is mentioned, he felt there was a difficult situation? 
A.	I am speaking from memory once more, but I think this is something I remember very clearly.  On the contrary, he said it is in such a situation that we need to feel that we have not been abandoned by foreigners.  And, of course, "foreigners" here mean consultants and other such people.  So this, in my view, was the message of a patriot. 
Q.	So you went to Kigali.  You arrived on the 4th of April, and in response to the question as to whether André Rwamakuba was present at the airport or not, you answered that you did not remember. 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Was Dr. Monet present? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You knew André Rwamakuba; you had seen him sometime before in Belgium.  You knew him before, even before that.  If he had been present at the airport, would you have remembered or not? 
A.	I cannot answer.  Perhaps yes, perhaps no. 
Q.	Well, that's an evasive answer. 
A.	I know.  You have already told me that.  That's true. 
Q.	It might seem a little surprising that, since you knew him very well, having observed that Dr. Monet was there, you are unable to say whether or not André Rwamakuba was present at the airport. 
A.	Should I tell you that I had personal and particular reasons for being anxious about my meeting with Dr. Monet on that day?  But these are personal reasons. 
Q.	So once more, you are not able to tell us whether he was at the airport or not? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	After that you went to the Mille Collines.  You stayed there until you were evacuated on the 11th of April.
A.	With your leave? 
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	During the two days, that is, the 5th and the 6th, I was out all day. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether you were able to meet André Rwamakuba on the 5th and the 6th? 
A.	I have already said that I do not specifically remember meeting André Rwamakuba.  Once more, my answer will be unclear, I'm afraid, but I would have been surprised if I hadn't met him. 
Q.	To try and refresh your memory -- just a minute, please -- so, you say that you would be surprised.  Can you explain to us why you would have been surprised not to see him? 
A.	Since he was normally the project officer for -- he was the head -- the national head of the project for which I had come on mission, I would have been surprised not to see him.  So he was the first person I was supposed to meet with. 
Q.	Mr. Mercenier, I have a problem there.  Do you agree with me?  Because you say that you would have been surprised not to have seen him because he was the person you would have met in the first instance.  And on the other hand, you say that you do not remember having seen him or not.  
A.	Specifically, no, I do not remember.  Actually, specifically, I cannot say that I saw him.  That is all I can tell you.  But normally I should have seen him. 
Q.	You should have seen him, but you didn't? 
A.	But I don't know whether I saw him or not.  Please don't put words into my mouth.  

	Might I add something to that?  I understood that Dr. Monet had much more precise information than I do on that, because on most of these matters I am speaking from memory because I have not been able to find any document, apart from my personal diary.  But it seems that Dr. Monet has his notes that he took on those -- on those days. 
Q.	As you have been told, Mr. Mercenier, this is your testimony, and Mr. Monet's will follow in due course.  I shall ask a slightly more general question.  So from the time you got to Kigali and until the time you were evacuated, do you remember whether you met André Rwamakuba or not? 
A.	Between when and when, do you say?
Q.	Between the 4th and the 11th of April, do you remember meeting André Rwamakuba even once? 
A.	From the 4th to the 6th, I say that I do not remember.  After the 6th of April, I am categorical on this, I did not meet him. 
Q.	Until you were evacuated? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So to summarise, to the best of your recollection, you practically did not see or meet André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I have nothing to add to what I have already said. 
Q.	Mr. Mercenier, did you learn at one time or another that André Rwamakuba had been appointed minister, member of the cabinet? 
A.	Yes.  When Dr. Monet called me, on one occasion in those few days, he told me of the forming of the new government and he told me that Rwamakuba was a minister, I believe of primary education or some such thing. 
Q.	If it is possible, can you tell us around what date you learned of that appointment? 
A.	Well, the crash occurred on the 6th.  It must have been the 8th or the 9th.  I really cannot remember. 
Q.	Did you know beforehand whether André Rwamakuba was involved in politics or not? 
A.	I believe I told you that I did not know it until those days when Dr. Monet told me that he was highly involved in politics. 
Q.	Did Dr. Monet tell you in which party he was active? 
A.	No.  Even if he had told me, I wouldn't have remembered because I knew nothing about the political structure or the political organisation of the country. 
Q.	So you had no prior discussion with André Rwamakuba in terms of politics? 
A.	In terms of local politics, no. 
Q.	And he never told you that he was a militant of any political party? 
A.	No. 
Q.	When you said a while ago -- you said a while ago that when André Rwamakuba asked you to come to Kigali, in spite of the warnings, quote/unquote, of Mr. Monet, I recall that you said that he was a patriot.  On what basis do you describe him as a patriot?  Perhaps I am going a little quickly.  I will slow down.  
A.	Well, he said, "Our country is facing difficulties; this is not the time for all our foreign friends to abandon us." 
Q.	And when he talked about a difficult -- difficulties, did he explain the nature of these difficulties to you? 
A.	I had some knowledge of them because I knew that the Arusha Accords had been started, and that this country was under tension because of the implementation of these Arusha Accords.  These I knew from elsewhere. 
Q.	So you will agree that perhaps the fact, as described to you by Mr. Monet, would have been real? 
A.	Are you talking about the politics?  I did not have any reason to doubt what was told me.  If I remember correctly, I said in my statement that Monet's advice seemed to be rational, and Rwamakuba's opinion seemed to be emotional. 
Q.	When you heard that Rwamakuba had been appointed to the cabinet, how did you feel?  Were you surprised or not? 
A.	Perhaps a little, but not too much. 
Q.	And why would you have been the tiniest bit surprised? 
A.	But I said "perhaps".  Perhaps.  Because this was a man I knew.  You are always a bit surprised when you hear that someone you know is suddenly thrust into such a position.  There is nothing specific about it, actually. 
Q.	Were you surprised or satisfied? 
A.	Certainly not satisfied.  I had no reason to be satisfied. 
Q.	From what you have just told us, might one say that you knew André Rwamakuba very well on a personal basis? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So you did not know André Rwamakuba well? 
A.	Well?  No. 
Q.	You confirmed that after you left Rwanda, you had no further opportunity to see André Rwamakuba, and you didn't hear about him either.  
A.	I don't believe so, no.  I believe I can say that the answer is no. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I have no further questions for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you are not quite finished as yet because the lawyer who examined you initially will now have an opportunity to ask you a few questions in re-examination.  
MR. HOOPER:
No questions, thank you.  Mr. Mercenier, due to plane delays, arrived here at about half past 2 this morning.  So for my part I want to extend a public thank-you for his being willing to conform to the difficulties that we had in presenting his evidence this afternoon.  I understand that he has a difficult hip and I am prevailing, I hope, upon WVS not to send him back on tonight's flight.  And we expect him probably to return to Florence via Schipol on Thursday evening.  And, in the meantime, Dr. André Rwamakuba would very much like to meet with him, and I understand Professor Mercenier would like to make the acquaintance with Dr. Rwamakuba.  So could he be granted that permission, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The permission is granted. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We also thank you for coming to give testimony in the Tribunal.  And now your testimony is ended, you are excused, and you may take your leave at your pleasure. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
(Witness excused) 
MR. HOOPER:
While that is -- the next witness is being prepared, could I just exhibit the curriculum vitae of Dr. Rwamakuba as referred to?  And there are no other exhibits relating to this witness.  And that would be D. 184. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. 184 admitted)
MR. HOOPER:
One-eight-four.  And I'm asked to mark the other document for identification as -- well, may I say -- may I say -- it may be it is unnecessary to do that, because when Professor van Balen comes to give his evidence, we can back refer at that moment to the documents as previously seen by Professor Mercenier.  So I think that will avoid -- he will provide the sufficient identification.  What I am saying now will appear at the end of the transcript of this witness's testimony.  The documents he was shown that were to be produced by Professor van Balen will be produced next Monday, we hope, by him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Monday?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Van Balen is coming Monday.  We anticipate his evidence will be given on Monday, together with Dr. Monet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have completed the testimony of the other witness, and we can now resume your evidence.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began earlier today.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper.
WITNESS 9/17,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So you've got to the hospital and you're looking after your daughter, you told us, in the ward.  You were passing yourself off as a Hutu so that you wouldn't be targeted because you were Tutsi.  And while you were there, did you get any authority from the hospital authorities to be there, or not? 
A.	Yes, I was granted an authorisation. 
Q.	What did you do for food for yourself and/or your daughter? 
A.	We had to manage.  Sometimes someone would give you a sweet potato or a cob of maize.  At that time our minds were not really on food. 
Q.	Now, while you were there, did you ever witness patients being taken away from the hospital, and if you did, who was doing the taking away? 
A.	There were soldiers and Interahamwe who were taking them away. 
Q.	During the months you were there, did you ever witness doctors physically attacking patients in the wards or elsewhere in the hospital? 
A.	The doctors didn't physically attack the patients, but they would do so discreetly, if I may put it that way. 
Q.	So when you say "discreetly", can you perhaps tell us what you mean by "discreetly"? 
A.	Doctors would do their rounds, and they would take down the names of people, or observe the people who were wounded and draw up lists.  And when they felt that they had a sufficiently large number of people on the list, they would inform Nyiramasuhuko, who would come and fetch these patients.  And these lists were drawn up based on the identity cards of the patients. 
Q.	And who would take these people away after that? 
A.	Doctors like Gatera used to do rounds and draw up lists.  When they saw that the number of people on the list was enough, they would take these people on the list to a pit that was not far from the hospital. 
Q.	Did you see anyone in particular being taken away like that? 
A.	There was a person, a staff member, a member of the medical staff that I could consider to be my (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) in the family.  I saw her being taken away in that way. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can we redact the word (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the order is made. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And is that something you saw personally? 
A.	I witnessed this with my own eyes.  I'm the one who used to give her water to drink. 
Q.	And when she was a staff member, what kind of job did she have at the hospital? 
A.	She was responsible for the files of patients. 
Q.	And if need be, and I don't ask you now to give it, but if need be you can provide her name; is that right? 
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. HOOPER:
Is that being translated?
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, before the break, the midday break, I'd asked you about two people called Mutabazi and Kazasomaho, and you told us how they were in another part of the ward where you were.  They were with you.  Now, did you know either one of them before you saw them in the ward? 
A.	We knew each other well before.  Those people lived not far from my mother's house.  Their parents were my mother's friends. 
Q.	Now, do you know why they were in the ward at all? 
A.	Kazasomaho had been wounded with a sharp blade or shape-bladed weapons. 
Q.	And where was his wound? 
A.	He was wounded all over the body, especially on the head.  But when he was brought -- he was recovering. 
Q.	Have you -- do you know how they came to be at the hospital? 
A.	It was a priest who took him from a place called Agatobwe to take him to the hospital. 
Q.	Do you know what happened to that priest? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what was that? 
A.	After having left the mother hospital, he took a number of persons towards Burundi, but those people were killed immediately. 
Q.	Now, apart from -- as far as Mutabazi and Kazasomaho were concerned, were the two of them on their own or did they have anyone else with them? 
A.	Kazasomaho was ill, but Matubazazi (phonetic) and his sister were patient minders. 
Q.	And what, if anything, happened to the three of them? 
A.	They were abducted towards the end of May.  I have told you that when the doctors wrote down the names of people on the list and it was full, they would call attackers who would come and take out those people. 
Q.	Did you witness their abduction? 
A.	Yes.  I was an eyewitness.  They had passed just by us when they were taken away. 
Q.	And who did you see there when they were taken away?  Who took them away? 
A.	They were taken away by soldiers, but Gatera and another doctor was near them when the attackers took them out of the room.  But when the attackers took them outside, the doctors didn't follow them.  
Q.	And do you know where they were taken? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And where was that? 
A.	There was a pit below the maternity.  There was yet another pit a little further on.  I do not know in which one they were thrown in.  There was a third pit at the university camp, and that is where most victims were thrown in.  I therefore would not be able to say in which of the three pits the people were thrown. 
Q.	You told us that Kazasomaho had been injured, and injured all over, and particularly to his head.  By the time that he was taken, you place that at the end of May, what state was he in? 
A.	He was on his way to recovery. 
Q.	Now, you and I have met twice, I think; once in Butare and once at the safehouse here.  I think on both occasions I showed you a photograph similar to the one that I'm passing up to you now, which is a photograph which we've seen and is already exhibited, of Dr. André Rwamakuba that was taken six, if not seven years ago now here in Arusha shortly after he was first brought here.  You've seen that before.  But looking at it, have you ever set eyes on that man while in the months you were in the hospital? 
A.	I never saw this person at the hospital. 
MR. HOOPER:
If I can have the photograph brought back, this photograph needn't be exhibited.  We know, I hope, from the transcript of what it is the witness has seen.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, the name Rwamakuba, have you ever heard of any Rwamakuba who was living in Butare or in the area of Butare? 
A.	Yes.  There was a certain Rwamakuba.  He was a parliamentarian.  At a certain point in time he was a minister, but he was an old man, and he died a long time ago.  He has big children, by the way. 
Q.	When you say "he died a long time ago", is that before the genocide or not? 
A.	He died while I was still young.  I think I was aged about 18. 
Q.	As far as his children are concerned, do you know if any of them were in any way concerned as attackers in the genocide at all? 
MS. FALL:
Can the question be formulated in another way, because it seems to be suggestive; it seems to be leading. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You mentioned that he had sons.  Do you know if any of the sons were involved in the genocide at all or not? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  I know that there is a son by him, but I don't know what he did during the genocide. 
Q.	Now, we've heard of a name in this case, and I want to know if you know anything about it, and in particular, if it's a name that's associated in any way with the genocide or not.  The name is Rekeraho. 
A.	Yes.  I know him, and I've heard about him. 
Q.	And what have you heard about him? 
A.	Rekeraho was very wicked towards us, just like Nyiramasuhuko.  He was the one who took away people or who brought attackers.  **************************************************.  He is the one who distributed weapons.  In that way he used to kill people. 
Q.	In your experience, when people were killed at the hospital, were they killed at the hospital or elsewhere? 
A.	They took them a little further away.  They did not kill anybody in front of the hospital because they did not want to smear the walls with blood. 
Q.	Just give me one moment.  I'm going to look for a document.  I've misplaced it.  I won't be a sec.  
MR. HOOPER:
I hope everyone can forgive me just for a moment or two.  I seem to have misplaced a document.  I won't be a moment.  I'm sure it will turn up.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, obviously from what you've told us, I'm going to need to go into closed session in order to utter names which otherwise might occur on the list.  
MR. HOOPER:
So can we go into closed session?  It will take 15 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, for the benefit of the public, this is a protected witness, and we have to take steps to protect her identity.  The closed session is estimated to last for 15 minutes.  We are going into closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 55 to 57] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 45 to 54 by Jennifer Spring)





















BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you made statements to Defence investigators; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many statements you made? 
A.	I think I gave two statements. 
Q.	Can you tell us the dates on which these statements were given? 
A.	No, I cannot give you the dates.  All I know is that I made -- I gave two statements. 
Q.	Witness, I have here before me statements; the first of which is a statement which was taken on the 25th of June 2005, it is a very short one.  The second statement is dated 3rd December 2005.  All right?  Did you sign these statements at any time? 
A.	I don't think so.  Are you referring to signing a statement?  What are you talking about?  
Q.	Did you at any time sign any of the statements that you gave? 
A.	I think I signed the statement that you refer to as "being short". 
Q.	Was this statement read back to you before you signed it? 
A.	Yes, the statement was read back to me first. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, at this point I want to raise a matter and I would like the witness to be requested to remove her headset. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President, unless I am making a mistake, unless I am making a mistake, we received two statements from this witness:  The first statement, which is very brief, dating from the                 25th of June 2005; and the second statement from the 3rd of December.  In the statement of the 3rd of December there it is indicated that this witness met with the investigator on the 25th of June 2005; met Mr. Hooper around the 24th of July.  I have been told, perhaps, that these are just notes.  And it was said that there was a prior statement which was given to the same investigator before that.  And when she met the investigator for the first time, it was a brief meeting, it was a short statement which was signed.  

We do not seem to have all of the statements, and we certainly do not have any signed statement.  I do not know whether it is possible for us -- for these statements to be disclosed to us. 
MR. HOOPER: 
There is one signed statement, it is the short one.  And as indicated in my pitiful record of a note, when I saw this witness last week I noticed that it referred to a previous statement, but we can't find it.  And if we could find it, we would have it and you would have it; but we can't find it.

Having said that, I believe I must have seen it because before I met this witness I think I knew something of her story, it wasn't that much -- it wasn't as much a surprise as it were -- as it would have been otherwise.  So, my conclusion is that the statement has disappeared some -- in Arusha, but we have looked for it and we can't find it.  And I think I have set all of that out in the statement that you have.  
MS. FALL: 
In this statement -- mentioned in these statements --  mention is made of the signed statements that we do not have.  I shall leave the Trial Chamber to put what it will on the matter.  

Mr. President, it is 5:30. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I can give it to you right now, I don't see how you have not had it, it is not a signed -- it is the second page of the short one, and I thought that was served.  Page one is like that, and page two is a PDF, which may --  
MS. FALL: 
No, no. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I will let you have the page.  Somehow, it has come adrift from the totality of the statement.  You can have mine.  It is a second page, it has no facts on it; it is merely signed.  According to my records, that was served.  I'm sorry if you haven't had it. 
MS. FALL: 
No, we don't have it, Counsel.  If we had it, we wouldn't have asked.  We don`t have it.  Thank you, without finding it -- we thank you for finding the document without too much effort, whereas you said that you would have trouble finding it.  
MR. HOOPER: 
So, I am invited to clarify; that statement is the statement -- the second statement.  And it says, "I confirm what I said in my previous evidence."  And she then adds information about RO, and information about her two relatives that were murdered.  And she signs it on the second page.  That was served as part of the document in October, according to my records.  You have had the first page, what obviously has gone adrift, for some reason, in your own records, is the actual signed page.  

Now, that is not what I have lost.  What I have lost is the first statement which is referred to there as, "further to my previous statement".   And we have looked for it.  We would very much like to find it, we can't find it.  And having thought about it and discussed it, it is my belief that that statement is going adrift here in Arusha, because I can remember seeing some of the facts before I first met this witness in Butare.  And that is all set out in our last statement, the (unintelligible), "notes of interview, Hooper witness in the safehouse last week." That is all set out, having discussed it with her. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I would like to thank Mr. Hooper for these clarifications.  We have just received the second page of a purportedly signed statement which has just been disclosed to us.  As indicated on the statement of the 3rd of December, there is a prior statement.  And Mr. Hooper has just told us, we were not aware of this.  So, there are three December statements here, and that there is a statement prior to the one that was disclosed to us.  So, I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to this, to the problem of disclosure.  

Mr. President, perhaps this may be the right time to break for the day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We note what has been said, and it is an appropriate time to have our adjournment.

Now, Madam Witness, when we adjourn today, we do not have access -- I'm sorry, could you put on your headphone, please.

Madam Witness, the time has come for us to adjourn for today.  Now, we do not have access to the courtroom until next week, Monday morning.  So we are going to have to take a recess in your testimony until Monday morning when your evidence will resume.  We are sorry for the inconvenience, but we have no control over it.  Do you understand what I am saying?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, as I had told you earlier today, during this, as on any other adjournments while you are a witness on the case, you are not to discuss your testimony or you are not to discuss the case itself with anybody at all.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I know, Mr. President, I mustn't reveal what I am saying here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I --  
THE WITNESS:
However, Mr. President, I didn't leave anyone at home, there is no one in my home.  And it is difficult for me to stay here all of these days till I finish giving my testimony.  It is a problem that I have. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, I was going to raise this with the Chamber because she mentioned it to me last week.  And it may be that I would invite you, Mr. President, to discuss with the witness whether matters are so compelling for her return that she wishes to take some other course of meeting next Monday, or whether there is anything that can be done from here, through WVSS, that would make her delay tolerable to her, and where she wouldn't feel that her situation is too difficult in respect to the children. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, I have had a brief discussion with the registrar who has made certain inquiries from the representative of the WVSS here in court.  And he may be able to say something which would indicate that steps could be put in place to give you some assistance in this particular difficulty that you have expressed.  So I will just asked the registrar to explain what is possible. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, the WVSS representative here said that she will contact her supervisor who will also contact the WVSS section in Kigali, and they will make inquiries whether they could assist the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, did you understand what was just said?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I understood. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If those steps were taken, would you find that an acceptable way of addressing the problem that you have just mentioned to us. 
THE WITNESS:
What exactly do they want to do for me?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I'm not sure.  You see you -- I don't think they have enough information to give a more specific answer.  They are in contact with you.  They have an office in Kigali.  And if you had particular requests that it was possible for their office in Kigali to address, I would imagine that they would negotiate with you and the office in Kigali and try to see how they could resolve any specific problems that you mention to them.  I don't think it is necessary for us to discuss this publicly, but you would have the opportunity to talk about those problems with the relevant officers who have said that they can liaise with their office in Kigali to resolve the problems that you might express to them.  

And so my question was, if that was done would that satisfy the problem that you have mentioned to us, or is there some other step that you think would be necessary to deal with your situation?  
THE WITNESS:
If the measures you have described are applied, and information is sent to my children to calm them down by giving them news that their mother is still alive, that might help.  It might alleviate my disquiet with regard to my children.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, it seems that the major concern that she has is a line of communication with her children. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, exactly and unlike some people in this courtroom, and I say I see it as a fundamental matter, that when they have had the trauma of separation and death, as this family has had, that every reassurance is given to those children.  As I understand from what the witness said and what I understand about her position, if, in fact, WVSS can go to Butare, and let this family know, discretely, and discretion is very important to this witness, that their mother is well and will be back next Tuesday or Wednesday, which is all of a week away; to reassure them that that is the case, and, perhaps, send a personal message from her, and convey back to her the fact that they are well, and reassure her as to that.  Then it may be, I suspect, that this witness would not be too unhappy in those circumstances to remain here all of another week, and I know -- but, at least, both family and her knowing what is going on.  

(By order of the court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and filed under seal).  Can I redact that.  I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Those statements are redacted. 
MR. HOOPER: 
There are difficulties within the family, physically and there are young ones now, as well.  But I got the feeling that if this witness can be reassured that her family was reassured, she would be reassured.  I think that is what she is driving at. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, I wanted to assure you that before you raised this matter, the Trial Chamber had had a discussion among ourselves and we were going to ask the identical questions of the witness.  Now, when I mentioned the matter to the registrar, the representative from WVSS proposed a solution of making contact with the Kigali office to assist in dealing with these issues.  So, I think that you will find that the officials in the Tribunal will do what they can to try to alleviate the situation to the best of their ability. 
MR. HOOPER: 
As we are rising, can I delegate Mr. O'Shea today to liaise directly with WVSS to ensure that the interest of the witness is fully protected?  I put it like that because I have handled the witness and where I don't want to involve myself over much with her, but it would just mean if we have a concern an independent concern, we can bring it to the Chamber. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was asking Mr. Fry to come speak with me privately before making another statement. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper, Mr. Fry assures me that this type of activity is untaken fairly regularly by the WVSS.  And they do have a system in place for addressing matters of this nature.  Mr. O'Shea is welcome to contact the registry or WVSS directly.  There is a chain of command there and there is an administrative system in place which regularly addresses problems of this nature.  So, I don't think that there is any need for worry on this issue. 
MR. HOOPER: 
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you have heard what has been said.  And I would just like to assure you, that the Tribunal has had on many occasions to deal with situations like this.  It is -- it is not uncommon for persons who have come to testify to find that their residence here is longer than was initially intended.  And so the relevant offices are accustomed to addressing problems of this nature.  And I can assure you that they will speak with you and take whatever steps are necessary to deal with the problems that you have.

Is there anything specific that you wanted to draw to my attention, or has what I have told you sufficiently reassured you?  
THE WITNESS:
I am reassured; thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you, very much.

Well, we can take adjournment now.  And we will resume on Monday morning.
