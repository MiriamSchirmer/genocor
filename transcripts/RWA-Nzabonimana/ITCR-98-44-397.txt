MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 27 January 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony continues.  Mr. N'dow will continue his cross-examination, and I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took yesterday. 
MR. N'DOW:
Most obliged, Your Honour.  Good morning. 
DICK PRUDENCE MUNYESHULI (continued)
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning.  We'll continue from where we left yesterday.  And Witness, just to backtrack a bit, I asked you yesterday whether you were aware that there were several allegations made against you of interfering with Prosecution witnesses.  Are you aware of these?  
A.	Some, yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'll just touch on a few of them.  Do you recall swearing to an affidavit in respect of an interview that you had with Prosecution Witness BDW, Mr. Witness?  This affidavit was dated the 
1st of June 2009, and you signed it.  You recall swearing to an affidavit? 
A.	Yes, I do, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And in that affidavit, Mr. Witness, you indicated that you interviewed -- in paragraph five of that 
affidavit -- that you interviewed Witness BDW at the Gitarama prison and he told you that he had not seen Joseph Nzirorera speak in Kibuye and that -- however, while at the Ruhengeri prison, he received a visit from relatives of Joseph Nzirorera and he, therefore, decided to include him in his statement.  This, Witness, is what you stated in that affidavit; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
Q.	And you understood this to have been a complete recantation from the testimony that this witness gave in this trial, didn't you? 
A.	It is not exactly that.  You see, when I conduct an investigation following instructions from the counsel, all I do is report on what I have collected, and it is for counsel now to give it legal value.  Thank you. 
Q.	At the time that you take -- you interviewed this witness you did not know that this was going to be a recantation of some of the evidence he gave in this trial.  Is that what you want Your Honours to believe? 
A.	As I have just stated, Mr. Prosecutor, when I went to the Gitarama prison, I had a discussion with that witness, he gave me a statement and I submitted my report to counsel.  And it was counsel's duty thereafter to look into the legal consequences that may flow from the result of my work.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, how did you come to meet the witness?  Did he seek you out, or did you contact him yourself? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  When I went to see that witness, there had initially been a request from the lawyer to meet the witness.  The witness said that he wanted to meet the counsel in the absence of the Prosecutor.  At the time of the appointment, counsel for the Defence was absent and I was delegated to represent him, so I went on his behalf.  Thank you.  
Q.	So it was Mr. Robinson who asked you to see the witness and not the witness seeking you out; is that correct? 
A.	The witness had agreed to meet the Defence team, yes, that is it.  
Q.	So it was your initiative? 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Mr. Witness -- and based on the affidavit that you swore to, Mr. Nzirorera filed a motion calling for the recall of Witness BDW.  Are you aware of this? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And you are aware the Judges in this trial in their usual wisdom ordered the registry to meet with the witness to confirm the accuracy of your affidavit; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And this mission was taken by the registry.  They interviewed Mr. BDW, and Mr. BDW denied ever telling you, Witness, what you stated in your affidavit.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Before that question is answered, I wonder whether Mr. N'dow can point out to me where Witness BDW denied that.  
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. Robinson, if I could refer you to the registry report that was filed by the registry.  In paragraph five of the registry report, the registrar is stating that during the encounter with the witness, he denied having declared any intention to recant his statement, and he said he was deeply disappointed by the way the whole matter was handled by the investigator.  This is the registry report quoting what the witness had told him.  Does this satisfy your enquiry?  
MR. ROBINSON:
It doesn't -- it doesn't, Mr. President, but then I would object to the form of the question because the witness didn't deny making the statement that has been attributed to him by my investigator.  He simply denied his intention to recant his testimony.  I think there's a difference.  Thank you.  
MR. N'DOW:
I think that would be a matter for the Court, Your Honours, to have a look at the registry report and draw your own conclusions.  But what we have in paragraph four is that during the encounter with the witness, he denied having declared any intention to recant his statement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, this is a matter that we will review in short course.  You may continue your cross-examination.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	So Mr. Witness, we have a registry report here which reported that the witness denied having made any intention or declared any intention to recant his statement.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I think the answer can be found in my previous answer; namely, that all that happened is that I reported to counsel what the witness had told me.  You would see in my affidavit that I did not mention that the witness intended to recant.  That report was forwarded to counsel who then gave it its legal value.  So I did not have any discussion with the witness regarding any recantation.  Thank you.  
Q.	Anyway, Witness, the Judges, on the strength of this report, declined to grant Mr. Nzirorera's motion to recall Mr. BDW.  Are you aware of that? 
A.	Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I'm happy that you say it is based on that report.  And not only on that excerpt, it is based on the entire report, and I understand that the entire report contains other documents as well.  I thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you did not record, did you, this interview either in writing or in any form; did you? 
A.	I recorded the interview, Mr. President, Your Honours, for my protection.  
Q.	And why didn't you consider it necessary to give it to the Court or to give it to Counsel Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, that's a question for me, and he did give me that recording.  We have it.  It confirms exactly what this -- my investigator has put in his affidavit, and the reason it was not disclosed was because you declined to recall Witness BDW.  And it was also not part of the witness's direct testimony.  So it's come up -- something that's come up in cross-examination.  So that's the answer to Mr. N'dow.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour... 

Your Honour, I'm a bit surprised and taken aback by this last response by the witness, quite frankly.  
The issue of taping audio -- secretly audio taping conversations with the witness surfaced for the first time, surprisingly, through the last witness, GAP.  And following that revelation in court, I sent a message to Mr. Robinson in writing by email asking him to clarify if his team had recorded any other witness and to make us aware of that and to disclose -- it was a request for inspection under Rule 67(C).  

And I also requested him to inform me if he had secretly recorded any of the conversations I had with him and if he had recorded the interviews of witnesses -- of Prosecution witnesses where I was present as a monitor for the OTP and to clarify those issues.  And he did so by return email and stated quite clearly that the recording of GAP was the only recording that his Defence team had of the witness interviews with its prospective witnesses.  And now we have a member of the Defence team on the stand telling us that yet there's another tape with regard to BDX.  

So that seems -- it's a bit surprising.  And I'm a bit, quite frankly, disappointed and a bit bewildered by this -- this new development in the case, and I'd like the Court on my behalf to ask the Defence, Mr. Robinson, to clearly state under oath to the Chamber whether there are any other recordings of any other Defence witnesses and if he has recordings of me when I had private conversations with him or of recordings of his interviews with Prosecution witnesses when I was present.  

So I know this is taking us a bit afield from the examination of this witness, but this is a development that just occurred almost by the -- the response from the witness takes us by surprise, quite frankly.  
I didn't think that we would get that type of response from this witness, but the issue is important enough for this Court to address it right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you see, I alluded to this sort of thing a day or so ago.  I was very surprised that Mr. Robinson intervened and gave an answer which should have come from the witness.  

If I ask Mr. Robinson to make a statement under oath, it means that he's going to be subject to cross-examination, and it puts him as a witness in the trial.  And it's -- it's a development which, I would think, is not something which one should do very lightly.  

I think there is a general understanding that lawyers in cases who are advocates should not conduct themselves so that they are witnesses.  It embarrasses the Court if we have to make a judgement as to whether an advocate before us is speaking the truth or not.  So those are problems which are gradually emerging into our trial now, and it's something in which I expressed disapproval of.  

Now -- so I don't know if -- if there is another type of procedure that you could follow to get information that you seek.  I would need to be very strongly persuaded that I should ask Mr. Robinson to make a statement under oath in the trial. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I appreciate the Court's concern, but he can certainly make a representation to the Chamber as an officer of the court without being sworn.  Perhaps I was a bit hasty in suggesting that he should be sworn, but he should be able to state on the record in open court whether there are any other recordings of witnesses, or the Court can fashion the appropriate procedure to -- so that this information is elicited, but it's problematic now only because it's inconsistent with what Mr. Robinson told me by email just a day or two ago.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, Mr. N'dow's question to the witness was why he didn't tell the Court that they had this recording.  That's not the witness's function, and I can make a representation about that without being a witness as to why something was submitted to the Trial Chamber or why it isn't, and that was my intervention that I made.  

I don't think there was anything wrong with my explaining to the Court why something is not or is submitted to the Chamber.  So I don't see that I'm acting in any way as a witness.  I'm making representations to you based on a question as to why something was not submitted to the Chamber.  

With respect to Mr. Webster's point, I don't see any reason why I can't give him the answer right now, and I'm ready to do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I think there is a difference between making a legal submission and making a factual representation.  The question that the witness was asked was one that he could have answered.  We didn't think that the legal issue that you addressed in your -- arose when the question was put.  

You are at liberty to make the statement that you said you can make now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. Webster did send me an email after the information surfaced that the recording had been made of the interview of Witness GAP.  And in his email he asked me for an inspection of any recorded statement of prospective Defence witnesses, and he also asked me if I had recorded any conversations in which he had been present or any of our private conversations.  

And my answer was, "I have no recordings of any other Defence witnesses.  That's the truth."  I said, "I have no recordings of any meetings at which you were present.  That's the truth."  And I said, "I have no recordings of our private conversations.  That's the truth." 

So I have been very consistent in my representations to Mr. Webster, and nothing that has been elicited today changes that.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'll let the record speak for itself.  The witness is under examination.  I think we can proceed with the examination and just see how things develop.  I don't see how I can pursue it any further.  

I'm not going to cross-examine Mr. Robinson on the other side of the courtroom.  But I think we can 
all -- we've all heard the witness's testimony and Mr. Robinson's representations, and I can provide or file with CMS a copy of the email exchange, and then the record will speak for itself.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  

Yes, well, we have noted the remarks on both sides, and I think the cross-examination should continue at this stage.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, it seems that you have been in the habit of interviewing witnesses and tape recording them.  How many (inaudible) tape recordings of interviews have you made? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I do not agree with you.  It is not a habit of mine; I'm not in that habit.  I have only done two recordings.  Thank you.  
Q.	Why didn't you do the simple thing, Witness?  If you were faithful, why don't you ask the witness to sign as is the usual practice?  That's what an experienced, faithful investigator would have done rather than taking them by subterfuge.  
A.	I have already told you, Mr. Prosecutor, that counsel assigns me to interview a witness, produce a report, and then it is for counsel to assess what the witness has said.  And, thereafter, a statement is signed by the witness.  That is the way things happens.  
Q.	So it was counsel who instructed you to carry a tape recorder.  You were just like a robot for counsel being manipulated as he wishes.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I have not understood your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. N'dow, I think you should rephrase. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Was it counsel who instructed you to tape record the two interviews you had with the two witnesses -- you had with two witnesses?  Did you do so at the instruction of counsel is my question.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Regarding the recording of the statement of the witness who has already appeared before this Trial Chamber, let me say that when we went to interview him, it is counsel who said that we should record the interview.  

As for the other witness, BDW, I went and decided to record the interview with that witness for purposes of my personal protection, but later on I informed counsel of what I had done because I work under his supervision.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, we have -- we've moved to another incident, and this concerns Mr. AWD.  In a letter that Mr. AWD wrote to the Office of the Prosecutor -- it is dated the 23rd of February 2009 -- he is saying that Mr. Robinson showed him a letter that you prepared in which you allege that he had given you an exculpatory statement.  He says -- he says this document did not bear his signature.  Did you ever prepare such a document, Witness? 
A.	I do recall having a discussion with that witness and, as I usually do, I must have submitted a report to counsel or to my lawyer.  
Q.	Did he give -- gave you -- did he give you an exculpatory statement or not? 
A.	I do not recall the content of our interview.  Maybe you can assist me by providing some excerpt of that interview which will help me recollect what may have transpired.  Then I'll be in a position to provide the appropriate answers.  
Q.	So you did not record this interview, did you? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Why not? 
A.	I just did not do it.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, how many -- you're under oath.  How many Prosecution witnesses have you met in this trial?  How many?  Think carefully.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, now I really cannot tell you how many, but each time I have met Prosecution witnesses, it has been in the presence of my counsel and sometimes in the presence of the Prosecutor.  And if my memory serves me right, the only witness whom I met personally -- this in the absence of my counsel or the Prosecutor -- was BDW who accepted to meet the Defence team in the absence of the Prosecutor.  
Q.	And, Witness, now looking at your report that you've helpfully provided to this Court about the whereabouts of the witnesses...

Mr. Witness, you met these witnesses.  For instance, on page two of the report talking about the testimony of Witness ZF with respect to Côme Bizimungu, Ambassador Ubalijoro, you took their Rule 92 bis statements, didn't you? 
A.	I recall I saw Ambassador Ubalijoro, but that was in the presence of the counsel.  It was with counsel.  As for Bizimungu, I never met him to the best of my recollection.  
Q.	Then why did you put him in your report? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  If you read the title of this report, I simply was looking at how to locate these persons and the information which I gathered during these investigations to be able to identify the location of these people.  It is this information that I have now put in this report.  It does not mean that I met or discussed with Bizimungu.  That is not it.  Thank you.  
Q.	So what information do you have about -- as to his whereabouts?  And where did you get that information from, Witness? 
A.	Thank you.  I would request that these reports be handed back to me so that I can refresh my memory.  I certainly did not memorise all that is in that report.  I don't have it to be able to say it's off the cuff, because there were many people that I met, many people from whom I got information from different sources.  And so if that report could be made available to me, that would facilitate things for me, and then I'd be -- would answer you correctly. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will tell you what you said about the current whereabouts of Côme Bizimungu.  You said he's in Namur in Belgium.  But where did you get that information from? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I believe that in Belgium you have people who know Côme Bizimungu.  There was Innocent with whom I worked here within the team who's my contact out there.  
Q.	And, Witness, you would agree with me that your report is the whereabouts of persons allegedly present at important meetings in which Nzirorera is alleged -- in which Nzirorera is alleged to have participated; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  These are persons who were mentioned by witnesses as having participated or attended these meetings by Prosecution witnesses.  
Q.	And these meetings, Witness, were in themselves, weren't they, suggesting that Mr. Nzirorera was involved in criminal acts, weren't they?  So the mere presence of the witnesses at these meetings would make them liable, wouldn't it, for similar conduct that Mr. Nzirorera is charged with in this Tribunal.  Am I right? 
A.	Mr. President and Your Honours, I think I would not stray from the work that I did.  I did not attend those meetings.  I was not present, and I cannot say who was present and who was absent.  All I did was take down the names of persons whom Prosecution witnesses mentioned as having attended those meetings.  And the aim in finding these persons was that the Defence team wanted to make sure that in reality; one, these meetings in fact took place; secondly, that -- and if so, if these meetings were held and unfolded as described by Prosecution witnesses; and thirdly, if Nzirorera was indeed present, in short. 
So that was the exercise:  Find these persons and obtain the said information.  And the information -- the report only contains information obtained with respect to the venue or the places where these persons are found.  And the persons that we were able to locate made statements which we submitted in the light of 92 bis and others who testify -- or testified, and there are others whom we've not been able to find.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm suggesting to you that it was in the interests of these persons that you interviewed to deny their participation at these meetings.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to --
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	You agree with me, or you do not?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I object.  I think that's argumentative.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. N'dow, it is argumentative.  In the end that's really going to be a conclusion which we would have to draw from the information which is on the record.  The witness's opinion wouldn't assist us too much on that. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I am most obliged.  

Mr. Webster will do the rest of the cross-examination as we had earlier represented.  Thank you.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have given permission for Mr. Webster to complete the cross-examination, and he will continue now.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So Mr. Munyeshuli, I'd like return to the issue of GAP's testimony in your investigation with respect to him, in particular.  Now, back in November of 2009 when GAP was brought to Arusha to testify in this trial as a Defence witness, clearly you were aware that GAP had testified in four prior ICTR trials; right? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And aside from the ten statements that he signed and made for the OTP and the four trials that he had testified in, your team had met with him in the presence of a representative of the Prosecution back in February of 2008, and you were present for that meeting; right? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And after that meeting in February of 2008, GAP testified in the Setako trial.  That was the fourth trial that he testified in.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	His testimony in the Setako trial was -- I believe it was the 25th to the 27th of August 2008.  Several months -- at least six months after your team met with him in Ruhengeri.  Right? 
A.	I don't know the date when he testified, but that is correct because I do know that he testified in the Setako trial rather recently.  
Q.	And you know that his testimony in the Setako trial was consistent with all of his previous 
Prosecution evidence.  
A.	It depends on what you mean by consistent, but he was a Prosecution witness in that trial.  
Q.	He gave evidence in Setako that Setako, Nzirorera, Kajelijeli, Bizimungu were all implicated or responsible -- in some degree responsible for the killings in Ruhengeri in 1994.  That's what I mean by consistent.  I'm not talking about picayune details.  I'm talking about the thrust of his testimony, which should be obvious from the way we're developing this examination.  
A.	Yes, he was and always was a Prosecution witness in those trials.  
Q.	And then in April of 2009, all of the parties received a final report of the amicus curiae into a certain investigation.  I don't think I need to identify it with any greater degree of specificity.  It's a document that's under seal, but you know what I'm talking about, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And you would agree with me in that document that was circulated in April of 2009 the amicus recorded his -- made a summary of his interview with GAP, and GAP had denied that there was any fabrication of evidence by prisoners in Ruhengeri to wrongfully accuse the ICTR detainees.  Wouldn't you agree that that's the summary of GAP's interview included in that final report of April 2009?  
A.	I cannot recall the contents in detail, but since the report is here before us I think it can be verified.  
But I cannot recall the details thereto.  
Q.	Did your team have any direct contact with GAP between April 2009 and November of 2009 when you brought him to Arusha to testify as a Defence witness? 
A.	Will you kindly repeat the dates.  I didn't get the time bracket. 
Q.	Between April of 2009, when the amicus report was circulated to the parties in this case, and 
November of 2009, when your team brought GAP to Arusha to testify as a Defence witness for 
Joseph Nzirorera.  So between April and November of 2009, did you or members of your team have any direct contact with GAP? 
A.	For all I recall it is, yes, because he came before November, if I recall properly.  I think he came in the month of June.  
Q.	He was brought to Arusha in June of 2009? 
A.	I cannot recall the dates exactly, but if I do recall rightly, he was here before November 2009.  He was here -- he was brought here for the trial before November 2009.  
Q.	If I recall his testimony accurately, I believe he testified that his first meeting -- that he met with -- with your Defence team in November of 2008 and that the very next time that he had any meeting with -- with your Defence team was in November of 2009 when he was actually brought here for testimony as a Defence witness.  That was his testimony.  I'm not suggesting to you that that's the case, but you seem to be suggesting otherwise.  

So I want the issue to be very clear in your mind that his account -- and he has been cross-examined by your team -- was that his first meeting with your team after having seen you in November of 2008 was when you interviewed him in the back of the courtroom in November of 2009.  
A.	If I recall right, we met in June at the safe house.  Yeah, it was at that time at the safe house, and they were taken back to Rwanda.  I think it was in June.  If I do recall properly, it was in June.  
Q.	Is it your testimony that he gave you exculpatory evidence or in any way recanted his previous Prosecution evidence in June?
A.	In June there was no interview per se.  We met at the safe house.  It was the Defence team.  When he arrived, we went to see him, and at that time he made no statement.  I mentioned that because he asked -- you asked the question whether we had any contact with him, and so the answer is we had contact with him in the month of June.  
Q.	So you had contact with him in June, but it was non-substantive.  In other words, he was brought to Arusha to talk to you but you didn't speak to him.  Is that what you're explaining?  
A.	Yes, we did not have any discussion as such.  We did not take any statement from him on that occasion.  
Q.	So what was the purpose of meeting with him if you didn't talk to him? 
A.	Well, I didn't say that we didn't talk to him because we got there when they arrived.  These were witnesses at the Ruhengeri prison who had been brought here at the time.  And so when BW (sic) informed us that these witnesses were here, we went and greeted them and -- see them.  And when we intended to have interviews with them, there arose a problem, and the trial was interrupted, and they were obliged to return to Rwanda.  
Q.	Okay.  So when you met with him in June of 2009, you still had no further discussion about the substance of his evidence or what the substance of his testimony -- his sworn testimony would be.  So that meeting was a nullity.  You'd agree with me in characterising it in those terms? 
A.	I would say it was a meeting.  To say that the meeting was of no use, I would not agree with you.  But I would say I agree with you.  We met.  
Q.	Yes, but you're telling us you didn't discuss the substance of his testimony in that meeting.  So again it returns us to the amicus report of April of 2009 as the last bit of substantive information you received concerning GAP until he was brought to testify in November of 2009.  
A.	Yes, you are right.  We had no discussion on his testimony or what was going to be his testimony.  
Q.	So what was it that led you to believe that he was going to recant his evidence in November of 2009?  That you would summon him as a Defence witness after having reviewed the amicus report in 
April of 2009 in which he denied that there was any fabrication of evidence in Ruhengeri?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I don't believe that this is a proper question for my investigator to answer.  Thank you.  

I'd be happy to answer that question actually, but I don't believe -- since it was a decision to summon the witness, it is a decision that I made.  I don't believe that the question is a proper one to be put to the investigator. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think the witness is perfectly capable of telling us that he's not in a position to answer a question.  I don't think he needs to be interrupted by Mr. Robinson for the Court to receive that information.  The witness seems very articulate to me.  He seems to be well educated.  He's a lawyer himself.  Certainly he was capable of making the same response that Mr. Robinson just gave.  
MR. ROBINSON:
But the response, Mr. President, is an objection.  I don't believe the question is proper.  So the witness shouldn't be allowed to answer it.  That's my point.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  I'll wait for the Court's ruling.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The objection is overruled.  

Now, Mr. Robinson, we feel that your intervention was capable of being interpreted as prompting 
the witness, and we would not like you to make any further factual statements during this 
witness's testimony.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you need me to repeat the question? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	In view of the fact that the last substantive information you had about GAP was contained in the 
amicus report, which you received in April of 2009, what led you to bring him back in November of 2009 as a Defence witness?  
A.	Thank you.  As mentioned earlier on, every member of the team has a role to play.  Consequently, when counsel took the decision to bring him over, he did not back that with explanations as to why.  It was he who took that decision.  It was his duty to take that decision, and, by the way, in all the interviews that we had with this witness, all I did was interpret.  That's all.  Thank you very much.  
Q.	The decision was made to record your interview in November of 2009 for your security or to protect your interest; right?  That's what you told us before.  
A.	I said that in November 2009 we tape recorded the witness on the instruction of the counsel, and all that I did was maybe prepare the recorder, carry it along, and do the recording of the interview.  That was it.  
Q.	Did you have the same concerns for your own interests in June of 2009 when you met GAP here in Arusha? 
A.	I am sorry, I did not understand very well.  What intention are you referring to? 
Q.	My question was that you made a decision not -- maybe not you personally, but your Defence team made a decision to secretly record him in November of 2009, but you told us that he was also here in June of 2009.  Did you have the same concerns for your own interests or your security or your -- to protect yourself in June of 2009 when you met him here in Arusha? 
A.	As I have already stated previously, in June 2009 we had not yet discussed what we were going to do.  We had not yet planned the manner in which we would conduct our work with all our witnesses by the way, so at that time, we didn't have any anything in place.  Things came to a halt, and all the witnesses were returned to Rwanda.  
Q.	So I presume that you did not record him in June of 2009? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, you agree with me that the content of the recording of November 2009 would be a basis -- excuse me.  Let me withdraw that.  

If the witness gave evidence in our trial that was consistent with the recording you made of him in November of 2009 -- that his testimony would have been a basis for prosecuting him for deliberately giving false evidence.  If my question is not clear I can rephrase it, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Please do.  
Q.	You were -- you were aware, weren't you, that if the Witness GAP had testified exactly as he had spoken to you as you recorded it in November of 2009, that that testimony under oath could have led to a prosecution against him for deliberately giving false evidence in other ICTR cases?  You knew that when you recorded him; right? 
A.	Yes, we knew, and, by the way, when we had the discussion with him in January at the UNDF, counsel clearly explained to him what could have been expected.  By the way, at that time, the witness said that he was aware and even went on to say that he had met people in Kigali who came to see him in prison, including a member of the intelligence service and a staff member of the Prosecutor's office, who told him that if he were to be a Defence witness, then he would be prosecuted and punished with a 
five-year imprisonment term and a 10 million imprisonment -- a 10 million fine, rather, if I remember correctly.  So he was aware of all of that.  
Q.	He was aware of that in November of 2009 when you spoke to him in the room behind this courtroom? Because that's the conversation that I'm focussing our attention on.  
A.	In November?  
Q.	The only conversation I'm asking you about is the one that took place in November of 2009 that you tape recorded.  
A.	I don't know whether he knew it or not because he didn't say so.  All I want to underscore is that in all the interviews that we had with this witness, counsel always reminded him that he could be prosecuted, and all along he said that he was fully aware of the situation; that things could happen that way.  
Q.	When was the last time you reviewed the audio recording of your conversation with him in 
November of 2009? 
A.	You mean myself, personally? 
Q.	You're the one that is answering the questions, Mr. Witness.  Yes, of course, you personally.  
A.	The last time I listened to that recording was last week.  
Q.	Well, we didn't play the entire recording for the Chamber, but I listened to it in its entirety, and what I would suggest to you, Mr. Witness, is that nowhere on that tape recording is there any discussion of the witness being advised or commenting on the possibility of being prosecuted for giving false evidence.  So are you suggesting there was a conversation with the witness that was not recorded back in November of 2009? 
A.	No, that's not the case, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The recording was the final phase of the 
process of various discussions which we had had with the witness at the UNDF.  We had met that witness on several occasions at the UNDF, but the tape recording -- we recorded the entire conversation from the beginning to the end.  And I'm referring here to that specific conversation of the 
18th of November 2009.  
Q.	So is it your testimony that prior to the portion of the conversation that we heard on the recording of the 18th of November 2009 you had engaged in discussion with this witness about the content of his evidence -- or his forthcoming evidence that would have included discussion of the recantation you were trying to get him to make? 
A.	No, that was not the case, Mr. President, Your Honours.  When the witness came here to Arusha, he was at the UNDF.  What we did was to put together all the necessary and available documents on that witness, including his statements to the prosecutor in Rwanda, as well as his statements here, and his testimonies in different cases here at the ICTR and even some Gacaca documentation.  

So when we went to see him at the UNDF, what we did was that counsel put questions to him relying on a number of documents and touching on specific paragraphs to elicit from him what he knew about those matters.  At that time, whenever the witness mentioned something that was contrary, particularly to his testimonies in other cases at the ICTR, counsel always reminded him that he could be prosecuted because he had testified under oath.  That is what happened.  So our interview with the witness was conducted in that manner.  
Q.	So based on your last response, Mr. Witness, if we were to listen to the entire tape recording of the 18th of November 2009, we should hear some discussion of the witness being cautioned; that he was opening himself up for a prosecution for falsely giving sworn testimony; right?  That's the logical conclusion that one would make based on your last response. 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  The tape recording was in relation to a discussion which summarised the various discussions that we had previously had with the witness throughout the time he was at the UNDF.  That was the purpose of the exercise.  
(Pages 1 to 15 by Jean Baigent)






























	1015H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	There were other conversations that you had with the witness about his forthcoming testimony that were never recorded.  That's the whole point, Mr. Witness.
A.	No.  That's not the case.  When I say that it is a summary, it is because, if you listen to the tape recording, reference is made to what happened at the Ruhengeri prison.  So the tape recording simply was a discussion of all the issues that we had mentioned during our previous discussions on such a point.  
Q.	Correct.  You were summarising on tape deliberately portions of what you had previously discussed with the witness.  That's the point I'm making, Mr. Witness.  The tape recording is not the only conversation that you had with the witness in November of 2009.  
A.	It was not the only conversation, but it is a summary of the contents of all the other conversations which we had with the witness.  
Q.	And it was not the first conversation that you had with him in November of 2009.  
A.	No, it was not. 
Q.	And it certainly wasn't a complete recording of everything you said to the witness and the witness said to you in November of 2009.
A.	I stated previously that we met the witness on several occasions at UNDF.  And counsel would put questions systematically to the witness on statements or files or transcripts of testimonies by the witness here at the ICTR or before Rwandan courts.  So you would understand that even at the very beginning of the tape recording, counsel himself says that "I have now brought a blank book, and I want you to tell me the truth about what happened at the location where the witness lived."  So the witness then answered all the questions and narrated the story as he knew it.  That's it.  
Q.	Your suggestion to this Chamber is that if we listen to the audio recording we will hear what you have just told us in your last response? 
A.	Namely, that the witness was answering questions from the counsel?
Q.	No, Mr. Witness.  I am giving you an opportunity to clarify matters so that the record is perfectly clear.  I'm not suggesting anything to you.  I'm trying to get you to clarify the meaning of your previous response.  You told us that during that conversation the lawyer told the witness that he had a blank book and now was -- I don't recall your exact phrasing, but I'm just trying to get from you a clear statement that you think that that bit of information is included on the one hour, 20-minute recording that you have entered into evidence.
A.	The tape recording is a faithful recording of the discussion we had with the witness in the 
room next door on the 18th of November 2009. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  You told us that you wanted to make that recording to protect yourself.  How was that recording protecting you, Mr. Witness, if there were other conversations with the witness that were not recorded? 
A.	I have stated very clearly that the recording of that discussion with Witness GAP is something that was called for or requested by counsel himself.  He asked that the discussion or the interview be recorded.  Now, as far as protection goes, when one records an interview with a witness -- allow me, first of all, to speak to you in my capacity as a Rwandan.  

You know that in our country the law punishes anyone who's perceived to be a negationist.  So when I have a discussion with anyone, in order to ensure that the person who has been interviewed does not subsequently narrate what was not said, the recording can be used, should such a case arise, to determine where the truth lies.  And that is the amount of protection for me as a Rwandan. 
Q.	I'm still not understanding you, because if you only recorded a portion of the conversation, I'm not understanding why the tape protects you.  I think the tape was intended to trap the witness.
A.	I don't think I can answer that question.  I don't see how the witness would have been trapped.  I don't see how.  But I'm answering in relation to my personal protection, because the witness can come here and then go back and tell a completely different story to the effect that during an interview I suggested such and such a thing to him.  So those are matters that speak directly to my protection as a Rwandan.  Now, as for the trap, I don't see how.  I don't understand how. 
Q.	Yes.  But the point I'm making to you, Mr. Witness, is that the witness has told a completely different story and we're in the same position, because the witness claims that he knew he was being tape recorded.  You told us that not -- your entire conversation was not recorded.  So you haven't dealt with the problem of your security, because there's conversation outside of that tape that has taken place and is now in controversy in this trial.
A.	I think that during those discussions or interviews that were not recorded or tape recorded at UNDF, we at least took down notes in answer to the questions that were put to the witness, and those notes were taken down by counsel himself.  I was only serving as an interpreter. 
Q.	There are many more things I would like to explore on this point, Mr. Witness, but I don't think it's going to take us very far.  So let me just move on to something else.  But before I do, tell us, don't you think there is a conflict of interest between you or your Defence team and GAP?  I'm not talking about now in light of his testimony, but back in November of 2009, when you tried to get him to recant evidence to help your client at his own peril by opening himself up for further prosecution.  Doesn't that suggest to you that your interests and the witness's interests are at odds?  
A.	No.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I did not think so because the witness himself told us that he was clearly aware of the possibility of proceedings against him for perjury.  I do recall clearly that he even asked us whether it was possible for the Tribunal to be -- for a request to be put to the Tribunal to the extent that he may be punished before he goes back to Rwanda.  So he was aware of all of this, and he was fully aware of all the implications.  So I do not see any possible conflict of interest, given that the witness himself was fully conscious of what was likely to happen. 
Q.	If we listen to the entirety of that one hour and 20-minute tape, are we going to hear the witness expressing what you have just told us?  
A.	No. 
Q.	So we have to rely on your account of that.
A.	I'm not sure I have understood you.  I know what happened.  I know what I heard from the witness.  I know what has transpired so far.  
Q.	Wouldn't you agree with me that it seems rather hypocritical for the Defence to now make a motion to prosecute GAP for giving false testimony when the whole object of calling him as your witness was to expose him to a prosecution for false testimony? 
A.	I cannot answer that question in my capacity as an investigator. 
Q.	What about in your capacity as an intelligent, thoughtful human being?  Can you answer the question in that capacity? 
A.	Do you want me to suggest to you what could be done?  
Q.	No, I want you to answer the question.  You either agree with me or you don't.  I can repeat it for you if you don't remember.  
A.	Please do. 
Q.	I said doesn't it seem rather hypocritical for the Defence to now call for prosecution of GAP for false testimony when it was your intention all along to open him up to an accusation of giving false testimony? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  You are asking me to give you my thoughts.  Well, I think that the offense of false testimony is one that is established on certain bases.  When an offense is established, as such, whoever is the perpetrator of such an offense must be answerable.  I, therefore, would not engage in any speculation relating to an offence that may or may not have been established.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, it was just brought to my attention that it's 10:30.  I do have additional questions it should take me around 10 minutes to complete.  I can continue or we can take the break now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I think we should take the mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1110H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster, you may continue.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Munyashuli, would you agree with me that GAP is not the only witness with whom your 
Defence team has traded accusations on this very issue of fabricating evidence?  There are others, right?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Among them, BTH, whose testimony in 2006 began with accusations traded between he and 
Mr. Robinson.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You're also aware that a witness -- pardon me one moment.  I don't want to mention his name on the record.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could show this to the Judges and then to the Defence and then the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Someone that I will refer to as Witness R.  You are familiar with the witness whose name is written on that piece of paper, are you not? 
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Okay.  And I'd like to refer to him as Witness R.  You are aware that this witness has accused your Defence team -- or actually it's Mr. Robinson in particular -- of wrongdoing based on an interview or a conversation they had going back to 2003 and 2004.  You are aware of that, aren't you? 
A.	I do not remember.
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, for the record, this witness was interviewed by the amicus, and his identity can be established in our record by referring to the final report of the amicus.  It's P. 367 in evidence, under seal.  And this witness's account is detailed at paragraphs 84 to 94.  So, for the record, it should be clear who we are referring to.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And for you, Mr. Witness, I'd remind you of that amicus report that provided an account of the amicus's interview with Witness R.  Would you like to read those paragraphs, or does my reminding you of the amicus interview refresh your recollection? 
A.	I do not have a clear recollection. 
Q.	Anyway, this witness was interviewed or claims to have been interviewed by Mr. Robinson and claims that they had communicated with each other by blinking the eyes or something of that nature, and he accused Mr. Robinson of trying to elicit the false testimony or to purchase his evidence.  I'm not suggesting to you that that is true.  I am simply asking you if you recall that account that was reported by the amicus from Witness R.
A.	As I have already stated, I do not clearly remember.  But I think we have the report, and we can check from the report.  By my own recollection I do not quite have a clear picture of the situation with that witness. 
Q.	Well, I don't think it's necessary for us to actually read the report, but I will ask you to take my word for it that's what the report says.  And I'm sure Mr. Robinson would jump up and correct me if I characterised its contents incorrectly.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, I'm still looking for the report.  But, in any event, I will jump up later if it's (inaudible).  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's at paragraphs 84 to 94 of P. 367. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But, in any case, Mr. Witness, you're also aware that in spite of what Witness R told the amicus, your team has listed him as a Defence witness and he was expected to testify this week, or he may be testifying next week.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In spite of his accusations against Mr. Robinson from April -- actually that interview took place in December of 2008, but it was reported to everyone in April of 2009 when the final report of the amicus was circulated.  
A.	As I stated in my testimony, I am an investigator, and it is for the counsel who took that decision to provide the explanations.  I am not in a position to provide any further explanation as to why that witness appears on our list. 
Q.	Well, weren't you the one who provided the contact, or at least the interpretation for a letter from Witness R that you procured and disclosed to the parties in November of 2009? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I am not the one who obtained the letter.  The letter was given to counsel or to the lawyer by someone else.  I was also there, however.  I was present when that person gave the letter to the lawyer -- to counsel.  I did not obtain that letter myself.  Thank you.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  But the point of my question was that certainly you should have known about the content of Witness R's evidence or his potential to contribute to your case because you had to have provided the interpretation to Mr. Robinson to understand the contents of his letter, which was written in Kinyarwanda, right? 
A.	Yes, I interpreted that short letter to Robinson. 
Q.	Okay.  So that's the only point I'm trying to make, Mr. Witness.  So that when I mentioned that name to you and when we were trying to elicit on the record your team's interaction with him and his potential to contribute to your case, at least the letter should have immediately come to mind, and it doesn't seem that it did until I specifically pointed you to it in a way that you had to admit.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Again, I don't want to make an intervention that's going to prompt the witness, but I'd object because the witness's answer was that that was up to the lead counsel.  He didn't avoid mentioning the letter or make any other factual representations.  So it's really unfair for 
Mr. Webster to be saying that the witness omitted to mention this letter when his answer had simply been that this was a matter for his lead counsel.  Thank you.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
I will move on to something else.  The record will speak for itself.  I was simply pointing out that it took us a long time to establish who this witness was and what he could contribute to the case when this witness should have been immediately familiar with it.  But perhaps I'm wrong on that score.  We will go on to something else.  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	There are Prosecution witnesses that you've interviewed, expecting to get recantations from them, and who have refused to deny their previous prosecution evidence.  Isn't that so, Mr. Munyashuli? 
A.	I do not agree with you when you say that we interview the witness in a quest to get him to recant.  What happens all the time for our Defence team is that when we meet a witness we seek to find out the truth as they know it.  In the course of our interviews we collect all the information provided by the witness.  Then counsel looks through the information and gives it legal value.  All I do during the exercise is to interpret from English to Kinyarwanda and from Kinyarwanda to English.  That is it. 
Q.	Well, when you have these interviews, and I am particularly concerned about the ones that involve allegations of fabricating evidence, do you always write it up in a memorandum or try to memorialise it in some fashion? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, if I remember clearly, all Prosecution witnesses whom we have met so far, we met them in your presence.  You were present.  You were part of the discussions that we had with those witnesses. 
Q.	Well, it couldn't be all Prosecution witnesses because we just had the example earlier this morning of BDX, I believe, who agreed to meet you without the Prosecution being present -- BDW, excuse me.  And AWD.
A.	What I can say is that when we met AWD, at that time we did not know that he was a Prosecution witness.  When we found out that he was a Prosecution witness, we did not meet him again without authorisation.  As for BDW, there was official correspondence with WVSS taking all necessary precautions in that connection.  If I remember clearly, I believe that he is the only witness that I met in the absence of the Prosecutor.  
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  But the crux of my question is really how you memorialise or document these interviews.  So, returning to the question, when you interview a witness, particularly on the issue of fabricating evidence or giving false testimony, do you always memorialise it in some fashion? 
A.	Well, personally, when I meet witnesses, in fact, all the witnesses I have met, I never had as a mission or as an intention to verify or deal with issues of fabrication of evidence.  And I am speaking about all the witnesses I have met, particularly Prosecution witnesses, BDW being the only one whom I met.  In that case I put questions to him seeking to find out the truth about what happened as best he could recall.  And he would tell me what he wanted to, and I would take down notes and provide a report to the counsel. 
Q.	And my question to you is, did you take down notes to memorialise the conversation you had with Witness GNK? 
A.	I do not remember that witness.  What was the pseudonym?
Q.	This is Witness GNK, who did not testify in our case, but he testified in several other cases on related facts.  And I think if I mention GBU to you, then his brother should immediately come to mind, and that's the person I'm talking about, GBU's brother.  Now that I have said that, do you have in your mind a clear idea of who GNK is, or should I write it down and pass it to you? 
A.	I do not remember.
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could show this to the Court and then to the witness.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, now that you've seen the name that I have written on the piece of paper, do you remember who GNK is? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you travelled with Mr. Robinson and the STA, the senior trial attorney in this case, to interview this Prosecution witness in November of 2009; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you served as the interpreter at that time.
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to any questions being put to this -- concerning this interview.  This is a different situation, and I think what Mr. Webster is now trying to elicit -- and he's passed on a note that he prepared about this interview -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, you know, now that Mr. Robinson has exposed the very issue that I'm trying to explore with the witness, it really has compromised what I was trying to do with this portion of my examination. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, maybe the witness can be excused so we can discuss it, because I would like to make an objection and explain my objection fully.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think that would be appropriate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We excuse the witness for a few minutes.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, on the 14th of November 2009, myself and Mr. Webster and interpreters for both of us, one of whom included this witness, interviewed this Witness GNK in the Ruhengeri prison, and he denied that there had been any fabrication of evidence.  And now that's what I believe that Mr. Webster is trying to elicit.  And I believe by doing that, first of all, he's going beyond the scope of the examination-in-chief; he's also -- it has no issue of credibility of this witness; and he's just simply trying to bring into the record testimony or the statement of another person to try to buttress his case that there was no fabrication of evidence in Ruhengeri prison.  And I don't think that that's proper.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I do want to address the issue of that interview.  But my question to the witness was how it was memorialised, and how Defence -- not only Defence, but how interviews between the parties and the witnesses are memorialised is a central issue now.  And what I'm trying to elicit from the witness is whether, when confronted with a witness refusing to recant evidence, if there is any attempt to memorialise it to keep a record of it; if the Defence ever pursues leads from witnesses about their allegations of being harassed and threatened, which are all issues that certainly arise from the line of investigation that was pursued both in the direct exam of this witness and then some portions of his responses both on direct and cross-examination, because he's brought the integrity of Defence investigations squarely into the arena.  

So I think we should take it question by question.  If there's something that I suggest to the witness that's improper, I'm sure Mr. Robinson will object at that point, but I shouldn't be precluded from asking the witness how other interviews with other Prosecution witnesses are documented, and that was the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We agree that we should allow the question.  The witness can be recalled.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the issue was resolved in your absence.  Your cross-examination will continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, we were talking about GNK.  And my question to you -- I believe the last question was, was any attempt made by you or other members of your team to document the substance of his responses when you interviewed him -- when we interviewed him back on the 14th of November 2009? 
A.	Thank you.  At that time I was interpreting.  There also was a lady who was also acting as interpreter for the Prosecutor.  And in the meantime counsels, if I do recall well, were taking down notes. 
Q.	Did your team ever make a memorandum of that interview in the same way or a similar way that you made a memorandum of the interview with ANU, which is D. NZ300, which we discussed in your testimony earlier?  Or perhaps it was the testimony of another witness.  But certainly it was some recent discussion of the memorandum you created to memorialise your conversation with ANU.  Were you as careful and professional in trying to memorialise the contents of your interview with GNK? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I cannot recall exactly any longer.  
Q.	You do recall, however, that GNK flatly denied having any intention to recant his previous Prosecution evidence and complained to you or to your team about other witnesses who he named who were procuring false evidence or recantations from other prisoners in Ruhengeri?  Do you remember GNK telling you that?  Or do you remember interpreting for your counsel when GNK was telling us that? 
A.	If I recall properly, this witness talked to us about other witnesses who at the time were alleged to be right here in Arusha.  And if my memory serves me right again, he was criticising the witnesses who were here in Arusha. 
Q.	The witnesses that your team had called who were also prisoners in Ruhengeri, right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And who said -- who he said were pressuring him to change his evidence and were procuring fabricated evidence on behalf of the Defence.  That's what he told you.  I'm not commenting on whether that is true or not.  But that's what he told you -- or told us on the 14th of November 2009.  
A.	I do not recall that he talked about any pressure.  But he certainly said that these people want him to serve as a Defence witness.  I do not recall him having said that any pressure was brought to bear on him.  But I think he mentioned that, because when the counsel came into the room he said that he had learnt from people who had been here that his witness, GNK, wanted to talk with the lawyer.  And it was from that, on those grounds, that he said that these witnesses were trying -- that these persons were trying to make them testify in favour of accused persons right here. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, we may remember the substance of what he said differently.  That particular point is not particularly important.  But you will agree with me that he complained about someone he identified as the sister of Juvenal Kajelijeli, and he identified her as Mama Rukara.  Do you remember him saying that?  
A.	I recall that at one point in time he talked about family members of Kajelijeli, and I think he 
mentioned -- whether he mentioned the name Mama Rukara in the conversation, really I cannot say. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I did memorialise that interview.  And in my notes there's a specific reference to the witness identifying Mama Rukara as Kajelijeli's sister and as someone who has been trying to get him to change his evidence.  And this is a name that has surfaced from other witnesses in this trial when they complain about being harassed and pressured to recant their evidence by family members of the accused in Arusha.  

And my question to you, Mr. Witness, is, have you ever, in your capacity as an investigator, tried to follow up on those issues by going to speak to Mama Rukara or to Bikete or to the people that have been identified as witnesses in this trial as threatening them and trying to procure recantations from them?  
A.	No.  And, by the way, this Mama Rukara, I do not know her. 
Q.	Do you know Bikete?  
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	What about Rwandege? 
A.	I know him. 
Q.	Have you ever interviewed those persons to follow up on the allegations that were made by witnesses in this trial against them? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Wouldn't that have been a sensible thing to do for someone interested in the pursuit of the truth?  I think that's what you told us you were interested in doing just five minutes ago.
A.	Yes, you are right.  I am interested in knowing what happened, getting the truth.  But I don't just do anything, okay?  I do my work following the instructions given by my counsel.  And that I made clear initially. 
Q.	But wouldn't you agree with me that these are three individuals who are central to the allegations that are being traded among the witnesses who have testified in this case? 
A.	I do not get your drift when you mention central persons.  Central with regards to what?  I'm sorry, I really do not get you. 
Q.	Well, witnesses that have testified in this case, and I'm not suggesting all witnesses, but certainly more than two, at least two, have claimed that Bikete and Mama Rukara are the brother and sister of Kajelijeli; that those two individuals have tried to get them to change their Prosecution evidence and recant their Prosecution evidence and give evidence in favour of the Defence, the Defence being both Kajelijeli and Nzirorera.  And this is in testimony that's emerged on several occasions in this trial.  And being the professional and fastidious investigator that you are, and telling us that you know these individuals, it would seem that it would be very easy to ask them if they were being wrongly accused by witnesses that testify in this trial in Arusha.  

So I'm trying to find out to what extent your investigations have been conducted with integrity.  Because that's the question and that's the objective.  So now that you have the whole story, you can comment.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I work as investigator for Joseph Nzirorera.  I do not work as an investigator for Kajelijeli.  As regards the Kajelijeli family, I never meddled in their affairs.  All I know -- I just know Joseph Bikete because he attended the same secondary school as I did.  I never got into talking with him on the trial here because I was not taking care of the Kajelijeli case.  That said, concerning Mama Rukara, I do not even know her.  I have never even seen her.  The only person who I met is Rwandege. 
Q.	Did Rwandege give you any information that was relevant to this trial? 
A.	No.  If not, he should have appeared on the list of potential witnesses. 
Q.	So your encounter with him was purely social? 
A.	No, that's not it. 
Q.	Well, then tell us, what is it?  
A.	Well, as you know, I'm not born in Mukingo.  I did not know parts of Mukingo.  Like all other persons, Rwandans among other -- many other persons whom I contacted in Mukingo, at least from the moment that I began doing investigations in Mukingo, we did not have a special relationship with him.  He was among many other persons.  
Q.	I'm not understanding you.  You told us you didn't have any contact with him on issues that were relevant to the trial.  And I asked you if your contact with him was purely social, and you said that wasn't it.  And I'm asking you to explain, well, what was the nature of your interaction with him.  So try responding again.  If it wasn't in relation to the issues of this trial and it wasn't social, what was it?  
A.	Initially, at least the first time I met Rwandege, as would be the case with anybody that we met, it was within the framework of this trial to ensure where he was and how much he knew regarding this trial.  So when I realised that Rwandege did not have much information on the allegations of this trial, I did not continue interviewing him on that -- on this trial.  Unless I mentioned -- if he had had relevant information regarding this trial, I would have mentioned him on the list of potential witnesses on this trial. 
Q.	Well, when you learned that witnesses were accusing him of trying to procure recantations from them, it never came to mind to go back to him and ask him if that was true or not? 
A.	Yeah, I remember an occasion on which I put that question to him, and he just told me no.  I didn't want to go any further.
Q.	Well, isn't that the question I asked you ten minutes ago? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the question you had put to me was whether I did an interview.  Now, having an interview with a person with just a question like that, does that mean that I carried out an investigation on him?  For the little I know, that is not it.  You cannot call that an investigation. 
Q.	Now, you told us that you weren't born in Ruhengeri but that you were in school in Ruhengeri.  So can we conclude from that that you lived for an extended period of time in Ruhengeri at some point in your adult life? 
A.	No, that isn't what I said. I said I'm not born in Mukingo, which is very different from Ruhengeri.  Ruhengeri was my native préfecture. 
Q.	And you lived in Ruhengeri for a good part of your life; is that a fair statement? 
A.	Yes, in the former Ruhondo commune, which is found about 15 kilometres away from Ruhengeri eastwards. 
Q.	Are there any other witnesses or persons who have been identified on our trial record with whom you are personally acquainted? 
A.	Yes, there are some persons that I know. 
Q.	Outside of the context of this trial.
A.	Yes, I recall one person that I knew -- well, one or two, one or two that I knew even before. 
Q.	What about your client, Joseph Nzirorera -- or your employer, I should say.
A.	I knew Joseph Nzirorera.  I knew him as a minister.  I would hear him over the radio.  And it was within that purview I got to know him.  Apart from that, before the trial I had never met him in my life. 
Q.	Okay.  And you have no family relationship with him, extended family relationship.
A.	No.  No. 
Q.	And I am coming to the end of my examination Mr. Witness, so if we were -- we are right at the very end now.  Wouldn't you agree with me that your integrity, your personal integrity, is really the centrepiece or a centrepiece of your team's interactions with the witnesses you meet?  And I suggest this to you because Mr. Robinson doesn't speak Kinyarwanda, and most witnesses don't speak English, and you serve as both investigator and as interpreter.  Wouldn't you agree with me that gives you a very pivotal position in how your Defence investigations are conducted? 
A.	No, I do not agree with you.  I was not a centrepiece within my team. 
Q.	Well, if the counsel Mr. Robinson doesn't understand what a witness says unless you interpret it, and a witness doesn't understand what Mr. Robinson says unless you interpret it, doesn't that make you an essential link in interpreting Mr. Robinson and his words to the witnesses and the witnesses and their words to Mr. Robinson? 
A.	To answer that question, and since we are here at the Tribunal, I could illustrate it with an example.  Here you have interpreters over there in the booths.  We have the Trial Chamber, which is right here before us.  Can you tell us, Mr. President, Honourable Judges -- can you assert that those interpreters sitting over there, it is they who are the centrepiece, they are essential to the proceedings of this Tribunal?  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, but the exception here is the interpreters are independent of the Court or the parties, where you are an integral member of the Defence team and, as you reminded us in your previous response, you are a Rwandan and you are concerned with current affairs in Rwanda, and you are from Ruhengeri, from a commune just adjoining Mukingo, which is where your client is from.  So I think your status as an interpreter is very different in the context of your Defence team than the interpreters who are seated behind me in this courtroom.  So now that you understand the point I'm trying to make, you can comment.
MR. WEBSTER:
	And that will be the end of my examination, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you.  Permit me to correct -- make this clear.  My commune is not neighbouring to Mukingo.  That's the first thing.  

	Now, secondly, the witnesses that the Defence expects to call for this trial, all these persons do not hail from Mukingo.  There are even some who come from abroad, who come from other countries.  And, in addition, all the work I do as an interpreter, I do not see how I can consider myself as a centrepiece in the entire job being done, particularly as, in order to locate the witnesses to be interviewed, that does not have -- is not based on imagination.  We draw inspiration from persons mentioned in the file.  We start from the list of persons mentioned in the indictment.  And we try to identify those persons.  We try to get in contact with those persons.  And so I do not see -- well, maybe I will leave that in the hands of the Chamber.  I do not see how the Prosecutor can describe my humble services, which avail to the counsel as interpreter, as an essential part of the work that he is doing.  I do not deny the fact that I play a certain role, but to describe that role as an essential role, I am sorry, I take exception to that.  

	Thank you very much.
(Pages 16 to 28 by Claudette Ask)






























1200H 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just for the record, I'd like to indicate that when I was referring to GNK, he can be identified in our record by referring to P. 367, which is under seal.  It's the amicus report.  And GNK's identified at paragraphs 28 to 38 of that report.  

And with that I thank you for your assistance, Mr. Witness.  And Your Honours, I have concluded my cross-examination. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, if I could crave your indulgence here.  I have a few documents to tender into evidence in relation to the questions I asked Mr. Munyeshuli.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How many?  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, one of these is the letter from Witness AWD dated 23rd of February 2009 to the 
	Office of the Prosecutor which I used in cross-examining the witness.  

And, Your Honours, I'm not sure what the -- your practice is in terms of admitting documents that have actually been received as part of court documents, and I'm talking about the affidavit of the witness in relation to Witness BDW.  That can also be admitted into evidence.  

And then the registry report offered by Mr. Constant Hometowu, which also I dealt with in my cross-examination of the witness, if it could be admitted as well. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, taking this one at a time, I don't believe there's any foundation for the letter from Witness AWD.  He was recalled to testify.  Had the Prosecution wanted to identify him on the contents of that letter, they could have done so at the time.  But the letter is not anything that this witness can validate.  

I'm not so sure that this letter hasn't already been somehow referred to in the record though, so I'm not clear about that because it seems that we had some discussion with Witness AWD about the events in which he was contacted by the Defence team.  

But if it's not already in evidence, I don't think there's been any foundation at this stage to admit.  And in respect of the documents for BDW, they are attached -- they are part of the registry's record.  They bear a registry number.  And it's up to the Chamber, if you want to admit them, then you can.  And I'll also have some exhibits to be admitted under that -- under those conditions.  But if you feel that it's already part of the record, then there's no need to admit them as an exhibit. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, in response to Mr. Robinson's objection, this letter, Your Honours, I did discuss it with the witness.  And if one looks at the letter, it is the witness who has been referred to in this particular letter and I put that to the witness.  So it is of closer relevance to the witness's testimony and his credibility.

Your Honour, that was my submission. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, to aid your deliberations, if I could just hand over to you the letter.  I have a copy here. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we think that the -- the letter can be admitted.  It relates directly to this witness and the issue of authenticity is not an issue to us.

With regard to the others, we have repeatedly ruled that the amicus report is part of the record.  Both parties have requested from time to time that we give it an exhibit number and we have declined to do so up to now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My colleague was referring to another report actually.  The amicus has -- has been given a number.  It is P. 367.  The Court admitted it with limitation.  It explicitly limited how it could be used, but it identified it for the record.  

But I believe my colleague's referring to a registry report which was done for BDW.  But as Mr. Robinson has already suggested, since it's already filed by the registry, we may not need it as an exhibit so long as it can be used in our submissions if we need to refer to it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, Mr. Webster.  Thank you for that.  We think we should have -- in that sense it probably would be best to treat it in the same way as we did the amicus report.  And in that context, we'll give it a number for easy -- easy reference.

Mr. Issa, could you?  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The letter will be P. 416.  And the report will be P. 417.  Thank you, 
	Your Honour.
(Exhibit No. P. 416 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. P. 417 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Robinson, any redirect?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  It's going to be somewhat lengthy but I'll do my best. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours -- sorry, Mr, Robinson.  You have not ruled on the affidavit that was deposed to by the witness.  This was the affidavit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I understood that document to be a part of the -- of the report. 
MR. N'DOW:
No, I don't think so, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It was in a separate document?  
MR. N'DOW:
It was in a separate document. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We admit it then.  I thought we had said we'd admit.  If it's a separate document, we also admit that. 
MR. N'DOW:
I am much obliged, Your Honour. 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

The document will be P. 418.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 418 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Munyeshuli, I'm going to take you all the way back to the first time we met.  And can you tell us what were the circumstances under which you were contacted and then hired to work on the Nzirorera Defence team? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I was contacted in 2003.  I believe it was in the month of March or April.  At that time Robinson was visiting Rwanda with an interpreter who worked at the parliament.  

When Robinson told that gentleman that he needed someone with whom to work on this case, the gentleman proposed Munyeshuli.  That is myself.  And I only got to learn of this later when I met Robinson and that person.  That is how I came into contact with Peter Robinson.  Thank you. 
Q.	Did you have any family or personal connection with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Nothing, no. 
Q.	What was your occupation at that time? 
A.	At that time I was what is known as a defence judiciaire and I was working with the defence judiciaire in Kibuye préfecture. 
Q.	And were you helping to defend people accused of genocide in the courts in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, that was the nature of our task.  So we were practicing lawyers involved in the genocide litigations.  And I worked in that capacity from 1997. 
Q.	And do you know whether or not I interviewed other judicial defenders before selecting you for that position? 
A.	Yes, at least I know one other defence judiciaire with whom you had discussions. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now we'll go kind of in chronological order to some witnesses that have been mentioned by Mr. Webster.  And we'll start with Witness AWD.  And I ask that you be shown Exhibit D. NZ361.  And while that's being circulated, I'll ask you do you recall that an individual named 
	Ahmed Mbonyunkiza had testified at the beginning of this trial as to a number of people who had attended some meetings at the MRND office at the Rubangura building in 1992? 
A.	Yes, I know him by name. 
Q.	And was one of the tasks that you were given as investigator to contact people who Mbonyunkiza had indicated were present at those meetings? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And was Witness AWD one of those people? 
A.	Yes, I do remember very clearly, because, if I'm not mistaken, at the time he was conseiller, or at least he held a position. 
Q.	Now directing your attention to Exhibit D. NZ361, which was admitted during the testimony of 
	Witness AWD, do you recognise that document? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And what is it? 
A.	It is the report on the discussion I had with that person, whose name is mentioned in the document. 
Q.	At that time you went to see Witness AWD had it been disclosed that he was a Prosecution witness in this case? 
A.	No, because I went to see him, given that his name appeared on the list of people who had been mentioned by another witness. 
Q.	Now looking at the contents of this exhibit, it says that Witness AWD says that:  "I never" -- number 2:  "I never attended any meetings in the MRND office in which the Interahamwe national committee was introduced, in which Mathieu Ngirumpatse called Interahamwe to exterminate Tutsis, in which axes were displayed" -- "which axes were placed with Gaspard Ukwizagira (phonetic), a Kigali businessman who was to import them, in which Simon Bikindi and Zacharie presented a song they composed about extermination of Tutsis."  

And then it adds that:  "I did not even know Zacharie before and I do not know Ahmed Mbonyunkiza."

And then it goes on to say:  "I learned that Ahmed had been turned down by his colleagues and become an MDR member."  

And then it goes on to say that:  "I met the ICTR several times.  The last time was in 2005 and I was asked about those meetings with Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera."  

Now, were those the things that Witness AWD told you during your interview? 
A.	Yes, that is what he told me. 
Q.	And after you had told -- he had told you those things, did you go back to Witness AWD and ask him to sign this declaration? 
A.	I do not clearly remember whether I went back there, but I think that I went back, although I do not have a clear recollection. 
Q.	And in any event once it became known that Witness AWD was a Prosecution witness, did you have any other contact with him? 
A.	No, never. 
Q.	Okay.  Now let's turn to the issue of Witness BDW.  Now, in the past when we have requested to meet a witness for the Prosecution, is there a procedure that we have followed with respect to WVSS? 
A.	Yes, there is a procedure in place, given that it is WVSS that contacts the witness to seek their opinion as to whether they want to meet us or not, and whether that would be in the presence of the Prosecutor or not.  Thank you. 
Q.	And in all other instances in which we have met a Prosecution -- in which a Prosecution witness has consented to meet us, except for BDW, have I -- except for BDW, have I also been present? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, for the benefit of the French booth, if counsel would kindly repeat his question.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	With the exception of BDW, and in all other cases in which a Prosecution witness has consented to meet with our team, have I been present? 
A.	Yes, in all other cases you've been present. 
Q.	In respect to Witness BDW, did he consent to meet through WVSS? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what had he said about whether he wanted the Prosecutor to be there or not? 
A.	He stated clearly that he could meet the Defence team in the absence of the Prosecutor. 
Q.	And did I request that you go and meet him without me on that occasion? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was I in Rwanda when you went and met him? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was there some danger, as you perceived it, in meeting Witness BDW? 
A.	Yes, I felt that there was some measure of risk involved. 
Q.	And can you explain what that was to the Trial Chamber? 
A.	Yes.  When one meets such a witness -- by the way, usually I met witnesses with the Defence counsel and the Prosecutor, so when it happened that I had to meet the witness alone, I wondered what I would do to defend myself if anything went wrong, given that some things -- such things had already happened previously.  And that is why I determined that I had to take every necessary precaution to avoid falling either into the hands of negationists, or those who denied the genocide, which is an offence punishable under Rwandan law. 
Q.	Were you concerned that if you were meeting that witness without that kind of protection, allegations by that witness could cause problems to you later? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Robinson is leading the witness and putting his evidence indirectly to the witness as confirmation.  So he needs to be more careful on how he puts the questions in redirect. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, that's correct.  I should ask him a non-leading question here. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So what were you concerned about?  What would happen?  What were the risks? 
A.	I was afraid that the witness could subsequently deny what he had said to me and that would place me in a very uncomfortable situation. 
Q.	Have witnesses in the past claimed that Defence investigators have threatened them? 
A.	I was aware of at least two cases in which witnesses had accused me of giving money. 
Q.	Now, when you record -- when you recorded your contact with Witness BDW, was that the first time that you had recorded a contact with a witness in this case or were there other times? 
A.	That was the first time.
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness could be shown Prosecution Exhibit 419, which is the affidavit or statement that he made.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, how much longer do you think you're likely to be?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think maybe about 15 minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Would you prefer -- if the -- if everybody agrees.  

Do you have any other witnesses to call after this witness for the rest of the week?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I don't, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, would it be more convenient just to complete the session and then we have the rest of the day free or would you prefer to break at 12:30 and resume at 2 o'clock in relation to your client's health?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, after consulting my client, he has indicated that he is willing to make the effort for the additional 15 minutes if that will release him for the afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  And I want to ensure mister --

Okay.  We will continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

I misspoke the number of the exhibit.  It is P. 418. 
MR. N'DOW:
I think you are right.  It is P. 419 because it was the last exhibit to be admitted. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, our records indicate that the last exhibit is Exhibit P. 418, and that's a copy of an affidavit sworn to by Witness Dick Prudence Munyeshuli.  Thank you.  
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, you are right, Mr. Robinson.  It is P. 418. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Right.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Munyeshuli, in this affidavit you say on paragraph 5 that:  "On the 8th of May 2009 I interviewed Witness BDW at the Gitarama prison.  He told me that he had not in fact" -- "he told me that in fact he had not seen Joseph Nzirorera speak at Kabuye.  However, while at Ruhengeri prison he received criticisms from relatives of Joseph Nzirorera and he therefore decided to include Nzirorera in his statement."  

Is that in fact what Witness BDW told you? 
A.	Yes, that is what he told me. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let's now move to Witness GAP.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I would ask that the registrar show to everyone a document I would like to use.  I had to just go and run and retrieve it from my office during the last break, so I haven't had a chance to make copies or show it to anyone, but it's a copy of the WVSS forms for Witness GAP. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Munyeshuli, directing your attention to the documents that have been placed in front of you, do you recognise those? 
A.	Yes, I recognise the document. 
Q.	And what is it? 
A.	It is a form that witness protection -- or, rather, that we use for the identification of witnesses. 
Q.	And is the one known for the person known as GAP? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is it dated? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What's the date? 
A.	The document bears the date 20 February 2008. 
Q.	And on that date was there a meeting with mister -- with Witness GAP? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, the witness seems a little puzzled, given the pause that he's taking to examine the document and answer the question.  And I'm a bit puzzled myself.  

Is the question whether this witness met with Witness GAP in February of 2008 or whether the documents disclose that WVSS met the witness?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No.  The question is whether this witness met with Witness GAP on 20th February 2008.  These are forms that have to be completed by the Defence team for WVSS. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And is that your handwriting having filled out that form? 
A.	Yes, that is my handwriting. 
Q.	And do you recall whether or not I was also present when those forms were filled out and the question about testifying for the Defence was discussed with Witness GAP? 
A.	Yes, I recall clearly, very clearly, if I'm not mistaken, that you were present. 
Q.	Now, in addition to completing the form for WVSS, is there also a form there in which we asked our witnesses whether or not they were willing to meet with the Prosecution? 
A.	The form is appended to the WVSS form. 
Q.	And what did Witness GAP say when he was asked whether or not he wanted to meet the Prosecution? 
A.	The witness indicated that he did not desire to meet representatives of the Prosecutor or of the OTP. 
Q.	And did he sign that form? 
A.	Yes, he did. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that that be admitted as D. NZ724, under seal. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would object on several grounds because this has picked up a whole new set of issues.  

First of all, the witness was here.  It seems to me that this is a document that should have been put to the witness.  At no time did the Defence challenge the witness about prior meetings that he had with the Defence team in February of 2008.  

The witness then went on to testify in the Setako trial in August of 2008 and spoke to the amicus in December of 2008 and then this witness, Mr. Munyeshuli, testified, just this morning, and was asked when he met with the witness and couldn't recall and could only state that after meeting with the witness in November, I believe it was, November of 2008, the next meeting was in June of 2009.  

So Mr. Robinson is almost -- seems to be impeaching his own witness on the issue of prior meetings with GAP, unless I'm not following the sequence of the documents.  This document was never disclosed to the Prosecution.  But what is more pertinent is that the witness himself was never confronted with these documents.  And then Mr. Robinson is suggesting to the Chamber that his encounter with GAP was monitored by the Prosecution by -- when he set up a meeting to meet with that witness in the presence of a representative, and I was that representative.  

So I don't understand where this document from February 2008 comes from where the witness refuses to meet with the Prosecution.  It's all a bit confusing and it goes counter to the testimony of the witness we have in the stand right now.  
And just given how this issue has developed, I think it would be unfair, to GAP himself and the trial record, to now admit this document into evidence without having confronted GAP with the document and asked him to explain it.  That would have been the most appropriate moment to bring this document to light.  

So this is the second time that -- with regard to this witness -- that somehow a prior statement, whether you want to characterise it as inconsistent or consistent, pops up simply to explain away the 
Defence's interaction with GAP.  So I think I would like a copy of the documents to look at them more cleverly.  

But this is not a negligible issue, just given how the testimony of GAP has evolved over the last 
three or four days. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  In the course of this witness's cross-examination, Mr. Webster raised the issue for the first time of the sequence of contacts with Witness GAP, suggesting that we have somehow brought this witness without any idea that he was going to testify in favour of the Defence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it wasn't -- it was the witness's answers who gave that impression that the Defence --

Now -- now what you have done just now is you have cross-examined your witness to impeach answers he gave in cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I don't believe he gave any inconsistent answers in cross-examination.  I think the sequence that Mr. Webster recalls is not correct.  Even Mr. Webster's meeting with GAP and myself was in 2007.  So the sequence --  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, but we have a witness on the witness box now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  We think the legal principle that should govern on this issue is what -- our characterisation of what transpired is that the document was used to refresh your witness's memory.  His answer's consistent with what's in the document, and so we decide not to admit it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, the document has legal significance besides the issue of this witness.  It's a signature of Witness GAP.  It shows that in February 2008 he had agreed to testify for the Defence and didn't even want to meet the Prosecutor.  
So I think that those facts seem to -- should be part of the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That cannot be put in through this witness.  It should be in his cross-examination.  How can the witness testify to that?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
He was present.  He was the one who took --  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
But this witness is in the witness box.  We don't think that that evidence should be admitted through this testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, ten minutes ago you admitted a letter from Witness AWD and this witness, AWD, was in the witness box.  Nobody asked him about the contents of that letter in which he talked about his meeting with this witness.  You admitted that letter on behalf of the Prosecution because that issue hadn't come up when AWD was testifying.  

Now, Witness GAP testified that the issue didn't come up.  What was the sequence of -- why did the Defence think that you might be a good witness for them?  It came up through this witness.  And if you admit the letter for AWD for the Prosecutor, the same principle applies and you should admit this document.  If you insist that all documents by -- signed by a witness be shown to that witness, then you should exclude the evidence of the letter of AWD.  It's the same principle and it's not being applied consistently.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, it's certainly not the same principle because this witness agreed with the content of the letter -- of the -- acknowledged that he had met with the witness, which is what the witness was alleging in that letter.  So it's completely different.

I doubt quite seriously if GAP was in the witness box today and was confronted with this witness -- with the exhibit Mr. Robinson is referring to, that he would have the same characterisation of the exhibit and the meeting and the content of what they said, as Mr. Robinson is suggesting.  That's the problem.  

It should have been put to GAP when he was here to acknowledge whether he signed the document or not.  Even with respect to the will-say statement, GAP contested his signature at the bottom.  He recognised the signature and then he characterised -- or he went on to state that he only knows what he heard from the interpreter.  

So the issue of signatures on documents should have been -- should have been put to the witness.  It's wholly inappropriate to bring this up now.  
First, that statement should have been disclosed to the Prosecution.  This is the first time that it's come to light that there was a purported meeting in February 2008. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You wish to say something else, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  The issue -- there was no issue at the time that Witness GAP testified about why the Defence decided to call him.  That came up during this witness's testimony.  Just like there was no issue when AWD testified as to whether or not he had met with this individual in 2009 when he came here to be recalled.  

So in both situations it was not necessary to put something to the witness at that time because it wasn't part of the issue.  

Now it's become an issue raised by Mr. Webster's cross-examination.  The Prosecutor profited from that and introduced the testimony of AWD, who is not here to be cross-examined about his statement.  And now I should be able to take the same benefit by asking him about GAP's document.  

With respect to disclosure, these are not statements.  They're disclosed to the WVSS.  The Prosecution never disclose any WVSS forms for their witnesses to us.  So there's no obligation for us to disclose it to them, and it's not a secret document.  These are the documents we were assembling for WVSS so they could transport our witnesses.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The evidentiary point is that we have Mr. Munyeshuli's response to Mr. Robinson's question on the record.  Dispute is over the piece of paper that he's trying to put in evidence.  

So I don't see how he's disadvantaged in making whatever arguments he wants to make based on Mr. Munyeshuli's responses.  But he shouldn't be allowed to enter into evidence this purported statement of GAP bearing GAP's signature.  It hasn't been authenticated.  The witness was here.  That's the fundamental point.  

And the witness, given how things have developed, would certainly have a very different characterisation of his interactions with Mr. Robinson and Mr. Munyeshuli than Mr. Robinson is suggesting through that document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have considered the additional submissions that have been made, but we think that in the circumstances of the way the case has developed that the probative value cannot outweigh the prejudicial value of admitting this document.  
The witness has given testimony about its content, that it refreshed his memory and he stated what was on the document.  And I think that's sufficient for the purposes of our adjudicative processes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I realise it's now somewhat later than the fifteen minutes.  It's still going to take me 
five or ten more minutes.  I don't know if you want me to proceed or you want to take a break. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If it's only five minutes or so, I think -- what I understood from Mr. Weyl is that it would be preferable to finish our session for the week now than to come back later this afternoon.  So unless he objects, I would suggest that you complete, if it is just five or ten minutes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's my estimate of the time of my examination.  If there are other issues that come up, I may have to revise that estimate, but I'll do my best. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Munyeshuli, can you tell us whether or not Witness GAP had agreed to testify on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera prior to being brought to Arusha? 
A.	Yes, that was it.  If not, there would have been no sense in getting it here, out here to Arusha. 
Q.	Now then, in June of 2009, do you recall the circumstances when our witnesses were brought to Arusha, yet the trial, because of an Appeals Chamber ruling, did not begin? 
A.	Yes, I do recall that when we met our witnesses at the safe house we took an appointment for the 
	days -- in the days ahead to be able to talk with them, and when the trial was postponed the witnesses were sent back to Rwanda.  And so we never had time to talk with them, as had been foreseen to 
	take place at the safe house. 
Q.	And during June of 2009 had there been any indication from Witness GAP that he was not willing to give testimony? 
A.	No.  To the best of my knowledge, no. 
Q.	And approximately when was the next time that Witness GAP was brought back to Arusha? 
A.	I think that after November he was brought back here in the course of January, this month of January. 
Q.	But our statement that was recorded was on the 18th of November 2009.  
A.	Yes, that's right.  That's correct. 
Q.	And had he been brought back here during the session of October to November 2009? 
A.	Yes, he was here but he never testified.  He did not testify. 
Q.	And were you present at meetings with him during this period at UNDF? 
A.	Yes, I was present, at least for most of the time during the interview. 
Q.	Were there also other members of my team who were present for interviews when you were not there? 
A.	Yes, because at such a point in time I returned to Kigali. 
Q.	And did Witness GAP -- what did he say about whether or not he remained willing to testify on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	He said he was still ready to testify and to tell the truth, as it was put in regarding Nzirorera. 
Q.	Now for this present session, and beginning on the 18th of January 2010, prior to Witness GAP coming to court, were you present at any meetings with him at UNDF? 
A.	Did you say before -- before he was brought to the court?  
Q.	Yes.  Between the time he arrived in Arusha in January 2010 and before he came into the courtroom, were you present with any meetings with him at UNDF? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And at that time did he make any statements concerning any fear he had about testifying for Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  When -- I believe it was on the day he came to the Tribunal.  When we met on the other side, he indicated that he had followed over a programme on -- a programme of Ibuka over Radio Rwanda and that he was frightened about testifying.  In fact, he said that if it was possible, it were better his testimony be postponed. 
Q.	And do you recall what was said to him? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was that? 
A.	He was told that if by chance he felt bad or uncomfortable beginning to testify, since he had expressed a wish for his testimony to be postponed to the next Monday, the counsel told him that he should raise it before the Trial Chamber and it would be at the discretion of the Trial Chamber to deliver a ruling on his request or motion. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. Munyeshuli. 

Mr. President, I have no further questions. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I apologise because I know we all want to finish expeditiously, but I do have a few questions based on the recent development to this testimony about the February 2008 meetings.  It shouldn't take more than five minutes if we get quick answers. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do the Defence have any questions or comments?  

Ms. Diagne, I address myself especially to you.  Are there any issues you would like to put to the witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Why, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thinking about you and making certain that you understand that we think you are an important part of the trial, so I thought I would take this step to demonstrate that.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
That is very thoughtful about -- from you, Mr. President.  I don't have any questions.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, and how do I understand your last remark as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President?  

I would like to say that I am rather astonished about this ping-pong game when you have compliments on adding to what was complementary.  In fact, Mr. President, I don't know what would authorise Mr. Webster to come back and do a counter-counter or a re-recross. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, there's no point to be jealous.  I addressed you especially when Ms. Diagne was not here.

Yes, Mr. Webster, you have a few minutes. 
FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Munyeshuli, when your Defence team met with GAP in November of 2007, you took the precaution of going through WVSS and alerting the Prosecution so the Prosecution could be represented; isn't that so? 
A.	Well, I do not recall exactly.  But I believe that each time we expressed the wish to meet a witness who was initially a Prosecution witness, the same procedure was followed. 
Q.	Well, that's not the case, and that's not the case based on your responses to Mr. Robinson's questions just five minutes ago, because when you met with the witness in February of 2008, you did not go through WVSS.  And WVSS did not communicate with the Prosecution to inform us that the witness consented to a Defence interview in our -- in the absence of the Prosecution.  
A.	But your question, you're talking to -- referring to 2007.  And I told you I did not remember these things in 2007, and yet you're talking about 2007. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm putting to you the same issues that you covered in your direct exam and cross-exam just five minutes ago.  

When your Defence team met with the witness in November 2007 the Prosecution was represented.  It was represented in my person.  I was present and I had been alerted of the witness's consent to meet with the Defence through WVSS.  And you testified earlier that any time you contacted a 
Prosecution witness you did so through WVSS.  And WVSS has a procedure of having a witness sign a form indicating whether he was willing to meet with the Defence alone or whether he wanted a representative of the Prosecution to be present.  
That's what happened in November of 2007, isn't that so? 
A.	The form was signed in 2008. 
Q.	I am simply repeating what you have already -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I beg your pardon.  

Mr. President, I have been standing up for the past five minutes, but, Mr. President, I understand that you did not see me.  But, Mr. Webster, could you not have seen me?  And yet he just went on.  And he did not notice that Mr. Ngirumpatse walked out because the 15 minutes he was granted has now extended to 35 minutes, and this is rather getting out of control.  And I take up my issue by saying I don't know what we are witnessing here.  

There has been an examination-in-chief, there has been a cross, and then there's been an additional direct.  And so what are we up to now, Mr. Webster?  What is he involved in?  Mr. Webster, is there going to be an infinite rebuttal?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Important issues are raised in the cross-examination which in our view entitled Mr. Robinson for an extended redirect, and he took it.  

But he also raised another two minor issues, I thought, in it, which would have entitled Mr. Webster to ask a few questions.  And we thought that he could have completed that in the five minutes he requested.  So I don't think it's an infinite matter and we don't think the questions are improper at this stage.  

But, Mr. Webster, are you still going to keep it within the time limit you estimated?
MR. WEBSTER:
If I get direct answers quickly, Your Honour.  I don't want to dwell on this issue, but I want three or four questions answered with specificity -- with clarity.  Excuse me.  So I have questions I'd like to ask.  

If the Ngirumpatse team objects to proceeding now, then we should come back after the 
luncheon recess. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't think that's what he's doing.  What his reason -- the question was -- it just takes a bit longer than I anticipated.  And he just wants an assurance that we're going to complete quickly.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
We thought that the five minutes you suggested was reasonable. 
MR. WEBSTER:
And I thought I would be able to do it in five minutes or less.
MR, PRESIDENT:
Fine.  Try and complete.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, back to you.  You used the procedure that we've all established through WVSS to arrange the interview that took place in November 2007 where the witness consented to a 
	Defence interview in the presence of the Prosecution.  Right? 
A.	Yes, but it is worthwhile to note that it was the counsel who was in charge of that.  I am only informed of the -- I was only informed that we would be meeting this witness on such and such a date. 
Q.	But when you met with the witness in February 2008, you didn't use that procedure.  You didn't try to respect the spirit of the protective order and go through WVSS with notice to the Prosecution, and the witness never signed a form from WVSS indicating that he didn't want the Prosecution present.  You met with the witness in February of 2008 and during that meeting you had the witness sign a form that your team prepared.  Isn't that so?  
A.	That's correct, Mr. President. 
Q.	Doesn't that contradict your previous testimony that every time you met with Prosecution witnesses it was on notice to the Prosecution?  You did that by giving notice to the Prosecution and WVSS? 
A.	As I earlier on stated in my statement, it's that these administrative issues are handled by the counsel exclusively.  I will not be able to tell you why at one point things were not done according to that procedure or that could have been done in that way or known to me because I do not monitor those administrative issues.  But that is the fact.  We met with the witness. 
Q.	And after your meeting with the witness in 2008 the witness testified in the Setako trial in August 2008.  Right?  You met with him in February.  He testified in August.  
A.	I did not know exactly on what date he testified, but I believe it may just be what you just said.  
Q.	Well, in the will-say statement that you interpreted and got the witness to sign, there's a recitation of the dates that he testified in previous trials.  And the last ICTR trial that he testified in was Setako on the 25th of August 2008, and that's information that you recorded from the witness.  And then after that he was interviewed by the amicus curiae in November 2008 and the final report of the amicus was circulated in April of 2009. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You've gone over that already.  We have that evidence in the record already.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  But the point is that Mr. Munyeshuli is suggesting that somehow the witness agreed to give Defence evidence in February.  And my question to him now is:
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Doesn't it strike you as odd that after you spoke to him in February he gave Prosecution evidence consistent with all of his previous OTP statements and trial testimony in August, and you didn't even discuss that with him in June of 2009 when you saw him? 
A.	Well, I think I've made it clear that in 2009 we went document after document and -- but these testimonies were handled during interviews that we had at UNDF.  And then when he came to testify, I don't think he came to testify then in the Nzirorera case. 
Q.	You testified just two or three hours ago that the witness was here in Arusha in June 2009, but you didn't have any substantive conversation with him, you just said hello to him, and that the first substantive conversation you had with him took place in November, the 18th of November 2009.  

Now you're telling us that you met with the witness in February 2008 and he agreed to give 
Defence evidence.  But yet in August he testified in Setako in a matter that was completely consistent with his previous OTP statements and previous ICTR testimony.  And again in April of 2009 you received the amicus report where the witness maintained that there was no attempt to fabricate evidence in Ruhengeri.  
A.	Maybe we did not understand ourselves, Mr. Prosecutor, when I answered the question about our last meeting.  But what I must make clear here is that:  Do you find it reasonable that one can -- would call a witness without knowing whether he's going to testify for you or not?  No.  Whatever the case, we met.  Maybe I did not understand your question when you put it to me earlier on, whether we had met, maybe I thought here in Arusha, but it would be meaningless for a witness to be called up without knowing that he's going to testify for you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I'll let the record speak for itself.  The witness's response is on the record.  We can all look at things in chronology and make an assessment at a later time.  

So thank you very much for the indulgence and my apologies to the Ngirumpatse team and my thanks for them as well for allowing me to continue. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Webster.

Mr. Witness, that concludes your stay in our witness box as a witness.  And we thank you, as we've done with all of the witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal with its work.  But you're now excused and you can now resume your major -- your substantive role. 
 
Mr. Robinson, is there -- are there any housekeeping rules that we ordinarily need to make or can we just adjourn until Monday?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think we could adjourn until Monday, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I would also like to express our appreciation to Mr. Ngirumpatse for staying on so we can complete the day and the week. 
MR. WEBSTER:
One last thing.  I had mentioned that I wanted an email exchange between Mr. Robinson and I to become part of the record.  I haven't had an opportunity to print it out.  But I just bring that to the Court's attention that I would like to make it a Prosecution exhibit when we reconvene on Monday morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will take note of that.  We take the adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1315H)
