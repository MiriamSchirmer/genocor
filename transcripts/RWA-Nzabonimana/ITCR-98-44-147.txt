MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  We welcome you back to the resumption of the hearing on the Rwamakuba case, and at this stage I'd like to ask the registrar to open the proceedings.
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Thank you.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 22nd of August 2005 for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, 
Case Number ICTR- 9844C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we now have appearances, please, starting with the Prosecution?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Welcome back.  The Prosecution is represented by myself, Don Webster; Dior Fall; Iain Morley; and Adama Niane.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Webster.  

Counsel for the Defence, please.
MR. HOOPER:
André Rwamakuba is represented by myself, David Hooper, and by Andreas O'Shea.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, as we commence this new trial session I again note that the Accused, Dr. Rwamakuba, is not in court.  Is there any further development that you have to give us on his continued absence from the trial?  
MR. HOOPER:
Essentially, no.  I have seen him last week.  He's well and he sends his respects to the Trial Chamber.  But his view has perhaps deepened rather than lessened, and his presence here is a voluntary absence.  And he has, otherwise, given the circumstances, participated as much as he can recently in his defence, in his advice to us, and in his instructions to us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Well, again, I'd just like to reiterate that the Chamber continues to request his attendance and to invite him to attend.
MR. HOOPER:
I thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, before we commence on the hearing of the evidence, are there any issues which are required to be addressed at this stage?  Well, in that event I would ask the Registrar to bring in the first witness.
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour.  I was pausing a bit because I had expected Mr. Hooper to jump to his feet and complain about an incident that took place in late July.  I did send an informal memo to the senior legal officer in Chambers to alert him that there was an issue that would arise today before the witness takes the stand.  It was copied to Mr. Hooper, so I'm sure he's aware of my concerns.  We are dealing with a troublesome issue, and it's the issue of witness protection and the violation of the Trial Chamber III witness protection order of 10 December 2004.  I think the Trial Chamber made it clear that the Defence should not divulge the name of Prosecution witnesses to third parties.  Of course, in conducting their defence investigations we acknowledge that it's inevitable that they should mention the names of witnesses that they are trying to develop information for impeachment purposes, but I would suggest that there is a spirit in the order, itself, that would encourage all the parties to refrain in bandying about the names of Prosecution witnesses and putting them in compromising positions in their communities.  This has been a recurring problem in this case and the Karemera case and it has come to a head now, because on the 26th of July there was a press conference in Kigali.  It was a press conference at the OTP headquarters in Remera, and there were several prosecution witnesses that made statements that complained about certain acts or behaviour on the part of Mr. Hooper and his Defence team.  I understand that on the 25th of July in Butare at the hospital Mr. Hooper was present and questioned a number of persons about these witnesses and divulged their names in that context and we've had these witnesses suffer repercussions.  One claimed that she was physically attacked herself, another claimed her home was attacked.  So these are serious issues for us.  

And I note that Mr. Hooper, himself, raised the issue.  Even before I was aware of it, he sent a letter to Jean De Dieu La Choix, who is the Prosecutor General of Rwanda, complaining about this press conference and asking that an investigation be undertaken.  And this letter, as I see on page -- it's a rather lengthy letter.  It looks like it contains at least 7 or 8 pages -- it's copied to Your Honour, Judge Byron, as the president of this Trial Chamber.  It is also copied to the president of the Tribunal, Judge Møse, and I received a copy because it was copied to the Prosecutor, Hassan Jallow.  And this letter I find a bit troubling, because it is now before the Trial Chamber, indirectly through yourself, Your Honour, and in it Mr. Hooper criticises Prosecution witnesses that have already testified, and he makes blanket statements that the witnesses are not to be believed.  He suggests that "they" -- and I say "they" because in his letter he refers to them as a group who were found to be incredible in other court proceedings, and these are all things that should not be before this Trial Chamber.  Unfortunately, I may be making the issue a bit worse by going into it, but it is inevitable.  This is something that has to be addressed by the Trial Chamber, and this is behaviour that we find inappropriate, and it's a continuation of a pattern that began years ago.  On more than one occasion, during the course of this trial in particular, Mr. Hooper has made statements about the credibility of witnesses based on what he says transpired in other cases in other forums.  That's inappropriate, and it needs to be corrected; but as a practical matter, the witness that is about to take the stand this morning, GIO, claims that she suffered injuries and she assumes that it is as a direct result of Mr. Hooper's behaviour in Butare.  

Now, I've read his letter very carefully, and what he says in his letter contradicts some of the things that some of these witnesses are saying.  We have started an investigation in the OTP, but the investigation has not been completed and it has not been documented.  It is in progress.  And the investigators in Kigali are waiting further instructions from the trial team in Arusha, in order to move forward, because it is clear that it is going to present a problem with this trial.  

But it is not only a question of that investigation; it is the issue of witness protection, which is already intruding on this trial.  We have two witnesses, now, who do not want to come to court.  And these are significant witnesses for our court, and it is directly on the issue of witness protection.  Two of the witnesses that are here today did not want to come to court, and it took a flurry of e-mails and telephone conversations between Arusha and Kigali to get them on the plane to arrive here in order to testify before you this week.  One witness claims that she did not want to come, and she did not know of the incident that had transpired in Kigali -- and here I'm referring to the press conference -- but had she known that she was going to encounter David Hooper here in Arusha, she would not come.  So, while we are all interested in seeing justice done and getting truthful testimonies from all concerned, and having evidence to present before this Trial Chamber, it is our considered opinion that the Defence is making it difficult both for ourselves and for the trial process.  And something needs to be done.  

An investigation needs to be undertaken, and I'm wondering if it's appropriate for OTP to be responsible for the investigation, because it would require taking a statement from Mr. Hooper, himself.  What he says in his letter -- and I acknowledge that this letter was not written with a view to documenting everything that transpired in Butare.  It was written to request information from the prosecutor general of Rwanda.  So I acknowledge that he may not have given a complete account of what transpired, but we need a complete account in order to make sense of what happened and to proceed with the testimony of witnesses who were present at that press conference.  

Now, GIO was not present and, according to her, she knew nothing about the press conference until she was asked to comment on it over the weekend, when we were preparing her for her testimony this morning.  So, I believe we can continue with the testimony of GIO, but for the other witnesses there may be a problem, and I'm looking for guidance from the Court on how we should proceed.  

So, I think I've said enough.  I would like to stop here but I would like Mr. Hooper's comment.  And I would like some response from the Trial Chamber on what the Trial Chamber suggests is the best way to proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, would you like to comment on what Mr. Prosecutor has said?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'll contain myself, I think, to saying this.  That I've set out in the letter, which is being distributed, really, all I know about the allegations and the way in which they were made.  Even as I stand here today, I do not know precisely who made the allegations, nor do I know the exact nature of which allegations were made.  I hear today, Mr. Webster, that there is an enquiry being conducted by the Prosecution; it's an enquiry which he says is undocumented.  It suggests to me it is not an enquiry at the moment in very profound depth, but at least he must know who it was who made the allegations and from what he said this morning that is the case.  And secondly, I should expect him by now, having been alerted to the problem, to have a very full record of what those allegations are.  And I consider it his duty to provide both this Chamber and myself with that account forthwith.  

I can't help but reflect that in my own jurisdiction, in a situation such as I and others in my team found ourselves, that we could look for and expect a degree of understanding, if not support, from Prosecution colleagues and fellow members -- fellow counsel.  Instead, I've sat here this morning to hear further allegations made against me which are untrue.  It's been said this morning that there has been a history of this.  Well, I invite Mr. Webster, forthwith, to indicate that history to this Chamber and, forthwith, to indicate my involvement in it.  These have been untrue allegations.  The position was -- and one just reflects on what Mr. Webster said this morning -- that I arrived in Butare at midday on a Sunday and then saw six witnesses, none of them for long, obviously in those circumstances, relatively not long.  And the next day went to the hospital, having just unbelatedly received the authority of the populaire general to go to the hospital.  And in my letter I accurately reflect what happened there.  Contrary to what Mr. Webster has said -- and he had every opportunity to discuss this with me -- there was no contact, no talking to anybody at the hospital, yet somehow these witnesses -- and what Mr. Webster said this morning -- have now contrived to say that, as a result of that visit to the hospital, between then and the next day, in 24 hours, they have been in some way attacked.  It's wholly incredible.  

My concern has been, how was it that these people made their way from Butare, three hours to Kigali, -- and we all know their status and employment there -- to arrive at a press conference being given by the Prosecutor here, Mr. Jallow, an important public event in his calendar, and there to stand up in front of television cameras -- so much for their protected witness senses -- sensibilities -- and make allegations, the allegations that they did.  

My own view is -- well, my own view, perhaps, doesn't count too much.  What I can say is this, that I made some enquiries on Saturday of the populaire general's office in Kigali office I am told that there is an enquiry -- there was.  An enquiry hasn't quite been completed yet.  But Mr. Mutchar (phonetic), for his part, hasn't been able to respond to my letter because he has been in America, and there is no one, as I understand it, delegated to deal with this sort of situation.  So I'm not expecting an immediate report, but I am reasonably confident of its content.  

In terms of witnesses, there may well be other reasons and motives why witnesses don't want to come here.  It may be misleading for the Prosecution to throw it on our shoulders.  Indeed, I consider it deliberately misleading.  He tells us today that two witnesses don't want to come.  Well, a month ago we were told that two witnesses don't want to come.  It may be that their motives are, in fact, understandable but for other reasons.  We're told that there is a witness here who is willing to give evidence and that we can proceed with her, but there may be difficulties with other witnesses.  I'm not seeking to muddy waters here, but I think Mr. Webster just has.  Mr. Webster wanted to come and ask me a full account of what happened, he's had every opportunity.  In fact, we've had an informal discussion several times in the last week.  He could have raised this with me any time.  Instead he's chosen to do it this way in this manner in open court.  I think I could hope for better.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you Mr. Hooper.

Mr. Webster, we are very concerned about the purpose of making this statement in open court at this time.  You have not made any application to the Court.  You have not presented any evidence to support the allegations you have made, which accuse counsel of very serious conduct.  And you raised it in open court where it doesn't seem to be relevant to what we are doing today.  This is a matter that could have been addressed in other ways and with supporting information where there is a clear application of some sort.  So what was the purpose of making this statement here this morning?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I believe I alerted all of the parties, including the Trial Chamber, through the senior legal officer in Chambers, that there was an issue that needed to be developed, that needed to be addressed this morning.  That e-mail was sent to Mr. O'Donnell -- I believe it was -- on Friday, if not before.
MR. PRESIDENT:
On Friday at what time?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't recall exactly, but it was in the afternoon on Friday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have a document here dated 4:32 (sic), time 4:32 on Friday afternoon.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that to raise the matter before the Court, before the Chamber?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, this is a situation that is developing.  It is still unclear to us.  My question is whether it is appropriate for OTP to investigate this matter further.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is not the forum to have done that.  You know what you have done here?  You have put the Chamber in a very serious position here, because you've made a professional attack on a lawyer in open court.
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe I've stated that we had started to investigate the matter, the Office of the Prosecutor, the witnesses give -- provide information that leads us to believe there has been a violation of the protective order that this Chamber issued in December --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, if you're alleging that there has been a violation of a protective order, there is a procedure that ought to be followed.  You should file a motion supported by evidence asking for the relief which is required.  You have done it in relation to other matters, so I know you are aware what the procedure should be.  But if you are alleging that there is a violation of the witness protective order making a statement in open court of this nature, which is not accompanied by any application for the Court, nor is it supported by any evidence, is not the appropriate way to do it.  So if you want an opportunity to make such an application, we will grant you one.  If you are saying that there is a violation of a witness protection order, then there is a method of addressing that.  And the Court will address it.
MR. WEBSTER:
Quite frankly, Your Honour, I'm caught a little bit unawares because I certainly didn't expect this reaction from the Trial Chamber.  In terms of making an application, whether the application is made in open court or not, it is still an application made on the record.  What would be the difference in putting something in writing with these allegations and making it before the Trial Chamber as I am doing now?
MR. PRESIDENT:
What you hope, Mr. Webster, if this is a motion you are making, then you will be obliged to call evidence to support the allegations you've made.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My application --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because you can't make an allegation of this nature without supporting it.  It requires the Court to make factual findings of misconduct by a lawyer and that requires evidentiary support.
MR. WEBSTER:
That's exactly what I'm asking for, Your Honour.  I believe in my earlier application I asked for directions from the Court.  I don't think it is appropriate for the Office of the Prosecutor to investigate this matter.  We would have to take a statement from Mr. Hooper, himself.  I began my submission this morning by providing some background information.  I asked the Court what is the best way for the -- because it's a problem for us -- it's a problem for us in regard to these witnesses.  I was not in Kigali.  I was not in Butare.  I have no way of knowing what transpired.  I am relying on what Mr. Hooper said in his letter and what the witnesses have been telling our investigators, and what they said in the press conference that was publicly reported on the 26th of July.  That information is before the Court.  Mr. Hooper took it upon hisself (sic) to circulate that information to this Tribunal.  To me it seems that is where the Court's anger should be directed.  This letter is wholly inappropriate, and instead of criticising the Prosecutor or myself for bringing the matter to the Court's attention we should be looking at the content of Mr. Hooper's letter that was copied to Your Honour where he disparages prosecution witnesses that testified during the last trial session.  How appropriate is that, Your Honour, when he makes statements in his communications to the Trial Chamber that go directly to an issue of credibility for these witnesses?  So this is not something that the OTP wanted to launch into.  We are actually responding to Mr. Hooper's letter, and we respond by having conversations with these the witnesses, two of whom are right here today.  One witness can answer the Court's question.  So if the Court is asking for an evidentiary basis we can bring the witness in, and you can ask the questions of her that are needed to determine if an investigation is needed to go forward in another forum.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, what the Court needs to do is to try the case that is before it.  We came here this morning to continue hearing testimony in the case against André Rwamakuba.  That's what we want to do.  Now, if you wish to raise a peripheral issue, then you must do it properly.  That's all I'm saying.
MR. WEBSTER:
How peripheral is the issue of witness intimidation, Your Honour?  And I'm not suggesting that Mr. Hooper, himself -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, you are suggesting it.  You said it already.  You see, that's the point I'm getting at.  You made a statement in open court accusing a lawyer of unprofessional conduct, and I'm saying that that statement ought not to be made unless you are prepared to support it by evidence.  It's normally inappropriate for statements to be made in this matter, for an oral motion to be made in this manner.  I would normally have expected there would have been a written motion supported by affidavit testimony which would enable the Court to make an evidentiary finding of fact.  We can't comment on anything you've said without making assumptions of fact.  And we can only make assumptions of findings of fact after we have had some evidence to consider.  So there is no way the Court can comment on the things you have said here this morning, without their being supported by evidence, and that's our position.
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness is sitting right outside this courtroom, Your Honour.  We can call her in and we can place questions to her and we can establish on the record in open court and take the investigation forward from that point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In relation to what?  Are you making a charge against Mr. Hooper without specifying what you are charging him with?  What are you taking evidence about?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm saying I do not know what transpired and that the matter has to be investigated.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's what you think a Court Chamber is about, that you have no idea what has transpired and you want to call a witness before us to find out what transpired in that matter?  That's abusing the proceedings of this Court Chamber.  It's not what we are here to do.  

If you wish to formulate a charge you must formulate the charge in the proper manner and that is supported in the usual fashion, which will enable us to have a hearing and make appropriate findings of fact, after the person who has been charged has been notified of the accusation and has an opportunity to rebut it.  Mr. Hooper has said publicly that he does not know what are the complaints that have been made against him.  And he's asked just a few minutes ago that, presumably, you know, because you say you have spoken to the witnesses, and he invited you to state what are the allegations against him.  And you want to commence a hearing, a trial, without having specified what is the complaint that is being made?  That's not what we are here to do.
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't want to commence a hearing.  I'm responding to Your Honour's concern that there is no substantiation of any of these allegations.  It was not my intention to have a witness take the stand and detail what transpired in Butare.  It was my intention and I actually thought that what I did was place the issue before the Court and asked for the Court's guidance because it's a problem.  It's a problem for the witnesses and it's a problem for the Prosecution because several witnesses do not want to participate in this proceeding, because they feel intimidated.  Whether there is a reasonable basis for that or not is something the Court is going to have to determine.  But what they had said to OTP investigators contradicts what Mr. Hooper has said in his letter.  And Mr. Hooper's letter is not a sworn statement either.  So I came before the Court requesting guidance from the Trial Chamber on how we should proceed because it's a problem for these witnesses in particular.  I'm not suggesting it is appropriate to take their testimony on this issue, but it is appropriate for the Trial Chamber to think about the issue in relation to the process, the trial process as a whole.  It's not a question of Mr. Hooper's word against any other witness.  It is the process that is at stake.  This is an issue that has been -- first of all, in relation to the press conference, which was on the 26th of July, I became aware of it for the first time, I think, maybe ten days ago.  I was not aware when it transpired.  The letter that Mr. Hooper copied to the Chamber was not copied to the trial team.  I received this letter weeks later after it was supposedly sent out to the Prosecutor.  Information is developing --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you making an application for the Court for the moment.  Is there some action that -- or some order that you are inviting the Court to make, some action you want the Court to make.
MR. WEBSTER:
What I've stated before is I'm requesting guidance from the Court.  This is something that the OTP should investigate, and if OTP investigators should go and take these statements then we'll do that.  But if it is more appropriate for WVSS or for an independent entity to look into the matter, then we will do that.  And I think that's what I stated at the very beginning when I first addressed the Court.  On Friday at 4 o'clock when I sent that e-mail --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I still don't understand.  What is it you are asking for guidance investigating?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Whether this is something that should proceed as an OTP matter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, what is something, what?  
MR. WEBSTER:
The allegation or the counter-allegations between Mr. Hooper and the witnesses that appear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't know what the allegations are.  It is impossible to ask us to give you advice when we don't have information upon which to give advice.
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Hooper's letter, itself, detail allegations by two -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but Mr. Hooper's action was not addressed to us.
MR. WEBSTER:
It was copied to the Trial Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was copied to us, and it was not addressed to us and it did not require us to take any action.  And we have no intention to taking any action on it.  As I understand it, Mr. Hooper was inviting the Rwandan authorities to investigate an issue that took place in Rwanda and he has expressed his willingness to cooperate with such an investigation.  That did not require any action from this Trial Chamber, and we have no intention of taking any.
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, let me proceed, Your Honour.  The Court has enquired -- has requested that I respond to Mr. Hooper's questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, I don't request that.  I refer to the fact that he made those questions.  He said he does not know what is alleged, and he said it appears that you know.  Now, what I'm saying is that this issue, as far as I'm concerned, seems peripheral to what we are dealing with.  So I'm asking you, at the moment, apart from your request for guidance, was there any application you are making, any action you expected the Court to take, or any order that you thought is appropriate at this time?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  I'm asking the Court to direct WVSS or the registry to investigate the allegations made by Mr. Hooper in his letter that was copied to the Registrar and to interview the three witnesses that were supposed to have appeared at this press conference and to document Mr. Hooper's account and the accounts of the three witnesses and report back to the Trial Chamber, so the Trial Chamber can make a determination if the witness protection order of 10 December 2004 was violated in any way.  Those witnesses are HF, RO and ALW.  All three are protected witnesses.  HF testified during the last trial session.  RO testified in December of 2003.  She is still a protected witness.  She is not expected to testify in this proceeding but she testified previously and is still covered by a protection order.  ALW is here in Arusha and expected to testify this week.  My understanding is that all three witnesses were present on the 26th of July at this press conference that took place in Kigali.  Another witness, GIO -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I do not think that that application is appropriate to be made orally.  I think if you make an application of that nature you should file a motion and have supporting evidence.  I don't see how we could address that in this manner at this moment.  I don't think we could address that in this manner at this moment.  I don't see how we could respond with an order to something presented in this way.  So I would think that this is appropriate for a written motion that should be addressed to the Chamber.  That would be my suggestion.
MR. WEBSTER:
We will follow up with a written motion, Your Honour, but that is going to require us, the OTP, OTP investigators, to take statements from these witnesses, which is something I was trying to get some feedback from the Trial Chamber on, but we will proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber cannot give you advice when we don't know what the matter is based on.  We have not got sufficient information to give a legal opinion or judicial response.  It's a simple position.  I saw Mr. Hooper's request that the matter be investigated by Rwanda, and that was an isolated peripheral issue, as far as I was concerned.  I did not see its direct bearing.  I did not see its direct connection to the trial.  So that was an issue, as I see, to be addressed by Rwanda, by Rwandan authorities.  

Now, I don't understand exactly what is the connection to our trial here, unless you are saying that there was a violation of the witness protection order.  That is what the complaint is.  Then I would think that the complaint would be presented in a motion with supporting evidence.  Now, picking up between what you are saying, it seems to me that is what you want to allege but you're not sure if you have sufficient material to justify making the allegation.  But we cannot advise you on that.  And if you don't have a factual basis to make any application, you cannot do it.  If you have a factual basis for making the application, then you should do it.  I don't know what I can say.  But I'm not inviting you to go on a fishing expedition.  And I'm -- really a matter before the Court, if you are not factually prepared to do so.  But that is a technical question which I think you should answer yourself.  Do you have a factual basis to make a complaint or not?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I will follow the Court's suggestion.  We'll file a motion in writing and we will accompany it with preliminary statements taken by the witnesses, and you should have that within a day or two.  My concern, and I think I stated it before, but I don't think we are quite in agreement, is that the issue for us is whether this should be something that is undertaken by the Prosecutor or an independent entity.  And rather than proceeding to document this from the OTP as a party in the proceedings, I was hoping get some suggestion from the Court that a more appropriate way to proceed would be to bring it to the attention or have WVSS be mandated to investigate it.  But I will do as Your Honour has suggested.  We will present -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can apply to the Court to direct a WVSS investigation or registry investigation, if you think that is appropriate.  But at the same time we would need a factual basis to justify making such an order.  So, if -- I'm not at this stage telling you that you should  proceed one way or the other.  What I'm saying is that we do not have material that should enable us to express a reasoned opinion on any of these issues.  If you consider that it is appropriate for the matter to be investigated by an independent authority, and you present us with some background information which will enable us to exercise our discretion, then we will exercise our discretion.  But I don't think that what happened in court this morning and what is happening now provides any basis to enable the Court to express a reasoned opinion.  That's what I'm saying.
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand.  We were not seeking a reason -- well, I'll simply conclude there and we will submit something in writing and take it from there. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Hooper, is there anything you wish to say before we rise?  I think we should take just a short break before we start the hearing testimony.
MR. HOOPER:
I'll restrain myself.  There are other matters there that I would like to raise, as I appreciated that Mr. Webster was going to say something.  I hadn't quite appreciated what.  There's a number of matters -- I'm sorry, some of them are almost petty housekeeping -- but they need to be addressed.  

The first one is this.  I need leave of this Chamber granting permission for the commandant of the UNDF, detention centre that is, to release to me, David Hooper, the Accused's, André Rwamakuba's passport, number 044245, I've got the details here and, indeed, I've composed a short note or letter of direction from the Chamber which reads:  "Leave has been sought by David Hooper, Defence counsel in this case, to be provided the custody of the Accused's passport number"-- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, slowly, slowly.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I'll read it again.  "Leave has been sought," it reads "by David Hooper, Defence counsel in this case, to be provided the custody of the Accused's passport, number 044245, for the purpose of delivering it to the Prosecutor for inspection.  Such leave has been granted by the Trial Chamber."  I anticipate, "We understand that the passport is presently in your possession.  Please provide Mr. Hooper with a passport on his undertaking to return it to you once the inspection has taken place."  And that's addressed to Mr. Saidou Guindo, who is the commandant of the UNDF.  Can I pass that up to Mr. Fry, please?  It may be that more appropriate wording may be thought necessary but I hope that assists.  

The Prosecution have asked me to obtain this document which contains the details of the Accused's purported stay in Belgium from September to March '93-'94.  So that's the relevance of the document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Leave granted.
MR. HOOPER:
The second matter relates to the Prosecutor's duties of disclosure, which, as the Chamber may be aware, I have felt, for some time, has been dealt with in an inappropriate and negligent manner.  When I saw the Accused last week he handed me a redacted witness statement, statement of a witness named RX.  I assume that he obtained this from another co-accused or some other source, probably within the detention facility.  It was a redacted statement.  He gave no details of the witness whose statement it was.  But what it read, to my concern, was a detailed account of events in Butare hospital in which this witness, RX, claimed to have been for three weeks during the relevant period that concerns this Chamber.  It's obvious that this witness was specifically asked about André Rwamakuba because he stated in it, "I've never heard of André Rwamakuba."  I have seen another statement or two statements relating to Gikomero.  I don't touch on those now.  But I take this statement RX and I can produce it and show it to the Chamber if it's not (sic) necessary as an example of a statement that is plainly a Prosecution statement.  Plainly should have been served  on the Defence under its duties of disclosure, and it hasn't been.  I feel it is the tip of an iceberg.  The very existence of this statement, unserved on the Defence, suggests that there has been an ineffective review of material available to the Prosecutor.  I know that in cases before the ICTY, one particular case, where Judge Humptver (phonetic) ordered the Prosecutor to conduct a review of his disclosure responsibilities and available material and to personally certify that that had been done.  I request that that be done here.  I don't want to find myself -- nor would this Chamber want the Defence to find itself -- in a year or two's time, if it ever came to that, suddenly finding that there was, in fact, material such as this statement RX which could, in fact, in itself, found an argument from this trial.  It's that significant.  Witness RX's statement could not exist in the Prosecutor's file without being discovered on a search.  It has the name André Rwamakuba within it.  It has the name Butare university hospital in it.  It has the dates within it.  And it has been served in another case; I don't know which one.  It may be the Butare trial.  So I raise that concern, and I anticipate it's a concern that should be shared by the Chamber.  And I state again that if the Chamber wishes to see this document it can.  I've got it here today.  And it suggests that there has not been appropriate disclosure.  

Can I move on to another matter?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
Talking to witnesses, Defence witnesses, I have become aware of their concerns and their sense of vulnerability, particularly if they live within Rwanda.  This is a real and not a contrived concern.  I need to seek a protective measure order in respect of the superiority of Defence witnesses or potential witness and I merely at this stage ask the Court whether you want me to proceed by way of a written motion or whether it would be sufficient for me to ask and to obtain today, by oral motion the following:  That is to say a protective measures order for the security of such Defence witnesses as are nominated by the Defence in the same terms as the protective witness order that has been extended to Prosecution witnesses.  This would effectively mean that they would have the protection of the pseudonym and the protection of WVS and, in addition, that their unredacted statements would not be served on the Prosecution until 30 days before it is expected that they would be giving evidence.  

The, I think, final matter that I wish to -- or penultimate matter that I wish to raise is this:  My understanding is today that the Prosecution are calling this week -- and in this order -- these witnesses:  Witness GIO, Witness ALW, Witness RJ -- or TM as she's otherwise known -- and Witness XV.  I really state that because that would be the basis of my preparation.  

The final matter is this:  When I arrived in Court today I received a will-say statement for Witness GO, who's the witness who's proposed to be called this morning.  It's a page and a half of text, and I don't know if the Chamber, itself, has received it.  I should think it probably has because I think the chamber is getting all the documents.  It's a radically different account to any account that she's given before today.
(Pages 1 to 14 by Rex. Lear)


















1000H
MR. HOOPER:
And I'm concerned and I have reservations as to whether I'd be in a position to conduct a cross-examination of this witness, given this document.  If I'd had earlier notice of it, then, of course, I could have tended to that yesterday in my preparation.  But having only just got it, I -- and it being so radically different, I really feel I should be given and, indeed, asked for the opportunity to conduct my cross-examination of this witness tomorrow.  Having said that, there would be some part, I'm sure, of my questioning that could probably take up much of the time -- I see it's already five past 10:00 -- that would be left anyway after she's given her evidence.  So I won't -- I won't say -- or ask, I should say, with respect, that you give me leave to conduct all my cross-examination tomorrow, but if I get into difficulties because of the different narrative that I've been presented with, I hope the Court will oblige me to that extent.  

The only other matter is a housekeeping matter.  My legal assistant, Miss Pouplard, is travelling here today.  She couldn't get here before today.  I hadn't realised our dependency on her, but the result is that there's considerable housekeeping difficulties -- I won't use "housekeeping"; that sounds rather sexist and trivialising  -- there are significant functional difficulties within the team in her absence, documents and translations and things which I thought had been done.  But between adjourning here four weeks ago and conducting inquiries in Rwanda and going back and coming here and the rest of it, I'm afraid there's a bit of disarray on this team.  We travel, as you know, like the snail with our house on our back, and I'm afraid there's been some disruption.  So I just sort of mention that in order not to surprise you perhaps later and earn your displeasure without notice, as it were.  So those are the matters that I wish to raise.  

Oh, there's one other matter.  I knew there was, and I'd forgotten about it.  Witness XV who I understand is the last witness before to be called, I received through the post and received last week and read last week, for the first time, pages XV90 and 91 in your bundles, which I understand you've been served with.  In July 2003, XV was party to a confirmation process with the investigator.  I'd received that notice -- or certificate, rather, of the confirmation process having taken place, but I didn't receive pages 90 and 91, which are a radical -- extremely radical alteration in XV's evidence.  I requested a week ago the Prosecution to furnish me with details of when, if ever, that document, that statement, was served on the Defence, and I've had no reply.  I note that there's no specific allegations, in fact, in the indictment, relating to this.  I also note that there's no English translation of the document.  All of which suggest to me that this has been recently stumbled upon by the Prosecution.  It was served rather oddly in a bundle of documents which had been previously served, so much so that I almost didn't read them.  But buried in the bundle was pages 90 and 91.  

The Chamber will know that we have been, I hope, diligently pursuing our inquiries in this case.  It's, therefore, of concern if I'm right and this is not a document that's been previously served, and on that assumption, that it's not a mistake on the part of the Defence, but on the basis that this is a late serving of a document that was missed by the Prosecution, it's meant that all our diligent inquiries have not focused on the relevant aspects of this new perspective on this witness's evidence.  How radical that is I can say in this way.  Until I had sight of this, pages 90 and 91, Witness XV had never, in his statements to the Prosecution, made any reference to Dr. André Rwamakuba.  We've had no time to prepare.  It's in breach of the basic 30-day rule, and the Defence may be in difficulties in approaching this witness's testimony as a result.  So that's another matter that I'd signpost at this point.  

The Defence will do its best to assist the Chamber, and we're anxious to conclude this session.  It may be that, in effect, what I'd be asking the Chamber is for leave to recall the witness if that becomes necessary in the future.  

In respect of allegations made by witnesses concerning this team, that may be a similar position -- or, rather, I should say, our position would be, I think, similar, that we reserve or may reserve -- and we indicate this -- a wish to make an application to recall witnesses which would then have to be reviewed in the light of the circumstances pertaining at the time that that application is made, but I don't make any application at the moment.  Those are my applications and mentions, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Prosecutor, do you wish to respond to any of these comments?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Only partially, Your Honour, I think for the last portion of Mr. Hooper's submission, we'd like to come back to that perhaps tomorrow because I don't have the bundle in front of me.  I'm not sure what he's referring to when he refers to page 90 and 91 of XV's statements.  So if we could address that either later on today or tomorrow, I'll have a response to that.  

But in regard to the disclosure regime, what Mr. Hooper has mentioned should demonstrate to the Court how radically different we see Rule 68, because simply going on -- basing my response on what he has said in open court  -- I don't have RX's statement in front of me.  I don't know who that witness is.  But if in that witness statement there's a sentence, "I've never heard of André Rwamakuba," it defies my conception of what is exculpatory material.  To suggest that somehow we have not complied with Rule 68, because that statement has not been served, clearly -- and I'm just basing my submission on what Mr. Hooper says is in the statement.  If a witness says he doesn't know André Rwamakuba, how could that possibly be exculpatory?  Some of the witnesses that have testified in this trial and that have identified, or that will identify André Rwamakuba, did not know him at the time.  And if this witness was asked if he knew André Rwamakuba and said "no," it stands to reason that he would not have been able to say that he was not present at Butare University Hospital or that he was present.  So this is not a statement that falls within Rule 68, as I understand it.  

The plenary of this Tribunal decided to amend Rule 68 and to make it more expansive by requesting that the Prosecutor make available relevant material in electronic form, and we've done that.  We'd created an EDS, and Mr. Hooper has signed on to the EDS.  And he would know, if he looks, if he's consulted it, that when you put in the name "André Rwamakuba" or the name of any one of our accused, a large volume of materials come up, including witness statements.  

I can't say, standing here before you today, that RX's statement is in the EDS, but our objective is to make sure that all statements from all witnesses are in the EDS, redacted, but certainly the name of André Rwamakuba would not be redacted.  And if it's in there, it's something that Mr. Hooper can discover on his own and use it to his best advantage, but it is not an exculpatory statement within the meaning of Rule 68, I think, it's A.  

As for the order of witnesses, my understanding is that we begin with GIO.  We continue with ALW.  And as for RJ and XV, I will allow my colleague Ms. Fall to comment on their respective orders, but in terms of our preparation to begin this session, certainly GIO is waiting to be called, and ALW is right behind her.  

As for the witness protection motion for the Defence, this seems to be such a contentious issue, the whole notion of what is the appropriate standard of witness protection and non-interference into the privacy of witnesses, I would think that this is a motion that should be made in writing.  We made a motion in writing.  The Court granted it and has -- has even modified it.  And to me it's wholly inappropriate to make an application orally, particularly in light of the discussion that we had this morning.  If there's anything that should be in writing, it should be a Defence motion for witness protection.  So I'd invite the Court to ask the Defence to submit the motion in writing, and then we'll respond to it at that point.  And then the Court can have a more relaxed environment in which to consider it and to appropriate -- to issue the appropriate protective measures.  

I don't have the Court's protective order of December 10th in front of me.  Maybe that covers Defence witnesses.  I'm not sure if it's directed only to Prosecution witnesses, but that's a matter that can be discussed at another time, or we can look at the Defence motion in writing if one arrives.  

And for, as I said, XV, my understanding is that we have complied with our disclosure requirements.  All the Rule 66 statements were served on a timely basis.  I will go back and look at the issue that Mr. Hooper has raised, but as a preliminary matter -- preliminary response, my understanding is that we fully complied with the disclosure.  And if he received these statements for the first time in a bundle, that doesn't make it any less compliance with Rule 66.  It was Mr. Hooper's insistence on these bundles that gave rise to them in the first place.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
If I may, Mr. President, just counter-respond in respect of one matter, the statement RXI that I have, which Mr. Webster says he cannot for the moment consider falls within Rule 68, is a statement of a man who says that on the 13th of April, he's taken to the University Hospital; and he stays there from that date for three weeks; and he sees soldiers come to look for and take away Tutsis.  And he goes on about that, and he says he saw them taking them from their beds.  He says, "I did not hear anyone talk about André Rwamakuba during my stay at the hospital."  Now, for Mr. Webster to say that that does not fall within the criteria that he's obliged to release documents upon is probably the strongest support for the submission that I made this morning that I can conceive of.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think I made it very clear in my submission that I did not have the statement in front of me and that I was relying on Mr. Hooper's characterisation of the statement during his first submission.  And to my ear, they're two very different submissions.  They're two very different characterisations, because that was not the statement.  The statement that Mr. Hooper just read into the record was not what he stated earlier.  So this is something that we'll look into, but I certainly cannot make a comment that's definitive now because the statement is not in front of me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say that when we were thinking about our schedule for this morning, we had imagined that we'd be more or less finished with GIO in chief at this time, but I think that it's probably appropriate that before we give our rulings on this matter and commence the testimony of GIO, that we should take a brief recess now.  So the Court will rise for a few minutes. 
(Court recessed at 1021H)
(Pages 15 to 18 by Wendy Molnar)








 

(Court resumed at 1101H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Our session resumes.  

In relation to the applications made by the Defence just before our recess, these are the orders that we think we should make at this time: 

With regard to the issue of protective measures for the Defence witnesses, it is appropriate for a written motion, including the information regarding the witnesses in relation to whom the request is -- is being made; and so we think that that should re -- procedurally should be addressed in that manner.  I don't know if time is an issue, but that's a matter which the Defence should address in their application, if necessary.  

With regard to the issue of Rule 68 disclosure of exculpatory matter, I think we should just make the comment that the existence of the electronic database be included by the Prosecutor.  It does not diminish the positive obligation which the Rules impose on the Prosecutor to disclose material subject -- pursuant to Rule 68.  However, I think that we should not make any order on this matter, as the Prosecutor is undertaking to enquire into this matter and report to the Chamber later today or tomorrow morning.  So we will wait until his report before making any order of this matter.  

With regard to Witness GIO, the only application the Defence has made is for time to cross-examine, but this is an obligation which we think should be addressed when the time arises, if necessary.  

I -- the only other issue that has been raised, as far as I -- my note is the matter regarding to       Witness XV; and in relation to that matter as well, I understood that the Prosecutor undertook to provide some information today or -- later today or tomorrow, so we don't think it's necessary for us to address this at this point in time.  

Mr. Hooper, did we exclude any matter?  
MR. HOOPER:
No, you've dealt with all the matters, Mr. President.  Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, Mr. Prosecutor, we think it's time to call the Witness GIO, unless there is any other matter to be addressed.  

MR. WEBSTER:
No, we -- there is no other matter that we need to address at this time.  My colleague Iain Morley will be conducting GIO. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Registrar.  Mr. Registrar, would you assist the witness with her headphone, please.

Good morning, Madam Witness.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for coming to give testimony in these proceedings.  The registrar will now, as is customary, invite you to take an oath to tell the truth.
(Declaration made by Witness GIO in Kinyarwanda)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now the Prosecutor will ask you questions which you must answer to the Court in accordance with the oath you've taken.  

Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honour's leave, may I begin by mentioning that at the moment, I'm not sure what channel I have the simultaneous translation from Kinyarwandan.  I've just been going through the channels as the witness was swearing the oath, and I cannot, at the moment, find the channel which simultaneously translates the Kinyarwandan into English.  May I just enquire of my learned friends if they can help me, whether they know what number channel they think I should be on? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I'm completely impressed.  I was unaware of your familiarity with the language.
MR. MORLEY:
I do my best, your Honour, but Kinyarwandan hasn't yet been something I've learned.  My learned friend, Mr. Hooper, has helpfully indicated channel 2, and this machine is not working.  Would            Your Honour just allow me a moment?  

Mr. Hooper says 3.  Mr. O'Shea says 1. 
MR. O'SHEA:
But 1 is very noisy.  I don't know --

MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if I begin, Your Honour, and I'll see what happens. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, could we get assistance from the booth, please? 
Could we have assistance from the booth?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, yes, I believe I did hear the witness speaking in English on channel 1.  Maybe the booth can confirm that, the English booth, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can you hear the booth, English booth?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, thank you.  Thank you very much. 
WITNESS GIO,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm going to be asking you some questions about what happened in Rwanda in 1994.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I understand, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	But before I do so, I'm going to ask that this a document is put in front of you so that you can see it, and I would like you to read it to yourself and not say anything about what you are reading from it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm handing to the witness the personal details of the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you have a document in front of you that you can look at?  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And I would like you to look at that document, and can you confirm for me that the document contains your name?  Don't tell us what your name is, but can you confirm that it contains your name? 
A.	Yes, sir, my name is on that document. 
Q.	Does the document also contain your year of birth? 
A.	Yes, I can see my year of birth on the document. 
Q.	Does it also contain the names of your parents?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, forgive me.  It doesn't.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can I ask you, does the document contain your current occupation? 
A.	Yes, my current occupation is contained in the document. 
Q.	Does it also contain your present address by cellule, secteur, commune, and préfecture?
A.	Yes, all that information features on the document. 
Q.	Does it also contain the cellule, secteur, commune, and préfecture of where you were born? 
A.	Yes, the document contains that information. 
Q.	And, finally, does the document contain the cellule, secteur, commune, and préfecture where you were in April 1994? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Will you now please sign the document?  And if it hasn't been dated already, can you date it for us as well?  Thank you.  
A.	Can you remind me what date it is today?
Q.	Today's date, I think, is -- 
A.	I am asking for the date of today. 
MR. MORLEY:
I don't think it's in dispute to lead on the date today.  The 22nd of August.

May I ask that the document is shown to my learned friend defending and then to His Honour and 
His Honour's colleagues?  Thank you.  

May I ask that the document is given the appropriate prosecution exhibit number and entered into evidence under seal, please?  
MR. MJUI:  
The document will be P. 59, Your Honour.
(Exhibit No. P. 59 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
You may proceed.  
MR. MORLEY:  
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	In 1994, were you living in the Butare préfecture? 
A.	Yes, I was living there. 
Q.	By April of 1994, did you have any children? 
A.	Yes, I had children. 
Q.	In April of 1994, how old was your eldest child? 
A.	He was seven years of age. 
Q.	Did you have any other children? 
A.	In 1994 I had three children, and at the time, I was pregnant with the fourth child. 
Q.	In dealing with the youngest of the three children, was that child an infant that you carried or older than that? 
A.	Are you referring to the eldest child?  I don't quite understand your question.  Or -- you were talking about the last child.  I don't know exactly which child you're referring to. 
Q.	In relation to the youngest of the three children, was that child an infant or -- 
A.	Concerning that child, that is a child that I used to carry on my back at the time. 
Q.	Thank you.  In April of 1994, did you have any brothers? 
A.	Yes, I had brothers. 
Q.	Do you recall the day when, sadly, the president of Rwanda died in a plane crash in 1994? 
A.	We learned of the death of the president over the radio, and that was during the night of the 6th.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is the night of the 6th through the 7th, said the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can you help us whether there came a time in the area in which you were living when events began which you will be able to tell us about? 
A.	On the night which President Habyarimana died, nothing happened to us at that moment, but subsequently there were incidents that occurred. 
Q.	When did the incidents begin to occur, can you remember, after the 6th of April of 1994? 
A.	At my place of residence, nothing abnormal happened at that locality, but we heard that houses were being burned in the Gikongoro préfecture . But as concerns our locality, nothing abnormal happened following the death of the president. 
Q.	Did there come a time when anything abnormal began to happen in your locality?  And, if so, approximately when was that? 
A.	Around the 20th, that is when we were the subject of attacks, and I'm talking about the locality of where I used to reside at the time.  
Q.	On around the 20th, what sort of attacks were you the subject of? 
A.	It was the 20th.  First there were soldiers who were wearing helmets who came, and we took refuge in a sorghum farm.  So what I'm talking about happened during the night of the 20th.
Q.	When you say "we" sought refuge in a sorghum farm, what ethnicity was the group that sought refuge in the sorghum farm? 
A.	We all fled, and all ethnic groups were amongst those who were fleeing; but subsequently, we learned that the Tutsis were those who were targeted. 
Q.	What was happening to the Tutsis from the 20th of April? 
A.	First of all there were gunshots that were fired, and then the members of the population carried out attacks using sharp objects. 
Q.	And what would happen to the people who were attacked with gunshots or sharp objects?  
A.	People were asked to produce their identity cards, and when it was noted that you were a Tutsi, you were shot at or you were attacked with sharp objects. 
Q.	Did anything happen to any one of your brothers?  Don't give us any names, but did anything happen to any one of your brothers? 
A.	When we were in the sorghum field, my brother was assaulted and was wounded with a bladed weapon. 
Q.	Now, with the assistance of the other helpful usher, could you be given a piece of paper and a pencil, and could you write down the name of your brother, please?  I don't want you to mention his name in court, but if you could write his name down, please.  Perhaps if I might see that, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if my learned friend may see it and then Your Honours. 

Thank you.  Now perhaps if the witness might have that document back, because there may be other names to write on it shortly.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Where was your brother injured with the bladed instrument? 
A.	He was injured, wounded, on his arm. 
Q.	After he was wounded on his arm, where did he go? 
A.	It was necessary to take him to hospital. 
Q.	Which hospital? 
A.	To the university hospital. 
Q.	University of which town? 
A.	At Butare university. 
Q.	Who took him to the hospital? 
A.	We went there together with the children and a wounded person. 
Q.	When you got to the hospital with your brother, how was he treated at first at the hospital? 
A.	When we reached the hospital, he was admitted, and he was given a transfusion or some intravenous thing, and his wound was treated and other things he needed. 
Q.	Was he given a bed? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, he was. 
Q.	Can you recall now the approximate date when you went to the Butare hospital with your wounded brother? 
A.	I do not remember the exact date, but it must have been after the 22nd or 23rd. It was around that time. 
Q.	For clarity, are we talking about April of 1994? 
A.	Yes, in April. 
Q.	Did there come a time when something happened to your brother at the hospital? 
A.	At one point, I don't remember which day, five or six doctors arrived on the spot. 
Q.	Just pause there.  Thank you.
Can you help us with how long after your brother had arrived around the 22nd or 23rd of April that the five or six doctors came to the hospital? 
A.	I think it was perhaps two days later, two days after we had arrived at the hospital. 
Q.	Can you tell us the names of any of the doctors who arrived at the hospital, please? 
A.	I saw Dr. Gatera, whom I already knew, and then there was Dr. Rwamakuba. I'll give you their names in chronological order, in the order in which they arrived.  Then there was a Dr. Pascal and then Dr. Twagirayezu and another person known as Athanase Habimana, although I'm not sure of his surname.  And that person, anyhow, was, rather, someone in charge of the cleaning at the hospital. 
Q.	Thank you.  Having mentioned five names, were there any other people who arrived with those five people at the hospital? 
A.	There were, but I didn't know them.  But the people who did know them told me that they were Interahamwe accompanying those people.  
Q.	Who did you understand the Interahamwe were?  What were they about? 
A.	Some of them were local inhabitants.  There were also soldiers.  There were all sorts of people. 
Q.	Can you help Their Honours with approximately how many Interahamwe and soldiers arrived at the hospital with the four doctors and Athanase? 
A.	There weren't many soldiers.  I could see some uniformed soldiers standing near the patients, but I'm not -- I couldn't tell exactly how many there were. 
Q.	And approximately how many Interahamwe were there who arrived on the scene? 
A.	They were in civilian clothes.  I couldn't tell how many there were. 
Q.	Well, can you help with whether there were less than five, more than five, more than 10?  Give us some idea.  
A.	There were more than five. 
Q.	Well, there being more than five, do you think there was less than 10?  Less than 20?  Less than what number? 
A.	Inasmuch as on that occasion my brother was killed practically as soon as they arrived, I did not have the stomach -- I did not have the heart to pay attention to what was going on and therefore cannot number the people. 
Q.	How did you know that one of the doctors was  Dr. Rwamakuba? 
A.	I learned of it subsequently. 
Q.	Do you remember the person from whom you learned that one of the doctors was Dr. Rwamakuba?  Do you remember that person's name or part of their name? 
A.	Yes, I do remember that person who told me Rwamakuba's name. 
Q.	Can you please write down on the piece of paper in front of you whatever you can remember of that person's name? 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps with the assistance of the other helpful usher, I could see the document, and then my learned friend, and then Their Honours, please.  Thank you.  Perhaps if the document might go back to the witness, may I just ask an additional question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Have you written down the person's first name or have you written down their surname? 
A.	It is the surname. 
Q.	Can you write down the first name, if you know it, please?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Perhaps if I might see the document, please.  

If you might just hand that to my learned friends defending.

Perhaps if the document might go back to the witness, please.  
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	You've told us that you learned the name of Dr.  Rwamakuba from that person subsequently.  Can you 
help us with what you mean by "subsequently"?  Did you learn the name on the occasion -- wait for the question, please.  Did you learn the name on the occasion that the doctor attended that evening, or was it on some other date?  
A.	I learned of his name during that night we have been talking about. 
Q.	Were you told the first name of Dr. Rwamakuba? 
A.	They said that it was Dr. André Rwamakuba.  There were people who knew him who said that. 
Q.	All right.  Now, if I may, I'm going to turn to the events which occurred that evening when the doctors arrived with the Interahamwe.  Can you help us with where your brother was when the doctors arrived? 
A.	He was in the surgical ward in bed number 2. 
Q.	Where did the doctors go when they went into the hospital? 
A.	They came in through the surgical ward. 
Q.	When they were in the surgical ward, what did they do regarding the patients in the beds? 
A.	They began with the first patient in bed number 1, asked him for his ID card, saw that he was Hutu, returned his ID card to him.  It was Rwamakuba who was asking to see the ID cards.  And they went on to my -- the bed my brother was in.  They saw that he was Tutsi, and it was Dr.  Gatera who killed him with a hatchet.  The next patient was a girl. 
Q.	You've been very helpful in giving us a lot of information there.  If I may, I want to take it in a little bit of -- little -- in stages.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	At the first bed, who asked for identification? 
A.	Dr. Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Was the person in the first bed identified as a Hutu or as a Tutsi or something else? 
A.	He saw that the person was Hutu and returned his ID card to him. 
Q.	Did anything happen to the Hutu in the first bed? 
A.	No.  He stayed on his bed, and nothing happened to him. 
Q.	Was your brother's identification asked for as he lay in bed number 2? 
A.	Yes.  Rwamakuba came and asked him for his ID card. 
Q.	Did you see this? 
A.	Yes, I witnessed it. 
Q.	How far away from your brother's bed were you when you saw Rwamakuba ask for your brother's identification? 
A.	I was a bit back from the bed in which my brother was lying.  There were three beds between us, if I'm not mistaken.  I cannot tell you how many yards exactly or metres, but it was quite close to where my brother was.  
Q.	Did your brother give his identification to Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes.  He held out his ID card using the arm that had not been wounded. 
Q.	Did his identification card say whether he was a Tutsi or a Hutu? 
A.	On his ID card, it was stated that he belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group. 
Q.	What did Rwamakuba do with your brother's identification card? 
A.	He gave the ID card to Athanase, who passed it on in turn to Gatera. 
Q.	Did Rwamakuba say anything when he passed the identification card of your brother to Athanase? 
A.	He said that my brother was an Inkotanyi. 
Q.	How old was your brother? 
A.	He was born in 1954. 
Q.	So he would have been around 40; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  You can calculate his age arithmetically. 
Q.	Now, having said that your brother was an Inkotanyi and passed the identification document to Athanase, who you told us passed it to Gatera, what did Gatera do? 
A.	Gatera grabbed a hatchet and struck him, struck my brother with the hatchet, struck his head, my brother's head, with the hatchet. 
Q.	Where did the hatchet come from? 
A.	The doctor had the hatchet -- was carrying it at his waist. 
Q.	Which doctor? 
A.	Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	Was anything said to your brother before he was struck on the head with an axe by Dr. Gatera? 
A.	He was simply told that he was an Inkotanyi and therefore had to die.  
Q.	How quickly did this happen?  Did your brother get an opportunity to explain himself or anything like that? 
A.	Within 30 minutes, all the people who had been -- who were targeted had been arrested. 
Q.	I'm sorry, you haven't understood my question.  
When Dr. Rwamakuba said your brother was an Inkotanyi, passed the identification card to Athanase, who then passed it to Gatera, who then struck your brother on the head with the axe, what I'm asking is, how quickly did this happen?  Was there a debate, an argument?  Did your brother have an opportunity to say anything?  Give us some idea of the speed or slowness with which this happened.  
A.	There was no -- strange, I don't know if he died immediately or not.  All I know is that he was struck with a hatchet.
Q.	How far away was Dr. Rwamakuba from Dr. Gatera when Dr. Gatera struck your brother with an axe?
A.	They were close to each other. 
Q.	When you say "close," how far away from your brother was Rwamakuba?  Give us some idea of distance.  Was he by his bed?  Was he by the wall?  Was he in another room?  What? 
A.	He was standing beside my brother. 
(Pages 19 to 28 by Jean Whalen)


























1200H 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Your brother having been struck with an axe on the head by Gatera, how did Rwamakuba react?  Did he say anything?  Did he express surprise?  Did he protest or what did he do? 
A.	Dr. Rwamakuba asked for a girl's identity card who was standing by my brother. 
Q.	All right, we will come to the girl.  You have mentioned the girl, where was the girl that you have told us about? 
A.	The girl was on bed No. 3. 
Q.	Was that girl Tutsi or Hutu, can you tell us? 
A.	She was Tutsi because her identification card was taken away from her. 
Q.	Can you remember where she was from? 
A.	She was a native of Gikongoro, according to what was said. 
Q.	Approximately, how old was she? 
A.	She was aged between 15 and 20 years. 
Q.	Who asked for her identification? 
A.	Dr. Rwamakuba is the person who asked for the papers. 
Q.	What happened to her identification papers? 
A.	Dr. Rwamakuba held her identification papers and referred to her as an Inyenzi. 
Q.	Having asked and that she was an Inyenzi, what happened to her? 
A.	She (sic) asked her to stand up. 
Q.	Did she stand up? 
A.	He asked her to get up. 
Q.	Well, did she get up?  Did she stand up or what? 
A.	She got up and at that very moment Dr. Gatera struck her but I was unable to tell if she died of the blow or not. 
Q.	Pause there.  Where did Dr. Gatera strike her? 
A.	Dr. Gatera struck her on the head. 
Q.	What did he strike her with? 
A.	She struck her with an axe. 
Q.	As a result of striking her with an axe, describe what physically happened to her? 
A.	I left immediately thereafter because people were being killed. 
Q.	Where did you go when you say you left? 
A.	I proceeded to the maternity. 
Q.	From where you were at the maternity section, did you see Rwamakuba doing anything else at the hospital? 
A.	They brought those people they had killed; put them in a vehicle that was parked near the maternity ward. 
Q.	Let's just pause there.  Can you describe the vehicle, please? 
A.	It was a pick-up. 
Q.	Can you describe its colour, can you remember? 
A.	It was a red pick-up. 
Q.	Who had arrived in that pick-up truck a little earlier? 
A.	There was Dr. Rwamakuba, many Interahamwe and Dr. Gatera, as well as the persons who had to load the corpses. 
Q.	Did you see any corpses loaded into that pick-up truck? 
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness to that. 
Q.	Did you see what happened to your brother? 
A.	We did not see my brother any more, which means that he was killed. 
Q.	Having been struck on the head with an axe in the head, did you see what happened to his body? 
A.	I wasn't able to tell what happened to him because subsequently they were put in a vehicle. 
Q.	Did you see your brother put in the vehicle? 
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness to that. 
Q.	When he was put in the vehicle, was he carried or did he walk there? 
A.	They were carried. 
Q.	Who carried them, what sort of people? 
A.	People who were accompanied by Dr. Rwamakuba and other Interahamwe. 
Q.	How many bodies did you see put in the pick-up truck? 
A.	Well, there were many corpses. 
Q.	Can you tell us from what you saw, how many corpses were carried from the hospital to the pick-up truck? 
A.	I am not in a position to tell the precise number because there were many other people who were still alive, who were also loaded into the pick-up but who never returned or came back. 
Q.	Please listen to my question carefully.  We will talk about people who were alive, who went into the pick-up truck in a moment.  I am asking you, how many bodies did you, yourself, see carried from the hospital to the pick-up truck? 
A.	I do not recall the number of corpses but I did see them. 
Q.	From where you were at the maternity section, did you see Rwamakuba inspecting any other identification documents? 
A.	I saw him again when he was standing near the pick-up.  He had a metal object that he was wearing on his belt and with that object, he was hitting people who were climbing into the vehicle. 
Q.	What sort of people were climbing into the vehicle? 
A.	There were men and young persons. 
Q.	How had they been selected to get into the vehicle? 
A.	It is from their identification papers that they were selected. 
Q.	Who selected them? 
A.	Dr. Rwamakuba is the one who selected them. 
Q.	Did you see that? 
A.	I saw it with my own eyes. 
Q.	How many people approximately still living were made to get into the pick-up truck? 
A.	There was a certain Boneface or Boniface.
Q. 	I am sorry, it seems that there has been a misunderstanding about the question, I will repeat it.  How many people, as an approximate number, were made to get into the pick-up truck? 
A.	There were many people, in particular men, and the pick-up was full. 
Q.	Where had the bodies been placed? 
A.	They were saying that they were taking the bodies to Kabakobwa. 
Q.	Specifically, the bodies from the hospital had been placed where?  I am not talking about the people who were still alive, in the pick-up; I am talking about the bodies that came out of the hospital.  Remind us, where were they placed? 
A.	The bodies were loaded into the truck, but I do not know exactly where they were buried. 
Q.	Is that the same truck that the people still living were being loaded? 
A.	In the second round, those who were still living were put in the car, and I learnt that they were taken to Kabakobwa. 
Q.	It maybe that there's a translation problem about the difference between bodies and people.  It's a very small point, but just to complete the picture.  You have described the pick-up truck.  You have described living people, being made to get into the pick-up truck.  You have described dead people being carried to a vehicle.  My question is simple, were the dead people taken to a different vehicle or was it the same vehicle that the living people were being made to get into? 
A.	That red vehicle was used several times at the hospital.  That vehicle made several rounds at the hospital. 
Q.	Was there any other vehicle transporting Tutsis alive or dead? 
A.	I only saw that vehicle at the hospital. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time when you ran away from the maternity section? 
A.	I had to flee because I heard people say that Rwamakuba was giving instructions to the effect that women be raped. 
Q.	Who did you hear say that Rwamakuba had given instructions that women could be raped? 
A.	I heard it from Athanase. 
Q.	Who was Athanase talking to or addressing when he said that Rwamakuba had said women could be raped? 
A.	I heard him say so. 
Q.	Please listen to the question.  It maybe a problem with translation.  I will start again.  Who was Athanase talking to when you heard him say that Rwamakuba had said women could be raped? 
A.	He was talking to those who were with me at the hospital. 
Q.	When you say "those who were with me at the hospital", what sort of people? 
A.	They were women. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I rise to my feet, with your leave, Mr. President.  There is no allegation or charge of rape in the indictment.  And it has not been indicated in the will-say that I received this morning that this witness was going to refer, in her testimony, to anything to do with rape.  So, I object to this line of questioning on relevance and on failure of notice.
MR. MORLEY: 
May I ask that the witness takes off her headphones.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, do you understand English?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not understand English, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  There's going to be a discussion at the moment which you should not participate in nor hear.  So, I am now asking you to take your headphones off.
MR. MORLEY: 
May I assist Your Honours and Your Honour's colleagues with the following observations.  It is right to say that there's no suggestion of rape in the Prosecution statement taken in September 1997.  However, when this witness gave evidence on a previous occasion in proceedings relating to Rwamakuba, which sadly, as Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues know, came to a rather abrupt halt before the trial was completed.  That occasion being the 10th of December of 2003, the witness did attempt to describe in evidence what happened to her just outside the hospital as she fled; supposedly on the orders of Rwamakuba.  It is right to say that the Trial Chamber, after hearing some argument, declined to hear further evidence on the allegation of rape because the Defence were not on notice.  However, it is my respectful submission that arising from the transcript of the 10th of December 2003, they have been on notice since then that this witness would give testimony of rape.  

Secondly, they are on notice, from what is marked paragraph 2, in the will-say statement which my learned friend has.  He has invited Your Honour to allow him some time, in any event, to consider the contents of the will-say statement.  And it may be that looking at the time, in any event, he will not be cross-examining today.  So, it is not a case where my learned friend is about to bind on a cross-examination in relation to rape.  And more fundamentally, it's my respectful submission that the Defence are on notice from the evidence which arose in December of 2003, when my learned friend himself was present defending Rwamakuba, that this witness would give testimony of rape.  The question which then arises -- if Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues take the point that disclosure is not a strong point for my learned friend, about relevance.  It's my respectful submission that allegations of rape as part of a genocide are probative of a genocide.  They do not necessarily fall into a separate category of charge.  And it is well known to the Trial Chamber that acts of genocide are not limited to acts of killing.  That the genocide is defined by the nature of an attack on an ethnic group.  An attack in which there is a widespread and systematic intent to destroy that group and methods of destruction can include, not simply killing, but also acts of personal violation designed to undermine the dignity of the ethnic group in question.  

It's well established before the Trial Chambers at this Tribunal that rape is a feature of genocide.  It is probative of genocide, and it manifests an intention to destroy the dignity of an ethnic group.  It's my respectful submission that rape is certainly relevant.  The question really, for Your Honours, is one of notice.  It's my respectful submission, my learned friend has notice from December 2003 and then the document which I filed --

	1230H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If an attempt was made to lead the evidence and it was disallowed -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
  What was it that they had notice from?  
MR. MORLEY:
They had no notice. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, precisely -- no, no, no.  No, you are saying that they had notice because an attempt was made to lead the evidence in December 2003, and the Court disallowed it.  So -- so, you have a situation where the Court said, "You can't do this.  This is not evidence before us."  What is it that you said constituted notice?
MR. MORLEY:
Well, during the proceedings in 2003, there was quite a lot of evidence given on the suggestion of rape before the objection was raised.  So, if I may start at the beginning, there was no notice on the part of the Defence.  They didn't know that this was coming, and that's probably why it took so long as the evidence emerged, one understandable and entirely proper objection to be taken at that stage.  

But as a consequence of what was said in Court, it was perfectly apparent to those defending that this witness would describe what happened to her outside the hospital as an act of rape in circumstances which she was saying that that had been ordered by Rwamakuba.  So, it might be that whilst the notice did not arise in a formal sense in the form of a statement being served or a will-say statement being served, nevertheless, actual notice arose in December of 2003.  I have sought through the documents which was prepared by me on Saturday, to put my learned friends on notice that what they knew had come out in December of 2003 was going to be led in evidence today.  I did make the attempt earlier today, and no doubt my learned friends would agree.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, when do you intend to lead this evidence?
MR. MORLEY:
Today. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you've formed this to lead this evidence today.
MR. MORLEY:
No, it was clear from the file that it was evidence that we would be leading. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Clear to who?  
MR. MORLEY:
To me as the person who was responsible for bringing the witness before the Tribunal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Even since 2003, you knew that?  
MR. MORLEY:
No, I wasn't here in 2003.  When I inherited this file, it was clear to me that the rape evidence was evidence that we would seek to lead.  So, the reasoning behind that is because of what transpired 
in 2003.  And I have -- I hope, not inappropriately, and sought by way of the will-say statement, to identify in paragraph 2 that aspect of the evidence which we are dealing with now, and if it helps at all -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see -- is the will-statement really a witness statement?  
MR. MORLEY:
It's not a witness statement in the strict sense.   Your Honour is right, it is -- it's a report of what a witness will say. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a report made by somebody who spoke to a witness.
MR. MORLEY:
That's right.  It is.  It's not a strict statement, but it nevertheless, arguably -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this is -- this is a -- isn't this sort of matter which should be part of a witness statement?  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't disagree with Your Honour.  In a -- an ideal world, I respectfully, entirely agree.  Your Honour and Your Honours' colleague will no doubt have the unhappy experience of will-say statements making appearance where my learned friend Mr. Hooper is perfectly, properly able to make observations about the lateness of notice, and the fact that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, in this particular case, the lateness issue is one issue.  Well, what is bothering me, you see, you've mentioned -- you've spoken of relevance as well.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, whereas it is quite sure that rape is a method by which the genocide could be committed -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Your Honour, could counsel off his microphone, because my colleagues aren't getting you sufficiently clearly?  Excuse me for interrupting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  My question was this:  Whereas what you've said about rape being a method by which genocide could be committed seems perfectly accurate to me, are you entitled to prove it as a method of genocide if it is not pleaded in the indictment?  Can you prove a method of genocide that's not pleaded?  
MR. MORLEY:
I would respectfully submit that we can, because it is relevant in supporting that which has been pleaded so that the evidence amounts to support for the allegation in the indictment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  I don't quite understand that, because that seems to be a shift of what you had said before.  You had said that rape was relevant because it was a method by which genocide could be committed.  So, my -- so that to me is something slightly different than saying rape supports something which was, in fact, pleaded, because this scenery is a different method of committing the crime.  Now, isn't that an issue which is required to be in the indictment, a new or additional or alternative method of committing the crime?  Isn't it required by law to be pleaded so the Defendant -- the Accused, could have notice of the nature and course of the charge against them?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour makes a powerful point.  My invitation to the Court is that whilst ideally and more legally, properly, the allegation of rape ought to be an amendment within the indictment since December of 2003, it can, nevertheless, be offered as a feature in the events which shows the methods by which genocide took place, and that as a method of genocide not pleaded, it nevertheless amounts to support for the methods of genocide pleaded.  It goes to weight and effectively, corroboration of the factual elements which are pleaded. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, there was an issue --I'm sorry, but I was going to ask you whether you have any jurisprudence to support that proposition?  
MR. MORLEY:
None at all, not to hand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I suspected that.  
MR. MORLEY: 
And if it helps Your Honour and Your Honours' colleagues, the argument doesn't give any better. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Mr. Hooper, did you wish to respond to what was just said?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Just to remind the Chamber that there was a count in relation to rape on the indictment that was withdrawn, and that is an effect of withdrawal of notice.  That seems the only matter I wish to add. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think this is an important issue.  We would like to retire for a few minutes to consider the issue.  The Court will rise for a few minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1241H to 1255H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we have considered the matter and have come to the conclusion that we should not allow this kind of questioning, both on grounds of relevance and on grounds of notice.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
One question, how much longer is your examination going to last?
MR. MORLEY:
About five minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you prefer to complete before the lunch break?
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, if you will allow it, I will finish with the witness now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sure.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Perhaps if she might put back on her headphones with the assistance of the usher.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Witness, can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you. 
Q.	I will not be asking you any questions about what happened to you outside the hospital.  Do you understand me? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	If I can take you back to what you saw in the hospital.  Firstly, did any of the people who were loaded on to the pickup truck, were they ever seen again? 
A.	No, apart from Boniface who came back, otherwise, I did not ever see again the people that were loaded on the pick-up truck. 
Q.	What did you understand had happened to them and where? 
A.	The people who were taken away on that pickup truck were all killed except for Boniface who escaped. 
Q.	And where do you understand they were murdered? 
A.	At Kabakobwa.  They were killed at Kabakobwa. 
Q.	Had you ever seen Dr. André Rwamakuba before that occasion? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Had you ever seen him since that occasion? 
A.	As I left that place, I never saw Dr. Rwamakuba again. 
Q.	Can you help us with what was it that Dr. Rwamakuba was carrying and using when he was making people get on to the pick-up truck? 
A.	He had a knife.  The knife one usually carries at on one's belt -- at one's belt. 
Q.	Did he have any other weapon? 
A.	No, not apart from that knife. 
Q.	How were people being made to get on to the pick-up truck? 
A.	Some were kicked -- some were kicked, others were slashed with a knife as Rwamakuba did, and others were forced to get aboard the vehicle.  
Q.	What was Rwamakuba doing with the knife? 
A.	He was striking people with his knife, the people getting into -- getting on board the pick-up truck.  He struck them with his knife. 
Q.	Did you ever see your brother or his body again after that occasion? 
A.	No, I never saw my friend -- my brother up until today. 
Q.	Can you help us with what time of day it was or night it was when these events occurred?  Was it in the morning, the afternoon, the evening, late at night, the early hours of the morning, dawn, dusk, when? 
A.	Generally, they kill during the night. 
Q.	I'm asking you about when your brother was killed and you saw people loaded on to a pick-up truck, what time of day was that? 
A.	It was during the day. 
Q.	What time of day, was it the morning, the afternoon or the evening, can you help us? 
A.	I do not quite recall.  All I know is that it happened during the day. 
Q.	And, approximately, how long was it between the moment your brother was murdered by Gatera -- strike him with an axe, and the moment you fled from the hospital having heard Athanase? Approximately, how much time was that? 
A.	I left the hospital the day after my brother's death. 
Q.	I think you misunderstood my question.  How much time was it between your brother being struck with an axe and the time you fled because you heard Athanase saying something about rape, how much time was that? 
A.	I fled after having heard Athanase say what he said.  I left 30 minutes after my brother had been struck with the axe. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honours' leave, that is all I proposed to ask, and I hope that is a convenient moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Hooper, if there is - if it proves that it is not practical or possible to continue the cross-examination of Ms. Des Forges this afternoon, would you be ready to start the cross-examination of this witness?  
MR. HOOPER: 
	I could, but I must say I prefer if I could be allowed to do it tomorrow, to say that, because there is also some photocopying and other matters, as well as attending to overview of where this traces the sequence and which ideals things.  I take it from what you've just indicated there may be a difficulty this afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't -- it's just a matter of general principle of always having a backup in place.  But as far as -- as far as I understand, Dr. Forges will commence her testimony at 3 o'clock this afternoon.  But I was just wondering whether I should have asked the Prosecutor in terms of the general principle of having a backup to have the witness available in case anything went wrong. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, may I say then, there may be at least something I can deal with which otherwise occupies tomorrow.  Let me put it like that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Overlapping microphones)
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, would that be convenient?  We -- I would explain to the witness that we intend to do something else this afternoon, but I don't know what's going to happen at 3 o'clock, and I just thought that in the event that something went wrong, we should have a backup -- a backup situation that we won't completely waste the afternoon.
MR. MORLEY:
Can I assist Your Honour with a thought?  We can make the witness available for this afternoon.  And, of course, if it's not necessary because Alison Des Forges is contactable, then we can make arrangements to take her home.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Madam Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Normally, our Court sits both in the morning and in the afternoon, but this afternoon we had planned to do something else.  So, your -- you are not expected to give evidence to continue your evidence until tomorrow morning, but we would like to prepare in the event of an unexpected occurrence, so we are asking that you be available for the commencement of the afternoon session in case something goes wrong with our other plans, and then we will continue your testimony.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  If things go as we have planned them, then you will be taken back to your home this afternoon, and you will resume your testimony tomorrow morning.  

Now, I also should tell you that during this adjournment as during any other adjournment of the case, while you are a witness, you are not to discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do understand, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I ask as a matter of formality that the document which the witness has been writing on becomes Exhibit P. 58, and entered under seal, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that.  The order is made accordingly.  Yes, could we have the number from the registrar, please, just for the record sake, identification number?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
That will be Prosecution Exhibit No. 60. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
(Exhibit No. P. 60 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can take the adjournment now.  
(Court recessed at 1310H)

1522H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon to everyone.  

Madam Registrar, could you just open the proceedings, please.  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Hökborg; and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 22nd August 2005, for the resumption of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-I (sic).  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Registrar.  

We are intending to proceed by way of teleconference for the testimony of Alison Des Forges.  

Madam Registrar, what is the status of the connection?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
The expert witness, Ms. Des Forges, is ready for the proceedings, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Ms. Des Forges.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  Good afternoon.  I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Welcome back.  I'm sorry that we are not seeing each other, but this seemed to be the --
THE WITNESS:  
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- best arrangement we could make under the circumstances.  

If you'll just give me one moment just to clarify a few housekeeping matters.  I would like to ask you, first of all, have you been able to access the documents that are intended to be used in your examination? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I have been able to access all of the documents of the Defence binder and a portion of the documents which were originally used by the Prosecution.  I assumed that I will not need the others from the Prosecution bundle.  If I should need them, then I will, in fact, be unable to deal with that situation.  The documents were sent to me in electronic form, and it took me about five hours to download the ones that I did get, and I was unable to finish.  It would have taken me another several hours to finish downloading the others, and I was unable to do that.  But I don't see that as a major problem unless one or the other of the parties is planning to deal with documents previously presented by the Prosecution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  And I must again express our appreciation for the effort that you made to prepare for this session.  I think what would be the best thing would be to take it step by step, and if a problem arises, then we'll see how best we can deal with it.  

In that case, Mr. Morley --
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- it's probably safe at this stage, I think -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- for us to say you will not be required this afternoon.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  And I'll let the witness go, with Your Honour's leave.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we start the testimony, are there any issues that need to be addressed, or can we just start -- or, complete the -- the cross-examination?
MR. WEBSTER:
Nothing from the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, no.  I'll just indicate that I will be referring to Prosecution documents, but, as Your Honour says, we can see where it goes. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Is it necessary to swear the witness again, seeing that it's now a new form of testimony after the recess? 

Madam Registrar, to be on the safe side, would you administer the oath.  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Witness GIO is in the waiting room, Mr. President, so we are awaiting your instructions for that purpose. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Madam Registrar, we are about to recommence the testimony of Alison Des Forges, who is doing her testimony by teleconference.  She had been a sworn witness during the last trial session, but since a month has elapsed and we are now doing this by a new method, I was suggesting that you invite her to take the oath again, that's on the telephone.  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Madam Des Forges, can you please take the solemn declaration again and please repeat after me the following words.
(Declaration made by Alison Des Forges in English) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Ms. Des Forges, I will now ask Mr. O'Shea to resume his examination.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, thank you very much.
ALISON DES FORGES,
first having been resworn,
testified as follows:
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, I take it you can hear me?  
A.	Yes, I can, Counsel. 
Q.	Yes, thank you.  I'm rather disappointed that we can't see each other, but, still, we'll proceed like that.  

	Can I start from here, perhaps.  Would you accept that on the 20th of January 1993 Allan Debrower (phonetic), political councillor of the Christian Democratic International, or Internationale démocrate chrétienne, advised Mathieu Ngirumpatse, secretary general of the MRND, to explore a permanent and open MRND-MDR collaboration? 
A.	January 20th, 1993?  Is that -- is that the date you're speaking of?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Would it also be right that the same Allan Debrower suggested calling a national conference to form an alliance? 
A.	I believe that was the case, yes.  I do not have that material in front of me, but it (inaudible) that Mr. Debrower's interest was in attempting to stimulate a greater coalition among certain political elements in Rwanda, that he saw a conference as one way to do that.  
Q.	Are you able to comment on his intentions behind that suggestion? 
A.	I believe that he saw the possibility of a division in the Hutu political bloc between the MDR and the MRND, in particular posing a problem for what he believed should be the future political development of Rwanda, and he was anxious to try to counter that.  
Q.	And would that be in confronting the RPF? 
A.	It would be, I believe, with two purposes, confronting the RPF and assuring the political dominance of the political formation that Mr. Debrower wished to be associated with.  
Q.	Would you accept that the MDR high-ranking membership was the same in 1992 and in 1993, until July of that year? 
A.	The ranking membership?  Do you mean the -- the (speakers overlapping) committee? 
Q.	The senior membership.  
A.	I believe it was essentially the same, yes.  There were the beginnings of differences of opinion being expressed, but I believe it had not reached a point of -- of formally resulting in any changes in party leadership.  
Q.	Is it right that in early 1993 President Habyarimana called a national conference to include the MDR, PSD, and PL in an attempt to form an alliance against the RPF? 
A.	A national conference in what sense?  You mean a meeting, or do you mean a massive, widespread conference involving large numbers of people? 
Q.	Well, do you -- do you have knowledge of any kind of attempt on the part of President Habyarimana to bring together the MDR, PSD, and PL to form an alliance against the RPF? 
A.	I believe in the early months of 1993 he did make such an effort, yes.  
Q.	Is it right that that offer was rejected by the MDR? 
A.	I believe it was rejected by all the parties to whom it was addressed except the MRND. 
Q.	Is it also correct that around the same time there was an MDR politician by the name of Emmanuel Gapyisi who was trying to form a political alliance across party lines that he called Peace and Democracy Forum? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And is it right that that intended alliance was designed to confront both the RPF and President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is it right that Gapyisi was assassinated on the 18th of May 1993? 
A.	I'm not certain of the date, but it was at about that time he was assassinated, yes. 
Q.	Would it be correct to evaluate that both of the proposals that I've put to you with regard to an alliance were designed to obtain a position of strength against the RPF in future negotiations? 
A.	Well, as we have explored in some detail, there were two proceeds going forward in a parallel fashion at this time.  One involved the war and the attempt to deal with the RPF; the other involved the enormous political changes within Rwanda itself.  And it would be extremely naive, I would think, to believe that any group of skilled politicians at this point was intent upon only one objective in a situation where there were perceived to be two major challenges.  So I would suppose, yes, in part, each effort had as one prong of its intention to create greater unity against the RPF, but certainly the other prong would have been to create a more solid political base for eventual political victory by those actors for their own political and personal gain. 
Q.	Is it right that the end of February 1993 the French minister of cooperation, Marcel Débarge (phonetic), urged the creation of a common front against the RPF? 
A.	I do not recall the details, but there were certainly French attempts at about that time.  Whether Mr. Débarge was personally associated with them, I don't recall.  
Q.	Would you accept that both the RPF and the MRND had an interest in weakening the MDR? 
A.	At what period?  I think we need to be specific here because this was a time of extraordinary political dynamism.  In general, yes, the MDR opposed a political challenge to both the MRND and the RPF, but there were certainly periods of time when one and the other, that is, both the MRND and the RPF, saw short-term political benefit in allying with the MDR.  
Q.	But if one looks at long-term political benefit, the MDR was a party which would have been in a strong position to take power in any future government once the Arusha courts had been implemented.  Would that not be correct? 
A.	It is certainly true that the MDR posed the major challenge to the MRND and to the RPF, that is, it was more important than any of the other political parties at that time in challenging those other contenders.  But the exact -- the likelihood that the MDR could have prevailed, say, in an electoral -- in an open election is very difficult to estimate.  And, again, it depends on the period.  In the month after its formation, the MDR experienced a great surge of strength and did indeed seem to be a formidable contender.  But, of course, after July 1993, it was considerably reduced in power, owing to the split in its own ranks.  So, once again, it's important to be precise about a date. 
Q.	The incident in July 1993 was a small incident in terms of the history of the party and the future of the party, was it not?  The MDR was a party which, four or five years down the line, had a excellent chance of obtaining the sympathy of a large number of people in Rwanda.  
A.	Well, the Kabusunzu split could hardly be described as a small incident.  By April of 1994, for example, there is some indication that the -- a significant of number of the bourgmestres of MDR persuasion were on one side and a significant number were on another.  And the stance of bourgmestres often would determine the results of elections in a given area.  So the fact that you had a very large number of -- you had a split where -- where numbers were significant on both sides indicated a terrific weakness in the party at that point.  

	It had -- yes, indeed, it had a revolutionary heritage which would have been useful in future political contexts. But that heritage would be usable only if the party -- structures at the party institutions were able to function in an organised fashion.  And as long as there was a serious split in the leadership, that was not going to happen.  
Q.	On the 6th of July 1993, Dismas Nsengiyaremye wrote a letter to President Habyarimana, and I believe that letter is reproduced or -- or, a translation is reproduced at page 115 of your book.  Perhaps I can read the relevant part and then you can tell me if you recognise it, and we can go from there.  

	"Terrorist groups are now preparing attacks on various politicians and disturbances throughout the country to try to stop the war again.  In other words, you feel you find a subterfuge that would enable you to avoid signing the peace agreement, to bring about the resignation of the present government so as to put in place a bellicose government devoted to you, to begin the hostilities again in an effort to push the RPF troops back to their former positions, and to demand the renegotiation of certain terms of the protocols that they have signed already." 

	Is that the text of a letter which you recognise?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And you -- would you accept that as a legitimate representation of what that letter says? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Now, since you've downloaded these documents, I imagine that my system of tabs no longer exists insofar as you're concerned, that side.  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Okay.  
A.	Okay.  If you can give me the number on your index, you prepared an index at one point, numbers 1 through 36 --
Q.	Yes.  
A.	-- and if you can give me the number in that index, I can find the document more quickly that way.  
Q.	Yes.  
	
	And, indeed, I can confirm that the numbers which are listed in the index match the numbers of the tabs.  So if I use a tab number to assist people in the court, that would be the same number on the index.  So if you go to tab 17, a document which is described as MDR Communiqué de presse de l'intervention humanitaire au Rwanda of 20th of June 1994.  
A.	I have that document.  
Q.	That -- that document is -- 
A.	Oh, wait a minute.  Sorry, no, I don't have that document.  

	The 20th of June.  Okay.  Hold on.  

	Okay.  I have the document.  
Q.	Yes.  Thank you.  Do you -- do you recognise that document? 
A.	I believe I've seen it before, yes. 
Q.	Yes.  So this is a document which comes out of the Prosecution archives and is numbered K0309571.  Could you describe to the Court what this document appears to be.  
A.	It's a press release by the Brussels-based bureau of the MDR congratulating or welcoming the French decision to send in troops for l'opération Turquoise. 
Q.	And it's a document dated the 20th of June 1994, signed --
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	-- by Dr. Oswald Nsengiyumva.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Could you -- would you mind -- this document is only in French, but would you mind reading the third paragraph from the bottom, starting with "MDA désapprouve."  
A.	Okay.  "The MDR disapproves and denounces any alliance when -- wherever it comes from, which shows a clear intention of counteracting humanitarian activity in Rwanda and accuses the authors of failing to assist persons in distress."  

	This last part, that is, "failure to assist persons in distress," is in brackets -- in quotation marks, I beg your pardon -- "exposed to war, massacres, epidemics, and plagues of all types."  
Q.	And could you then read the following paragraph, please.  
A.	"The MDR family condemns the antihumanitarian mobilisation that has been launched by the RPF and its various associative ramifications."  
Q.	Yes.  Thank you.  

	Could you now turn to tab 35.  
A.	Shall I keep this document open, or are we finished with it?  I just say that because it will take some time -- 
Q.	I think you can -- 
A.	Can I close it?  
Q.	You can close it, yes.  
A.	Okay.  
Q.	Are you -- are you looking for tab 35 or have you found it? 
A.	No, still looking. 
Q.	Okay.  
A.	Okay.  I have it.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could Ms. Des Forges be asked to speak more into her telephone? Because her sound levels are going lower, they're going down, they're becoming poorer. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  Is that -- is that better? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  So I have the document at tab 35.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, thank you, Professor Des Forges.  

	Could you describe -- well, first of all, can I ask you, have you seen this document before? 
A.	No, I have not seen this document before.  I downloaded it yesterday. 
Q.	Very well.  Could you -- could you describe to the Court what it appears to be.  
A.	It's a letter dated the 14th of April, again coming from the MDR office in Belgium and signed by the same MDR representative, Dr. Oswald Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A, and by Mr. Nkezabera.  "JMV" are the initials, and then the name is Nkezabera, N-K-E-Z-A-B-E-R-A, and it is a letter to the minister of foreign defence; the minister of national defence, obviously the Belgian minister of national defence from the address, dated the 14th of April 1994.  And it is a letter of condolence for the -- expressing condolences to the Belgians for the killing of the Belgian blue helmets, the peacekeepers who were part of the UN mission, and asking for national and international enquiry into the deaths of the Burundian and Rwandan heads of state and their respective delegations and into the killing of the Belgian soldiers and also into all of the killings of innocent populations.  And it concludes by condemning the barbarian acts perpetrated by the enemy, those forces that are -- that are hostile to peace and democracy in Rwanda.  
Q.	Yes, thank you.  

	We can move from that document now.  

	Would it be correct to say that on the 17th of November 1991 the MDR, the PL, and the PSD organised a demonstration of 20,000 people, demanding an end to government attacks against citizens? 
A.	There was a demonstration that month.  I'm not sure of the date.  
Q.	Can you confirm that it was a demonstration organised by the MDR, PL, and PSD? 
A.	I believe that's correct, yes.  
Q.	And does the figure I gave appear to be correct or not? 
A.	I think that was the figure that was generally used.  Of course, no one -- in any society, it's difficult to get accurate estimates of participants, and I think Rwanda, particularly, was not experienced in the -- in the business of estimating numbers of people, but I think one could say a significantly larger number than was usual to be seen in such -- such meetings.  
Q.	Is it right that the day after the signing of the Arusha Accords, President Habyarimana stated on the radio that he would not permit the negotiators to lead our country into an adventure it would not like.  
A.	I believe that was after the signing of the first protocol of the Arusha Accords.  Is that what you're referring to?
Q.	That --
A.	That is not the final --
Q.	-- may be correct.  
A.	-- not the final accords in 1994 but the first protocol in 1993. 
Q.	Yes.  Thank you.  

	Would it be correct to say that in December 1992 the MRND and the CDR announced their rejection of the Arusha Accords and described them as a plan for treason that we must prepare to defeat? 
A.	That is correct.  That was a statement issued at the end of December 1992.  But we should note that within 10 days' time Habyarimana had signed an -- and the Rwandan government had signed another part of the Arusha Accords.  So this is simply a very good example of the kind of zigzag course, back and forth, back and forth, pursued by Habyarimana and the MRND at this point. 
Q.	Yes.  Would that be because Habyarimana was caught between a rock and a hard place, politically? 
A.	Indeed.  
Q.	Would it be right that around that time and following December '92 there was also widespread intimidation of opposition parties? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  This was the period of what was called Kubohoza, when there was violence used, actually both by the government against opposition parties and by militia of opposition parties, particularly the MDR, against supporters of the MRND. 
Q.	Are you in a position to name the individuals who were considered to be part of that close group of people around Habyarimana known as Akazu? 
A.	There a number of, shall we say, lists of those members of the Akazu.  It is somewhat difficult to be sure of the identity of all members because it was, in effect, a floating group and a very secretive group.  So it was not in any sense a publicly organised group, but it was generally acknowledged certainly that the group included, in addition to the president himself, his wife; members of her immediate family, including her two brothers; the -- that was Rwamakuba and Rwabukumba and Zigiranyirazo; her -- let's see.  I think he was a cousin rather than a brother, Segatwa.  It would have included as well the important people from the parastatal community, like Bagaragaza, who headed OCIR-Thé.  It would have included at one point Mfizi, although he later broke from the group.  It would have included Simbikangwa, who was a person in charge of intelligence and torture at one point.  It would have -- at any given time there would have been perhaps two dozen people most closely affiliated, but those are some of the examples.  
Q.	Just for clarification, you mentioned a person called Rwabukumba.  That would be Seraphin Rwabukumba, correct? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	So there would be people who were clearly associated with the family of Habyarimana who perhaps one would know or would be known by virtue of that fact, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And then there may be other people who would have direct access to the president and a certain degree of power but whose identity would not necessarily be known because they were not immediate family members.  Would that be fair? 
A.	That's correct, or simply because they were not known public figures, like, for example, Pasteur Masabe, who was -- who was a banker and who was not known as an outspoken political figure; someone like Felicien Kabuga, who was also an important businessman but who was not a political leader, as such.  

	So there would have been people connected to the group in a variety of ways, and the power was exercised by that group in a very behind-the-scenes, but nonetheless extremely effective, fashion. 
Q.	And I think you -- you mentioned a moment ago that there was a degree of secrecy around the operation of Akazu.  
A.	In the sense that it was not publicly acknowledged and -- and was not done in public.  In other words, it exercised its powers through personal connections, not through legislative fiat, for example, but it was public in the sense that it was widely acknowledged to exist.  
Q.	Would it be -- 
A.	This was all the more -- excuse me.  I was just --
Q.	Yes.  
A.	-- going to add, this was all the more the case after August 1992 when Christophe Mfizi, who had been an important player in the government, separated himself from Habyarimana by writing an open letter, basically calling on the president to separate himself from this group that was, in Mfizi's view, causing the -- the loss of popularity for both the president and the MRND party.  
Q.	How would you describe the political ideology of Akazu? 
A.	I think political -- political ideology was something that they didn't spend a great deal of time on.  It was a group that operated in terms of personal interest, and political ideas were useful primarily as vehicles to guarantee that personal interest.  But, in general, particularly in the period of '93-'94, the ideas which they enunciated most frequently were the dissent of the gains of the revolution as the phrase was used, in quotes, "gains of the revolution," meaning the political power of the Hutu and the material benefits that they had derived by being in power.  
Q.	Would it be a fair proposition that while President Habyarimana was in power, for anyone to exercise any effective power in Rwanda, it would be done through them obtaining a position essentially through Akazu in one way or another? 
A.	Well, before 1990 certainly it was the case that much of -- many -- many of the posts and the benefits were attributed, either directly or indirectly, by Akazu members, and it would be extremely difficult to get ahead beyond a certain local level of importance, in any case, without the backing of someone in the Akazu.  

	But with the organisation of multiparty politics and the success of other political parties with getting a place at the table, that is, getting positions of minister and prefect and bourgmestre and so on, these members of opposition political parties no longer technically opposition because they're now part of the government coalition, but opposition in the sense of opposed to the MRND.  Members of these parties were then in a position to become the dispensers of wealth and position, and they did indeed do that.  So it's a situation where the mechanism, where the pattern of the distribution of benefits remains the same but where members of the Akazu basically had to make -- make room for members of other political parties to participate in sharing out the goodies and could no longer do so in an exclusive way.  
Q.	But, again, that -- that was not a position of real choice or -- or a voluntary position, was it, from the -- from the side of Habyarimana and Akazu? 
A.	Certainly not.  Their purpose was to obtain exclusive control. 
Q.	The term "Akazu," would it be right that it was Boniface Ngulinzira who coined that term? 
A.	Well, actually, the term is an old term which dates back to the 19th century, or probably before.  I mean, it's simply a term in Kinyarwanda meaning "the little house."  But in the sense of referring to a specific group of those surrounding the president, it may indeed have been Ngulinzira who first used it in that connection. 
Q.	He was -- he was known to have some expertise in linguistics, wasn't he? 
A.	Um-hmm, yeah.  Well, it was -- as I say, it was not a particularly recherché kind of use of language.  It was a term that was commonly used and used to refer to small structures within the customary enclosure where activities would go on that were not appropriate to the main house.  So it had a slightly disreputable connotation to it.  
Q.	And the reason for Boniface Ngulinzira applying this ancient term to this phenomenon was -- was essentially opposition to the idea, wasn't it? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And if I can just talk for a moment about Mr. Ngulinzira, he was at one point head of educational affairs department in the office of the president; is that -- is that right? 
A.	That may well be.  I'm not familiar with the details of his CV. 
Q.	Would you be familiar with the fact that he was sacked from that office for joining the MDR and opposing the MRND in 1991? 
A.	I did not know that, but it wouldn't surprise me.  That was a fairly common happening at the time. 
Q.	And he became minister of foreign affairs in April 1992? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And he was head of the Rwandan government delegation at Arusha from 1992 to 1993? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And then he was chosen by the MDR party to join the broad-based transitional government in March 1994.?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then he was killed by soldiers on the 11th of April 1994? 
A.	He was indeed killed in the first days.  I'm not sure if it was the 11th or another day, but it was at about that period, yes.  
Q.	Do you have any knowledge of the arrangements which were made for the evacuation of his family during the war in April 1994? 
A.	At one point I did, but I'm not sure I recall the details.  I know at one point I was immersed in that, but I don't recall right now exactly how that happened.  
Q.	Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but in terms of your understanding -- or, the development of your understanding of how the genocide came about in 1994, would it be right to say that it's your view that there was some degree of planning of the genocide well before April 1994? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And how far back would you take that? 
A.	It's -- the difficulty with answering that question becomes the difficulty with judging intention because the persons who began the planning at some point had in mind the elimination of Tutsi.  But at what point for each person was that determination made, I don't know.  I don't believe that there was a -- necessarily a major turning point at which a large group came to the conclusion that this was the plan that needed to be implemented.  I see it instead as a gradual progression over time, where a relatively small number of people managed to convince larger numbers to join in the process of attacking Tutsis with the intention of eliminating them.  I believe that the letter of Colonel Nsengiyumva from July 27th, 1992, is, for me, a significant document in indicating that the possibility of large-scale attacks on Tutsi civilians was indeed being discussed at that point by the military hierarchy.  This was then reinforced for me by the positions taken in September with the circulation of the Definition of the Enemy document.  

	There are some indications of the -- the launching of the idea of genocide, even as early as 1991, by propaganda of the government, who used it in a process called accusation in a mirror, that is, they accused others of planning a genocide against the Hutu, which was a way, I think, of putting the idea out there.  

	So, in short, it is difficult to say exactly when and for which persons this became the intention.  But beginning at least in January of 1993, you see a clear development of the idea of using large numbers of civilians, trained and organised by professional killers -- professional killers in the sense of those with professional military training, either soldiers, retired soldiers, communal policemen, people who knew how to shoot, for example.  So from January 1993, that idea becomes increasingly clear, the large-scale organisation of parts of the civilian population, and at the same time, parallel to that, there becomes increasingly clearly defined the notion of Tutsi civilians within the country being, in effect, part of the RPF guerilla movement, whether they were or not.  

	So it is in those two parallel movements from 19 -- January 1993 on that you can see the increasingly clear line of what becomes implemented in April 1994.  In fact, it's remarkable how the -- how many of the details of practice in April 1994 can be directly traced back to 1993.  
Q.	In your examination-in-chief, you made reference to a speech by one Léon Mugesera.  Do you -- do you remember talking about that? 
A.	Yes.  I don't remember specifically referring to that, but I have on many occasions talked about that speech as a speech of great importance, yes.  
Q.	Do you -- do you believe that that speech links into your conception of an early plan of genocide? 
A.	Yes.  If you look -- if you -- if you start with the period of July, August 1992 when the first Arusha Accords negotiations are going forward, and you see at that time the Nsengiyumva letter, and then that's followed by Habyarimana's denunciation of the Arusha process, that's followed then the next month by the circulation of the Definition of the Enemy document.  That's followed by the --
Q.	Professor Des Forges, sorry.  Can I -- can I just stop you for one moment?

	Could you please try to talk a little more slowly because there are people here who may have difficulties with the speed, the rate.  Sorry.  
A.	Okay.  I was attempting to give a brief chronology of some major points, beginning with July 1992 when the reality of the accords, the reality of a negotiated settlement, becomes concrete in the minds of many people.  The success of the first negotiations seems to have, in effect, triggered an effort to move in the direction of thinking about and planning for an alternative strategy, which would be put into effect simultaneous with carrying on the negotiations.  So, in other words, you do one thing in the front parlour and something else in the hallway.  And in the front parlour, you have the negotiations going on; you have the various stages of the Arusha Accords being signed.  In the back hallway, you have soldiers and politicians talking about the possibility of widespread killing sprees and killing of those members of the political opposition, those opposed to Habyarimana, who were the strongest proponents of negotiation.  

	And among the other events that I would name that were taking place in the back hallway would be the circulation of this document in September of '92, "Defining the Enemy."  It seems somewhat surprising that the -- the military hierarchy puts such great attention on underlining the characteristics of the enemy just as the peace process appears to be succeeding.  

	The months -- well, then immediately after that, the next day, the CDR, an extremist political party, takes up and echoes this same theme of Definition of the Enemy and even names some of the same individuals that were named by the military officers.  

	The next month, in October, there was an attempted coup, which was aborted, and the lines of that attempted coup had been suggested in that same July 27th letter of Colonel Nsengiyumva, which I referred to.  And then two or three weeks after that, there is a speech by Habyarimana, again disavowing the accords.  The week after that is the speech by Mugesera -- by this time we've come to late November -- Mugesera, who gives a speech calling for the violent attack against Tutsi and saying that the chief cause of the violence in 1959 was in letting some of them escape.  So here, clearly putting forward the idea that total elimination should be the objective if the country is to solve the problem of the Tutsi once and for all.  

	There is then violence against Tutsi in the region, Tutsi and the related Bagogwe, B-a-g-o-g-w-e, people.  And then several weeks after that is the statement which counsel mentioned a few minutes ago by the MRND and the CDR, saying the Arusha Accords are an act of treason.  

	In January the government is forced once again into a position of signing yet another part of the accords, and this part defining the definition -- the division of political power, this, then, indicating considerable weakness on the part of the MRND and the CDR, which they attempt to cover by launching the massacres of Tutsi and members of the political opposition, again, particularly in the northwest.  

	And then after that comes the dramatic offensive of the RPF, which indeed seriously frightens many people and pushes the extremists into a position of greater strength and extremism in demanding that there be a widespread civilian organisation to prepare people to, quote, unquote, defend the gains of the revolution.

THE WITNESS:
The Mugesera speech -- to return to your question, the Mugesera speech fits into that chronology and is an important part of the process. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	From the way you described the speech it seems to have been fairly direct in its terminology.  
A.	Indeed that was the case.  Mugesera was a highly educated linguist with a complete understanding of the impact of the language he chose, and unlike many of the speeches and statements at this period, it is, in fact, brutally direct, concluding with the phrase, or in effect, "Remember the person whose throat you do not cut will cut yours."  The impact of the speech was such that another academic wrote to him immediately and expressed his astonishment and his thoughts -- that was Professor Rumiya, R-U-M-I-Y-A -- at Mugesera's use of language and reproached him, saying, "You, above all, know the importance of language; how could you say these things?" 
Q.	Do you believe that Léon Mugesera was part of a plan for genocide? 
A.	I believe that Mugesera was part of a plan to define Tutsi civilians as a people outside the law, a people without the rights of citizens, a people who could be and should be attacked in order to preserve, to defend the interests of the -- the Hutu majority.  His language is -- is very clear where he says, as I mentioned before, that the mistake in 1959 was allowing some of these people to escape.  
Q.	Would it be fair for me to say that your belief that there was a plan of genocide of Tutsi went as far back as it did -- and I think you went as far back as 1991, if I'm not mistaken -- would it be right that that belief is based on all the circumstantial evidence put together?  Is that the way you put your case? 
A.	There is significant documentary evidence to substantiate the positions I have taken.  
Q.	So your expert opinion, having looked at this documentation and all the circumstantial evidence, is that there was a plan for genocide and that that plan went back as far as 1991? 
A.	The launching of the idea of genocide went back as far as 1991, but as I have attempted to say, a historical process is not a simple matter.  We are looking at a process of development where a small number of people begin with an idea and gradually enlist other numbers of people to that idea.  To say a plan for genocide existed on a given date requires looking at the particular persons involved, on the part of whom was there a plan for genocide at that date.  But certainly the thinking about mobilisation of large numbers of assailants, the defining of Tutsi civilians as the targets for the violence, that was clearly present in the thinking and in the expression of important persons in Rwanda as early as 1992, the latter part of 1992, and present increasingly, and increasingly publicly, in 1993. 
Q.	You mentioned earlier a process of front door/back corridor.  Presumably if there were a group of individuals who in 1992/1993 were designing or planning a genocide, they -- they would have kept that secret; would that be right?  
A.	Well, in terms of the mechanics of it, there was a lot of talk about trying to keep it secret, and there were various attempts.  For example, the document of the definition of the enemy when it became public, that was considered something very unfortunate on the part of the people who had intended it to circulate without publicity.  But at the same time there was a public aspect to it.  There has to be a public aspect to it because the mobilisation of people necessarily involved creating the image of Tutsi as enemy.  So the -- the way this was done was through the use of media that were supported by those people who from the back corridors, media which increasingly taught that Tutsi were evil, subhuman snakes or serpents and should be eradicated. 
Q.	Yes, I understand that.  You -- you, for your part, however, you do believe that there was also a secret side to it, do you? 
A.	Certainly there are aspects of it that we have not been able to document, yes.  And at the time, these were secret.  They most likely involved conversations among people rather than exchange of written material about the idea.  And this is -- this is a part of the history which we cannot reconstruct with any exactness. 
Q.	Is it your belief that there was a -- a group of individuals who designed a plan deliberately? 
A.	It is my conclusion that there was a group of individuals who came to the conclusion that it would be desirable and indeed necessary to eliminate large numbers of Tutsi civilians because they were Tutsi, and they then agreed upon the method, the mechanism, to do that.  Whether you call this designing a plan, it's not -- it's not designing a plan in the sense of sitting down and writing out an organisational structure and assigning tasks at the start, but by February 1994 it had reached that point, and there was indeed a set of tasks assigned in writing to people in conjunction with attacks on Tutsi.  
Q.	I think I see the distinction you're trying to make, but your -- your -- your view would be, would it, that well before the genocide there were discussions and exchanges which were secret, as well as the public manifestations?  There were discussions and exchanges which were secret to the effects of a deliberate move towards the genocide; is that right? 
A.	Yeah.  
Q.	And for that -- for that kind of -- those kinds of discussions and exchanges or the secret side to that plot to work, it would necessarily, would it not, have to be restrictive in the number of people who were fully in the know? 
A.	Well, that, as I have tried to point out to you, is the problem which they encountered.  In order to -- to carry forward their intention without public discovery, they needed to keep things quiet, if not secret.  But in order to assure widespread popular mobilisation, they did, in fact, have to, at some point, go public or at least reveal their intentions with sufficient publicity to begin to prepare people for this awful idea of killing their neighbours.  So they were caught, in a sense, on the horns of a dilemma, but it's clear from a number of the historical documents that there were meetings which were private and where the intention was to keep the matter under discussion private, yes. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honours, in terms of my planning of things, this -- depending on the Court's feeling, this might, in fact, be a convenient moment for a break.  I'm in the Court's hands. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 90 minutes we've done up to now.  Are you -- do you see your way to completing this evening?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
I might.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You might. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I'd like to see how it goes, but I -- I think that's a possibility, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, we could take a short break now of 10 or 15 minutes. 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, may I ask how long you're planning to sit today?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, I thought that our scheduling order had been sent to you.  
THE WITNESS:
I had had mentioned both 18 hours and 19 hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, well, I see.  What we had wanted to do was to sit for four hours -- to have four hours of testimony starting at 3:00 and with two short breaks, which would mean that if we're able to keep our breaks down to 15 minutes each, we'd be able to stop at 7:30 Arusha time, which would be approximately 12:30 where you are.  So that was our plan. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  I had -- that was my understanding as well, and I have scheduled a medical appointment actually months ago which I will need to keep to this afternoon, so I can be available until 7:30.  After 7:30 it would mean missing an appointment that I have waited months for.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, you said could be or you could not be available until 7:30. 
THE WITNESS:
I can be, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, good.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
After 7:30 it becomes very difficult for me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, but we will stop at around that time.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I think that we should take two short breaks during around period of about -- 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- 10 to 15 minutes each.  And I think that we could probably take our first break now. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honours, just -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Your Honour, she's trying to say something. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, I missed your last comment, Professor Des Forges.  
THE WITNESS:
My question was really for the technicians, whether they wanted me to stay on the line or whether I should hang up and they will call again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Could we have an answer to that?  

Well, what I'll do, I will leave the courtroom and ask the registrar to supervise the answer to that question. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Court recessed from 1645H to 1705H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We are back in our courtroom.  

And Professor Des Forges, are you with us again?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
Mr. O'Shea, would you continue, please.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, thank you.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, would it be correct to say that there are persons who can be considered as significant political figures during 1991, 1992, and 1993 who were themselves not aware of a deliberate strategy or conspiracy towards a genocide? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Are you aware, for example, that Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu has given evidence to the effect that he personally was not aware of any deliberate plan? 
A.	I'm aware of his testimony. 
Q.	And would you accept that he was a significant political figure? 
A.	Yes, certainly -- I don't recall the exact words of his testimony, whether it was that -- if I recall, what he said was that there was no government plan.  I don't recall his having said that he was unaware of a plan, but as I say, I don't have the exact quotation before me. 
Q.	Even in 1994 there were individuals who were -- significant individuals who were not aware of a plan; would that be correct? 
A.	I think most politically aware people in 1994 had a clear sense of a risk of massive violence against Tutsi, but it is accurate that there would have been some persons, even of considerable political importance, who would have been unaware of the details of what was being discussed, but I would say that by 1994 there was certainly a sense that large-scale violence against Tutsi was indeed possible.  All you had to do was listen to the radio and the evidence which was widely discussed about arms, about training of militia, recruiting of militia, and so on; all of that was publicly known certainly by people of any political importance. 
Q.	Do you know the name Jean Baptiste Nsanzimfura? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And was he the general staff of the gendarmerie in 1994? 
A.	Yes, he was. 
Q.	Do you know what his position is now? 
A.	I do not know what his exact position is now, no.  I do know that he has, from time to time, served as a consultant to the Prosecution at the ICTR, but I do not know if that is his current situation. 
Q.	Do you know the name Augustin Igazuwera (phonetic)?  I may be pronouncing that incorrectly. 
A.	I do not know an Augustin Igazuwera, no. 
Q.	Do you know who was in charge of the intelligence service in the prime minister's office in 1994? 
A.	I believe that was a person named Iyakaremye. 
Q.	Do you know what he did after the genocide? 
A.	He joined -- or was appointed to some political post in the current government in Rwanda.  I'm not sure what his exact status is, but I believe he has some position in the current government. 
Q.	Did he not become a cabinet minister? 
A.	At one point, but I don't know that he still has that post. 
Q.	Do you know the name François Xavier Nsanzuwera -- Nzauwera (sic)? 
A.	Nsanzuwera. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Was he the procureur in Kigali? 
A.	He was.  I believe the procureur général, in fact. 
Q.	And do you know what he did after the genocide? 
A.	He worked for a series of non-governmental organisations in Europe and subsequently became a member of the staff of the Prosecutor's office at the ICTR. 
Q.	Do you know from what point in time the RPF had soldiers at the CND? 
A.	They officially entered Kigali at the end of December 1993.  I do not know whether there was one or another present as a representative prior to that time to make arrangements for their arrival or for some other business, I don't know.  But in any case, the official arrival of a substantial number of RPF soldiers was the end of December 1993. 
Q.	Would you accept that at the end of 1993 and during 1994 the RPF did have people within Rwanda who provided the RPF with information? 
A.	Yes, that's clear.  Obviously if they have 600 soldiers in Kigali, they must have some people providing them with information.  They also occupied a tract of northern Rwanda at that point, and certainly we're well aware of what was happening within that zone. 
Q.	Did they also have people other than soldiers within Rwanda who provided them with information? 
A.	At that time the RPF was a political formation, not yet a registered political party, but a political formation, no longer, officially at least, considered a hostile force, so that persons who had supported the RPF in the past and others who were attracted to the RPF at this time publicly acknowledged their support of the RPF, and I would certainly suppose that some of them also provided information to other members of the movement. 
Q.	And I think you've said at one point, although I can't honestly say it was during your chief, I don't remember, but did you say at some point that the RPF held positions deep within Rwanda following the 8th of February attack? 
A.	After the February 1993 offensive, they had indeed advanced quite close to the national capital, but they withdrew from that position in March 1993 back to their original lines, and the zone in between became a supervised buffer zone. 
Q.	During -- during that period when they did hold positions deep within Rwanda, they would have had the ability to set up information networks, would they not? 
A.	I doubt that that was how it happened because that -- their occupation of that area was about a month in duration, and I think they were probably sufficiently occupied with actual military considerations there.  Their lines at that point were very far extended, and I think they were scrambling simply to deal with military issues.  So I doubt that gathering intelligence elsewhere in the country was a priority at that point. 
Q.	Would you agree that the RPF during the course of 1993 and in 1994 would have a significant interest in ensuring that they knew what was going on in Rwanda? 
A.	Intelligence gathering has always been one of the strong points of the RPF, and it was true at that period as well. 
Q.	And the RPF could be said to have had a reasonable knowledge of development which took place within Rwanda during 1993 and the first half of 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is it right that the RPF had claimed that ethnic purification, as they put it, had been planned for a long time? 
A.	Claimed when and where, by whom?  
Q.	Is it correct that the RPF took the position that -- I don't want to use the word "genocide" because I'm not sure if that would be accurate, but took the position that a plan for widespread massacring of Tutsis had existed for a long time before April 1994? 
A.	Well, their position has been ambiguous, and because of that, I would ask you for some clarification in terms of the time period and who is speaking and in what circumstances, because they themselves were caught in a -- in a difficult situation, in a dilemma, in a sense that they did indeed want to use the attacks on Tutsi as a political justification for their own conduct, but at the same time, they wanted to portray the war as a general war of liberation against Habyarimana which necessitated down-playing the ethnic element.  So at one point they said some things concerning genocide and long-term planning of genocide, but at other times they took a rather different attack.  So it depends what you're talking about.  If you're talking about more recently after 1994, it has indeed been frequently stated by RPF leaders that there was long-term planning of the genocide, and some of them indeed take that back to 1959. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry, just bear with me one moment.  I've mislaid my index. 

I apologise, Your Honour.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, if you could turn to tab 16.  
A.	16?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Okay, I have tab 16. 
Q.	Yes.  Do you recognise that document? 
A.	Yes, I've seen this document. 
Q.	Could you describe to the Court what it represents? 
A.	It was one of the early RPF communiqués about the war and about the killing of Habyarimana and about the call for an end to killings, killings of civilians, that is. 
Q.	Would you kindly read the second paragraph in the -- in the French text? 
A.	I have the English text in front of me.  Do you want it in French?  
Q.	Well, the French is the original and English is -- 
A.	Oh, okay.
Q.	-- an unofficial translation.  So I think it's better -- 
A.	Oh, I see.
Q.	-- if we take the French.  
A.	Okay. 
Q.	Do you have the French? 
A.	I do.  I just have to go back to it.  Just a minute, please.  Okay.  The second paragraph?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	"Today, after this attack, our country has been plunged into a bloodbath.  Thus, people have planned ethnic and political purification.  They have been planning it for a long time.  The death of the president of the republic has given the MRND/CDR extremists, of which the Presidential Guard constitutes the armed wing, the signal to hunt down members of the opposition, entrepreneurs of those who are victims of their Tutsi origin, the clergy, the intelligentsia, and NGOs.  They do not hesitate to attack foreigners and the blue berets who have come to help our country on its path to democracy.  Their aims are obvious:  decimate the opposition, to plunge the country into obscurity, and intimidate foreigners.  The RPF condemns these acts of barbarism and cannot tolerate them any longer." 
Q.	Yes, thank you.  And what is the date of this press communiqué? 
A.	This is -- well, the 9th of April 1994. 
Q.	Yes, thank you.  You can put that document aside now, Ms. Des Forges.  Thank you. 

Are you aware of the scholar Gérard Prunier. 
A.	Yes, I know Mr. Prunier. 
Q.	And are you aware of his view that the organisers of the genocide were a tight group? 
A.	Expressed where?  I think he's taken a number of views.  Which one exactly are you referring to?  
Q.	Well, I don't have it with me now, but he wrote a book on the genocide which I think was entitled Genocide in Rwanda; is that right? 
A.	Yeah.  In any case, I know the book you're referring to. 
Q.	In which he developed that conception and named individuals, in fact.  
A.	Right.  Yeah.  I think his thinking may have evolved somewhat since that point, but in any case, yes, that was one of his theses. 
Q.	If I could now turn, if I may, to the activities of the RPF and what that may have created in the minds of people in Rwanda in 1994.  Is it right that the announcement of multiparty democracy was in July 1990? 
A.	I'm sorry?  Was there a question there?  I didn't quite catch it. 
Q.	I said, is it correct that in July 1990 there was an announcement of multiparty democracy? 
A.	Well, yes and no.  Habyarimana gave a nominal public acknowledgement of the possibility of multiparty democracy, but he did not, in fact, accept the existence of the multiple parties for -- until 1991.  What he did in 1990 was to announce that the subject would be studied, but I think he anticipated something like a three-year period of study, but in fact that was shortened and action was taken in 1991.

1730H
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	And the RPF invaded Rwanda on the 1st of October 1990; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Would it also be correct that as a result of that attack, hundreds of thousands of persons were displaced? 
A.	Well, not immediately because the first attack was repulsed.  By the end of the month of November, there were virtually no RPF troops left in the country.  As a result of a military offensive in the north-east in 1992, hundreds of thousands of people were displaced, and then as a result of the military offensive of February 1993, a much larger number of many hundreds of thousands more were displaced.  But this was not the immediate impact; this was something that happened over time. 
Q.	Could you turn to tab 27. 
A.	In my -- in the -- the documents I was sent, that document of tab 27 is divided.  Do you have a specific page number so I know which file to open? 
Q.	Well, there is a section which is entitled -- sorry, I see.  There is a section which is entitled, "Abuses by the RPF", which starts at page 21 of that report and goes on -- well, at least until page 23. 
A.	I have that section. 
Q.	Yes.  Do you -- do you also have the front page? 
A.	The title page of the document? 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And could you describe to the Court what this document is? 
A.	This is a Human Rights Watch report on the situation of continuing human rights abuses in Rwanda, which was issued on June -- in June 1993 by the international human rights organisation then known as Africa Watch and now known as Human Rights Watch. 
Q.	And are you familiar with this document? 
A.	I am. 
Q.	And in your view are the findings in this document credible? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is it correct that it was reported that the RPF, following the attack of 1990, that the RPF continued to attack civilians so that as at the 28th of October 1991 they had killed 707 in Byumba préfecture, 131 in Ruhengeri préfecture, and that they also kidnapped and pillaged? 
A.	I'm sorry, I don't see where you're reading. 
Q.	I'm not reading, I'm making a statement.  Sorry.  
A.	And what is -- what is the source of that? 
Q.	Well, do you -- do you have a comment on that? 
A.	You -- what you did was you cited a certain number of people killed in Byumba; is that correct?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	And the number was what?  For what date?  
Q.	The date would be the 28th of October 1991, and the number would be 707 in Byumba préfecture.  
A.	Killed up until that time or on that date? 
Q.	I believe up until that time -- that you -- you may be able to assist me. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me.  Could we know (microphones overlapping). 
THE WITNESS:  
The number seems to me not unlikely, but I can't affirm that that is, in fact, a correct number.  I don't know the source and I don't know how it was prepared, but it is -- it is clear that there were hundreds of civilians killed in the first years of the war by the RPF, yes.  Whether it amounts to 707 or whether the number was considerably less than that, I really don't know at this point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you wished to ask a question?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe Dr. Des Forges asked it for me.  I was inquiring about the source because Mr. -- I mean we're -- we're disconnected, we don't see each other.  But I can see across the courtroom, Mr. O'Shea did seem like he was reading from something and I wanted to know the source of the information because that makes a difference in how the witness would -- would relate to the question and so on. 
MR. O'SHEA:
I was reading from my notes.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	But in any event, I found the source, and it's the same document that I asked you to look at a moment ago, Professor Des Forges.  If -- if you look at page 22 -- but, in fact, I don't need to ask you for your reaction on this because I've already asked you whether you agree that whether the findings in this document are credible, and you have given an answer to that.  So I'm satisfied with that answer. 

Would it be correct to say that in 1991 and/or early 1992 there were several thousand Hutus killed in Burundi? 
A.	Yes, in 1992. 
Q.	Is it right that in July 1992 there was a ceasefire? 
A.	Yes.  In Rwanda, you mean? 
Q.	Yes.  Sorry. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In August 1992, was there a protocol signed in Arusha by Habyarimana? 
A.	I'm sorry, in what date? 
Q.	August '92.
A.	Yes, that's correct.  In the meantime, just to correct the record if -- to return to the previous citation --
Q.	Yes.
A.	That citation is actually not from the Human Rights Watch publication you mentioned. 
Q.	Oh, sorry.
A.	It's from another one dated February 27, 1992, actually, an Africa Watch publication called, "Rwanda Talking Peace and Waging War, Human Rights since the October 1990 Invasion," and it's found on page 22 of that document.  Not the June 1993 document entitled, "Beyond the Rhetoric," just so that the record is correct on that. 
Q.	Well, I'm very grateful to you, Professor Des Forges, because the document I was referring to in the first place was the document of February 27th, 1992. 
A.	Oh. 
Q.	So I'm grateful for that clarification.  And immediately signing -- immediately following the signing of that protocol in August 1992, information came into the hands of Habyarimana and his supporters that more than a million dollars worth of arms had been seized in Orlando, Florida, apparently en route for Kampala; is that right?  
A.	Yes, there was information about those arms being seized.  It was unclear about what the ultimate destination of the arms was to be. 
Q.	Would it be right that the assumption on the part of Habyarimana and his followers was that the arms were meant for -- to supply the RPF? 
A.	That was the assumption made by Habyarimana, but I do not believe that that was a correct assumption. I think the -- the arms may have been, in fact, en route to another source, but I don't remember the details. 
Q.	On the 8th of February 1993, the RPF violated the ceasefire and attacked Rwanda; is that right? 
A.	Well, yes, it violated the ceasefire, but to say it attacked Rwanda is not really accurate because it was already present inside Rwanda.  What it did was to launch a massive military offensive from its position within north-eastern Rwanda. 
Q.	How massive was this offensive? 
A.	Well, it covered a very extensive front line stretching from Ruhengeri in the west over to Kibungo in the east, as I recall, and it -- it advanced very readily towards the national capital. 
Q.	Could you help us place this attack and the date of this attack, the 8th of February 1993, in the context of the Arusha negotiations in terms of a time frame?
A.	Well, we have already mentioned this morning, or this afternoon for you, that the -- at the end of December 1992, the MRND and CDR had backed away from the Arusha Accords, but then 10 days later, they were, in fact -- or two weeks later they were, in fact, obliged to go along with signing yet another protocol of the accord, which would have transferred a significant amount of political power to other -- to actors other than the MRND and Habyarimana personally.  This then caused a very significant reaction among MRND and CDR supporters, and they, as was often the case, used Tutsi as their targets and they launched killings of Tutsi and members of other political parties, but primarily Tutsi, in north-western Rwanda and elsewhere in the last weeks of January, I believe, starting January 21st or 22nd perhaps -- maybe January 23rd of 1993. 

Those killings had largely ended by the 1st of February.  When the RPF launched its offensive in early February, they did so claiming, in part, that they were attempting to halt the massacres of civilians.  But in fact, those massacres were, by that point, ended and the attack appeared to have been, instead, a strong-armed tactic to ensure that the MRND and CDR not back away from the concessions already made in the previous Arusha Accords.  In other words, it was in all likelihood a tactic to push ahead the peace negotiations. 
Q.	Would you be able to comment upon the humanitarian impact of that attack of the 8th of February 1993? 
A.	Well, as I mentioned earlier, it displaced hundreds of thousands of people, particularly from Cyumba and from parts of -- of Kibungo and Ruhengeri as well.  And those people were clustered in very miserable conditions in displaced persons camps dotted around the countryside to the north of the capital where they were dependent upon humanitarian aid to survive. 

The withdrawal of the RPF from its advanced military position back to its original line and the creation of a buffer zone was supposed to be followed by the return of those displaced people to their homes and, in fact, some of them did return, but not -- full -- the -- the presence of hundreds of thousands, no longer a million, as it had been at the height, but the presence of hundreds of thousands of displaced persons in these camps served as a permanent reminder of the -- of the damage being done to civilians by the continuation of the war. 
Q.	Did you -- did you just say that there was one million displaced persons? 
A.	The estimated number at the height was one million, but as I say, a portion of those people returned home after the RPF withdrew, so that in the coming months after that time, the figure again went down to several hundreds of thousands. 
Q.	And one -- one million displaced persons, that would be about one-seventh of the total population of Rwanda; would that be right? 
A.	That is correct for a brief period of time, that was the situation. 
Q.	And when Ndadaye was killed in October '93, do you know what the position was with displaced persons then? 
A.	I'm not sure of the figures at that time.  It would have been several hundred thousand displaced Rwandans in the northern part of the country and approximately 300,000 Burundian refugees in the southern part of the country; that would have been in late 1993. 
Q.	If I could now move on to another topic. 

MR. O'SHEA:
Did Your Honour want to say something? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) you can proceed. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Would you accept that the ministers who were appointed for the interim government in April 1994 did not all have a choice in that appointment? 
A.	According to the account of several ministers they were, in effect, fetched from their homes or even from their hiding places by military and taken to the meeting place at which the nominations were announced.  Whether they had weapons actually pointed at their heads or whether the presence of military was sufficiently intimidating to persuade them to go along, I do not know.  Having a choice implies being able to make a determination free from threat of imminent death, certainly, and whether the persons who agreed to join this government were faced with imminent death - or, rather, with a lesser level of coercion, I do not know. 
Q.	Knowing the politics and culture of Rwanda as you do, would it be necessary for a minister to have a gun pointed at his head to feel that he had no choice in the matter? 
A.	It would exam -- it would require a careful examination of the circumstances of each case in order to evaluate the circumstances in which the decision was made to join the government.  Rwandans are often subject to heavy pressure from official and sometimes unofficial powers to do certain things, and as a result, many Rwandans have developed mechanisms for avoiding participation in activities that they prefer not to participate in.  But evaluating the conduct of any given individual in those circumstances requires knowing a substantial amount about what was going on at that time. 
Q.	Are you aware of the fact, for instance, that Mr. Jean Kambanda, the prime minister, has suggested that he himself had no choice in the matter? 
A.	I know that that is his account, that he relates that he was taken from what was essentially a kind of hiding place by several military officers and then escorted to the place where he was informed that he would be prime minister.  It's clear that he was transported by officers, but it is not clear just how willingly he went along.  He had significant political ambitions; he had attempted to be made a prime minister earlier on, and it's not clear at all that he accepted this position because he had no other choice. 
Q.	But you would accept that that is the position that he has stated during the course of his fairly frank interviews with the Prosecution? 
A.	As I recall, having read those interviews, and I don't have them in front of me at this point, what he describes is having been transported by military officers to the place where the government was, in fact, designated.  I don't recall his having described any significant level of coercion imposed upon him once he arrived at that place or even in the course of his being transported there.  In other words, the fact of being transported by military officers who have come to locate you in a situation where there is warfare going on is not a terrifically exceptional situation in and of itself from this point on and even before the resumption of active hostilities in -- in early April, many political leaders were accompanied by military in all of their movements around town and throughout the country.

	So yes, it is true, he was taken there by soldiers, but what transpired between him and the soldiers and what level of coercion he was subject to in order to persuade him, if -- if any, we do not know, or at least I do not know. 
Q.	But do -- do you accept that he says that he had no choice? 
A.	I don't recall those words.  Do you have the transcript in front of you?  I do not and I hesitate to -- to say that without his actual words in front of me. 
Q.	I don't.  Do you -- do you remember him saying that nobody bothered to find out if he accepted or not? 
A.	I don't re -- I don't recall those words.  I recall the circumstances of his being transported and being informed that he was being named prime minister, but I don't recall his exact description of his personal situation at that time.  It would help if I -- if I had his exact words and we could comment on them. 
Q.	It is right, is it not, that a number of MDR ministers had been very recently, as you said yourself in your evidence, assassinated? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And there was also a context of people disappearing? 
A.	It was a time of considerable insecurity. 
Q.	In that context, if the military turns up at your door and you're told that the president wants to see you and that you are going to be a minister, it would -- would it not be understandable for that person to feel that they had no choice but to accompany that military? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me -- 
THE WITNESS:
That's -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to object to the form of that question.  It's calling for speculation on the part of the witness.  If Mr. O'Shea has a specific reference to Kambanda or to any other -- any other witness or any -- excuse me, any other member of the internal government, then the question would be appropriate.  But I've read through Kambanda's transcripts, and I don't recall any statement that goes along those lines.  If he could link his question to something that has substance as opposed to asking for outright speculation on an issue that isn't even factual. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, it's not outright speculation, Your Honour.  The witness herself has outlined her understanding of Mr. Kambanda having the military come to his home and being accompanied by -- being accompanied to a meeting. 

Now, this is a witness which the Prosecution has brought forward as an expert on Rwandan history and culture.  And she is, in my respectful submission, able to comment on the state of mind of an individual faced with certain circumstances, and it is relevant and it's not pure speculation in the context of a previous answer. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My objection is not Dr. Des Forges providing as much information as she possibly can.  The cross-examination has gone far and wide.  I'm willing to listen all week to what she has to say because I find it very interesting.  But the question that was asked is simply -- there's no foundation for it in the sense that I have read Kambanda's transcript, that nowhere does he say that an officer came to him and told him he was going to be president.  That was not the -- that is simply not what he said in his transcripts.  And if he would like -- excuse me, if the Defence would like to pursue this line of questioning, we should have the -- the specific statement made by Jean Kambanda and have a response to that, or if there is any other minister that provides a similar account -- provides a specific account, because the question itself is deforming the reality that we are trying to pursue here. 
MR. O'SHEA:
With respect, my learned friend is now giving evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, what we're -- at this point in time, what Mr. Kambanda said is not evidence.  It's -- it's -- the allegation of his statement is merely a background or a platform on which Dr. Des Forges can give her opinion, because we are only interested, at this moment, in what she has to say. 

Mr. O'Shea, I think you should continue but you should rephrase your question and put it in a more acceptable form. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, thank you. 

Perhaps I don't need to, in fact. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, if we can come to the issue of decision-making in the government, which was another matter which you discussed during your examination-in-chief.  You explained that decisions were made by consensus.  Now, would it not be correct to say that the notion of consensus would include a situation where one or more ministers express no opinion at all? 
A.	I expect that was the case, yes. 
Q.	Is it correct that at least half of the ministers in the interim government came from the MRND party? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And -- 
A.	But, you see, that, I think, is an interesting point.  The -- since the days of the establishment of the coalition government in 1992, there had been this practice of attempting to reach decisions inside the government by consensus rather than by vote.  And I think it was an acknowledgement of the importance of trying to create some form of political cohesion at the top to replace or replicate the kind of cohesion that used to exist there when there was a single party.  

So there was also, in the interim government, a realisation of the importance of maintaining the adhesion and the loyalty, at least the nominal adhesion and loyalty of all members of the government, and that, I'm sure, is one of the reasons why decisions were not taken on a -- on a -- on a simple majority vote because it could have been done that way, but it was not.  It was -- it was done through a procedure which emphasised the importance of bringing everyone along and of bringing everyone on board so that there was no split within the government, where one group said, "Listen, we're opposed to this," but, rather, everyone either explicitly or implicitly gave consent to the various government policies. 
Q.	Was it not more significant in terms of the consensus procedure that that had been the prior procedure? 
A.	I'm sure that the president played a role here in the practices which were used by the government, but that does not diminish, from my point of view, the political reason why this was being done. They needed those people. They needed their -- their support, and if it meant taking an extra day or two to talk them around and to bring them to at least implicit acceptance of a point of view, the MRND were willing to do that. 
Q.	I -- I accept that prize number one for the reaching of any particular decision would be to have the active and expressed support of everybody in any venture that -- that would make sense, but it would also serve the purposes of the government, would it not, if -- if they could only ensure that there was no opposition to what they were doing?
A.	Are you -- I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you.  Are you saying that the attempt to create consensus would be futile if there was no hope of getting consensus?  Is that -- is that what you're saying? 
Q.	No, no, not at all.  You were -- you were saying that it was in the interests of the process to have everybody agree, and of course that makes perfect sense, but it would also serve the purposes, whatever those purposes were of the government, if they could reach a decision with no active opposition.  In other words, it would not be necessary for the functioning and purposes of the government to have every minister vote in favor of a resolution.  It would be sufficient if there was no expressed opposition. 
A.	Yes, that could also serve their purposes if there was no expressed opposition. 
Q.	You would be right, of course, in saying that where opposition was expressed there was an attempt from those who wished the decision to be passed to persuade those who were opposed not to be opposed.  That -- that - that, in fact, happened, didn't it? 
A.	The one instance that I'm aware of, which was an instance involving the declaration by the government on the policy of civilian self-defence and pacification, at least from Kambanda's account, that is, indeed, what happened.  The discussion, which, in theory, should have taken a relatively short time, was prolonged over several days in order to ensure that those who were opposed to the original statement be persuaded to accept it.  I -- I do not know other instances where this happened, but Kambanda himself points to that statement as perhaps the most important statement made by his government.  And so it is significant, I'm sure, that there was a period of discussion before that was, in fact, issued. In other words, it was not issued as a result of a simple majority but by persuading everyone to agree or at least not to oppose. 
Q.	Yes.  So agreement does not mean putting up your hand and saying, "yeah"; agreement means not opposing? 
A.	In this context, that could be the case, yes. 
Q.	And it would be --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, when you come to a convenient time, we thought -- we think we should take another short break. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well, Your Honour.  I'll just try and get through this issue of decision-making, I think, because I don't think I've got much more on that. 

No, in fact, it might go on a bit longer, depending on the answers.  Perhaps we should have a short break if it is convenient. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Professor Des Forges?  Professor Des Forges, we think we should take another short break now and when we --
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when we resume, we will then go up to approximately 7:30 when we will terminate the transmission for the evening. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, I couldn't hear the last part of your statement.  I heard that there would be a short break, and after that I lost you. 
MR PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, I was just confirming that we would not go beyond 7:30 this evening. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  Thank you very much. 
(Court recessed at 1815H)
(Pages 66 to 75 by Jean Baigent)




































(Court resumed at 1830H)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Good afternoon, Professor, we are back on line.  Are you with us still? 
THE WITNESS:
I am here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, you can continue.  
MR. O'SHEA:  
Your Honour, thank you. 
BY MR. O'SHEA: 
Q. 	 Professor Des Forges, have you seen minutes of cabinet meetings?  Professor Des Forges, can you hear me?  
A.	Hello, if you were speaking I haven't heard anything -- anything for the last couple of minutes. 
Q.  	All right, okay.  Have you seen minutes of cabinet meetings?  
A.	Have I seen minutes of a meeting?  Which meeting?  
Q.  	Of any cabinet meetings?  
A.	No minutes were taken as I understand it.  If there were perhaps some informal minutes, I have not seen them.  The accounts I have seen have been either Kambanda's own recollection or notes in the diary of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.  
Q. 	Have you seen Kambanda's own recollection about minutes? 
A.	That's correct, along with the written notations in the diary of the Minister of Feminine Affairs, Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.  
Q.  	My question is this, have you seen Kambanda's comments about the taking of minutes?  
A.	I'm sorry, I'm getting only every second or third word of what you are saying. 
Q.  	Alright, let me try again.  I hope we are not entering into a technical realm.  Have you seen Kambanda's recollection on the subject of whether there were minutes and if so what has happened to those minutes? 
A.	I believe Kambanda said that there were some written records but they are no longer in his possession? 
Q.  	Is it his recollection that minutes of cabinet meetings were lost in Ngoma taken by Zairean soldiers? 
A.	I'm sorry, I'm still getting a very interrupted pattern here.   Not enough to make sense of your question.  
MR. O'SHEA:   
	Do I try again, Your Honour?  
BY MR. O'SHEA: 
Q.  	Is it Kambanda's recollection that minutes of cabinet meetings were seized by Zairean soldiers in Ngoma?  
A.	I believe he said that the documents he had were divided into two groups and I believe one group of documents were seized by soldiers, but it isn't clear to me if the government minutes were, in fact, groups of documents or whether they were in the second group.
Q. 	 Would it be correct to say that not all decisions were taken by the council of ministers and that some decisions would be taken independently by the prime minister or individual ministries?  
A.	I'm sorry your voice is still breaking up.  I heard, "would it be correct to say," and then nothing else.  
Q.  	Would it be correct to say that not all decisions were taken -- would it be correct to say that not all decisions were taken by the prime minister or the president or individual ministries?  
A.	Is it correct to say that some decisions were taken by others in the full government, for example, by the prime minister and in conjunction perhaps with several other ministers?  Is that your question?  
Q.  	It wasn't, but it would be useful to have an answer to that question anyway.  Since that's the question you understood, I think it would be useful to have an answer to that.  
A.	Well, perhaps we can focus on what your question actually was but I'm afraid unless we can get a better  line here, this is not going to be a very productive use of anyone's time.  
Q.  	Just a moment, Professor.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Madam Registrar, could we have a comment from the technical people in the booth as to whether there is a problem, a technical problem that can be addressed?  

	Mr. O'Shea, in the meantime, could you give an indication of how much longer you anticipate?  
MR. O'SHEA:   
	I don't think I would finish today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Could you give an idea of how much time you've got to go, roughly?  
MR. O'SHEA:    
	As a very bold estimate, and I am going to be-- try to be pessimistic, four or five hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:   
	Why is that necessary?   
MR. O'SHEA:  
	Well, I'm just looking at the matters that I still want to cover and trying to judge in accordance with how things have gone so far.  I thought earlier today it might have been possible to finish today.  In terms of my general view on how long my cross-examination was going to last, I've always thought it would be about three days.  I've had about one day, plus today and I think it can be shorter, but I'm trying my best to get through the material.  I might be much shorter.  To be honest, I'm not that good at estimates.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Well, I'm really asking the question in the context that you had anticipated the possibility of completing her testimony before the recess and you have now had about three hours additional and yet you said you want an extra 45 hours.  It just seems inconsistent with what we had been anticipating.  
MR. O'SHEA:  
	Well, Your Honour, before the recess -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:   
	Well, I'm not stopping you but I'm just mentioning it.  I gather Dr. Des Forges is still on the line-- is on the line again.  Dr. Des Forges, can you hear me now?  Dr. Des Forges, can you hear me now?   

	Madam Registrar, did I misinterpret your signal?  Madam Registrar, if you are in contact with the technical assistants, could you just report for the record what they've said. 
MS. BEN SALIMO:  
	Mr. President, the technicians have said that.  Professor Des Forges can hear us, but we are unable to hear her.  That is the problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Is there any reason for it, is there something they can do to adjust that situation?   
MS. BEN SALIMO:  
	They are trying to solve the problem, Mr. President.  I'm speaking about the technicians.  They are trying to solve the problem. 

	Madam Des Forges?  Madam Des Forges?
THE WITNESS: 
	Can you hear me now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:   
	Yes, Madam Des Forges, I can hear you.  Can you hear me?  So the connection has been restored?  
THE WITNESS:  
	Yes, I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  We have approximately 40 minutes more which we would like to use as best as we can.  And Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, thank you.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q. 	 Let me try again, Professor.  Would it be correct to say that not all decisions were taken by the council of ministers, some decisions could be taken independently by the prime minister, or by the president, or by an individual ministry?  
A.	From the Kambanda interview, it appears that on occasion, he took decisions in conjunction with one or two ministers, which perhaps were submitted to the government as a whole, to the cabinet as a whole for approval so that essentially, it had been determined outside of the cabinet.  The President, I think, was not a significant player in any form.  I think he was purely a figurehead.  So I don't think he was involved in making decisions on his own.  It is possible that certain ministers who were very powerful, for example, the minister of defence, the minister of interior could have been in a position to make some decisions without letting the entire cabinet know.   But as I said before, the emphasis to create a consensus, to try to ensure that there was, at least, nominal agreement was a very powerful force.  So it appears from Kambanda's description and so it appears from Pauline's diary.  So it would please me that it would have been not impossible for a powerfully, relatively, unlikely-- for either the prime minister or an individual minister to have taken many decisions.  I wouldn't say they never did it, but I would say that it would have been exceptional for them to take decisions without involving the entire cabinet in the process.  
Q.  	That answer is based upon your understanding of the significance of trying to get everybody on board.  Is that right?  
A.	Yes, and also Kambanda's description of how some of the matters were presented  and how they were discussed and discussed extensively.  It is actually based upon that.  Yes.  
Q.	But in terms of whether certain decisions were taken by ministers, you have not seen sufficient evidence to be able to comment definitively.  Would that be fair?  
A.	Are you referring to one specific decision or simply to the process in general?  
Q. 	The process in general. 
A.	Well, as I said, I can't exclude that that did happen from time to time, but I have no evidence of it happening at any significant level.  
Q. 	And you have no evidence of it not having happened other than the circumstantial evidence that you just referred to?  
A.	That is correct.  I cannot exclude it.  
MR. O'SHEA:  
	May I proceed, Your Honour?  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Since your curiosity is overcoming, what's bothering me is the relevance of this line, because joint criminal enterprise is not part of this case.  I was just wondering  how significant this line of questioning was to the indictment that you have ground to?  
MR. O'SHEA:  
	Well, if it turns out not to be significant, that's good for me.  The Chamber has indicated on a previous occasion, that this category of evidence, in relation to the operation of the government is relevant to the ideology of the Accused.  So the extent to which decisions were collective, which is a matter which was commented on in examination-in-chief is relevant to that and I am covering that ground.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	I'm not stopping you, but you queried about between the so that's what was concerning us.  We've not decided to stop you on this issue as yet.  
MR. O'SHEA:  
	Your Honour, thank you.
BY MR. O'SHEA: 
Q.  	Professor, after the government moved on the 12th, the degree of organisation within the government, in terms of meetings, also reduced, would that be fair?  
A.	I think not, initially.  I think, throughout the month of April and month of May, there was still a fairly high level of organisation and cohesion.  If you look, for example, at the decision to implement the pacification campaign and the sending of representatives of the national level government into the préfecture, as happened with Nyiramasuhuko, and the defendants in Ruhengeri, as happened with a number of ministers who went to Kibuye, these things happened at the end of April and the beginning of May, and was purely the implementation of a policy decision taken at the cabinet level.  So --
MR. WEBSTER:   
	I'm sorry if I'd interrupt.  I don't hear anything coming through.  Do other people share the same problem?  The volume is very low.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	I am hearing, but the volume is less than it was before.  So may be, if you try turning up the volume.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
	The volume is at max, Your Honour.  It's very faint.  I can try another machine, but I'm not hearing anything that the witness is saying. 
	(Pages 76 to 80 by Sheriffo Jammeh)


















1900H
THE WITNESS:
Shall I repeat my answer?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  Mr. Webster is trying another machine.  I think he is ready now.  You can repeat your answer, please.
THE WITNESS:
In response to whether or not the government exhibited a fair level of organisation after its move on April the 12th to Gitarama, I answered that it did, in fact, continue to operate in quite an organised fashion, and I gave as an example of that the implementation of the decision taken at national cabinet level to do pacification campaigns throughout the country and then the way that policy was, in fact, implemented by meetings in Butare involving the president and prime minister and a number of ministers, the meetings in Kibuye involving a number of ministers and the prime minister, and the meeting in Ruhengeri involving two ministers, Nyiramasuhuko and Rwamakuba.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	But, would it be right that, following the 12th, there was a large degree of informality in the way cabinet meetings were brought together?
A.	Well, certainly, the physical circumstances were less formal than in the national capital; that is, people were meeting in unaccustomed quarters in a kind of teacher -- not teacher, but a kind of government training college.  But as for the procedures of the discussion and decision making, according to Kambanda in any case, there was a great deal of effort made to adhere to the same kinds of practices and procedures that had been used in previous governments.
Q.	But there were meetings, were there not, where ministers were not present and it was not seen as too much of a difficulty?
A.	I do not know the attendance at all of the meetings, but certainly there must have been a number of meetings where not all ministers were present because a number of ministers were out of the country for periods of time.
Q.	Are you aware of Kambanda's view that ministers did not come out publicly in meetings supporting the massacres?
A.	I recall his discussing that.  Again, I feel somewhat at a loss in attempting to comment on words that I do not have in front of me, but the impression that I carried from having read his interviews is that, indeed, there was encouragement to give at least nominal agreement to government policy, and that any form of dissent from the policy of killing was discouraged.  He speaks, for example, about the language being relatively explicit in the first meeting between cabinet ministers and the préfets on April the 11th, and how after that time, people impose a form of self-censorship on their own language, so that the clear and explicit description of killings of Tutsi became transformed into a more generalised kind of -- quote, unquote -- "troubles" in an area, or inter-ethnic fighting, rather than killing of Tutsi.  And, certainly, that kind of use of euphemisms or circumlocutions would have been, in some sense, an effort to deal with the desire to achieve unanimity and to gloss over the nasty details of what everyone knew was happening.
Q.	Was it not his view that what people knew they didn't say?
A.	Was this Kambanda's view, is that what you are asking?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Well, rather, it was that they said it, but that they said it in guarded terms.  In other words, they used euphemisms, they used circumlocutions; they didn't say, "In such-and-such a place the Tutsi have been nearly wiped out.  We are almost done."  Rather, they talked about the need to improve security or to finish the pacification of a given area.  So it was a choice of vocabulary which reflected a desire to obfuscate and hide what was happening.  And, in that sense, yes, people did not say what was going on.
Q.	A moment ago when you mentioned the meeting of the 11th, insofar as words were explicit, that was more from the préfets than the ministers, wasn't it? 
A.	I'm sorry, I'm losing you again.  I understood the question to be a reference to the meeting of the 11th, but I didn't understand the second part.
Q.	A moment ago you made a reference to the 11th and more explicit references, and I'm suggesting to you that those more explicit references were coming from the mouth of préfets -- or the reports of préfets rather than the mouth of ministers.
A.	That may well be the case, but I do not have evidence of that.  The description of the meetings -- the descriptions that I am familiar with talked about the meeting as being, essentially, one where the préfets report on what has happened in their areas, and so I suppose they would, indeed, have the floor throughout most of the meetings, but that's not to exclude that there was some reaction from various ministers.
Q.	Yes, I'll come back to that meeting.  Can I take a step backwards for a moment?  I know it's disjointed, but I just want to go back to an issue which I raised before.  Could you turn to tab 25?

I'm just checking, are you still with us, Professor?  Professor, are you still with us?
A.	Hello.
Q.	Yes, can you hear me, Professor?
A.	Yes, I can.
Q.	All right.  Have you found tab 25?
A.	Not quite, but I think I'm in the vicinity.
Q.	Okay.  I was checking that you were still there.
A.	Right, my computer was asleep and slow to wake up, but I think we are getting there.  Is tab 25 a long document, or is it just a page or two?
Q.	It's a fairly long document?
A.	It's about 10 pages, I think.  It's the diagrams.  It's a series of maps, is it?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Yeah, okay, I have the maps.
Q.	All right.  Had you seen these maps before?
A.	No, I had not.
Q.	Are you able to describe to the Court what the maps represent?
A.	Well, I'm just looking through them.  It looks to me like it may be displaced persons' camps.
Q.	Yes.
A.	Yeah, it looks to me like it's camps, indications of the locations of camps that are receiving assistance from international NGOs and where they are located.  I have to say it is strange that they were labelled "secret".
Q.	It looks as though you don't have the front page in front of you.
A.	No, I am coming at it from the end of the document.
Q.	The front page says, "Reserve exclusivement aux autorites Belges".  So this appears to be an intelligence document within the Belgian government.
A.	Okay.  We are moving up slowly.  Indeed, the description of the population applies in early February 1993.
Q.	Um --
A.	The (inaudible) ... The first frame of it says, "Population effected by the offensive of -- up to the first", and the offensive up to the first was nowhere near that significance, but, anyway.  What was your question?
Q.	Yes.  Professor Des Forges, you may not have been speaking into the microphone then, so can I ask you to pay attention to do so.
A.	Okay.  I was -- go ahead with your question.
Q.	Have you -- I don't want you slowly scrolling down your computer again.  Have you looked through these maps in general terms?
A.	Very quickly, yes, enough to have an impression that, as I say, it depicts population movement as a result of the February 8th census of the RPF, February 8th of 1993.
Q.	And does what you see on the maps make sense to you in the context of what you know?
A.	Yes, it's a very interesting depiction.
Q.	Right.  We can leave that document.  I just -- there was just something I hadn't tidied up earlier.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, looking at the time, I don't think that there's any topic that I can complete in 10 or 15 minutes in terms of the topics I have.  I don't know if that means it would be wise to stop here.  Or should I start a topic?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, are you going to finish this cross-examination tomorrow?
MR. O'SHEA:
I believe so.  I'm, of course, willing to assist the Court.  I mean, if there's a reason to exercise a degree of pressure, I am willing to impose that upon myself.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't want to interfere with the rights of the Accused put properly.
MR. O'SEHA:
Of course.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just don't want to have time wasted; two different issues.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  I hope I haven't given the impression to the Court so far that I'm going in that direction.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we should go till 7:30.
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well, Your Honour.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, you indicated earlier that in terms of Prosecution documents you had some, but not all, downloaded.  Can I ask you if you have Exhibit P. 10, entitled "Protocole additionel au protocole d'entente ... du 8 (sic) avril 1992"?
A.	Does someone, by any chance, have an index that keys the groups of documents sent to me with the -- with the P-numbers, because I don't have that?  I believe I must have had the document you mentioned, but the question is where, where in these files I'm going to find it.
MR. O'SHEA:
Mr. Webster may be able to assist.
MR. WEBSTER:
It's included in tab 3 of the Prosecution bundle that was prepared for Alison Des Forges and I believe there's an indication on it; it's P. 10, and there's a P. 10A and a P. 10B.  It should be around the third or the fourth document in, if you turn to tab 3.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Professor Des Forges, are you having any luck in locating the document?  Professor Des Forges, are you still on line?
THE WITNESS:
I am.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you located the document as yet?
THE WITNESS:
No, I have not, Your Honour.  It's complicated, and you probably don't want to know, but I have two computers, only one of which has the capacity to print, but the one that has the capacity to print doesn't have enough memory to download all the documents.  So I had to download them onto the other one so I couldn't print them, and I would have to go and download again, bit by bit, onto the other computer, erasing as I go, in order to be able to print these things.  So, as a result, I don't have a printed copy of the Prosecution index and that makes it difficult for me to locate exactly where these documents are in the set that was sent to me by e-mail.
MR. O'SHEA:
Perhaps I can deal with another matter and it can be looked for overnight.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  If you could give me a list of the P-numbers, I can try to locate them overnight and I can transfer them from one computer to another so I can print them and have them available.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	I will do that at the end.  We are almost there.  If I could just deal with something that I don't need a document for, if I could jump to the meeting of the 19th and the issue of the préfet of Butare, which is a matter you referred to in your examination-in-chief.  Are you aware of the fact that that -- well, first of all, I should ask you: do you know Callixte Kalimanzira or Kalimanzira, Callixte?
A.	I am familiar with his name; I have never met him.
Q.	And was he cabinet director at the interior ministry?
A.	Yes, an acting minister of interior, in effect, until the end of May.
Q.	And was he the direct boss, as it were, of the préfet of Butare?
A.	In the sense that he was replacing the minister of interior, yes.
Q.	So the préfet of Butare would fall under the ministry of interior --
A.	That is correct.
Q.	-- in terms of line of superiority?  Now, are you aware of the fact that Kalimanzira, Callixte, made certain allegations against the préfet of Butare?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And one of those allegations was that the préfet of Butare had imposed a curfew from 1400 hours, to the effect that only Tutsis could go about after that time and not Hutus? 
A.	I had not heard that particular version of Kalimanzira's accusations.  That is very interesting.  I had not heard that previously.
Q.	Had you heard the suggestion that Tutsis were afraid that the Hutus -- sorry, that the Hutus were afraid that the Tutsis were going to eliminate them?
A.	Where and when?
Q.	This is in the same context.  This is Kalimanzira, Callixte, making this assertion, in fact, linking to the thing you don't know about, which might explain why you wouldn't hear of that either, but I don't know.
A.	Well, as I pointed out, as early as 1991, the charge the Tutsi were, in fact, planning a genocide of Hutu had been floated by government propaganda, so this may, indeed, be a continuation of that same kind of thing.  There had been a fair amount of tension within Butare and there were various allegations used to justify attacking Tutsi, one of those allegations being that the Tutsi were, in fact, preparing; digging pits in their living rooms in which they intended to bury Hutu, which is one of the things which I found most remarkable as an accusation, because the idea that a Rwandan would want a dead body in his living room seemed to me quite beyond imagination.  But that kind of thing did circulate at this period.
Q.	The assertion that you don't know about, that the curfew was linked to this, in the sense that it was said that because of this curfew the Hutus were afraid because, by virtue of their communication with each other being delinked, the Tutsis would take advantage of this and kill them.  Does that kind of allegation make sense in the context of what you know?
A.	In the context that Kalimanzira was prepared to say almost anything to get rid of the people he wanted to get rid of, yes, it makes perfect sense.  I mean, it's the sort of thing he might very well have come up.
Q.	He also made an assertion -- whether it was true or not, he made an assertion that the préfet, accompanied by gendarmes, may have gone to kill the bourgmestre of Nyakizu.  Have you heard of that allegation?
A.	Yeah, that I had heard.  In fact, that was on the national radio, not specifically linking it to the préfet, but linking it to a supposed attempt to the kill the bourgmestre of Nyakizu.
Q.	And a further allegation which was made was that the préfet of Butare was transporting Inkotanyi from Burundi to Butare.  Have you heard about that?
A.	I don't know that transporting was the idea; but that he was permitting them to enter, I had heard that accusation, yes.
Q.	A further accusation again made by Kalimanzira, Callixte, an accusation which was conveyed to other ministers, was that the préfet of Butare was arming Tutsis.  Had you heard that allegation?
A.	I don't recall having heard that specific one; Kalimanzira came out with a lot of things.  Basically, he was interested -- Butare was his home turf; he was from that préfecture; he wanted to excel and draw attention to his own personal accomplishments as an implementer of government policy, and in that connection he was ready to say almost anything, apparently, against Habyarimana in order to get rid of him.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, we can probably draw a line there, and I will indicate specific documents I know I need to refer to.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, if overnight you could look for Exhibit P. 10, which I think Mr. Webster has already assisted you with.  Also, if you could look for Exhibit P. 14, which I believe is a communiqué des partis politiques.  These are both documents which you referred to in your examination-in-chief.  I don't know if Mr. Webster can help you with the second to give you some guidance there.
A.	That's okay; I'll look for it.
Q.	All right.
MR. WEBSTER:
If it would be helpful, I can indicate that P. 14 is also in tab 3, so you will find the documents near each other.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, it would be generally helpful, because my cross-examination may take one or more directions, depending on your answers, but it may be helpful if you could locate all of those documents which you discussed during your examination-in-chief.
A.	I don't have a clue what they were.  I have no list of what I referred to.  That's part of the difficulty of being at a distance.  I don't have that available to me.  I don't know what I talked about.
Q.	That's fair enough.  That's fair enough.  If you could try and locate Prosecution Exhibit 20, which is the directives of the prime minister to all préfets on the organisation of civil defence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think that we need to be here while this is taking place, so we will adjourn the court session.  We will rise.  And, Professor Des Forges, if you don't mind --
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- we will ask counsel to provide this information to you.
THE WITNESS:
Actually, Your Honour, in order to make my own engagement I also have to leave.  Perhaps Mr. O'Shea could get my e-mail address from registry and just send me a list and then I'll do my best to locate those documents.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea -- 
THE WITNESS:
That would give him time to reflect a little bit and would save the rest of us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. O'SHEA:
That's fine.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1935H)
