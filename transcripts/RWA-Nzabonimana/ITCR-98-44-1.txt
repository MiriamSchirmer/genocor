17
18
 MR. KINABO:

2O

I have
 no
 observations,
 Mr.
 President.
Mr.
 Joseph
 Nzirorera,
 all
 your
 rights
 have
 been
respected
 as
 a suspect.
 Now
 I give
 you
 the
floor
 if you
 have
 any
 further
 observations.
Yes.
 I thank
 you
 very
 much,
 Mr.
 President.
 I
have
 two
 small
 things,
 if not
 three.
When
 I was
 with
 the
 investigators
 when
 they
arrested
 me
 I asked
 them
 to
 show
 me
 the
 warrant
of arrest
 on
 the
 basis
 of which
 I was
 arrested.
They
 said
 nothing
 to
 me.
 That’s
 No.
 I.
No.
 2,
 I asked
 what
 were
 my crimes
 for
 which
 I
was
 accused.
 I was
 told
 that
 this
 would
 be
 told
to me later.
Thirdly,
 they
 have
 taken
 things
 from
 my
documents.
 They
 took
 away
 these
 documents
without
 any
 report
 and
 I didn’t
 sign
 anything
concerning
 the
 list
 of the
 documentation
 that
they
 bave
 taken
 away
 from
 me
 and
 I don’t
 know
where
 they
 are
 now
 and
 we are
 dealing
 with
 a
delicate
 issue.

So this
 is
 what
 I would
 like
 to
 inform
 the
 Court
of
 but
 otherwise
 all
 the
 other
 procedures
 were
respected
 and
 I thank
 you,
 Mr°
 President.
5
 MR. PRESIDENT:
I told
 your
 colleagues
 that
 the
 prosecutor
 had
6
the
 right
 to request
 for
 your
 arrest
 if
 there
7
are
 other
 things
 which
 were
 done,
 if
 there
 were
8
things
 which
 were
 taken
 from
 you
 by the
 police
9
in Benin.
I0
il
 THE
 ACCUSED:
Yes,
 it
 is
 the
 Benin
 police
 following
12
instructions
 from
 the
 investigators.
 I would
13
wish
 that
 the
 list
 of
 documents
 be
 identified
 so
14
that
 one
 day
 or
 another
 I can
 indeed
 say
 that
15
these
 documents
 indeed
 did
 come
 from
 my
16
residence.
17
18
 MR.
 PRESIDENT:
Yes,
 during
 the
 seizure
 there
 should
 be
 a report
19
which
 you
 were
 supposed
 to
 sign.
 So
 we
 have
2O
taken
 due
 note
 of this.
21
22
 THE
 ACCUSED:
I thank
 you
 very
 much,
 Mr.
 President.
23
24
 MR.
 PRESIDENT:
Thank
 you,
 Mr.
 Nzirorera.
 You
 may
 withdraw.
