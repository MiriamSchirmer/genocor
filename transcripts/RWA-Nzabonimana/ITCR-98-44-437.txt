MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

And before you continue your testimony, Witness, we would like to remind you that you made a 
solemn declaration to tell the truth and that you should keep it in mind as you continue to testify. 
THE WITNESS:
I take due note of that, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But before you continue, let's have the appearances of counsel, beginning with the Prosecution. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearance for the Prosecutor is as before. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  This morning, the Defence is composed of 
Nathalie Le Blanc, for the Accused, and myself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The testimony of the witness is resumed.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Counsel. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I am requesting for us to continue in a closed session since the questions I am going to put to this witness may disclose his identity.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, could you arrange for us to go into closed session for the reasons given by 
Prosecution counsel. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 25] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 2 by Haruna Farage) 
































MR. MWAMASANGULA:
We are in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

Witness T24, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you well, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, kindly arrange to administer the oath to the witness. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Declaration made by Witness T24 in Kinyarwanda)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness T24, welcome to the Tribunal.  We would like to make sure your stay is comfortable.  Open your microphone before you speak and switch it off when you are done.  And sit very close to it so that the interpreters and everybody else can hear you clearly.  

We would now like to take you through the procedures that obtain here.  You will begin your testimony in-chief and you will be led to establish that evidence by the Defence, which is seated on your left-hand.  

The Prosecution side, which is seated on your right, in front of the translation booth, will also have an opportunity to put questions to you.  

The Judges, all three of them, may put questions to you at any time during your testimony.  

Make your narrative short and precise.  And while you give your evidence, make breaks in between your sentences to ease and facilitate the work of translation and recording your evidence.  

Answer the questions in a direct manner.  You are required to answer all questions put to you by all the parties in this case, including the Judges.  If you have not understood a question, ask for a question to be repeated or clarified.  We require all parties in this proceeding to be courteous to you and we expect similar courtesy from you towards all the parties.  If you follow these simple instructions we hope that we would quickly come to the end of your testimony.  

One last matter I would like to bring to your attention is that, we conduct these proceedings in open sessions where the public is allowed to attend, and in closed sessions where the public is excluded.  Whether or not we are in open or closed session will depend on what you are testifying about.  

If the Trial Chamber considers that your testimony may disclose your identity, it will order the testimony to be taken in closed session.  Therefore, when we are in closed session, feel free to mention everything, including any particulars that may identify you.  But when we are in open session, as we are right now, where the public is allowed to attend, be careful not to mention anything that may disclose your identity.  And if you have any problem or if you consider that the answer that you might give might identify you, do not hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber.  

Witness, we would now like to know whether you have understood the procedures and the instructions that have been given to you.  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel.  
WITNESS T24,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good day, Witness.  
A.	Good day, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, could you get closer to the microphone, if you can.  And try to speak loudly so that we can hear you.  

You should have before you a document, which is your personal identification sheet.  Do you see that document on the table? 
A.	Yes, I have the document before me.  
Q.	Could you please verify the document?  Go through it and tell us if there are any errors.  
A.	It is correct.  
Q.	Very well.  Can you now sign the document? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, we request -- we would like to have this document tendered into evidence.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection, Prosecution Counsel?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
No objection, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President, it would be Exhibit -- Defence Exhibit No. 11. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification sheet for Witness T24 is entered as Defence Exhibit No. 11, under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of this witness, who is a protected witness.
(Exhibit No. D. 11 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel, we are in open session.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, I am sorry, the questions I shall be asking as of this moment might directly identify the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will now go in closed session for the reasons given by learned counsel.  This is a protected witness.  Members of public, we regret, you have to leave now.  

Registry, could you arrange for us to go into closed session.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 29 to 62] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
