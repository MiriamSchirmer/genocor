P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 28th November 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same?  I must, first of all, apologise for our late start this morning after discussions over the weekend, when we discussed the importance of maximising our effective sitting time, but we had a few logistical management matters to discuss and settle, which accounted for a little longer than we had anticipated.  I apologise for our late start.

Mr. Witness, good morning.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're now going to resume your testimony.  I remind you that you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began last week.  Your cross-examination will be continued, and Mr. Prosecutor will continue examining you.
MR. HOOPER:
Just before that continues, can I just indicate that the next witness who has been produced this morning was not the anticipated witness that I've said that for my part poses no difficulty.  Secondly, that I received a telephone call on Friday afternoon relating to possibly sitting full days on several days -- three days perhaps of this week.  And I don't know if that's still the position.  And for our part, we're anxious to use the available time, but it will require some attentive housekeeping on our part, and a degree, I hope, of tolerance by both our friends in the Prosecution and perhaps the Chamber in terms of who is available and the rest of it.

And we haven't fully digested the potential of that opportunity in terms of those witnesses, but we're pretty sure that we can probably occupy most of the available time.

So that is our position at present.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper.  We are hoping that during the course of today, we will be able to have some further discussions with you and the Prosecutor and to get a firm decision on these matters.  Some other information has arisen, because part of the issue has to do with the utilisation of the courtroom by the other trial, which is currently in progress assigned for afternoon sessions.  So it is in connection with the relationship between the utilisation of courtroom space between the two cases that we have been involved in some discussions.  So during the course of today, I think our trial coordinator will have some further discussions with yourself and the Prosecutor, and we hope that we're able to get a firm decision as to how we proceed for the rest of the trial session.  So thank you for your indication that you will work along with us in that area.
MS. FALL:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I should like to respond merely to what Counsel Hooper has said with regard to the order of appearance of witnesses, if I've correctly understood.  I think he said that the next witness is not the witness provided for on the list of witnesses, and I should like to say that the Prosecution is not in a position to take on any other witness than that initially provided for.  So if another witness is to appear today who is not the witness that was originally programmed to appear, we will have to ask for an adjournment.
MR. MORLEY:
It would be our suggestion, respectfully, Your Honour, that in the time that it will take for me to complete my cross-examination of the present witness, that my learned friends make arrangements for the witness that they have brought accidentally today to be brought back to her accommodation and for the appropriate witness, who we were expecting, to be brought to court.  There will be plenty of time for that to happen, and it should not cause any real difficulty on the part of the Defence.  That would be our request, that we send the mistaken witness back, and we get the proper one in the interim while I'm cross-examining.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, has Mr. Morley correctly stated the position?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  And, certainly, if there is going to be time to cross-examine the second witness, otherwise we could just take the present one here in chief today.  But I'm quite happy to send this one back empty and have the next one brought here.

As long as an explanation -- well, we'll get someone to go and see the witness and explain the position.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will our trial coordinator be able to assist in that area?  Could I ask the trial coordinator to assist -- to offer any assistance?

MR. HOOPER:
No.  WVS are normally extremely -- well, we have absolutely no criticism of them at all, and, in fact, I saw one of their -- the party responsible for movements of witnesses this morning, and he told me he had brought the wrong one, and I rather misguidedly, as it turned out, said we'll carry on as we are.  But I can see if it's a problem, it's a problem -- return this one and get the next one.  It's not a problem.

And the witness who is going to be brought is 9/1 -- I repeat, 9/1, who I think at one time has flown under the flag of 10/1, but that was an initial printing error two months ago.  It's 10/1/9/1.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Hopefully that issue has now been resolved and we can commence -- recommence with the --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, Mr. President, could you bring your microphone a bit closer?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  I think -- I was merely saying that we're now ready to recommence the cross-examination of the witness.  So, Mr. Witness, could you put back on your headphone?  Thank you.  I think the preliminary matters have now been dealt with, and the Prosecutor will now continue to examine you.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, sir.  
WITNESS 6/10,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	On Thursday, Mr. Witness, you told us that you arrived at Kayanga health centre on the 15th of April, and that whilst in one of the wards you observed four people being taken from the health centre, dragged, beaten, taken away, you believe to be killed; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	On Thursday, you also told us that the person who appeared to be in charge of the murder of that group was the brigadier; that's right, is it?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Would it be right that you and your family would have been in fear of being dragged out and murdered as well?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Would it be right that the dragging away of the four people from where you were in refuge made quite a strong impression upon you?
A.	You are quite correct, it really scared me.
Q.	Would it be right that it is the sort of event you would not forget?
A.	I will never be able to forget it.
Q.	In your statement to the ICTR investigators of the 11th of August of 1999, you refer to being at the health centre; do you understand?
A.	Yes, I understand.
Q.	You do not refer to seeing people dragged out of the health centre to be murdered; do you understand?
A.	I understand.
Q.	In your statement to the Defence of the 5th of April of 2004, you refer to being at the health centre; do you understand?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You do not refer to seeing people dragged out to be murdered; do you understand?
A.	I understand, Counsel, but I have a comment to make on that score.  In answering the questions in my statement, I was following the order in the way in which the questions were put to me.  I did not volunteer information.  I did not elaborate.  I answered the questions put to me.  With regard to the statement of 1999, you will see certain points in common with my statement to the Defence.  I agree that they are infrequent, but that all depends on the questions put to me.
Q.	In your statement to the Defence of the 22nd of July of 2004, you refer to being in Kayanga; do you understand?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You do not refer to seeing anybody dragged out of the health centre to be murdered; do you understand?
A.	I have the impression that I did mention that fact, that event, in that statement.  Moreover, at the time of being questioned here by Defence counsel, Defence counsel put questions to me about that, which shows, well, that I did mention that point in my statement to the Defence.
Q.	I have no doubt that my learned friend Mr. Hooper will correct me if I'm wrong in suggesting that you have not mentioned watching people being taken from the health centre to be murdered in any of your statements so far disclosed.  That being the case, what I would like to ask you now is about the questions and the answers which arose when you saw Defence counsel more recently, because it's my suggestion to you that you have only told the Defence very recently about your description of seeing people dragged from the health service -- I'm sorry, I keep calling it "service" -- the health centre.  It's only recently that you observed people being dragged from the health centre as part of your story of events in Rwanda.  Now, do you understand the suggestion I'm making?
A.	I understand your suggestion, but I don't agree with you; if my memory serves me right, that is.  You say that I made a statement to the Defence on the 22nd of July 2004.  Well, on that day I didn't meet them, as I told you on Thursday -- it's -- perhaps you got that information from the statement in regard to that date.
Q.	Do you accept that you have not recorded in an interview or a statement, ever, the suggestion that you saw people being dragged to their deaths at the health centre?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm afraid that's much broader than the last and specific question as to whether he had referred to it in disclosed interviews.  But I have my own counsel notes of meeting or meetings with the witness, which I know must have been reflected in the cross-examination or, rather, the examination-in-chief of this witness.  And this witness may not, and would not, I suspect, be aware of the distinctions between those kinds of documents that we know about.  So, if you can pose your question in a rather less specific way so that the witness himself isn't misled into what is being said.
MR. MORLEY:
I'm grateful to my learned friend for his contribution just then.  It's quite clear that what is being implicitly put before the Court is that there is not a disclosed statement from this witness to show that he was going to say anything about murders at the Kayanga health centre.  But what is of interest to me is when was it he first said to my learned friend about murders at Kayanga health centre.  Now, maybe my learned friend is in a position to assist us with when that was, and that the witness is not in the best position to remember the date.  I have asked the witness, and suggested to the witness, that murders at the Kayanga health centre have only been mentioned first to my learned friend, the Defence counsel, in recent interviews.  Now, if I'm right about that, it may be of assistance for that to be on the record.
MR. HOOPER:
I can't recall if this was mentioned in July of 2005 by this witness, and I would need to go to my note on that.  But I was aware in July 2005 that this witness could speak of it, and I took his evidence in respect to that, or his instructions, on 15th of November this year, together with other matters that have been obviously alluded to in his evidence that do not appear in his previous statement.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, that is helpful.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	In your narrative, Mr. Witness, of the horrific events that befell you and your family in Rwanda in 1994, first in your statement in 1999, then in your statement in April 2004, then in your statement in July of 2004, having referred to being at the Kayanga health centre in each of those three statements, what is your explanation on those three occasions, separate occasions, distinct occasions, for your not mentioning anything about seeing murders at the health centre?
A.	You're speaking of three occasions.  Well, in the course of the current year, I mentioned that incident -- maybe I didn't mention it in 1999, but as regards 2004, I tell you that I did not meet the Defence investigator in July.  However, in July this year I did meet with the Defence team, and I remember that on that occasion I mentioned the incident in question.  As I told you, it is an incident, a fact, an event that I can never forget inasmuch as when those poor people were dragged off, an assailant approached me with a spear, he was screaming, shouting very loudly, screaming for my wife because he could see through the window pane, and he dragged another person, who was next to us -- dragged them off.  You know, I took a solemn oath to speak the truth before testifying.  I am speaking the truth, not in order to -- for the Accused in this trial to win the case.  I speak the truth in order to contribute to discovering the truth, giving additional information to bring out the truth.  
In 1999, I did not mention this incident.  But if you look closely, you will see questions were put to me that were not directly connected to my present testimony; in fact, they were more or less preliminary questions.

On three occasions I met the Defence team, and I think that over the three occasions I did at least once mention that incident to the Defence team.
Q.	When?
A.	I think it was in July of this year.  I also mentioned it this month while I was here in Arusha already.
Q.	So what is your explanation for not mentioning it before July of this year, this incident you told us was very memorable?
A.	Insofar as that statement is concerned, I have told you that in statements I answered questions that were put to me.  For instance, when I met the Prosecution investigators, they merely asked me to give them a broad view of the situation.  They did not ask for details from me.  As for my own personal experience, I have related them in other statements that I gave subsequently.  I, therefore, only answered questions that were put to me and this, depending on the objective of those who put questions to me.
Q.	Your statement to the investigators of 1999 is three-and-a-bit pages long in tight typescript, recounting all the horrible events that occurred with you and your family.  And your only reference to Kayanga health centre is to say you stayed there for a few days.  You were --
MR. HOOPER:
Can you give the dates that he states that he stayed there?  
MR. MORLEY:
No, thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
You should give the evidence more fairly and fully.
MR. MORLEY:
No, thank you.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	In respect of your statement in 1999, you were asked about everything that happened to you, and the only thing that you said about Kayanga health centre is that you stayed there.  Why is there no description of what happened there?
A.	As you have just said, I gave an account of all that happened to me.  You should understand that I gave that statement in reply to questions put to me by investigators.  So you should foreground the fact that I talked about my personal experience, which means that the investigators were interested in knowing what had happened to me rather than what had happened or occurred in general, and that is why my answer was veered towards what happened to me personally.
Q.	On the 5th of April 2004, you gave a four-and-a-half page reasonably tight typescript statement describing all the events that befell you and your family -- no mention of Kayanga health centre murders.  Are you saying the Defence didn't ask you about those; is that the position?
A.	I cannot recollect the questions that were put to me on that occasion, but I think I answered all questions that were put to me.  Furthermore, I can tell you that what I said didn't capture all that happened.  There are many things that happened.  There are many horrific things and atrocities that occurred.
Q.	You're a friend of the Rwamakuba family, and you have volunteered a piece of information about the health centre in order to suggest that Rwamakuba wasn't present at the health centre.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	No.  That wasn't my motivation in giving information.  I talked and I provided answers to questions that you were put to me.  I cannot say that Rwamakuba was there while he wasn't there when I didn't see him.  I did not give the statement in order to defend him at all costs or to serve his case.  All I did was give an account of what happened there.
Q.	You told us on Thursday under cross-examination that you were aware there had been a massacre of many Tutsi at the health centre on an occasion -- a day before you arrived at the health service -- centre.  Do you remember saying that last Thursday?
A.	I told you that it is possible that the massacre might have taken place at that location.  You say that it concerned many people, but I know nothing of it.  From information that I got, there were people or persons that had been massacred, but I cannot tell you their number.
Q.	Why did you not tell us when you were describing what you knew of what happened at the health centre, when my learned friend Mr. Hooper was asking you questions, that what you saw related to four people and that you were aware there had, in fact, been an earlier massacre when you'd not been present?
A.	I talked about four persons because I witnessed what happened to them.  I saw them when they were being dragged outside.  I saw what happened to them, and I have just told you, in answer to a previous question, I have said that I haven't given an account of all that happened at that location.  Furthermore, in respect of Kayanga, when I was talking about Kayanga to the Defence counsel, he told me, "Well, leave that aside.  Your wife is going to talk to us about."  And the truth be told, I had gone there to see my wife and see if I could do something for her, and it is my wife who described what she saw happening at the health centre prior to my arrival there.  She described to me what happened before her own eyes.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, let's move on to another subject.  You're aware that André Rwamakuba was a prominent member of the MDR; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Within Gikomero commune, he was probably the most prominent member of the MDR; would that be right?
A.	I cannot confirm that he was the most prominent member of MDR, because you also had Gasana who was of the same commune as himself.  They belonged to the same political party.  I, therefore, cannot be in a position to say who was the most important or the more important of those two personalities.
Q.	There were MDR meetings which took place in late 1993 and early 1994 in Gikomero commune; that's right, isn't it?
A.	I believe that rallies were held, because those political parties, be it the MRND or the MDR, usually held rallies.
Q.	You did not attend these rallies; is that correct?
A.	No, I didn't attend any rally of any political party.
Q.	You did not know who was at those rallies if you did not attend them; you'd agree with that?  Thank you.  
A.	No, I cannot know those who attended the meetings.  The only thing is that I was duly informed of what was happening at the rally, and sometimes they would tell us that this person, this prominent figure or this other one took part at the meeting, or that this prominent figure did not attend the meeting.  That is all I had as information.
Q.	There were rallies in Sha and Shango and in Nduba in the late part -- in October, November 1993 and January 1994; would you disagree with that?  Do you know anything about it?  Thank you.
A.	Yes, I am aware of those rallies, but I cannot tell you the dates on which those rallies were held.  I cannot tell you that this rally was organised on this date and at this location, for instance.
Q.	Would you agree that the rallies of the MDR that I've described, from what you remember of this period in Rwanda, were around about the time of late 1993/early 1994, or are you unable to say at all when they took place?
A.	I think I have already told you that I cannot give either date or month in which the rallies were held, but I think those rallies started being organised with effect from the time multiparty politics was ushered into the country.  That is 1992, for instance.  The multiparty politics didn't begin in 1992, but the rallies started being organised in 1992.  It was mostly the MRND and MDR parties that held meetings in the rally.  There was also the PSD and PL parties, but their rallies were less frequently organised since their membership was not sizeable in our commune.  I, therefore, cannot say that the rallies started being organised only in late 1993.
Q.	At these rallies there were people who spoke of Hutu extremism.  Now, you may not have attended the rally, but you know that to be true; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, that wasn't the case.  I didn't have such information in any case and, as I said earlier on in my testimony, those parties actually did not focus their efforts on ethnicism; they, rather, wanted to destroy each other -- the parties.  Each party criticised other parties so that the members of other parties could join theirs.

As for the extremists, I did not quite monitor or follow that closely.  During their discussions, debates, political parties did not focus on the ethnic matters.
Q.	Have you come to the attention of a Gacaca in Nduba as someone who might be investigated for saying things before the genocide?
A.	Yes.  During Gacaca hearings, we noticed that people rely -- or base themselves on ethnicity.  There is an ethnic group that exterminated another, and it is seen that during the genocide people based themselves or their actions on the ethnic issues.
Q.	Has your name been mentioned at a Gacaca in Nduba in connection with saying things prior to the genocide?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the Prosecutor repeat his question, please, says the Kinyarwanda booth interpreter?
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Has your name been mentioned at a Gacaca in Nduba in connection with saying things before the genocide?
A.	No, my name has never been mentioned at Gacaca hearings.
Q.	You told us on Thursday that you know the person who's marked as number 10 on the list of names given to you last week by my learned friend, Mr. Hooper.  Perhaps if you might have that document again?
A.	Yes, I do remember number 10.
Q.	Now, without mentioning number 10's name, you are aware that number 10 has been a Prosecution witness in this case; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, I'm aware of that.
Q.	You know number 10, and number 10 knows you; that's right, isn't it?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did you say before the genocide took place, things against the Tutsis?
A.	No, I said nothing bad about the Tutsis.
Q.	Your wife was Tutsi; that's right, is it not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	She was spared; that's right, is it not?
A.	Yes, she was able to survive.
Q.	She was spared because of her being your wife; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No.  I believe that during my testimony I told you that we were attacked and she almost got killed, and we had to flee in order that she shouldn't be killed, since the assailants had told us that, for now, they were merely looting, but that they were going to return to look for my wife.  So, you see that I myself was in a rather embarrassing situation.
Q.	You knew the brigadier; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	The brigadier had power of life or death over your wife at Kayanga; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, he had the right over life and death, so far as my wife was concerned.
Q.	You tell us that the brigadier was coordinating the murder of Tutsis all around you; is that right?
A.	Yes, that was my testimony.
Q.	The brigadier was a Hutu extremist; you'd agree with that, yes?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You were able to speak to him, weren't you?
A.	Which period are you referring to, Mr. Prosecutor?
Q.	In case it's not obvious, the period during the genocide when you were in the hands or the control of the brigadier who had life or death power over your wife, that period.  You were able to speak to him, weren't you?
A.	No, I was not able to speak to the brigadier.  As I told you, when we met the brigadier on the day he took my wife, I was not able to speak to my wife.  He brought his car, his vehicle, and said, "I would like to evacuate you, to take you away.  Let your wife get into the car."  I made my wife go into the car and he started driving off immediately after that.  Besides, he was carrying a weapon, and I never had the opportunity of talking with him again, later.
Q.	Did you hold similar views to the brigadier about the Tutsis which made the brigadier spare your wife?
A.	He wanted to do something bad to my wife.  I have told you that he took my wife, he took away my children, and took them to Rutunga, where he handed them over to killers.  Fortunately, my wife saw a house and ran with the children to the house of a neighbour, and that neighbour welcomed her, and the killers didn't have the opportunity of killing her.  Therefore, I would not say that it was the brigadier's intention to save my wife -- quite the contrary.
Q.	You were gaoled for being thought to be a Hutu extremist; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, that is not the case.  I was put in prison six months after I returned from exile.  I don't know for which reasons I was arrested and put into prison.  Investigations were conducted, and it was later that I got to know that I was being suspected of having collaborated with the infiltrators.  I, therefore, was not detained on grounds of my being an extremist, and I think I should avail myself of this opportunity to give some explanations.

I should -- I would tell you that nobody had confidence in me.  I could not go into a bar and discuss normally with those people.  They did not trust me because my wife was Tutsi.  And, secondly, they were not very sure that I was 100 per cent Hutu.  They thought I was a Tutsi who had changed his ethnicity.  Most of the time they held these discussions in pubs, which is the reason wherefore I could not go close to them while they were in those pubs.
Q.	You were thought to be somebody who was anti-RPF and, therefore, gaoled.  There was an investigation and you were let out, but initially you were denounced by Rutabagirwa, isn't that right?
A.	Actually, when you are accused of being an infiltrator, this means automatically -- this means automatically that you are accused of being against the RPF.  I was being accused of being an infiltrator, which means that I was suspected of being against the RPF.
Q.	When we looked at a document put forward by my learned friend Mr. Hooper on Thursday, the document discloses that the principal informer was Rutabagirwa; do you remember that?
A.	Yes, that is the case.
Q.	You were saying on Thursday that he was a reliable informer, and it was interesting he hadn't mentioned Rwamakuba; do you remember that?
A.	No, Rutabagirwa has never accused Rwamakuba of anything whatsoever, since we see that in the documents he doesn't mention him as one of the organisers of the genocide in Gikomero.
Q.	You were saying he was a reliable informer; do you remember that?
A.	Are you referring to Rutabagirwa?  I told you -- well, I did not say that he was a reliable person.  I told you that this is somebody who was in charge of the commune, and that the information that he has is information that he received from other persons.  Each secteur had a conseiller, and there were responsable of the cellules, and there are still responsable of the cellules, and that all the members of the population could give him all the information of the events that occurred during the genocide.  So the fact that nobody has ever mentioned Rwamakuba's name to him as being amongst one of the planners or killers in the genocide, what this means is that Rwamakuba never got to Gikomero.  Otherwise, all those inhabitants of the area, all those members of the population, and all those responsable of cellules would have talked to him about that.
Q.	All I asked you was had you been saying on Thursday that he was a reliable informer, and your response has been to say: he's not that reliable, and then to tell us how André Rwamakuba can't possibly be responsible --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Listen to the question.  Here's your problem.  If he's a reliable informer, he informed against you.  If he's not a reliable informer, it means nothing that he doesn't mention Rwamakuba.  Which is it?
A.	I did not say that he was a reliable person.  What I said is that a person who has given all information about what happened in his commune couldn't have forgotten to remember Rwamakuba's name.  Otherwise, if I see the charges that he had against me -- I'm talking about charges concerning Rushashi and Rutongo communes, I cannot consider him as one of the cred -- reliable persons, because these are all fabrications.  My question, therefore, is as follows.  He is the bourgmestre who gave all the information in respect of what happened in his commune, and information that he got from all quarters, how could he have forgotten to mention Rwamakuba's name?  
Q.	You told us about vehicles on the roads during the genocide; do you remember that -- on Thursday?
A.	Well, the question was put to me as to whether it was possible for vehicles to leave Kigali and go to Gikomero.  My answer to you was that the vehicles that normally were in Gikomero commune are those that could move about inside the commune.
Q.	You told us on Thursday there were no military vehicles on the roads; do you remember that?
A.	Yes, I can remember having said that.
Q.	You told us on Thursday that the only vehicles on the roads were a commune ambulance, a car belonging to a man called Kayunga, and a car belonging to somebody called Kambanda -- I may have the spelling wrong.  Those were the only vehicles you were suggesting were on the roads after the genocide began.  Do you remember saying that last Thursday?
A.	I also mentioned among those vehicles the priest's vehicle that had been confiscated by Brigadier Nyarwaya.  That vehicle could also move about within the commune.
Q.	How come you missed the four Toyotas loaded with Interahamwe going off to Gikomero centre?
A.	I did not forget those vehicles.  It is merely because I did not see them.  I told you that the Interahamwe came from Rubungo in a vehicle.  I did not know if the vehicle was a Toyota model car.  They got to Gishaka and looted the property of a certain Kambanda and left.  As for the four Toyotas, I don't have any knowledge of them.
Q.	What about the bus that was floating around?
A.	I did not see any bus moving around, except on the 14th, when I saw a bus coming from Bumbogo and which was carrying soldiers, and it was said that the soldiers were going to Gasabo.  I only saw soldiers in the bus.  Ten minutes later, however, the vehicle came back, since it was being said that the soldiers were going to fight the Inkotanyi, but ten minutes later I saw the soldiers coming back.
Q.	You didn't tell us about the bus on Thursday with the soldiers.  Why was that?
A.	It is not easy to recollect or to remember all vehicles.  I did not include on the list all vehicles, but I've told you that since the 6th of April soldiers had a military post in Gikomero and no vehicles were moving around where the soldiers were.  Those soldiers left, and at a certain point in time I saw another bus carrying soldiers that came back from the Gasabo -- from the direction of Gasabo.  As for saying that I did not mention that bus, well, I must say that I merely forgot to mention it.
Q.	What you forgot to mention was the movement of people committing murders.  You only made mention on Thursday of a businessman's car, of Kambanda's car, and an ambulance.  You've now told us that you were aware of the movement of Interahamwe Toyota vehicles and -- thank you -- about the bus.  There was movement on the roads of people committing murders; that's right, isn't it?
A.	I think I mentioned a vehicle that was carrying the Interahamwe last Thursday.  I told you that a group of Interahamwe from Rubungo came from Gishaka.  I don't think it's the first time I mentioned that vehicle.  The only vehicle that I just remembered now at this moment was the bus carrying the soldiers.  I remembered Kayunga's vehicle carrying his family, as well as Kambanda's vehicle, the ambulance, as well as the priest's vehicle.  Those were vehicles we saw all the time in the commune.  They drove around all the time in the commune.
Q.	It's part of the Prosecution case that Rwamakuba, in company with some military people, encouraged the killing of Tutsis at various locations in Gikomero commune.  Now, if he was with the military, he would have been able to move around; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, that isn't true.  I have told you that those soldiers came through Bumbogo on the 14th, and the killings had already begun.  Moreover, I never saw another military vehicle.  I never saw Rwamakuba, either alone or in the company of soldiers, at least in the secteurs where I was. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, we missed the place name, if you want it elucidated -- interpreter's note.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Is that why you didn't mention seeing military vehicles on the road on Thursday when you were trying to help your friend Rwamakuba to suggest that he couldn't have moved around Gikomero commune?
A.	No, I did not omit mentioning that vehicle on purpose.  I told you a while back that I only mentioned the vehicles that belonged to the commune, so to speak.  You put the question to me as to which vehicles could drive around on the 7th, 8th and 9th, so I mentioned those vehicles which were local vehicles from our commune.

I also mentioned the vehicle that came from Rubungo carrying Interahamwe.  As to the military vehicle, I couldn't recall that vehicle.  I told you that the soldiers came in a bus.
Q.	You're not going to suggest, are you, that you saw every vehicle on the road throughout the time of the genocide in Rwanda?  Do you accept that you may have missed vehicles?
A.	I told you that in the places where I went, or from the information I obtained, because one can say what one saw or what one has heard about.  I was not ubiquitous, only present, of course.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, is that a convenient moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.  We will take a short recess now for about 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1031H to 1105H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley, you may resume.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	You saw Rwamakuba in Gitarama; that's right, is it?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	At Murambi; is that right?
A.	No, I saw him in Gitarama town.
Q.	He was there as part of the government; that's right, isn't it?
A.	I met him on the road, like any passerby, but it is true that when I met him that it was at a time when the government was moving from one location to another while in flight.
Q.	This was in May of 1994 you told us; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	The bulk of the murders had been committed by the Interahamwe throughout Rwanda and Gikomero commune; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, that's possible.
Q.	In May of 1994 were you aware that the government in which Rwamakuba was a minister was in the process of adopting the Interahamwe as part of a civil defence?
A.	In my opinion, the government was doing nothing good or bad, and it would appear to me that it was a useless government.
Q.	Did I understand your evidence correctly that you've just volunteered an opinion that the government in which Rwamakuba was a minister was doing nothing, good or bad; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is my opinion.  The government was of no use -- was useless, because it was doing nothing good for Rwandans.
Q.	There was a genocide taking place in Rwanda; we're agreed on that, are we?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And is it your evidence that Rwamakuba's government was doing nothing about it?
A.	Where I was, I was under the impression that the government was doing nothing.  We were in exile and we had no instructions, and there was no authority, so to speak.  It was total chaos, anarchy.
Q.	Did Rwamakuba say to you that he was going to resign and get himself out of this useless government, as you put it, which was overseeing or presiding over a genocide throughout the country?
A.	We did not broach that subject.
Q.	Did Rwamakuba say to you, "It's a terrible thing that's happening in Rwanda.  I wish I could do more.  There's nothing that can be done."  You certainly haven't suggested he ever said anything like that.  
A.	You know, we did not have any conversation, as it were.  After (unintelligible) I knew him like somebody I knew before.  We did not stay together, not even for five minutes.  I greeted him and continued on my way to the camp where I was.
Q.	Did you not say to him, Rwamakuba, someone who is your neighbour and also a government minister, "Have you any idea what's happened to me and my family in the last month?  What on earth are you people doing to stop all of this?" 
A.	I said nothing to him concerning what had happened to me.  All I did was tell him about the death of his father and I did that in reply to his question -- the question he put to me, asking what was news from home.
Q.	Rwamakuba asked you for news from home, and you did not raise with him the appalling events which had befallen your family; is that right?
A.	No, I did not talk to him about that.
Q.	You've just told us Rwamakuba raised with you events from home, and you did not tell him about the appalling events that had befallen your family; is that right?
A.	I should have told you that he asked me about news of his family.  I didn't mean to say that he asked me what was the news from his area.
Q.	You fled with the Hutu murderers to the Congo; that's right, isn't it?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You did not wait for the RPF to come to town and bring some form of order to the murder which had been going on all around; that's right, is it?
A.	You want me to tell you if I didn't think about that.  Can you please repeat the question?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	You joined with the exodus of people who feared reprisal from the RPF; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You feared reprisal from the RPF; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Well, I had to proceed on my way.  As I told you, when I was in Kayanga on the 17th, I refused to go with those who had taken camp there and who, on that date, fled from the RPF.  I refused to go on along with them.  It is the soldiers of the RPF who compelled me to leave with my children.  When they found me at that location, they told me that they were going to take my wife, and they asked me to leave and to follow my kind of people, so I had earlier refused to flee with the others.
Q.	As I understand what you've just said, despite having a Tutsi wife, the exodus of Hutu murderers to the Congo were your kind of people, and so you joined with them; is that right?
A.	It was not a personal decision.  I had wanted to remain in Rwanda, but the RPF soldiers told me to leave and not to stay near them.  If I had remained there, things would have happened differently.  You can see that under the circumstances I was forced to leave and go away.  I was left with no option.
Q.	Is that right, Mr. Witness; you were left with no option when you found yourself walking to the Congo from Gikomero?  Did you have something to hide?  Were you part of the bad things that took place in Rwanda?
A.      	Well, it was not possible for me to choose.  I fled with the others towards Congo.  And, by the way, my trip wasn't smooth; it wasn't good.  I was stopped at a certain roadblock.  I was almost killed.  And as I told you before, and I'm repeating this, I was saved by the grace of God.  I was not fleeing because I had participated in the massacre or collaborated with the killers.  I fled because I told myself that there were bad things that were happening.  And, by the way, the trip was not a very good one.  I didn't say everything in my evidence.  There were certain things -- certain bad things that took place either while I was on my way or in the refugee camp while I was in Congo, up until when I returned home.
Q.	Your wife would have been safer to remain with the RPF as a Tutsi.  That would have been right, wouldn't it?
A.	Yes, that is true.
Q.	You took her to the Congo with the Hutu murderers; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Whom are you talking about, Counsel?
Q.	You took your wife to the Congo with the Hutu murderers; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, we did not go together.  My wife did not come with me.
Q.	Thank you.  I want to be clear about your evidence.  Was your wife in the Congo, or did she stay in Rwanda?
A.	She stayed in Rwanda.
Q.	She could have spoken for you amongst the RPF when they arrived, and helped you so that nothing happened to you.  What is it that made you fear staying with your wife in Rwanda?
A.	I have told you that there was nothing my wife could do.  She had no power.  And, by the way, it was the RPF soldiers who chose to go with my wife and asked me to leave.  I have also told you that it was a person -- a recruit of sorts who had joined the RPF ranks in the course of the week, and that was the person who decided that I should leave, because the person seemed to be the guide of the soldiers who did not quite know the country.  I had no choice and my wife had no power to be able to decide otherwise.  She said she wanted me to remain with her, and that I should go along with her.  But the soldiers refused.
Q.	When you were in Gitarama speaking to Rwamakuba and not complaining about what had happened to the Tutsis in your local area, is that because you accepted the genocide?
A.	How can I be indifferent to the genocide?  The massacres alone were repulsive to me.  I talked to him in any case about the massacres, because I talked to him about his father's death and also of the death of his brother-in-law.  That is all I mentioned to him, actually.
Q.	Did you just say a moment ago that you talked to him about the massacres, or not?
A.	I have just told you that I talked to him of the death of his father, and of his brother-in-law.  It appeared to me that those were the deaths that had to be revealed to him personally.  

Now, as concerns massacres or the genocide visited upon the Tutsis, these were things that were being done.  This is what was happening in the country generally and it was well known that the Tutsis were being killed.
Q.	And although you talked about deaths to Rwamakuba, you uttered not one word, is this right, about what was well known about the killing of Tutsis in Rwanda; is that right?
A.	I have just given you an account of what I told him.  That is all I told him while we were together.  I went and looked for money, which I didn't have, by the way, and that is when I met him, greeted him, and in about five minutes that followed we went our separate ways and I went away.
Q.	Radio RTLM was broadcasting every day throughout the genocide; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Government ministers spoke on the radio, RTLM; that's right, isn't it?
A.	That's possible, but I'm not in a position to tell you whether I heard this or that minister during the genocide.  I did not quite follow radio broadcasts, because I was anxious -- I was worried.
Q.	If it is suggested that Rwamakuba was heard on the radio, you're not in a position to say that's not true; is that right?
A.	I would merely say that I know nothing of it, because I did not hear his statement, because over the radio it could be true or false, but it doesn't concern me and I know nothing of it.
Q.	The government could have closed down the radio; you agree with that?
A.	Yes, that was possible.
Q.	In your statement to the investigators in 1999, you made some observations about the media; do you remember that?
A.	Well, that goes back a long way.  Can you please refresh my memory and, if it so happens that I mentioned the media, well, I will accept what you say.
Q.	In a signed statement on page 5, at K0157364, your statement reads, four paragraphs up from the bottom:  

"The media was also used for genocide propaganda.  Peasants who listened to Radio RTLM could not distinguish extremist statements aired on this radio from official announcements.  As far as these peasants were concerned, all that was aired was interpreted by them as an order to implement.  I heard broadcasts on RTLM which derided the RPF and the Tutsis and recalled the events of 1959 thereby inciting the people to kill the members of the other ethnic group?"

The last sentence reads, "The government knew the influence these" -- it says, "newspapers" -- "had on the people and could have taken action to stop the incitement."  

Now, if I've read it incorrectly, Mr. Hooper will be on his feet.  That is what is in your statement, and it's true, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Rwamakuba had his family home in Nduba; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	We've seen the photograph of his mother, photograph number 8, who survived the genocide period; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	When the genocide began, one might expect people to be concerned for their families; would you agree with that?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	One might expect Rwamakuba to be concerned for his family; do you agree with that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	One might expect Rwamakuba to travel to Nduba; do you agree with that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Rwamakuba regularly, before the genocide, visited his family; do you agree with that?
A.	No, he did not visit his families regularly.  Actually, he never had a residence at his parents' home.  He never built a house on the parents' property and did not come there often.
Q.	He did go there, whether it was often or regularly, or not.  You're not saying he never went home after he went to university.  That, I suggest, would be ridiculous; do you agree?
A.	Yes, of course, it would be impossible that he wouldn't go to see his parents, but it wasn't as regular as that.
Q.	Do you agree that there were occasions after he went to university when he would visit his parents, whether it was regular or not?
A.	When he was a student at the university, he used to come to see his parents, particularly during holidays, given that he was still -- he was still single.
Q.	And after university, he would have visited his parents; do you agree with that?
A.	Yes, I agree.
Q.	In your statement of the 5th of April of 2004 to the Defence investigator, what has been written on the bottom of the third page, last paragraph, apparently your words, is this:  "Rwamakuba had no habit of coming to Nduba.  He has finished his secondary education at Nyanza and then went to Belgium for university education."  Do you remember saying that to the Defence?
A.	In my testimony here I said that at the end of his secondary education at Nyanza, he went on to Belgium to pursue his studies, but I did not say that he never went to his parents' home.  Obviously, when one is a student, you go home to your parents, were it only during the holidays.  So while he was in university, during the school year he couldn't be at his parents' home or go there, but during the holidays he would -- could go there, and this is all but normal.
Q.	Do we agree then that, unhappily, it would be inaccurate to record in your statement the line, "Rwamakuba had no habit of coming to Nduba"?
A.	You're talking about usually or regularly.  That is the -- what I don't quite understand -- at least, I don't understand your understanding of it.  I would rather not use the word "habit" or "usually".  But I think that I told you that he did not usually or frequently or often come to his parents' home.  He came rarely, or he seldom came to see his parents.  He didn't come often.  During the holidays he could come there, that is, to his parents' home, and during other holidays he might go to his elder brother's house, which elder brother lived in Kigali.  So I don't agree with the word "regularly" or "usually" since he didn't spend all holidays in his parents' home.  Sometimes he would come to his parents' home for holidays and on other occasions he would go to his elder brother's.
Q.	Thank you.  All right.  That's helpful.  You seem to know quite a lot about where Rwamakuba went during his holidays -- sometimes to his brother in Kigali, sometimes to his parents' home.  You were a friend of his and a friend of the family.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	No, that doesn't establish friendship.  What this proves is that I was a neighbour to his family.  When he wasn't at his parents' home on holidays, we were told that he was at Kigali at his brother's house, because he used to go and stay at his brother's place before he went to Europe.  However, I was not able to say where he was each time -- even a child is not in a position to always say where another family member was at -- at specific times.  All I know is that he didn't often come to his father's -- to his parents' home, and it used to happen that he'd go to his brother's house in Kigali.  That's his older brother's house.
Q.	And you would know when he went to his older brother's house in Kigali, because you would be told that by your friends who were members of the Rwamakuba family; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No.  They didn't have to tell me that.  I didn't monitor his actions and gestures -- I'm talking about Rwamakuba's actions and gestures, since he was a friend of mine.  When he came to Nduba, the locals would know this.  This is a rural area where it is only too normal that people have interests in a person who is undergoing studies in Europe, for instance, but I had no business in monitoring his movements, since I have told you that I was his neighbour and between my residence and that of his house, there was a distance that could be covered in five minutes or between five minutes and ten minutes' walking.  That is what made it possible for me to know exactly what was happening at his father's home, or at his parents' home.
Q.	You were aware that Rwamakuba was around in Kigali in late 1993; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, I did not -- I was not aware of that.  As I told you, when he was a student, he would come to see his parents and after his marriage, we did not often see him at his parents' home, and that is why thereafter it was hard for me to know where he was, or his whereabouts.  So I couldn't know if he was in Kigali or elsewhere.
Q.	You told us on Thursday that you had encountered the person who is number 10 on the witness list.  Looking back at that name, without saying it in court, as I understood your evidence, you said you had encountered him in Arusha.  Now, if I've misunderstood you, please correct me.  
A.	That is incorrect.  We did not meet here.
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Do I understand that you met in Rwanda?
A.	Yes, it is in Rwanda that we met.  In fact, we are often together.
Q.	And do I understand that you met after he had testified here?
A.	Quite.  It was after he testified -- in fact, in the days following, when he testified here.
Q.	And you are often together, you've just told us; is that right?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you asked him about what he'd been saying before this Tribunal; is that right?
A.	No, I did not question him about that.  He merely told me that he had come from testifying against the Accused in this trial, and I asked him, "But how can you testify against this person when you didn't see him in action?"  And he answered me, "Those people have committed crimes and they must -- and they are answerable for those crimes."
Q.	Number 10 made it clear to you that he was comfortable about his evidence.  That's right, is it?
A.	No.  We did not have a long conversation.  I've just reported to you his response, and we cannot say that the answer would lead one to believe that the testimony was very strong.  
Q.	Number 10, in this short conversation you tell us you had, did not say to you that he had been lying.  That seems to be what you are saying to the Tribunal; that's right, is it?
A.	He did not tell me whether he had lied or not.  We didn't broach that topic.
Q.	Thank you.  You were aware that number 10 had said that he had seen Rwamakuba in the area.  That's right, isn't it?  I'm sorry, I'll ask that question again.

You were aware that number 10 had said in his testimony he had observed Rwamakuba, at periods which are relevant to this Tribunal, in Gikomero commune.  Now, you were aware of that, were you?
A.	No.  I asked number 10 whether he was a Prosecution witness against Rwamakuba, because he had seen him during the events, and he did not answer my question by "yes" or by "no".  He merely told me that those people had committed crimes and should be punished for those crimes.
Q.	You asked number 10 if he was a Prosecution witness because he had seen Rwamakuba during the events.  That is what you have just told us.  Do you agree you've just told us that?
A.	Yes, that is a question I put to him, and he did not answer my question.  He did not tell me that he had seen or heard him during the events.  He merely told me, "Those people must be punished." 
Q.	I'm no longer interested in what he told you.  I'm interested in what you knew.  You thought he might be a Prosecution witness because he had seen Rwamakuba during the events, and that is what you've told us.  Do you agree you just told us that?
A.	No, no, no, no, that is not what I have just told you.  I've just told you that I asked him whether he was a Prosecution witness against Rwamakuba because he would have seen him during the events.  And his answer was, "Those people must be punished for their crime."  In fact, I asked that question because I knew that number 10 was lying about Rwamakuba, because I know that after the 9th of April, number 10 wasn't in Gikomero.  He was already with the RPF, in the hands of the RPF.  And when I put the question to him, he did not tell me that he had seen the Accused, or heard him, during the events.  I did not put the question, because I thought I knew that he had seen or heard him during the events.
Q.	You thought you knew that he had seen or heard Rwamakuba during the events.  Is that what you've just told us?
A.	No.  I was not thinking what you're just saying.  You can only think of something when you know it happened.  And I personally couldn't think that.  I put that question when number 10 told me that he'd just testified as a Prosecution witness against Rwamakuba, and I asked, "Did you testify against him because you saw him and knew what he did?"  And I told you what response -- what the response was.

I did not put my question because I knew at all that the witness had seen or heard Rwamakuba.  That was not why I put the question.
Q.	You told us a moment ago that it was you who asked the question if he had been a Prosecution witness because you believed, as I understood it, that he could say that he had seen Rwamakuba during the events.  Now, what are you saying now?
A.	You are incorrectly interpreting my answer.  It is not on the basis of what I was thinking that I put the question to him.  It was he who saw me and told me of his experience, of his trip.  He said he was just back from a trip and that's what I questioned him on.  I didn't leave my house to go and question him.  I questioned him after he had told me about his trip.  But you are saying that if I put the question to him, it is because I had something in mind.  But that isn't true.  I put the question to him after he told me about his trip.
Q.	Number 10, on your testimony, did not say to you whether he had or had not seen Rwamakuba, but you, however, told us in your testimony that you understood that number 10 had said he had seen Rwamakuba.  Do you understand what I've just said to you?
A.	No, no, I never said that.  I deny that, and I will persist in denying it.  Whether it be before the Trial Chamber or elsewhere, I never stated any such thing.  If I had said such a thing, I would concede the point to you.
Q.	Do you want to read the transcript of your evidence over the last 15 minutes? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley --
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I see the -- I'm not -- yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I think you have mischaracterised what the witness said.  You see, I am looking at a section of his evidence when you put to him --
MR. MORLEY:
May I invite that the witness takes off his headphones?  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Witness, take off your headphones, please.

The question that I recall is this, you asked him, "I'm no longer interested in what he told you.  I'm interested in what you knew.  You thought he might be a Prosecution witness because he had seen Rwamakuba during the events.  Now, that is what you've told us.  Do you agree you've just told us that?"  And the answer, "No, no, no, no, no.  That is not what I have just told you.  I've just told you that I asked him whether he was a Prosecution witness against Rwamakuba because he would have seen him during the events.  And his answer was, 'Those people must be punished for their crime.'  In fact, I asked that question because I knew that number 10 was lying about Rwamakuba, because I know that after the 9th of April, number 10 wasn't in Gikomero.  He was already with the RPF, in the hands of the RPF.  And when I put the question to him, he did not tell me that he had seen the Accused or heard him during the events.  I did not put the question because I thought I knew he had seen or heard him during the events."  

Your next question after that was, "You thought you knew you'd seen or heard Rwamakuba during the events; is that what you've just told us?"  And then you went along that line.

I didn't intervene before.

MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour.  That's helpful and I'm very grateful that Your Honour is able to read back what is clearly the evidence, and it appears to me that there are a variety of different interpretations to some of what has been said in that long answer.  I'm not going to pursue this much further, but I have two more questions on the matter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, certainly.  

Put the headphones back on.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	If number 10 did not say to you anything about what it is he had said in court, how is it that you say to the Tribunal that he was lying, if you don't know what it is that he said?
A.	I think I just said -- I didn't say so before, but I've just said number 10 never saw Rwamakuba because, on the 9th, I know that he had already gone over to the other side -- had joined the ranks of the RPF, and he only returned to the commune after the genocide.  Otherwise, he never told me what he had said against Rwamakuba.  He'd only given me the information that he had just returned from -- from Arusha where he had testified against Rwamakuba.
Q.	Thank you, but that perhaps doesn't strictly answer the question.  If number 10 has not said to you what he said here, how do you know, or think you know, what it is he said here?
A.	I don't know what number 10 stated before the Trial Chamber, but when I say that he would have lied, it's because I know that he did not see the Accused.
Q.	When?
A.	He told me he'd come from Arusha where he was testifying for the Prosecution against Rwamakuba.  I asked him, "Did you really see him?"  He never answered that question, from which I conclude that he lied.
Q.	Do you think he just didn't want to talk to you about his testimony?  Do you not think you're being a little bit overzealous in suggesting he's a liar, when you don't know what he said?
A.	Yes, you're right.  I'm not going to decide in the Judges' stead whether he lied or not, but, personally, I think he lied.
Q.	Based on no information, you offer an opinion that a witness is a liar; is that right?
A.	In concluding that he lied, I am relying, obviously -- I must tell you that it's not up to me to assess whether a person has lied or not.  But were I to assess the situation where he approached me to tell me he'd just come from Arusha for the Prosecution, he did not tell me that he had seen Rwamakuba do this or commit that offence.  He merely said, "He must be punished."  And taking into consideration, also, that that person had quite a few people thrown in prison and lied about many people, and that many are still in prison because of him, of that person, then I can say that I think that person is in bad faith and does that out of anger against the Hutu who killed his family.  So he takes all Hutu as being killers and puts them all in the same basket.  

I think he does that out of vengeance, to avenge himself.  
So when you're asking me on what I base -- what is my basis for saying -- my grounds for saying he's lying, that is what I found as grounds on which I rely to conclude that he lied out of vengeance.
Q.	You've just told us that he has been a witness in other proceedings and relied upon; is that right?
A.	That's what people say.  I don't assert it 100 per cent that he's a liar.  When you see the people in prison, everybody says that he had them thrown into the prison because he lied that they had committed crimes.  But the day the people appear before the courts, then we will know who lied and who had not lied.
Q.	And he has been involved in several people being arrested and put in gaol and relied upon by the authorities as a truthful and reliable man; is that the position?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	That'll do.  Let's move on to the Congo.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel, please.  Sorry.
MR. MORLEY:
My microphone is on.  Can I be heard at the moment?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Loud and clear.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Let's move on to the Congo.  As I understand it, your eldest son died in the Congo.  Is that the evidence you gave on Thursday?
A.	No, I did not say that he died in Congo.  He died in Rwanda.  I will repeat, I'm not 100 per cent sure that he's dead, but I tell you that in 1997, from December 1997 I have no news of him.  So I think he could be dead.
Q.	You had news from him before December 1997; is that right?
A.	No, no, I had no news of him even before December 1997, because he was living in Congo and I was living in Rwanda.
Q.	I don't want to misunderstand you.  Is it right that you're not sure your eldest son is dead, but you have not heard from him since 1997?  Is that right?
A.	Yes, you understood me well.  If you want, I could repeat what happened and what I said last Wednesday or Thursday.  In 1996, after camps were dismantled in Congo, we went our separate ways from the children.  I spent a night at my duty post, which means that the children fled on their own, and I also fled on my own.  I came back to Rwanda alone and wasn't with my children.  

Subsequently, the children came back one after another.  The youngest child came first, and the three others remained.  And then two of my girls came back and told me that they had been with their brothers, but that they found a former FAR, that is why the armed forces have stopped their brothers from coming back to Rwanda, because no young man was allowed to come back to Rwanda.  They, therefore, kept them forcibly.  

So in 1997 when my son came back or returned, he came amongst the infiltrators.  He was captured in Ruhengeri, and was shown on the radio (sic) and -- on Rwandan radio and television.  His voice was heard over Radio Rwanda, and he was seen on TV.  That's the last we heard of him or the last news we had of him.
Q.	You did not see your son die; is that right?
A.	No.  That is why I'm telling you that I cannot confirm absolutely that he's dead.
Q.	And did you lose any other children during the genocide?
A.	No.
Q.	Would it be wrong to say that your son was murdered during the early part of the genocide in Rwanda with a blow to the head with a machete?
A.	No, that is not true.  The person who died at the beginning of the genocide is a person that had been hidden within my house.  I have told you that I had hidden six to seven people in my house.  That is how the person was killed in my house.  That's a person who had come to take refuge, or one of the persons that had taken refuge in my house.
Q.	This poor young man who was murdered, having sought refuge in your house, was not your son; that's right, is it not?
A.	No, he wasn't my son.
Q.	It would be wrong to say that that person was your eldest son, wouldn't it?
MR. HOOPER:
I think --
MR. MORLEY:
Headphones off, please.
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry?
MR. MORLEY:
Headphones off, please.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. Witness, can you just remove your headphones?  

The statement being referred to is found in the witness's wife's statement.  Now, I want to make it plain that she withdraws that comment and states that it's a mistake.
MR. MORLEY:
Now -- 
MR. HOOPER:
And -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Excuse me.
MR. HOOPER:
I mention that because my friend has been pursuing this for a while.
MR. MORLEY:
Excuse me.
MR. HOOPER:
And we are -- one's alert to it and one's aware that there is that discrepancy.  She'll be giving evidence that she never said that and that it's a mistake in the statement.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm astounded my friend stands up and starts trying to explain away what is going to be a short moment of cross-examination.  He offers evidence to Your Honour that there's been a mistake.  He offers an explanation to Your Honour as to why the mistake has occurred.  He offers an explanation, if the witness's headphones weren't off, to the witness.  In my respectful submission, my learned friend's intervention at that point was wrong.  He knows what's coming, and he has tried to neutralise it.  And I respectfully submit that Your Honour might -- I don't know -- have an observation about that sort of thing, standing up to try and explain away what's going to happen next.
MR. HOOPER:
I hope that the Prosecution note that I waited until the witness had given his answer, which he has done with great clarity.  It was then picked up again and more time taken up with it.  It is going to be stated that that's a simple mistake on the part of the maker of the state -- of the recorder of the statement, rather than the maker of the statement.  And I anticipate that that evidence is going to be given.  I hope that saves some time.
MR. MORLEY:
This begs the rather interesting question of whether Mr. Hooper is going to give evidence as to how this mistake has occurred.

The difficulty here is that usually it cannot be counsel's role to offer explanations without the explanations being effectively evidence and not subject to cross-examination.  And I respectfully submit that this is a feature which has arisen from time to time during the course of testimony, where my learned friend has helpfully explained various things about, for example, the background to how statements get taken and the circumstances in which mistakes may arise and how sometimes the witnesses don't sign the statement, there isn't an opportunity to do so.

And, in so doing, he's offering an explanation to the Tribunal, without it being subject to evidence and without it being subject to cross-examination, which is designed to neutralise the impact of questions and potentially important cross-examination.

I respectfully submit that what has happened a moment ago, with my learned friend standing up to protect the witness, was completely wrong.  He knows what's coming, and what he has tried to do is offer an explanation outside the rules of evidence to neutralise it.  And I respectfully submit that Your Honour may have a thought about that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we have many thoughts about it.  We didn't think that it was necessary to intervene, because you're dealing now with a panel of Judges who can distinguish between evidence and comments from the Bar table.  As far as I see it, the problem with the observations -- with the observation that you have made, which would be normally correct, have been complicated by the fact that Mr. Hooper has been the person who has taken the statement, and it could very well be that his intervention could be aimed at giving information to you, which would affect the way you proceed.

We, as I said, are able to distinguish between evidence and information.  As far as we're concerned, we will be interested to know what happens as the evidence on this particular issue unfolds.  And that's the source -- that's going to be the source of any decisions that we make on this issue.

I would have, more or less, been prepared to regard this as being information to you, and you can proceed as you see fit on the basis of the statements just made from the Bar table.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The only thought I offer is that the relevant statements, which are the 21st of July of 2004, which is in relation to this man's wife, and the 22nd of July 2004, which is in relation to this witness, neither of those statements were taken by Mr. Hooper.  So Mr. Hooper is offering an explanation which is not a personal experience.

I see the strength of Your Honour's position, because there is a problem or a complication here with the proximity that the lawyers come to with the witnesses prior to their giving evidence.  And ordinarily that is a difficulty best avoided, but it's unavoidable here.  So that Your Honour is clear, Mr. Hooper has not offered a mea culpa, "I, Mr. Hooper, made a mistake in what the witness is saying."  Mr. Hooper is offering an explanation of what two other people have reported.  That's the problem.
MR. HOOPER:
The observation about the statement is corrects.  My intervention, as such, came after the witness had given the most direct evidence in response to the question that it was wrong to say that child was a child of theirs.  He then went on to say that that child who had been attacked with the machete died at home and the rest of it.  

Now, what -- essentially what my intervention is is that when my friend came back to play that again, the central matter is that the maker of that statement is not this witness; it is his wife, and his wife is going to come and give evidence about that, and she will deal with it.  And I can indicate now and flag up that it will be asserted, I anticipate, that that was a mistake.  Those are my present instructions.

But if you -- that will be pursued with the wife.  I can see, frankly, and could see, frankly, no further purpose in taking this witness round and round the point.  He'd stated so clearly to the Prosecution:  "Look, it wasn't a son of ours."  And he then specified who he believed it related to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the point is, as -- as we mentioned before, we can distinguish, I think, between evidence, and -- but the cross-examiner does have a certain latitude in matters of this nature.  It is true that we are looking at the clock and we don't want to waste too much time.  I had initially thought that your statement had been based on the fact that you had taken the statement -- 
MR. HOOPER:
No, that was incorrect.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and that you are providing information which would have assisted Mr. Morley in the way in which he proceeded.  But I -- I don't wish to make a judgemental comment at this stage on this issue.

Mr. Morley, how much longer do you have?  It is approaching our point of no return.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'd like to finish now.  Although, as Mr. Hooper will no doubt be aware, the finishing point is a little muted as a result of his contribution a moment ago.  Let's see how we go.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	It is right, is it not, that you are aware that your wife made a statement on 21 July of 2004?
A.	Yes, I'm aware of that.
Q.	Are you aware that within the statement on the third page, second paragraph, four lines up from the bottom of the paragraph, it reads, in French, and I'll read it in French, "My eldest son was murdered in front of me with the use of a club on the head."  Now, are you aware that that appears in her statement?
A.	No, I was not aware of that, and I know that that is not the information that she has.  I do not know why the person who wrote that down wrote it in such a manner.  I know that the boy who was killed in our house on the 9th was someone who had come to hide in my house and that our son disappeared elsewhere.  I do not know if the person who wrote that down did not misunderstand my wife, since my wife is certain and positive that it wasn't our son that was killed in our house.
Q.	You made a statement on 22 July 2004 in which it's recorded, in French, "I saw my eldest son die tragically." 
A.	I have told you that I have never met any investigator whatsoever, that I never met any investigator on the 22nd of July 2004.  I never met anyone -- never met any investigator on that date.
Q.	The name of the investigator you may know -- I'm going to suggest to you that you did meet an investigator on the 22nd of July of 2004, and my learned friend Mr. Hooper will correct me if I'm wrong.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it's the date shown on the statement.  I think we've been here before.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	You have separately -- you and your wife -- suggested that your eldest son was killed in front of your eyes, on two separate occasions.  On the face of it, your wife on the 21st of July and you on the 22nd of July.  Do you understand what I'm suggesting?
A.	I deny having met that investigator.  I don't know if he took, in fact, my wife's statement and then ascribed it to me.  Maybe he made a mistake with the date.  I don't see how he could have come to me on the 21st and then come back again on the 27th -- 22nd.  All I know is that elsewhere in my statement I do clearly state that the person who died in my house was not my son.

If you check thoroughly through another statement I made, you will see that there.
Q.	You did lose your elder son.  How do you explain that there was some confusion in the mind of the investigator -- you and your wife -- over your eldest son being killed in front of your eyes when you know all along he simply disappeared in the Congo?
A.	It's not our fault.  I ascribe the error to the person that recorded the statement.  And, moreover, the person wrote down a date on which I didn't meet him.  And I told you, moreover, that I do not assert that my son is dead, to this day.
MR. MORLEY:
Finally, on this point, not for the witness, I would be interested to know -- and it may be that Mr. Hooper is not in a position to say yet -- are we going to hear from this investigator, or are we simply going to have to rely on Mr. Hooper standing on his feet and giving explanations?  

Thank you.  I've got no further questions.
MR. HOOPER:
I have some re-examination, but it will have to be tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can't continue.  We cannot continue now.  How long do you envisage being?
MR. HOOPER:
Twenty minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have to take the adjournment at this time.  We do not sit this afternoon.  Your testimony will continue tomorrow morning.  As I've told you before, you remain a witness during this or any other adjournment, and you are not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  

We will take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1235H)
