P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, 13 September 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have appearances, please, starting with the Prosecutor.  
MR. RAPP:
Yes, appearing today for the Prosecutor is -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. RAPP:
Is Stephen Rapp, Chief of Prosecutions.  With me as senior legal advisor, Dior Fall and Adama Niane and Ms. Tamara Cummings-John for the Prosecutor.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Rapp.  

And for the Defence, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
David Hooper and Andreas O'Shea, assisted by the extremely efficient Mrs. Svetlana Pouplard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we thank you all for being here.  

As we commence our proceedings, perhaps we thought it would be useful just to recall that on the 
24th of March 2005 at a status conference held here, we had ordered -- made a scheduling order.  And this required that the preliminary motions under Rule 72(A) should be filed no later than the 
28th of April 2005, and that any Prosecution's reply should be filed no later than the 4th of May 2005, with an order that the Prosecution should file a final witness list, as prescribed under Rule 73bis(B)(iv) of the rules, no later than 1st April 2005 and that pursuant to Rule 94bis of the rules, the Prosecution should disclose any statement or report of expert witnesses intended to be called no later than the 
2nd of May 2005.  

The Prosecution was required to file a pre-trial brief, and a list of exhibits, as prescribed under Rule 73bis(B)(i) and (v) of the rules no later than 23rd of May 2005.  And the Defence were required to file any pre-trial brief as prescribed under Rule 73bis(F) of the rules no later than the 30th of May 2005.  We ordered both parties should file any statement of admitted facts and law and any statement of contested matters of fact and law as prescribed under Rule 73bis no later than 30th May 2005.  

And then we had ordered that the pre-trial conference pursuant to Rule 73bis should take place on the 6th of June.  That led to scheduling the first trial session to start on the 9th of June 2005 until 
15th July 2005.  We eventually subsequently ordered that there should be a second trial session, which commenced on the 22nd of August, 2005, with a view to closing the Prosecution case during the month of August and to facilitate the completion of the Defence case before the Christmas recess.  

Now, as stated at our recent meeting on the 9th of September, we were faced with problems which seemed to raise questions of diligence, fair trial issues, and the rights of the Accused.  And we also raised the issue of inconsistency between the Prosecution's claim that these witnesses are crucial to the case and the fact that the actions on the Prosecution's side seemed quite late.  And, furthermore, we also commented that no evidence has been presented about the security issues which, presumably, make the witnesses reluctant to testify.  

Now, at that time we decided that -- to give the Prosecution one last opportunity, today, to give us a report, and on which we now eagerly await.  
MR. RAPP:
Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you for sitting in this case and for being present in this Tribunal to try these important crimes that occurred in Rwanda in 1994 and the serious allegations that have been levied in the indictment confirmed by this Court and -- and on which evidence has been presented to date.  

There are, as you know, these two witnesses whose pseudonyms are ALX and AWZ.  They are, in the view of the trial team and in my view from review of the evidence, very, very important witnesses for the Prosecution in this case, without which -- without their testimony, in our view, impossible to understand the events that transpired and which we, in our indictment confirmed by this Tribunal, allege the Accused was involved.  

We have made immense efforts to provide for their attendance throughout this trial, and I think, as you know -- and I don't want to repeat what my -- what my -- what my superior, the Prosecutor himself, may have said last Friday.  We in the Prosecution do not have control over our witnesses.  We are not in charge of their protection.  We cannot make promises to them.  We have had great difficulty in a variety of situations with people who -- who have claimed security and other reasons for noncooperation.  There's nothing we can do but persuade and persuade and persuade.  

And personally, during my mission in Brussels, I was involved in efforts to persuade one of these witnesses to appear and have come close to the point that she may, may, appear.  The -- that is the witness, AWZ.  The news on that is that she may appear, she may not.  We're doing everything we can to tell her how important it is for her to testify.  

The other witness, Witness ALX, in the last -- in the last days has confirmed that she will appear and she will be a witness in this matter.  The difficulty with her is the matter of scheduling.  Because of her own professional responsibilities, her personal responsibilities for her family, she wishes to testify during a time when she has a -- a break from her employment, which commences on the 
3rd of October.  But she assures that she would be available to testify during that time period.  She, as everyone, is always concerned about coming to Arusha and spending several weeks and the difficulties that she hears occur with people and their professional and their personal schedules and has a very ill mother and is -- very much regrets having to leave her side, but she is willing to participate.  

The question with the second witness, AWZ, another contact is being made with her with a former schoolmate in the next day to attempt to persuade her to be a witness.  Again, we don't have any way to compel them.  We don't have any way to assure them of their future security, other than the anonymity that they'll receive by testifying under pseudonyms and under provisions of the protective order.  But our position, Your Honour, is that we should have the opportunity to present these witnesses.  This Tribunal has been constituted by the United Nations.  When it finishes, it will have tried 70 or 75 individuals, will have spent in excess of a billion dollars, and if we miss out on a few days to miss the opportunity to hear important testimony that's critical for the resolution of one of those cases, I think we will all have failed in our responsibility.  Our view is that it could be possible to recess this proceeding and return here and -- and hear this witness, ALX, and potentially hear the witness AWZ, during that -- during a week in October.  

Mr. Hooper, I can't speak for him, and I -- I'm not sure I have his calendar correct, appears to have responsibilities the first week of October but would be available the second, the week beginning the 10th.  And -- and this Trial Chamber could potentially sit in shifts during that week with the Trial Chamber in Karemera and complete this matter.  Now, that may have implications to the start of the Defence case.  As I understand, the Defence does not wish to start the case until mid-November in any situation, even though there was some communication at some point that the Defence case would start the 31st of August -- or, 31st of October.  

Obviously there are questions in regard to the disclosure of Defence witnesses, the Defence protective orders.  I'm not sure it's been issued here, but I'm sure soon will be issued, but that will presumably provide for disclosure of Defence witnesses some 30 days, as is the case with the Prosecution order, before the commencement of the Defence session.  So that will put us into a situation where perhaps we could hear these witnesses the 10th or the 14th.  The Defence could then disclose its witnesses 
30 days before the commencement of a Defence session in mid-November.  

But we submit that that kind of calendar, which would not disturb greatly the Karemera scheduling, though it would take away a half day from it and require Your Honours, or some of you, to sit in shifts during that time period, from early in the morning until late at night -- and I know that, with all -- with all the work that must be done in this Tribunal, is a difficult thing and a lot to ask.  But all of us -- all of us that have made the decision to commit our time and our lives and this portion of it to Arusha and to the cause of justice for the victims of the -- of the genocide and the violations of international humanitarian law that the United Nations cited in Resolution 955 know that we sometimes have to go to extraordinary lengths to make sure that the ends of justice are achieved.  

And for that reason, we would respectfully ask to be provided with an opportunity to definitely call Witness ALX and to -- and to call, if she is then willing, Witness AWZ.  We would be prepared, according to ALX, to do that on the 3rd of October.  But under these circumstances, we're happy to defer to Mr. Hooper's schedule to make sure that we can schedule this in a way that he can be here, and vigorously cross-examining these witnesses, and so that the Prosecution case can then close and that we can then, in due course, commence the case for the Defence.  

Thank you very much, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Rapp.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I don't want to repeat what I know the Chamber appreciates is the Defence position here.  Security Council of the United Nations is a body in establishing this Tribunal.  Resolution 995 and others has been particularly anxious to preserve the rights of the Accused, and this Chamber doesn't need to be reminded the extent to which the rights of this Accused have arguably already been abused by the extensive confinement that he's had to face, in custody, since his arrest in 1997.  

This cloud of witness difficulty has been on the horizon of the Prosecution case since we started this trial.  If these witnesses were so very important, as this Chamber's already rightly commented, it's extraordinary that that has not been reflected in appropriate steps to achieve their timely attendance here.  

Mr. Rapp a moment ago spoke of immense efforts.  We dispute that there's been any demonstration of immense efforts to bring them here in a timely fashion.  The witness in Belgium, despite what may have been over the last few days the immense efforts of a persuasive Mr. Rapp in Belgium, leaves us with the prospect that she may appear and she may not.  And the Prosecution have, it seems, drawn in a schoolmate to -- to bring her before this international Tribunal, or encourage her to do so.  We're not a jot further on than we were two weeks ago in respect of this witness.  

ALX, we're told, in the last days has confirmed she will come.  This after three months and with no certainty that she will, in fact, come.  We're told she wishes to give evidence.  She's shown little or no inclination to do so to date.  She speaks of an ill mother.  She speaks of apparently a job, and I didn't quite gather this, but, as I understand it, is it a job that she's starting or her present occupation?  We know what that is.  That doesn't allow her to come before the 3rd of October.  But if this witness is really important, and if the proper efforts have been made and considering the scheduling by this Chamber, this trial, she should have been here several weeks ago.  

The Defence say well, if she's willing to come, produce her tomorrow.  But there's no forceful basis for argument for delaying that which should happen, in our submission, and that is that the Prosecution close their case.  

Those are our submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp. 
MR. RAPP:
I don't want to repeat our arguments, but the Defence was making light of efforts to try to persuade this witness through her friends or former schoolmates.  I'm afraid that's what we have, Your Honour.  We do not have the power here to compel witnesses in another country to travel to Arusha and to be present in this Tribunal.  We must use every persuasive method, every sort of plea to conscience, every plea that we can imagine from a personal, professional, legal, ethical basis to persuade people to come forward in this Tribunal.  

I've been here for four years.  I've had trials where many witnesses wouldn't participate.  And it's a struggle day after day after day.  It's a struggle to be in a Prosecution office that doesn't even have control of the witnesses and of their protection or of the services that they're provided, unlike the system in many national systems -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp -- 
MR. RAPP:
So we use the techniques that we have, and we're doing it, and we're doing it in this case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp?
MR. RAPP:
Yes?
MR. PRESIDENT:  
One of the problems that we have is that, as I mentioned before, we have had difficulty in accepting the -- the importance of these witnesses.  Because up till last week, we were told that contact information has been sent to your agent in Rwanda to make contact with the witness.  So until last week there had been no contact, you see?  And then -- and then we gathered that the witness in Belgium was approached just a week ago.  That does not persuade us that these witnesses are really crucial.  Because if they were, we would have expected that the Prosecutor turned up something much earlier than that.  
MR. RAPP:
It is my understanding that efforts have been made with these witnesses from the beginning to persuade them to testify and that they have always expressed some reluctance to testify.  And it's requiring going back to them time and time again.  And in many of our trials, your witnesses are often reluctant from the beginning.  And you have to list those witnesses, go back to them, tell them what's happening, that we need them, that we need them in Arusha, we need them to testify.  And that's part of the process, and it's part of what we're left with.  We don't have a lot of compulsion authority in this Tribunal.  I mean, the defendant himself doesn't appear in court to be here to be identified specifically by witnesses.  We operate a lot on volition, and so we have to -- we have to use the techniques that we have to establish the process.  And we're doing it in this case, and we ask you to provide us with an opportunity to bring these witnesses forth and then conclude our case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, I think that an opportunity had been provided.  Now, if the problem is that the witness doesn't want to travel to Arusha but she has agreed to testify, why can't we do a video link this week?  Say, for example, why can't we hear her on Thursday by video link from Arusha?
MR. RAPP:
This particular -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the other one I should mention, with regard to the Karemera trial, I don't think there's any -- there's been any suggestion that the Court is not willing to sit full days.  Now, we have scheduled full-day sittings in Karemera, and the Karemera scheduling had been carefully worked out to accommodate a certain number of witnesses with full-day sittings.  So if the -- we had to sit in shifts, it's not a question of inconvenience to the members of the Bench.  It is the effect it is going to have on the administration of justice as it runs in to us. 
MR. RAPP:
And I understand that, Your Honour.  I didn't want to -- I'm clearly aware that Karemera was going to sit in full days.  I do know, however, that when we sit in shifts, the schedule sometimes begins at 8:30 in the morning and continues to 7:30 at night, that each shift becomes essentially a two-thirds day rather than a 50-percent day but that -- and that that could happen here and that that's a -- and that often creates real stresses on the system.  But -- and that is a stress that we -- we understood that we might have to deal with here.  I didn't want to imply that we weren't going to have full days in Karemera.  

Now, in regard to -- to the particular witness, ALX, she is willing to come here and testify in person.  The -- the issue of the video conference we have not moved for.  If the only choice is a video conference, we will go back to her and say it's a video conference and you need to appear in Kigali on a certain day.  Obviously there's a question of her professional responsibilities and her job, but, you know, presumably it would take fewer days to appear in Kigali than it would be to fly to Arusha.  That's a second-best alternative to the witness appearing in October.  But if Your Honours are willing to -- to allow her to appear at all, we're willing to go back and to deal with the video conference issue.  

But our preference is to -- to have this matter heard in October with her in person and for there then -- we believe that there's an excellent chance that we would also have the witness AWZ.  Admittedly, Mr. Hooper talked about needing to leave tonight, though I know he may be willing to remain if there was a possibility of the witnesses' being here.  But I think it would be more convenient for them and for -- and for all concerned to have them physically present in mid-October.  But we will accept whatever the Trial Chamber's ruling is.  And if it's a question of no witness or a witness by video conference in the next -- in the next few days, we will obviously accept the witness by video conference. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're not making a ruling right now.  We're trying to find out what the position can -- can or should be.  The fact is that we are not sitting now.  We are not doing anything, and we are not sitting until a day early in next week.  So the Chamber has time.  So if the witnesses are available, and this is -- and, in fact, if the witnesses are available, then it's the most appropriate for the witness to be called now.  And usually one would expect the witnesses to form part of the Prosecution case.  It's most peculiar, in my -- in my -- for this trial gap to be coming at the end of a Prosecution case.  And if the witness is available, the closer proximity to the case the better it is for everybody.  And the fact is that we are available now. 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, we will explore that -- that possibility.  I understand there is a teleconferencing going on right now in the Butare case from Brussels.  I don't know if it's possible to do two simultaneously, one from Kigali and one in this situation.  I'm seeing a nod that basically would indicate that it would not be possible to do both at the same time.  Obviously, that could create problems with this week.  There may be possibilities next week.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, Mr. Rapp, I think I ought to comment on something you said earlier when you were speaking of the importance of the trial and suggesting that -- that that -- that -- that fairness and justice required accommodating whatever the Prosecutor wanted.  But I don't see it that way at all.  I think that the Prosecutor had an obligation to -- to be ready for -- for the trial.  This trial has been pending for a very long time.  The Accused has been arrested since 1996.  The -- we made scheduling orders, with everybody's agreement, in March.  The final witness lists were supposed to have been filed no later than 1st April.  So the -- the suggestion that the Chamber has not given the Prosecutor an opportunity to call its witnesses is certainly not a fair suggestion to make at all.  The Prosecutor has had every opportunity to do so and has not done so.  

Now, the question is, where does the interest of justice -- where do we draw the line if we're going to have justice in this matter?  Where do we draw the line?  What does justice require at this stage?  Because that is the question that we have to ask ourselves and a question that we have to answer.  How do we produce a fair trial? 
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honours -- Your Honours have provided an opportunity for the Prosecutor to call witnesses, and the Prosecutor has called witnesses.  The question is, is it sufficient to tell the whole story?  Is it reasonable to have a brief delay to make available crucial witnesses to this case?  

And we submit that there is certainly the rights of the Accused, the rights of the Accused to be present in this proceeding that he himself has waived, and other rights that need to be preserved, but that in this particular situation, given the time period that's already elapsed, a short delay to hear the last two witnesses that may not even occasion a delay in the final judgment to the case beyond the end of the year, depending on the length of the Defence case, is not too much to ask for the other parties that we're talking about here, the parties for which this Tribunal was created, the victims of one of the most massive crimes to occur in human history.  And the Tribunal was established to hear the facts, to hear the truth, to know what happened in Rwanda.  And unless you can have the witnesses come forth who had first eye, firsthand experience -- and let us not forget the name of Alison Des Forges' book, 
Leave No One (sic) to Tell the Story.  Indeed, most of the people who could testify, quite accurately, about a variety of things in Rwanda are dead and were killed because -- to make sure that they would not be around to testify.  Finding people after this period of time that are willing to come forward, willing to disturb their lives, willing to revisit the painful death of their friends and family is an enormously difficult task.  And -- and that requires that -- in these circumstances of this Tribunal, it requires sometimes a delay to provide an opportunity for that whole story to be told.  And it's not an unreasonable, under the circumstances.  And that's what we're asking for here today, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You spoke about making investigations about the use of the time that's available now.  How -- what did that require?  What does it involve?  
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honour, if -- if the issue is a video conference, then I think it involves a question of -- of, one, the technical aspect of it, dealing with the people on the third floor that work with that, to see what's possible to arrange, determine exactly the Butare, the progress of that particular case in terms of hearing this -- this Defence witness that's on the stand right now, if that's going to conclude or if there's going to be a break in that testimony, and then contacting this witness, ALX, to determine her availability to come in and -- and sit for a video conference.  

You know, we have the question of doing it at -- at -- at extraordinary hours, or something like that.  We could look at those issues.  Those always involve difficulties with the Tribunal, the court reporters and interpreters and the other staff, not to mention the audiovisual people that are required.  But, I mean, I'm quite willing to -- to leave this room and -- and go make enquiry on those and report back as quickly as possible to your -- to -- to Your Honours in a session like this or -- or through some other means on -- on what kind of result we can achieve.  

And, obviously, there's the crucial issue of the availability of the witness.  Then there's the issue -- and what days and hours we could bring her in.  And then there's the availability of the -- of the teleconferencing.  And, you know, if it were possible, for instance, say to do it on Monday or Tuesday and -- and commence Karemera on Wednesday or something like that, that might be an option to look at.  I think it may be difficult, technically, just from the indications I get and from my experience with teleconferencing before, from Brussels, to -- to do it this week.  But I will make enquiry and -- and do my best.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, you made those enquiries about finding out about your convenience, but we wanted to -- to -- 

MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, your phone's -- I can hear you without my microphone on --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
Your microphone's not on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I'm saying that we made those enquiries without intending to make any promises or commitments of any sort, but we wanted to amass as much information as possible before we took a final decision.  

Now, what is your position with regard to -- to addressing these problems, if an order were to be made?  What are the time parameters that -- that -- and how is that going to affect us?  I don't know if you have any comments.  We have not decided to -- anything yet, but we are trying to amass information on all aspects. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Can I address that?  

Before I do that, can I just correct perhaps what may be a misapprehension on the part of Mr. Rapp when he said earlier, in terms of the importance of the witnesses, quote, "Without these witnesses' testifying, it will be impossible to understand the events."  

And a cursory review, I suggest, of their evidence does not support that in any way.  In fact, it is the case that these witnesses -- if the witnesses who have given evidence so far are to be believed -- these witnesses do not, in fact, add anything new at all.  So that's on a general point. 

Your Honour asked the Prosecution a moment ago what justice requires.  And we submit, that in terms of the timeliness of hearing and trial without undue delay and the Prosecution's duties to the Chamber as well, that there is a compelling requirement, which, of course, the Prosecution recognised, to produce its witnesses at the appropriate time during the Prosecution case.  And the Prosecution will, of course, have in mind, in terms of the scheduling of this trial, what that implies, what it meant.  They did not, in fact, seek subpoena powers except late in the day and then abandoned that particular approach.  They chose to seek persuasion rather than coercion.  And, in our submission, this Chamber has given the Prosecution an extraordinary degree of allowance -- appropriate allowance -- I don't mean that in any critical sense at all -- but appropriate allowance to come before it on three or four separate occasions to explain its position and to explain the position of each of the relevant witnesses.  

These particular concerns became more highly focused, of course, as we reached the conclusion of the Prosecution case, already delayed by a month.  The week before last they were given that opportunity, and last week again and again this week.  

In terms of personal disruption, well, it meant this, that we had flights, as this Chamber knows, out of Arusha on Saturday.  And those have been changed, and they're now tonight, and I have 35 minutes, and probably less, to cancel that ticket or lose it.  And so has -- has my legal assistant.  

The Prosecution come today, and when Your Honour raises the issue of video conference, they are taken aback and quickly harness some arguments and possibilities in respect of it.  But, you know, they were coming today to give what was obviously their last and final proposals.  And the possibility of a video conference should have been part of their kit.  It was, after all, raised by the Prosecution itself in respect of one of these witnesses as long ago as two and a half months.  

So it's extraordinary against a background where it's evoked these immense efforts being conducted, that, in fact, that particular possibility has not -- has not been looked into.  And they've had their chance.  

And the Prosecution know your schedule.  They know what you're doing and what you're not doing this week.  The Prosecution witnesses should be here.  The Prosecution's had every chance and opportunity to, in fact, secure that.  We mustn't forget that they have not availed themselves of -- of the matters that they could have in this matter.  

For us, the -- the question, "What does justice require?" has a simple and -- and -- and firm conclusion.  It requires an end to the prevarications.  The Prosecution have had that opportunity again and again.  They still come here today with a lack, in our submission, of appropriate response.  And in all the circumstances, we submit that this Court can, in fairness to both sides and in justice, draw the line and say well, the opportunity was there, and, frankly, it hasn't been appropriately addressed.  I'm not blaming anyone for that, but there we are.  

But the Defence deserve finality here as well.  And -- and the Defence have its responsibilities -- responsibilities and obligations, which the Chamber will be acutely sensitive to.  And the focus, then, of decision comes, in our respectful submission, firmly in favor of -- well, doing what the Prosecution should have done several weeks ago:  Close their case.  

In terms of being present later this week, I have a flight tonight.  We don't find it attractive to then have to consider, well, we'll twiddle our thumbs, like the Judges, for a few days while we wait to see if the Prosecution consider -- consider what they're doing when, you know, Mr. President, the Prosecution could have addressed this before they walked into court this afternoon, and should have.  
And by "twiggling (sic) your thumbs," I don't mean that -- that literally.  But I certainly mean it in the sense of time wasted.

1530H 
MR. HOOPER (continued): 
At present, I'm inclined to board that plane tonight.  As for October, the knock-on effect will -- well, we've addressed that already; it will be significant.  

And the Court will also have to be concerned with a 90 bis -- 98 bis motion, which is receiving our attentions at the moment and which, in fact, in respect of which I'd like to make some comments at an appropriate moment this afternoon.  

But while I'm on my feet, Mr. President, can I just say that -- I need to say something about that and I need to also seek, by oral motion, temporary protective measures of witnesses, pending the final decision.  But I can raise that, but not at great length, a little later this afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think we'll take a short recess now and resume in a few minutes.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Just -- I understand I might need some -- if I'm going to cancel tickets, to cancel them by 4 o'clock at the latest.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we'll try and come back as soon as we can.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I know.  It's just an added -- for both of us; it will be a loss of about several thousands dollars.
(Court recessed from 1538H to 1617H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As we resume, I would just like to make one last enqueries, Mr. Rapp, did you, in fact, make enquiries about the video conference?  
MR. RAPP:
Well, my understanding from the registry individuals was that that -- the case of the witness appearing for the Defence in the Butare matter will be testifying for the remainder of this week, that it is not possible to have two video conferences at the same time, albeit one from Brussels and one from Kigali, it cannot be done technically.  There is the impression, though not the certitude, in that trial that the witness will continue into a second week.  But, of course, that depends on a number of situations.  So that begins to look like a difficult option in terms of arranging something that would allow us to -- to proceed with that testimony in the next -- in the next four or five days, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We have taken time to consider what we should do at this stage, and the Trial Chamber notes that the Prosecution has not given any particular account of the immense efforts to get the two witnesses in question to come and testify.  No details as to when they have seen them, except belatedly in Belgium and Rwanda respectively.

The Trial Chamber also notes that, in fact, the Prosecution has had the privilege of extra time due to the fact that the Prosecution case had to continue after the recess, continuing on the 22nd of August, while it was originally agreed between the parties and scheduled in our order to be finished by mid-July.  We do not think that there has been appropriate diligence.  

Also, no further details have been provided to convince the Trial Chamber as to how or why the two remaining witnesses are so crucial to the case, as the Prosecution claims.  We think that there have been now -- or no adequate efforts on the Prosecution side to provide a practical solution to the possible security concerns or inconvenience of the witnesses, as stated for their reasons for non-attendance; like even, for example, the question of a video conference which may have solved the problem of inconvenience, if that is a reason why the witness in Rwanda could not come to testify.  

Pursuant to Article 20 of the Statute, the Chamber has to guarantee the right of the Accused to be tried without undue delay.  On several occasions, the Chamber has raised its concern on the respect of that fundamental right, and we have even had to adjudicate on an application by this Accused to stay the proceedings because of undue delay.  

Now, I think it's apparent that the interests of justice apply, not only to this case, but also to other cases before this Tribunal, and the accused in those trials, which will have to suffer delays because of the lack of diligence in this case.  

Unbalanced between the interests of the Accused on the one side, and the interests of the Prosecution on the other side, and in view of the reasons which we have given, the Chamber finds itself in a position with the -- that the only way to deal with this matter is to deny further adjournment, and that's the conclusion to which we've reached.  

Mr. Hooper, you said you wished to address a matter on 98 bis.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  On the close of the Prosecution case, the Defence have an opportunity to, of course, invite the Chamber to review the position, as it were, at half time as is colloquially known in my own system, and this will be by written motion, 98 bis, which would address the position in respect of each witness.  We request 14 days to -- from the close of the Prosecution case, which we take will be this afternoon, to submit that motion and this is an oral motion to be given those 14 days in order to submit it.  
The second matter I need to mention is that there is, as the Chamber will be aware, a motion pending in respect of the Defence seeking protective measures for Defence witnesses.  We are not that far from the commencement of the Defence case and we need to furnish a list of witnesses for -- to witness protection here, and we -- we are in a position to submit that today, or latest tomorrow.  Pending the decision on our motion -- written motion for protective measures, we now orally apply to the Chamber to grant those protective measures that are sought in the motion or such other orders the Chamber feels appropriate in the circumstances, and to order it pro tem until the Chamber's final position.  And the object essentially is this:  to ensure that witness protection in no way discloses those names of the witnesses before the Chamber has ruled one way or the other in respect of the protective measures matter.  Of course, as far as witness protection is concerned, they are not meant to do so, but we have an area of concern here and we feel it's in the interest of our witnesses that the -- that they receive every protection they can.  I don't repeat or review the arguments now in fact in the written motion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The -- just for my information, the written motion has been filed already, has it?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I think last week.  I think last Wednesday or Thursday, I think, in English.  And basically we seek the same level of protective measures as was afforded Prosecution witnesses, and we do so for arguments which are set out in the motion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Prosecutor, is there any contention on the application for protective measures?  
MR. RAPP:
On that question, I don't believe -- other than we want to make sure that those measures are fully reciprocal to those that were entered in the case in the protection of the Prosecution witnesses.  So I don't see a problem with the -- certainly the pro tem grant of protection at this point, but understand that we will have that issue of when -- when witnesses are identified, at what stage prior to their testimony, and the service of statements, if there are any, in an unredacted form at what point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you intend to file a written response to the motion or could we regard this as your response?  
MR. RAPP:
Just checking with the trial team, Your Honour.  In our response, you can take our oral willingness to see the motion granted as long as provisions therein are duplicated than reciprocal for those that applied in the case of Prosecution witnesses.  

Your Honour, however, before we -- well, to proceed with further housekeeping, I certainly don't want to re-argue the issues which Your Honours considered and decided, but I noticed Mr. Hooper's tentativeness about the closure of the Prosecution case, if this be the closure of the Prosecution case.  
Your Honour has referred to the -- to the further adjournment being denied.  We have a witness from Rwanda, ALX, who is prepared to be here on the 3rd of October, or whatever date thereafter 
Your Honours wish, and the question before Your Honours is whether she can be heard and if not heard, then I think rather than talk of adjournment, what Your Honours seem to be saying is that you've decided to take on the role of the Prosecutor and close the Prosecution case, and I want that clearly for the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, I didn't quite understand the meaning behind your comment about the Court taking on the role of the Prosecutor.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, obviously, Your Honours have within your power to enter orders in regard to these proceedings, but what I wanted clearly understood is I am not closing the Prosecution case.  I have a witness who is prepared to come on the 3rd of October.  If you want to decide that I can't call that witness, then you need to close the Prosecution case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I don't know if you want to take on the role of the Court and decide when the Court sits.  You have the privilege to call your witness now.  You have had the privilege to call you witness for quite a long time.  You had your privilege to call -- so we are not stopping you from calling your witness, but we don't think that the Prosecutor schedules the sittings of this Court.  And I don't make that -- I -- I'm not quite certain whether there was some attempted intimidation or rudeness from your part, but we will not accept that.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honours, I just want to be clear and don't mean any rudeness to Your Honours whatsoever, and I understand that each organ of this Tribunal is independent and each has its own responsibilities.  The Prosecutor has been given the responsibility by the Security Council to prevent -- present evidence of the genocide and the grave crimes committed in Rwanda in 1994; that's our responsibility.  
Your Honours' is to decide all the judicial functions, when the court sits, and how that evidence is to be weighed, and those proceedings to be held.  

I just want to make it plain that we have a witness that's available but not today, and if the decision of Your Honours is to -- to move -- to ask us to close the Prosecution case, then I will follow Your Honours' instruction and close the Prosecution case, but that's not the -- that's not before us at the moment, and I think that that step needs to be taken.

1635H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I do not see why the Court should make such an order.  We didn't intend to make any such order.

With regard to the application for temporary protective measures, the Chamber has not seen the motion as yet.  We don't think it appropriate to make an order today.  In view of the Prosecutor's response that the motion is not opposed, to the extent that the terms applied for are reciprocal to the terms granted to the Prosecutor, it is very likely that there will be a speedy decision presented.  So I think you will have to wait on us and we will act as best we can.  

We have decided to grant 14 days, extend the prescribed time by seven days for filing a (inaudible) of this motion in this case.  

Mr. Rapp, is there any further business?  Does the Prosecutor have any further business?  
MR. RAPP:
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, there's one other item that we need to resolve today, and we've got to fix a date for a status conference for the scheduling of the Defence case.  We think that that conference should be earlier rather than later.  

Looking at our calendar, the date that seems convenient to the Court is the 25th of October, Tuesday the 25th of October.  How is that with the parties?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, Mr. President.  That is a date in the context of a start date when, please, because I am not sure what -- what the proposed -- it's a status conference, but is there an anchored date for the start of the Defence case?  Is there a certain -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have the objective of having the Defence close its case by -- before the Christmas recess.  So the question that we had considered earlier was that the Defence would require between -- you have said four weeks to close -- to complete your case, and we thought of making that on to six weeks in the event of -- just to allow for contingencies.  So -- but that is the objective that we have.  And we would like to schedule the proceedings in a manner which is likely to result in the closure of the Defence case before the Christmas recess.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  In which case, 25th is fine by us.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, I would imagine on that date we could -- well, is there any preferential date -- any other date that you have for the commencement -- we also have to deal with the issue of the completion of the Karemera trial session which had originally been scheduled to conclude, I think it was on the 30th of October, right -- on the 28th of October.  Now, we are getting off to a late start with Karemera, and I don't know what pressures are going to be brought to bear on the Trial Chamber as a result of that, but we had originally expected to be available from the 31st of October, and I certainly would not want to -- I would like us to have -- use that as our time window for commencement.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, we have some experience, of course, of difficulties that can occur in the Karemera case.  For our part, we are at the service of the Chamber, and the 25th, as a date, is as I have indicated wholly acceptable.  And I can indicate now, if that was to be moved a week further, either forward or back, that wouldn't cause us undue difficulty with due notice.  So we are flexible, and appreciate the Chamber's difficulties in respect of the other case.  
MR. RAPP:
And just for the record, Your Honour, when the Chamber sets a date, the Prosecution will be there and prepared.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We also like, as far as possible in the making of fixtures, to consult.  So, if there is an anticipated difficulty and we know about it, we would like to plan for it.  As far as we are concerned, the element of uncertainty that we have has to do with the pressures of the Karemera case.  But the preplanning that had been gone into it creates the impression that we will be available at the -- our Chamber will be available from the 31st of October for trial.  That seems to be the -- what preplanning suggests.  
MR. RAPP:
And, Your Honour, that would be satisfactory and matters of -- and Karemera can be dealt with tomorrow.  We would certainly be content to have the Karemera session extended to make up for the late start ourselves, but that's going to obviously be a matter that will have to be dealt with there.  Whatever day Karemera concludes, we are prepared the following Monday to deal with the Defence case in Rwamakuba.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Hooper, we have fixed the date for the status conference.  We have given an indication of the time window for the putting on of the Defence case, and I think we should just confirm the date by which the 98 bis motion should be filed is the 27th of September, for the avoidance of any uncertainty on your part.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, we will try and get it before the Chamber as early as possible.  And it would assist us in that respect if the Court could oblige us by authorising that service by email would be acceptable service.  
MR. FRY: 
Yes, sir, the registry has no objection to that procedure, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and we so authorise.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  

And coming back did the status conference which will be, I understand, on the 25th of October, with a view to starting the trial at a convenient point thereafter, am I to understand that once the Karemera trial is, as it were, out of the way, that the Court would be in a position to sit full days or are we, in fact, sitting half days, or is that at this stage an unknown factor? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not able to give a definite answer now.  There are one or two factors over which there is still an element of uncertainty which would affect the availability of the Chamber and a courtroom for that purpose.  But we will, as soon as we know for sure, we will notify the parties as to whether it is a half-day or full-day hearing.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And there may be matters that we can invite the Prosecution to admit or not that I raised last week, and I raise again as a matter which we would seek both the Chamber's assistance, but also, fundamentally, the Prosecution's, and that is that, as the Chamber will know, three months ago we served alibi notice in respect of Rwamakuba's being in Belgium from mid-September until mid-March, mid-September '93 to mid-March of 1994, and we served statement in support of that, and I don't need to repeat the personalities involved in respect of that.  It would assist us to hear -- and I make an oral application to the Prosecution to admit that as a fact, that he was in fact, in Belgium from the date stated in the alibi, that he did not return during that time.  

now, that would be of assistance to us.  It will be of great assistance to the Chamber.  It will cut down the amount time, of course, that witnesses would need to take up court time, and it would certainly save inconvenience to significant professional persons.  It may well be that despite having had three months, the Prosecution aren't today in a position to agree or disagree, to admit or not admit, in which case, I'd invite, by oral application, the Chamber to request the Prosecution to give an indication whether that is an admitted or not admitted fact in terms of the alibi notice within 14 days, or such time as the Chamber feels appropriate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under what rule would we be entitled to make that request? 
MR. HOOPER: 
Under the Chamber's general rules to make such orders and findings as are necessary for the good conduct of the trial in the interests of justice. Rule 54.  Thank you.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, this might be a useful time to consider rules amendments on admissions and make the provision more effective but it does not provide for what Mr. Hooper would want it to provide for.  I understand that -- and I have to consult further with the trial team on that -- but my understanding is that this period that is sought to be alibied is a very broad period and the witnesses' accounts do not, in the view of the Prosecution, adequately account for that time period.  And while we are willing to discuss with Mr. Hooper and other members of his team stipulations as to particular time periods, I don't believe we are prepared to say that this man did not set foot in Rwanda during this six-month time.  So we will not agree to that, but continue to work any way that we can to narrow the issues as we move into this portion of the trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
 
Mr. Hooper, I -- the Chamber does not accept your invitation to make the order that you request, but you have had an offer of cooperative discussion from the Prosecutor -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- which could resolve matters as narrowing down the issues that are contentious as much as is possible in the case of this nature.  
MR. HOOPER:
If they can give us a formal written response in respect of the matters which they don't -- the times they are concerned with, then we can react to that and, I hope, in the long run, save court time. 
(Pages 17 to 20 by Judith Baverstock)









1700H
MR. HOOPER (continued):
The only other matter, if I may very briefly take up the Court's time with -- and, if you see me about in Arusha tomorrow, it's because certain other arrangements have been made in the last half an hour - but, it's simply this: That the Chamber will know that at the beginning of this trial, 
Mrs. Svetlana Pouplard came to join our team as a legal assistant.  And certainly, to my astonishment, she's -- she's displayed a considerable grasp and applied a considerable diligence to her working with this team, which has been of great assistance to us, and incidentally, of course, to the Chamber as we've seen from time to time with her mastery of the exhibits and the rest. 

I mention all that because she's had the good fortune to be offered a position in the Appeals Chamber as an AOL appointment and, despite our objections, she's taken up that offer and I wish her well.  And, I just hope it's not inappropriate for us to put on record our thanks to her over the recent months and merely to forewarn the Chamber that there is -- if there's a less cohesive team here in the future, then you'll know the reason probably why that is. 

Thank you. 
MR. RAPP:
And, Your Honour, while -- while no one is leaving the Prosecution team, while we're in points of personal privilege, just because I want to make sure that the record is absolutely clear, I certainly want to salute the representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor who have presented this case, and note that in terms of the schedule, that they presented witnesses each day that they were called upon to do it, and if witnesses did not conclude by the days that one would've hoped, that was because of the extensive nature of cross-examination in those situations.  And -- and that's the reason why this case and the presentation of the available -- the readily available witnesses continued until last week.  And they've done their work well and diligently and I salute them. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Rapp. 

Well, I think that we have concluded our business for today and I'll bring the proceedings to a close now. 

We hereby adjourn.
(Court adjourned at 1705H)
