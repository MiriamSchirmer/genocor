(Witness enters courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 14th of November, 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  

Now, the appearances are the same?  
MR. HOOPER:
They are.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Welcome back to our courtroom after the weekend.  Your testimony will continue this morning, and I have to remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began last week.  
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Hooper, it's another Monday, beginning of another week, and we again raise enquiries about the Accused Rwamakuba. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm afraid I haven't seen him since last week so I can't give you, as it were, an update, but I very much doubt that his position has changed, and he's not here this morning, and he's free to come at any time.  So the position remains the same. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If you could continue conveying the Court's invitation to attend whenever you see him. 

MR. HOOPER:
Certainly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like to start by asking you about the person you mentioned who killed your father-in-law.  Was his first name Jean? 
A.	Nduwezu. 
Q.	Was he Jean Nduwezu? 
A.	I did not know his forename. 
Q.	Madam Witness, Nduwezu was a teacher, wasn't he? 
A.	No, he was a communal policeman. 
Q.	Would it be fair to say that you didn't know him very well? 
A.	Sorry, could you repeat the question?  
Q.	Madam Witness, you did not know Nduwezu very well, did you? 
A.	I knew him. 
Q.	But you didn't know what his first name was? 
A.	No, I did not know his forename, first name. 
Q.	In fact, Nduwezu was actually a teacher who was trained as an Interahamwe, wasn't he? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, do you recall on Friday telling us in your latest version of the events of the 12th of April that some refugees came to warn you that the attackers were coming to the school?  Do you recall saying this? 
A.	Yes, I remember having said that. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many of these refugees came to warn you? 
A.	Two. 
Q.	And they told you that the attackers had just killed two children at the trading centre; isn't that correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	It was not your testimony on Friday that -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	May I finish?  Was it not your testimony on Friday that the refugees came and told you that two children had just been killed by the attackers and that they were on their way to the school? 
A.	That is not what I said. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I do not wish to go into this, however, your testimony is noted in a transcript, a document which I will not quote from as it's still in its draft form.  Everything you say here, however, is noted and written down and typed out on a piece of paper.  According to my record, this is what you said.  
MR. HOOPER:
Could you give us a page reference, please?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Page 33 of the English transcript, draft transcript.  

Your Honours, with all due respect, I would rather not quote directly from the transcript because the stenographers have actually explained to us that they provide us with these draft transcripts as a matter of assistance, but we cannot quote word for word from them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I'm aware that that is a rule.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
However, I hope that when the final transcripts do come out the records will speak for themselves. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Q.	So, Madam Witness, you're now saying that this is not what you told us.  Can you tell us what the refugees came and told you?  
A.	Yes, I can. 
Q.	Please do so.  
A.	What I said was that the refugees arrived, informed us that the Interahamwe had come.  As to the people who were killed at the trading centre, that was told to us by other people who came subsequently, and that it was Turatsinze and Muramba, that they were killed.  That is what I stated. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court, Madam Witness, when the people who came subsequently came and told you about the two people who had been killed at the trading centre? 
A.	It was the people who were at the trading centre when those people were killed. 
Q.	So, Madam Witness, let us be clear.  The refugees who came to warn you of the imminent arrival of the attackers, where were they? 
A.	The refugees came from the trading centre.  They're the ones who told us that the Interahamwe had arrived at the trading centre. 
Q.	And so they witnessed the arrival of the four vehicles at the trading centre; is that correct? 
A.	No, they didn't say that they had seen any vehicles.  They only told us that the Interahamwe had arrived at the trading centre. 
Q.	So what was the purpose of them warning you?  Was it simply to tell you that the Interahamwe had arrived at the trading centre? 
A.	They wanted -- their intention was that the people would have enough time to flee. 
Q.	But, Madam Witness, how did they know that the Interahamwe were coming to the school and the parish?  
A.	Those people were refugees.  They, therefore, warned their colleagues, the other refugees who were at the school, that the Interahamwe had arrived, and themselves went; they went -- fled from the trading centre.  They were, in fact, fleeing from the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us how the Interahamwe arrived at the trading centre? 
A.	I don't know.  It's only things I have heard.  All the information I have is only hearsay. 
Q.	Thank you for clarifying that point.  So in your version of the story, the most recent one now, the Interahamwe arrived at the trading centre, then two refugees came to tell you that they had arrived; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was the ethnicity of these two refugees? 
A.	They were Tutsi. 
Q.	And why did they come and warn you, a Hutu married to another Hutu? 
A.	In fact, they wanted to warn other refugees, because I was talking with the refugees and someone else was teaching at the school, and I heard the news.  But, in fact, they didn't want to alert me.  They wanted to alert their Tutsi comrades, colleagues. 
Q.	You did state, though, that they came and stopped at your home before going on to warn the refugees at the school, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, they stopped near my house because they spoke to that man who was talking to me. 
Q.	And after informing you and the man you were talking to whose name I note as Nzaramda; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	After stopping and warning Nzaramda and you overhearing, they went on to the school; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And at this point you stayed at your house, did you not? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, the French booth is asking if you could make a distinct pause after the answer to the question.  Sorry.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Would the interpreters like me to repeat the question?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
For the record, perhaps it might be better.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, after being informed by the refugees, and they went on to the school, you remained at your house; is that correct? 
A.	I stayed where I was.  There were people there by the side of the road. 
Q.	And had the cars arrived, or not, at this point, Madam Witness? 
A.	No, the vehicles had not yet come to that place. 
Q.	Can you tell us how much time elapsed between the refugees coming and the vehicles arriving? 
A.	Just a short while. 
Q.	Would that be less than five minutes, Madam Witness? 
A.	More than five minutes. 
Q.	Would it be less or more than 10 minutes? 
A.	Less than 10 minutes. 
Q.	And can you tell the Court at what point those who came subsequently to inform you of the two people who had been killed at the trading centre did so? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Counsel, could you please repeat the question, asks the Kinyarwanda booth?  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell the Court at what point those people who came to warn you that two people had been killed; at what point did they come in relation to these events?  
A.	After the vehicles had left, there was a crowd of people and that's where -- when some people told us that the assailants had killed two people at the trading centre. 
Q.	So -- and at what point did you then go to the school, Madam Witness? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could the Kinyarwanda booth please repeat that answer?  Sorry.  
THE WITNESS:
I went to the school after the vehicles had come.  I followed the vehicles, therefore. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	And if we can go back to the refugees, the two who came to warn you of the arrival of the Interahamwe, can you tell us how they came from the trading centre? 
A.	I don't know how they left the trading centre.  All I know is that they were telling us that the Interahamwe had arrived at the trading centre. 
Q.	Did they arrive by car? 
A.	You're talking of the attackers, the assailants?  The assailants came in vehicles. 
Q.	No, Madam Witness, I'm talking about the two refugees, the ones who first came to warn you.  
A.	They came on foot. 
Q.	So, allow me to recap.  The cars arrived at the trading centre; the first two refugees went to your home, some 300 metres from the trading centre; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Then, subsequently, more refugees came to tell you of the two people that the assailants had just killed at the trading centre, also arriving before the vehicles; is that correct? 
A.	No, it was not like that. 
Q.	Can you tell us how it was, then, Madam Witness?  
A.	The two refugees arrived, warned us that the Interahamwe were arriving at the trading centre.  Subsequently, when the attackers had already left, people living at the trading centre informed us that at the trading centre the same attackers had killed two people. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court when these people informed you that the attackers had killed two people? 
A.	I think I said that it was after the departure of the assailants and their vehicles. 
Q.	Was this in the same evening of that day? 
A.	They left at about 5 p.m., and I heard the news after their departure. 
Q.	So when you told Defence counsel during your examination-in-chief that other than the massacres at the school, the only other massacres or killings that took place in your secteur occurred some two weeks after the school massacres, you were lying, were you not? 
A.	No.  I have never lied. 
Q.	So you were telling the truth when you said that the two people were killed two weeks later? 
A.	Yes, two additional people were killed two weeks after that massacre. 
Q.	Madam Witness, with all due respect, I will let the record speak for itself.  In your words, following the school massacres, the only other people who were killed, two young people, coincidentally, were killed two weeks after the school massacres? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I'm sorry, I'm not going to keep interrupting my friend, but that's exactly so, as with much of this transcript, killings after the school massacres, not before them.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm afraid I didn't quite grasp Mr. Hooper's intervention. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, just read the question and the answer that you've read again and reflect on its content.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Was that an objection, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that's not necessary, Ms. Cummings-John.  Mr. Hooper was drawing your attention that you made a slip when you put your question to the witness, and you can monitor that.  You can correct yourself. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Which is why, Your Honour, I stated that I didn't understand.  I couldn't -- it is hard for me to correct myself if I don't understand what the point was that was being made, with all due respect.  
MR. HOOPER:
The point I'm making is this:  If you go to the question and answer that you've just put from the transcript -- and I've no objection to you putting it from the transcript, albeit that it's the draft, as we know -- you'll see that the question was framed, "What killings occurred at Gikomero centre after the school killings?"  And the witness is talking now about killings that happened, two killings before the school killings and two killings two weeks afterwards.  So it's inappropriate, to put it mildly, to accuse the witness of lying on that basis.  So I suggest, with respect, that you withdraw the allegation that was made against this witness and formally declare yourself corrected.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Perhaps it was my error, and I thought that my question was the only other killings that took place in the secteur, but again I'd like to see to the transcripts and let them speak -- let the record speak for itself.  If there was any misunderstanding, I withdraw and I hope that everything will become clear in due course.  Now, if I may continue.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, you also testified that you followed the cars when they went to the school; is that correct?  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And during this time, was your husband inside your house? 
A.	Yes, he was at our home. 
Q.	Did you tell him that you were going to follow the assailants to the school? 
A.	No.  I went to the school immediately. 
Q.	So, Madam Witness, if I understand correctly, having been warned of the imminent danger of these assailants, you chose to follow them? 
A.	I would like to give some clarifications on that.  
Q.	Please go ahead.  
A.	When those refugees came, fleeing, I was conversing with Nzaramda, who was also a refugee.  I was asking him questions in respect of people who were chasing them away from their property, and he answered, saying that it was -- they were their neighbours, who were equipped with clubs and machetes and other traditional weapons.  And when I saw those vehicles with the indication "Rubungo commune" written on it -- on them, I thought they were the communal authorities that had come to protect the refugees, and that is why I followed the vehicles. 
Q.	And can you tell the Court where on the vehicles the words "Rubungo commune" were written? 
A.	The words were written on the side of the vehicle, on the side of the Daihatsu vehicle, as well as on the Peugeot.  So you had the inscription "Rubungo commune" written on them. 
Q.	And having seen Nduwezu descend from the vehicles, one of the vehicles, you still thought that they had come to protect the refugees? 
A.	When the vehicles stopped at my father-in-law's place I saw him, but I didn't tell you that I saw Nduwezu leave the vehicle and go into my father-in-law's house.  I saw the vehicles follow (sic) a moment and then continued along, following the other vehicle. 
Q.	So you confirm that you did see Nduwezu? 
A.	I told you that when Nduwezu came out of the vehicle to go to my father-in-law's house, I did not see him, but I saw the vehicle stop there for a while.  It was later that I saw Nduwezu again in the school, but I saw him subsequently, after the killings.  I saw him at the time that the cows were being killed. 
Q.	Madam Witness, if I can ask that we go back to the two refugees who came to warn those who were at the school, can you tell us how did they warn this group when they got to the school? 
A.	I don't know how they warned the other refugees since I did not go with them to the school. 
Q.	Is this not something you learnt of later? 
A.	The fact that they warned the refugees, is that what you're referring to?  Those refugees came and told Nzaramda -- that Nzaramda had just arrived and Nzaramda went with them to the school. 
Q.	So three of them went to the school to warn the more than 200, but less than 500, refugees; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And these three men, having warned the hundreds of refugees, can you tell us how many of these refugees fled? 
A.	I am not aware of the number of refugees who took flight. 
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, in your testimony and your statement of 2003 you talked of the adults being separated from the children; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You also talked of Hutu being separated from Tutsi; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So I wonder if you can assist us to paint a clearer picture.  When the assailants arrived did they say, "Hutu, separate yourself from Tutsi," or did they say, "Adults, separate yourself from the children"? 
A.	They asked the Tutsis to step to one side, and the children to step to the other side.  The Hutus and the children, and the Tutsi children, went to the same group. 
Q.	Can you tell us where you were at this point? 
A.	I was already on the spot.  There were many other people there.  There were also people who were doing their business in school.  I myself, I got there ***********************. 
Q.	Were you stood on the side of the assailants, Madam Witness? 
A.	I was with the crowd of inhabitants who were looking on. 
Q.	And how far away would you say you were from the assailants? 
A.	The distance was short.  They asked us to be on one side, and that we were all near the group of refugees, and then some attackers surrounded the group of refugees whilst others were in the midst of the group of refugees or in the middle of the group of refugees. 
Q.	So you were in the midst of the refugees? 
A.	No.  I was with the group of inhabitants who were a bit farther than the group of refugees. 
Q.	And the assailants asked you to stand to one side; is that your testimony? 
A.	The attackers said the following, that the Tutsis should step to one side and that the Hutus should step to the other side.  They also asked the Tutsi children to join the group of Hutus.  We were not in the group of refugees; we were in a group apart. 
Q.	But, Madam Witness, you just said that "They asked us to stand to one side," did you not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So they were aware of your presence? 
A.	Yes.  You know, they knew that they were members of the population, they knew also that they were people who had come to sell their wares at the school. 
Q.	And during this time you did not fear for your safety? 
A.	We were scared after they made the statement that they made. 
Q.	Can you tell us which statement that was? 
A.	After they had asked the Hutus to step to one side.  Of course, that made us afraid -- to be afraid. 
Q.	But you remained there nonetheless; is that correct? 
A.	Nobody moved us.  We remained there.
Q.	And you described 30 minutes of shooting in your statement; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So the assailants who numbered 39, according to your testimony, 20 communal policemen, 4 members of the Presidential Guard and 15 or so ordinary citizens, all shooting at the civilians for a period of 30 minutes; is that correct? 
A.	Only those who had firearms were shooting at people.  Those who had grenades also threw the grenades at them. 
Q.	But each and every one of them was armed, were they not? 
A.	Some of them were not armed. 
Q.	Would it be fair to say that the majority of them were armed? 
A.	The majority of them were not armed. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Madam Witness, what the others who were not armed were doing? 
A.	They were standing there. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many of them were armed? 
A.	I can't tell. 
Q.	But you can say with certainty that the majority were not armed? 
A.	Yes, some of them were not armed; that I confirm. 
Q.	Are communal policemen armed, in general? 
A.	There were even some communal policemen who were not armed. 
Q.	Would you say that the majority of the communal policemen were armed? 
A.	They were armed, but there were some of them who weren't. 
Q.	I believe the word I'm trying to emphasise is the "majority".  Were the majority of the communal policemen armed, or not? 
A.	Yes, they were armed. 
Q.	And the Presidential Guard, were they armed? 
A.	Those who were wearing the khaki uniforms were carrying nothing with them. 
Q.	Can you tell us who was carrying the grenades? 
A.	The policemen were those who had the grenades.  Some policemen had guns and others had grenades. 
Q.	Would you say in total that more than 10 or less than 10 people were armed? 
A.	From what I saw, I would say that about some 10 or a dozen people were armed. 
Q.	And would it be fair to say that these assailants came with the purpose of killing the refugees at the school? 
A.	It is true, the intention was to kill the refugees and, by the way, they did just that. 
Q.	And yet only a quarter of them came with arms? 
A.	I cannot know how many of them would have represented a quarter of the total of them.  I can't make the calculation. 
Q.	Well, if I were to tell you, roughly, about 10 of them.  
A.	Well, that would be for firearms because there were others who were carrying grenades. 
Q.	So 10 of them were carrying firearms.  How many others would you say were carrying grenades, the same amount or more? 
A.	I will try to make an estimate.  I believe that there were about 25 people who were carrying grenades -- about 5 people were carrying grenades. 
Q.	So 10 people carrying guns, 5 people carrying grenades, shooting for a period of 30 minutes, throwing of grenades during this time, and they only managed to kill 61 people; is that your testimony? 
A.	Yes, 61 people perished at that location. 
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, how many survivors there were? 
A.	No. 
Q.	But you would say there were at least three; is that correct? 
A.	I know people who survived the killing at that location.  I know that there are three of them. 
Q.	But you're not aware of any more? 
A.	I know those three because they're the ones who remained at the location.  The others had fled. 
Q.	And those three survivors, you testified that they hid under bodies; is that correct? 
A.	No, I did not testify to that effect. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court how they managed to go unnoticed by the assailants? 
A.	I'm going to explain how it happened to you.  
Q.	I believe we're all waiting impatiently, Madam Witness.  Please go ahead.  
A.	Nirere went to join the group of Hutus when the Hutus were asked to step to one side, and Karangwa had been wounded.  He lost a leg.  There is another person, another lady, who had a Tutsi husband but who was Hutu, and who also joined the Hutu group.  I remember another person who was wounded at that location.  It's a lady whose name is Ellen.  Those are the people I remember. 
Q.	And those who managed to flee, Madam Witness, did the assailants not pursue them? 
A.	The attackers did not pursue them. 
Q.	And after the killings, after the massacre at the school, you stated in your statement of 2003 that you remained at the school, sitting down, that evening? 
A.	Yes, that's correct; **********************************. 
Q.	You remained at the school or you remained at your home? 
A.	I remained in front of my house at the roadside, sitting. 
Q.	And did you have children at this time? 
A.	Yes, I had children. 
Q.	And where were your children? 
A.	I was carrying the youngest on my back and had sent the three others, the older ones, to the Munini cellule to go and fetch potatoes from the field. 
Q.	So did you carry the younger one on your back when you went to the school? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In spite of the insecurity of the situation.  Madam Witness, are you aware if any of the survivors of that massacre gave a statement to the ICTR? 
A.	They did not give statements; at least, I'm not aware of that. 
Q.	Did you have an opportunity to speak with them after the events? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So you wouldn't be in a position to tell us whether they gave a statement, or not, would you? 
A.	I am not in a position to know. 
Q.	Do you know -- do you know if it was possible for them to put the figure of those who were killed that day at a higher number than the one you gave? 
A.	I'm not aware. 
Q.	Do you know if it's possible that they testified that they had lost children during the massacres? 
A.	Even if they said that, I would say that no child died at that location. 
Q.	And the figure that you said were exhumed from those massacres, can you tell us again how many? 
A.	Sixty-one corpses. 
Q.	And you told us that Pastor Nkuranga convened the exhumations and declared that there were only 61 bodies; is that correct? 
A.	That is not what I stated. 
Q.	Please correct us.  What did you state, Madam Witness? 
A.	My evidence, rather, was that it was Pastor Nkuranga who made those people to be buried -- who caused the bodies to be buried. 
Q.	And he put the figure at 61 bodies; is that correct? 
A.	He did not say that.  He did not know the number of the persons. 
Q.	Was Pastor Nkuranga not accused of delivering Tutsis to their killers during these massacres, Madam Witness? 
A.	It is true that he was accused, but he was tried and acquitted. 
Q.	So the answer to my question is that he was accused of having delivered the Tutsis to their killers.  Now, can you tell us the number of victims that you are aware of in your secteur? 
A.	Are you referring to the inhabitants of the secteur or those who had come to that secteur and killed there?  
Q.	I'm referring to the victims, be they inhabitants or refugees. 
A.	I can't tell the number thereof. 
Q.	Can you tell us, other than the massacres at the school, which other massacres took place at your secteur that you're aware of? 
A.	Apart from the two children who were killed subsequently at Rubungo (sic), I am not aware of any other killings that took place in my secteur. 
Q.	So there were two children killed at Rubungo? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"I said 'Rupangu'", says the witness," not 'Rubungo'".
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Your Honour, I think we need to have that struck from the record.  It is quite a precise location that the witness has just given. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't understand how it affects the identity. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay.  You're right, perhaps.  Okay, I'll move on.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	So you're only aware, Madam Witness, of two victims at the Rupangu trading centre; is that correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And these two victims, were they killed on the same day as the massacres at the school?  
A.	No. 
Q.	So there were no people killed by the assailants when they were making their way to the school and the parish; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, there were two people who had been killed before they got to the parish and the school. 
Q.	Can you tell us where they were killed? 
A.	Those persons were killed at that very centre before they got to the school. 
Q.	Were they the only two victims that you are aware of having been killed, other than those massacred at the school? 
A.	After that date two other persons were killed at the centre. 
Q.	So, Madam Witness, would it be fair to say that you're aware of four other people having been killed in your secteur? 
A.	Yes, you're correct. 
Q.	Now, you mentioned during your examination-in-chief that ********************************************************************? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And is the Gacaca organised at the secteur level or at the cellule level? 
A.	******** at the cellule level. 
Q.	So would it be fair to say that ******************************************************* in the Gacaca at the secteur level? 
A.	You are right, ************************************************************** during Gacaca hearings in the entire secteur.  I've told you that ****************, it is not within the framework of the secteur ****************. 
Q.	Can you tell us without revealing -- let me rephrase.  Are the sessions held at the secteur office, Madam Witness? 
A.	Each cellule has a place where the hearings are held. 
Q.	And the hearings that relate to your cellule, are they held near to your home or are they held towards the main trading centre? 
A.	We hold the hearings *******. 
Q.	Would that be on the same road as your home? 
A.	Yes, those who live above my home pass by my house, but there are other inhabitants who live below my house and they don't need to pass by my home to get to theirs. 
Q.	And can you tell us what day the sessions are held in your cellule? 
A.	Every **********. 
Q.	Would that be in the mornings or in the afternoons? 
A.	In the morning.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And apparently it was ***************, I'm told by my colleague.  Sorry. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like, with the assistance of the registrar, to show you a name on a piece of paper and I'd like you to tell me whether you know this person or not.  

I can see you have the paper in front of you.  Do you know this person, Madam Witness?  
A.	Yes, I know that person. 
Q.	Can you tell us what his function is? 
A.	He is the conseiller, the councillor, of Gikomero secteur. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Madam Witness, if this person sits in ********** Gacaca sessions *********? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Has this person ever approached you to testify during the Gacaca sessions, Madam Witness? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, do you know if this person sits in any Gacaca sessions, Madam Witness? 
A.	No, he's not on the jury of any Gacaca jurisdiction. 
Q.	Yet we met with this person some three weeks ago, on the ***** of October, and he was sat during Gacaca sessions *********.  

I'd like to move on now to your knowledge of the Accused André Rwamakuba.  You testified that you last saw him in 1969.  Would I be right in saying that you would have been around 11 years old at the time?  
A.	I think I was 12.  I was in grade six of primary school at the time. 
Q.	Okay.  Would you agree that that was quite a long time ago? 
A.	Yes, a very long time ago. 
Q.	So if you had seen him in 1994, 25 years after your first encounter, you would not have been able to recognise him, would you? 
A.	I would not have recognised him. 
Q.	You also testified that you went to school with his brother and sister -- his sister and brothers; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us what their ethnicity is? 
A.	He is Hutu. 
Q.	So they weren't Muhunde? 
A.	I know that there are three ethnic groups in Rwanda.  I don't know of any Muhunde ethnic group in Rwanda. 
Q.	And André Rwamakuba's family were Rwandese, were they not? 
A.	Yes, they are Rwandans. 
Q.	You also testified, Madam Witness, that if he had come to Gikomero, someone would have told you; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I heard people speaking of him. 
Q.	No, I think you misunderstand my question.  You had stated that if he had come to Gikomero, someone would have told you; is that correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So is it your testimony now that it is possible for him to have come to Gikomero, but that you not be aware of his presence? 
A.	No, he did not come to Gikomero. 
Q.	Had he come to Gikomero and you not having seen him, how would you have known, Madam Witness? 
A.	I know that people surely would have seen him and they would have informed me that he'd come to Gikomero. 
Q.	Did you, Madam Witness, inform people that you were coming to testify on André Rwamakuba's behalf? 
A.	No.  You don't inform anyone; even your own children, you don't tell them. 
Q.	Are you aware if any of your neighbours came to testify against a man by the name of Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda? 
A.	No, I know of no one. 
Q.	So would it be fair to say that you and your neighbours do not share all information that you come upon? 
A.	Yes, that would be true. 
Q.	You told us, Madam Witness, in your evidence-in-chief that after fleeing to Kibobo with a lady whose name was written down on a piece of paper for you, a Tutsi lady who we in this courtroom know as *****, no one spoke of the genocide.  Do you recall saying this? 
A.	No, we did not discuss it. 
Q.	So would it be fair to say that this lady did not tell you about the events that she had witnessed in your secteur? 
A.	No, she did not speak to me of it.  She did not speak of that to me. 
Q.	In relation to the Kayanga health centre massacres, you mentioned that one of the perpetrators was Brigadier Nyarwaya.  Do you recall saying this? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	You also told us that he was aided by other people, whose names you didn't mention.  Do you recall telling us this? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, if the Tutsi lady you fled with to Kibobo, if her husband was amongst the assailants at the Kayanga health centre massacres? 
A.	Yes.  He and other people went on board the vehicles to Kayanga. 
Q.	Did you know who the other people were, Madam Witness? 
A.	They were put in the vehicles.  The policemen forced members of the population to go with them to Kayanga to fight the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	I think we may be at a misunderstanding here.  I am not referring to the attacks on the Inkotanyi, Madam Witness, but the attacks that took place at the Kayanga health centre.  
A.	No. 
Q.	The attacks where four children were killed; do you recall telling us about these attacks? 
A.	I heard about those massacres but I was not an eyewitness, but the refugees from Kayanga told us of the events that had occurred at Kayanga dispensary -- health centre. 
Q.	And did you hear who the attackers were at the Kayanga dispensary? 
A.	Nyarwaya was one of the perpetrators and as well as other people whose names I did not hear mentioned. 
Q.	So you didn't learn that the lady -- the Tutsi lady's husband was amongst the attackers; is that correct? 
A.	No, he was not among the assailants. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Mr. President, I think I may have maybe about 30 minutes left of questions, so I don't know if it's appropriate for you that we take a break now, or should I continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think we should take a break now.  

Madam Witness, we take a short recess and we resume in 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed at 1030H) 
(Pages 1 to 16 by Karen Holm)



























(Court resumed at 1100H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we may resume.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good morning again, Madam Witness.
A.	Good morning, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Prior to the break that we took, you had told us that André Rwamakuba and his family were Hutu; do you remember telling us that?
A.	Yes, I did say so. 
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, what crimes André Rwamakuba is accused of having committed here?
A.	I heard over the radio that he allegedly took part in killings. 
Q.	Which radio did you hear this on?
A.	I heard that over the radio. 
Q.	Do you recall which radio station you heard it on?
A.	I heard that over Radio Rwanda.  The person who was making the broadcast mentioned about -- mentioned Arusha. 
Q.	And did -- when you met with the members of the Defence team, did they not tell you what he was accused of having done, having committed?
A.	They also told me that he's charged with having taken part in the killings. 
Q.	Would it put your mind at rest to know that he's not accused of the massacres at the parish and the school?
A.	Yes, I would be at rest if he were not accused of those massacres. 
Q.	Well, I can assure you that he isn't.  He is, however, accused of acts of genocide committed near the trading centre some ***********************************, a place you could not see from your home, could you?
A.	From my house I cannot see the centre. 
Q.	At the time, how many children did you have in 1994 -- April 1994, to be precise?
A.	I had four children. 
Q.	And as a mother of four children and a wife living some ************ away from the trading centre, you could not know what was taking place there at every moment of the day, could you?
A.	I cannot know. 
Q.	André Rwamakuba is also accused of participating in the Kayanga health centre massacres, massacres which you have testified you did not witness, but you learned some information about, but you did not know who the perpetrators were, other than Brigadier Nyarwaya, did you?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Madam Witness, am I correct in calculating that you left your secteur of origin, ******, some 25 years ago, didn't you?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And it is your testimony that this is the same secteur of origin of André Rwamakuba, is it not?
A.	No, that is not true. 
Q.	Perhaps there was a misinterpretation, but in your evidence-in-chief, towards the end, you talk about coming from the same place as André Rwamakuba.
A.	We do not hail from the same secteur. 
Q.	Is it correct that you hail from ******************, Madam Witness?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us where André Rwamakuba hails from?
A.	He's a native of Nduba secteur -- N-D-U-B-A.
Q.	Would it be accurate to describe these as neighbouring secteurs?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Madam Witness, are you aware of all the events that take place at Shango secteur today?
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you follow political meetings there in 1993 and 1994?
A.	I did not attend any meeting. 
Q.	I believe you described yourself as someone who was not political; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Were you aware of any political meetings held in Shango in 1993 and 1994?
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, you told the investigators in your statement of 2003 that you attended meetings at the communal office, I believe in your present area, as a *******************; is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can I ask when you were nominated representative, what year?
A.	That was in 1987. 
Q.	And how long did you hold this post for?
A.	I held that post up until 1994 when the war broke out. 
Q.	And these meetings you attended, were they political party meetings?
A.	No. 
Q.	Madam Witness, are you able to visit your husband in prison?
A.	Yes, I do visit him. 
Q.	Is he aware that you are here testifying in Arusha presently?
A.	He is not aware. 
Q.	Does he know where you are, Madam Witness?
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you come to Arusha with your children, Madam Witness?
A.	No. 
Q.	So would I be correct in concluding that you left your children in Rwanda, and your husband has no idea where you are today?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, if your husband is a witness in this case?
A.	I'm not aware. 
Q.	Now, you also stated in your evidence-in-chief that no one from the ICTR, with the exception, that is, of the Defence investigators, ever approached you; is that correct?
A.	I have not understood your question well. 
Q.	It is my understanding -- my understanding of the transcripts -- that you testified that you have never been approached by any member, be they investigators or prosecutors, of this present Tribunal, other of course than the Defence team; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  They are the only ones who have contacted me. 
Q.	Have you ever seen members of the ICTR in the vicinity or at the --
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	May I finish?  Have you ever seen members of the ICTR in the immediate vicinity or at the school and parish near where you live?
A.	I haven't seen them. 
Q.	Yet there have been members of the Office of the Prosecutor, investigators, in previous cases over a period of 10 years who have visited the school and parish, taken pictures, drawn sketches, measured distances, it is your testimony that you have never ever seen them?
A.	It is true that I've seen some white men who have come and taken pictures and have gone to see where the victims were buried, but I had no knowledge as to why they came to that location. 
Q.	Did you know which institution they belonged to, these white men?
A.	I do not know. 
Q.	Madam Witness, if someone were to approach you and ask you if you knew of a man named            Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, what would your response be?
A.	I hear that Kamuhanda is of the same secteur of origin as mine.  That is where I live. 
Q.	Do you know him, Madam Witness?
A.	I do not know him. 
Q.	Now, I get to the final point in my cross-examination.  I wish to show you, Madam Witness, a list of names which I would like you to refer to by number, and to tell the Court which of these people, if any, you know, and what relationship exists between you and a particular person, if any such relationship does exist.

If Mr. Registrar can assist me.  This list has been served to all parties, but you can certainly show it to everyone just before.

MR. HOOPER:
Can you provide us with another list, because we have not retained the last one, I'm afraid?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm afraid I don't have a spare copy.  Perhaps the interpreters' booth may be able to assist, as they don't really need the names.

For the record, though it was served on all parties at the beginning, the commencement of this witness's -- Issa, may I please have a look -- it was served on all parties at the beginning of this witness's testimony.  May I proceed? 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, I think you've had a little time to have a look at the list.  Can you focus your attention to No. 1, and can you tell this Court if you know this person, without naming them, simply by referring to the number?  Do you know this person, Madam Witness?
A.	I know that person. 
Q.	Is this person of any relation to you?
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you had occasion to discuss the events of April to July 1994 with this person?
A.	No. 
Q.	Moving down the list to No. 2, do you know this person?
A.	I do not know the person. 
Q.	And No. 3, do you know this person?
A.	Yes, I know the person. 
Q.	Is this person of any relation to you, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, he's the husband of my junior sister. 
Q.	Have you had an opportunity to discuss the events of the genocide with this person?
A.	He was put in prison immediately. 
Q.	And No. 4, do you know this person?
A.	I can't see clearly.  I think I know the No. 4. 
Q.	Would it help you if I told you she was -- she is, rather, a rather elderly lady of about *** years old?
A.	I know her.  *****************. 
Q.	Is she the person who told you about the events that took place at your father-in-law's house?
A.	Yes, she is the one who talked to me about it -- about them. 
Q.	And other than this tragic event where your father-in-law was killed, have you had occasion to discuss any other events concerning the genocide with this person?
A.	No. 
Q.	What about No. 5, Madam Witness, do you know this person?
A.	I do not know the person No. 5. 
Q.	And No. 6, do you know No. 6?
A.	No. 
Q.	Would it help if I told you that he came from the same secteur of origin as you?
A.	Are you referring to No. 6?  I do not know him.  I will tell you what I know. 
Q.	What do you know, Madam Witness; please tell us?  When you say you will tell us what you know, are you referring to No. 6, or generally? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  The French booth interpreters cannot hear you.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Just a moment, Madam Witness.  
A.	I am going to run down the list and tell you the numbers that I know.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has just given the name of one of those listed on the sheet of paper.  
THE WITNESS:  
	I know No. 7.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:  
Q.	Can you tell us how you know No. 7, Madam Witness?
A.	I am sorry that I pronounced the name.  I know this person.  The person lives a bit far from my house and I usually see that person in church. 
Q.	Have you and this person ever discussed the events of 1994?
A.	No. 
Q.	Can you tell us when the last time you saw this person was?
A.	It's been a long time since I last saw the person. 
Q.	No. 8, Madam Witness, do you know No. 8? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has just called out the name of the person on the list.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, if we can try and --
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	If you can try and follow my lead, Madam Witness, and just stick with the numbers that I tell you and tell me if you know the particular number I'm referring to or not.  I'm looking at No. 8.  Do you know No. 8?
A.	Yes, I know No. 8 -- no, I don't know him.  Rather, I know the No. 9. 
Q.	Can you tell us how you know No. 9?
A.	He also lives in my secteur of residence. 
Q.	Can you tell us when you last saw this person at No. 9?
A.	He lives very far from my home.  I don't see him very often, and we did not attend the same church; we don't go to the same church. 
Q.	Since 1994, have you ever had occasion to discuss with this person indicated at No. 9 the events of the genocide of April to July 1994?
A.	He was also arrested straight away and put in detention. 
Q.	Can I ask you to focus your attention now, Madam Witness, to the person at No. 10.  Do you know this person? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has just specified the duties of the person on No. 10, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will redact that information.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	So is it fair to conclude that you know the person at No. 10, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I know that person. 
Q.	Have you ever discussed the events of 1994 with that person?
A.	No. 
Q.	Is this person of any relation to you?
A.	No relationship. 
Q.	And the person at No. 11, finally, do you know this person?
A.	I do not know this person.
Q.	Would it assist you if I told you the person was married to the person indicated as No. 1?
A.	Yes, I think perhaps I misread -- I also know that person. 
Q.	And this person is of no relation to you, Madam Witness?
A.	No, there is no relation at all -- no relationship. 
Q.	And you have never discussed the events of 1994 with this person; is that correct?
A.	No, I never discussed that with him. 
Q.	Do you know where this person is today, Madam Witness?
A.	No. 
Q.	What about No. 10, who you told us you knew; do you know where No. 10 is today?
A.	No. 
Q.	So of all the people that you know on this list, I note seven, you have never ever discussed the events of 1994 with any of these people; is that correct?
A.	No, I never discussed the events of 1994 with anyone on this list. 
Q.	And all of these people on this list are from the same secteur as you; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So, Madam Witness, would it be fair to conclude that, of these seven people from the same secteur as you where the Prosecutor alleges crimes were committed by André Rwamakuba, if any of these people had seen him or had heard of him committing crimes, you would be none the wiser; that's correct, isn't it?
A.	Yes, I would have known.  If he had come to my secteur and had committed crimes, I think I would have known of it. 
Q.	Would you, Madam Witness, have learned of it from these seven people that you state that you know?
A.	No. 
Q.	So can we agree that if any of these seven people, who you know, had seen Rwamakuba during the genocide committing acts, you would not know about it?
A.	I would not have known it.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I have no further questions for this witness, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Cummings-John.  

Madam Witness, you will still have to answer a few other questions.  The rules require that counsel for the Defence may ask you a few additional questions.  So you now have to answer Mr. Hooper.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	First of all, in respect of the names on that list, in case you're in any way misled, I want to make it clear that not one of them has suggested that Rwamakuba came to your cellule or secteur to participate in the genocide -- none of them have said that.

Now, in terms of the ones on that list that you know, can I just take you, if you still have the list, to No. 10?  Is he from your cellule, or not?
A.	No, he is not a native of our secteur. 
Q.	And when you say you know him, without mentioning his function which you did earlier, do you know him because of his function within the commune, or do you know him personally in some other way?  Can you help us with that?
A.	I know him because of the position he held in the commune.  Moreover, he had sought refuge in our area.  That's where he gathered people together and forced them to go and attack in Kayanga. 
Q.	Now, No. 4 on the list -- that's the old lady you described *********************** -- have you in fact discussed the events of the genocide with her?
A.	The only thing we spoke of are the circumstances of the death of my father-in-law. 
Q.	In respect of No. 7, who you say you met in church, have you any other personal contact with him other than seeing him there?
A.	No, apart from the fact that I see him at church. 
Q.	No. 9, what is the position with No. 9?  When you say you know him, is it a question you know of him, or you have some personal contact with him, or had personal contact with him; which is it?
A.	I know that person, but he is not a neighbour.  He was also immediately arrested and imprisoned, detained. 
Q.	Now, on the 12th, you've told us that you subsequently learnt that before the group went to the school to kill, that they had visited Gikomero commercial centre, and that there two people were killed.  And you told us that the next day you in fact confirmed that by seeing their corpses in the centre.  I want to ask you this: do you know the names or the origin or any details about who those two people were?
A.	After the massacre at the school, two children were killed. 
Q.	Yes.  Let me stop you there -- 
A.	Those children came with the refugees. 
Q.	Let me stop you there.  I'm not asking you about the children who were killed two weeks or so after the massacre at the school.  I'm asking you about the two persons who were killed on the same day as the massacre at the school, at the centre, which you told us occurred when the Rubungo group passed through the centre on their way to the school.  Do you know anything about those two?
A.	Yes, I know the victims -- the name of the victims at the commercial centre. 
Q.	Can you give us those names, please, and, if possible, can you spell them out?
A.	The first one's name was Muramba, and he came from Rubungo; he was from Rubungo.  Muramba is spelt M-U-R-A-M-B-A -- M-U-R-A-M-B-A, Muramba. 
Q.	Do you know the name of the other one, or any details of where that other one came from?
A.	The other victim was from Gikomero secteur, Kibobo cellule, and his name was Turatsinze. 
Q.	And can you spell that, please?
A.	T-U-R-A-T-S-I-N-Z-E -- T-U-R-A-T-S-I-N-Z-E. 
Q.	Now, you were asked about a councillor called *****************, who is the current councillor; is that right?  I say "current", because I understand, is this right, that elections are about to be held for that position, but he's the current conseiller of Gikomero secteur; is that right?
A.	Yes, he is still councillor of Gikomero secteur. 
Q.	Now, in his case, do you know his ethnic origin?
A.	Tutsi, Tutsi. 
Q.	Do you know if he stayed or fled during the genocide and, if he did flee, on what date he fled?
A.	I know that he also fled towards Butare (as interpreted), but I couldn't tell you on what date he fled. 
Q.	And when you say Butare (sic), is that Butare the trading centre in Gikomero commune, or is it Butare, the university town?  Which one is it?
A.	No, Rutare -- R-U-T-A-R-E; not Butare, but Rutare, R-U-T-A-R-E. 
Q.	And do you know when he went there, or have I missed that?  Do you know when he fled there?
A.	No, I do not know on what date he fled. 
Q.	Now, you told us that when you returned in July after the genocide that you didn't speak -- people didn't speak about the events.  But over the 11 years since then, has that remained the position?  Have people discussed it since then, or not?
A.	When the Gacaca process began, that is when people began to speak of it. 
Q.	Now, in respect of André Rwamakuba, you've told us that you remember meeting him as a schoolgirl many years ago, but that you've had no contact with him since; you've not seen him since and, indeed, if presented with him, you would not be able to recognise him, you think.  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And not knowing him or having a relationship with him, have you any motive to come here to lie in order in any way to protect or defend him?
A.	No, there would be no interest in it for me to come and lie before the Trial Chamber and exculpate him.  We have the obligation in the Gacaca process to speak the truth, the whole truth, as to what happened in -- during the events of 1994 in our country. 
Q.	Now, the Prosecution in this case, if I can put it in a nutshell, alleged here that André Rwamakuba came to Gikomero trading centre on or about the 12th of April -- but don't worry at the moment about the date, about that time -- to quote "kick off the genocide in Gikomero secteur" and that having arrived there as a Minister of the government, he incited people to commit genocide, to start the killing and, indeed, three people were then murdered at the centre, and then a few days later he came back and gathered people to go to murder the people at Kayanga health centre.  If he had done any of those things, is there any chance that you would not have heard about it then or in the 11 years since?
A.	I would have known of all those events, because in the meantime the Gacaca sessions began and many people testified or provided information that matches, that fits each other -- that fit together.  So I don't see how I could not have heard of those events up to today, all the more so since they occurred in our home cellule. 
Q.	Now, let me ask you about a man of whom I have little or no interest -- a man called                         Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, and you told us a moment ago that you knew that he came from the same secteur as you now -- in circumstances you explained.

Do you know that he was convicted of leading the massacre at the Protestant school that you've described; did you know that?
A.	We heard it over the radio. 
Q.	And may I ask, what was your reaction and those of others at Gikomero secteur on learning of that conviction of Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda over the radio?  What was the reaction of you local people to that news?
A.	All the local inhabitants were surprised to hear those allegations, because we know he never came to that Protestant school. 
Q.	And whatever others may say, have you told the truth over the several days that you've given evidence, and nothing but the truth?
A.	Yes, I have spoken the truth, nothing but the truth, and all the truth. 
Q.	And, finally, you've told us about your husband being in prison, and you've told us what you believe the circumstances of that detention are and the reasons why he was put in prison.  And you've told us that he doesn't know about you being here today.
A.	No, he doesn't know. 
Q.	And would you have any fear as to what might happen to him because of your evidence, or not?
A.	No one knows of my presence here to testify.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Before I sit down, can I ask you not to leave this building until I've spoken to you, because otherwise they may take you to a safe house and I may not be able to meet you again.  So please don't leave the building or let someone take you from this building until I've spoken to you again later this morning and, in the meantime, Mr. President, unless you or your brother Judges have a question of the witness, that is this witness's testimony.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.

Madam Witness, this has come to the end of your evidence.  We thank you for coming here and testifying in the Tribunal, but now you are excused and you may leave.  Thank you very much.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you equally, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the registrar has reminded me that you may have an exhibit or two to put in with regard to this witness.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you very much.  Yes, I've got a list, or I had a list on Friday, but I'm afraid I misplaced it and it's being renewed.  Thank you. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Perhaps with leave from Your Honours, I can go ahead with the exhibits we wish to put in.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're trying to maintain a -- it doesn't matter, you have a different numbering system.  Yes, you can do that.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
It's regarding this particular witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know.  What we are trying to do is to make certain that there is a proper chronology.  But it doesn't matter, because your numbers are different.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
P.

MR. HOOPER:
Yes, they have in fact been discussed and exhibit numbers given.  The personal identification sheet for witness 3/11, to be kept under seal, D. 158.
(Exhibit No. D. 158 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
The name written down by the witness -- that name was the name of **** -- to be kept under seal, exhibit D. 159.
(Exhibit No.  D. 159 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
Exhibited is now the CD containing photographs of Gikomero, D. 160.
(Exhibit No. D. 160 admitted)
MR. HOOPER:
And those are the Defence exhibits.  Thank you, Mr. Fry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The first document that we would like exhibited, under seal, is the witness's statement or statements, the document that was served on the Prosecutor by the Defence, numbered 1306 to 1303.  This is the CMS numbering.  And that is to be placed under seal.  I'm terribly sorry, I'm not sure what the number is that we've arrived at.  
MR. FRY:
P. 76, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 76 admitted, under seal)
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
The second and final document is the list that was shown to the witness entitled "List for Witness 3/11", and that should also be placed under seal, I believe as P. 77.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No.  P. 77 admitted, under seal)
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Cummings-John.

Mr. Hooper, the CD that was admitted contains about 60 photographs.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What actually is admitted into evidence? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we've proposed the CD and not this witness, the next witness, I'll take on a trawl, if need be, through the entire document, so that there will be someone who will speak as to each photograph on the exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the photographs are numbered?  
MR. HOOPER:
They are.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So should the exhibits reflect the numbers, CD --
MR. HOOPER:
I respectfully suggest not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that not necessary?  
MR. HOOPER:
Because the CD, once exhibited, the numbers are plainly referred to in the course of the transcripts.  It will save adding another 50 or so exhibit numbers to our lists.  So if it can be put in compendiously at this point, they will be dealt with very shortly -- relatively shortly -- this week, certainly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.
MR. HOOPER:
The only other matter perhaps I could raise at this stage is this: if there are statements in the Prosecution possession relating to the massacre at the school, it is our submission that they must necessarily fall into the category of exculpatory material unless they mention André Rwamakuba.  We have been served with none.

I would also mention that some weeks ago -- a month or so ago we wrote to the Prosecution enumerating about 30 statements, I think, relating to statements that had been served by the Prosecution in the Butare case that came to our knowledge recently, or a few months ago, and that these statements concerned events both at Butare hospital and at the préfecture building, both of which are scenes of crime relating to the Accused Rwamakuba.  

We wrote and asked that they be served on us, and we were provided a helpful reply that they would be served but that they were in the process of redaction.  And that redaction took about a month or so, as far as I can make out.

But we've never had them.  Though there was a claim that they had been served on us, I've made enquiries and, as far as I can see, they haven't been served on us, unless they have been lost somewhere in the system.

Now, the significance of these statements are that they may have great significance and may, of course, lead to further Defence enquiries in respect of the people to whom they relate, which is why we've been pursuing them for several months.

So I stress that it's a matter of concern to us, and I'm sure to the Tribunal, that if these statements are in fact available, that they should be served forthwith.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, and I'd like to respond to that.  On the first issue concerning -- that witness statements relating to the school that do not mention Rwamakuba be considered exculpatory, I'm frankly at a loss, because we're not alleging any crimes at the school or the parish, so I don't see how they can be considered exculpatory if they do not mention the Accused.  That's number 1.  

No. 2:  Mr. O'Shea had previously spoken to me in relation to the witness statements that were requested.  I have emailed, I believe, all parties in the Defence team stating that we could not give them the full list that they had asked for, because we were told by the Prosecution team in the Butare case that they did not actually use all these statements -- they did not refer to all these witnesses.

However, they did provide us with a list of some 10 or 15 -- I really cannot be certain, but they did provide us a list of those who they did use, and we did subsequently pull out these statements, redact them and, according to the request for facts to admit, the Defence in their index of exhibits had listed Butare, or statements relating to Butare the Prosecution is to serve, and we incorporated it in this document which was served on all parties.  So it is in this document, and I can confirm that, and I think CMS can also confirm that, that we have served them with these statements and they have all been redacted, as requested, Your Honour.  Thank you.

And may I just also raise the point?  On Friday, I believe Mr. Hooper stated that he would verify whether statements for this witness that had been signed did exist.  Since then we have not had any feedback.  It would be very kind if he could get back to us on that.  
And, furthermore, if questions are put to a witness and answers are given, it is our submission that they should fall within the same rule that applied to us, which is from the Niyitegeka judgment, and that they should be communicated as witness statements.  

So that Mr. Hooper and his team meet with witnesses, put questions to them, and do not communicate this to us we submit is a violation of the rules.  We can ask that these statements be communicated as will-say statements, which is what we did during the Prosecution case; that is, when Defence counsel go to meet with witnesses, they put questions to them, responses are given.  These can be signed by the Defence counsel and subsequently communicated to us.

If notes of investigators exist, we also submit that it is the duty of the Defence counsel to communicate these notes to us, as we did during our presentation.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, dealing with the several issues, first of all, in relation to Gikomero school statements, if I can put it like that, it's an extraordinary position to seek to assume that a major crime committed 200 yards away from where Rwamakuba is meant to have been exhorting the population to commit genocide, that the persons who make statements and their statements should not in fact be disclosed to us, the Defence for Rwamakuba.  Because, after all, each of those witnesses must have been in the secteur at the time, each of them must have got to the school in some way, and each of them, as they are alive to tell the story, have got a subsequent history.

If they don't mention Rwamakuba at all in any of this, then I would have thought it's compelling that the Defence would be, of course, deeply interested in what they say.  And we ask it, if for nothing else, as an act of fairness.  This surely isn't the behaviour, to keep these statements pressed to the chest, not to permit the Defence to share in the knowledge that the Prosecution have, to decide that the Prosecution, and the Prosecution alone, will apply the criteria in those circumstances.

Secondly, in respect of statements served, or believed by the Defence to have been served as a result, of course, of our receiving a Prosecution document -- and I have the document in which these statements are stated as having been served in the Butare case, a Prosecution document listing the statements served in the Butare case, and I'm told this morning that not all of them were used.  

Well, frankly, whether they were used or not, the issue is if these are witnesses, again with a history of living and surviving the hospital during the relevant period, they must prima facie be exculpatory unless they mention André Rwamakuba and, even if they mention him, it depends, of course, on the context in which he's mentioned.

So, again, in order for us to deal with the Defence case fairly and squarely and to respond to the Prosecution case fairly and squarely, we demand that we have served on us those redacted statements.

On the last point, we can go to an extensive argument in respect of the duties -- my duties as counsel in respect of my notes.  In fact, Niyitegeka has perhaps been somewhat overtaken by the decision in Sesay in the Sierra Leone case, where counsel's notes were emphatically stated not to be admissible.  

But, in any event, it is somewhat disingenuous of the Prosecution to claim that they have conducted themselves with this open hand; they haven't.  I believe, of course, when Mr. Morley presented a witness, we did get the benefit of a will-say, but when Ms. Fall presented a witness, I don't think we ever saw one.  So let us be a bit careful about sauces for geese and sauces for ganders.
MS. FALL:
Objection.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I know that.  Thank you, Ms. Fall.  

The position is this: we have been, we consider, rather sanctimoniously perhaps, open-handed with the Prosecution, and we will continue to be.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I merely wanted to tell Counsel Hooper that probably he has a short memory, but I believe I can give him examples that come to mind.  I think with RW I did serve upon him a will-say that I duly signed.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We do not propose to make any rulings at the moment.  We'll consider what has been said, and in due course we'll respond to you.

Mr. Hooper, are you going to call your next witness now? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We only have 15 minutes.
MR. HOOPER:
I know.  Yes, certainly.  Can I call Mr. 3/10, please.  And have the witness identification forms been circulated sufficiently?  No?  If one could be placed on the witness stand or in the witness box. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, before the witness is called in, I wish, in respect of the disclosure of --
(Witness enters courtroom)
MS. FALL:
-- documents that we talked about here, and with respect to the statement made by the witness -- well, he doesn't have his headset on, so I may as well proceed with what I'm saying.

May I proceed, Mr. President?  Well, concerning those statements, both the statements that some witnesses say they signed but the Defence counsel says they were not signed, we would like to have all statements signed by the witness.  On the other hand, we wish to be served with all the notes that were taken by the Defence counsel and that we can consider to be will-say and we think that this is necessary, that this should be done.  

And I think the Prosecution has, at a certain point, made a written motion concerning those documents, or, rather, the Prosecution will make a written motion in respect of the documents in question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We'll take this into account when we consider the submissions that were raised.  Did you wish to add something, Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Mr Registrar, could you prepare the witness for taking the oath?  

Mr. Witness, can you hear me now? 
THE WITNESS:
   I can hear you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming here to give testimony in this trial.  The first step will be that the Registrar will give you an oath to tell the truth, and you must now take the oath from the Registrar.
(Declaration made by Witness 3/10 in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you'll be giving your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  The first lawyer who will question you will be Mr. Hooper, who is the lawyer for the Accused André Rwamakuba.  

Mr. Hooper? 

MR. HOOPER:
Yes, can we go into closed session and I'll deal with the witness identification form in closed session and then refer back to it when we go into open session and I'll try, in the time left to us of 10 minutes this morning, to cover as much of the closed session questions that I need to ask this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We'll go into closed session now.  For the members of the public who are present, we take our adjournment at 12:30, which means we will not be resuming in open session until tomorrow morning.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 34 to 37] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
