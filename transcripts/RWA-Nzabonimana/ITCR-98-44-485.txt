     (Pages 1 to 10 were extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the proceedings commenced in 
     closed session)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. MAWERE:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution requests to tender into evidence the two -- the Gacaca documents in Kinyarwanda, with an uncertified English translation, and the sketch that was shown to the witness and he made markings on it.  

I have served my learned colleague with a copy of the document -- copies of the documents and a justification dated 6 July 2010, and she advises (sic) that there is no objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Defence Counsel, we would like for you to confirm whether that is the case.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
We have no objection, but we -- I revert to the reservations that I made earlier on, or the comments that I made earlier on, on counsel for the Prosecution's map.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

So the Trial Chamber -- 

Learned Counsel for the Prosecution, you want to tender the Gacaca record with the translation in English; is that the case?  
MR. MAWERE:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Gacaca record of the witness, is there a date on this?  
MR. MAWERE:
No, I could not see the date.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, the Gacaca record in Kinyarwanda, and its English translation, together with the modification, dated 6 July 2010, are tendered as one exhibit for the Prosecution.  And it is Exhibit?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 60. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps P. 60A, and we order that a translation be made of the Kinyarwanda Gacaca record into French.  And it will be P. 6B -- P. 60B. 
(Exhibit Nos. P. 60A and P. 60B admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber notes the reservations of the Defence team on the sketch, which was drawn by the witness (sic) but, nevertheless, admits this sketch as marked by the witness.  And it is 
	Prosecution Exhibit P. 61. 

Is that the case, Registry?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. MAWERE:
Madam President, Your Honours, for clarification, the sketch was actually drawn by the Prosecutor and shown to the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have said the sketch is -- is marked by the witness.  
MR. MAWERE:
The -- the earlier portion states "drawn by the witness and marked". 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  The correction is made then that the sketch was drawn by the Prosecution and marked by the witness.  And it is Exhibit P. 61.  
     (Exhibit No. P. 61 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, can we have a look at the marked exhibits?  
MR. MAWERE:
Thank you, Madam President.  That will be all.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, Your Honours, I'm sorry.  I just want to make a clarification in terminology.  The Gacaca document which you entered into evidence is not a judgement.  It is the -- the judicial file -- or, the case file of the witness.  It is not a judgement sentencing the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we called it a record.  We just called it a Gacaca record in English.  So the translation should reflect that.  Is that okay?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well, for the English.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right then.  Who is your next witness, Defence Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Witness T134.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Before the witness is brought in, Learned Counsel, the Trial Chamber would like to note that a ruling stands regarding this witness, and we hope that you will take it into account, in accordance with our decision dated 4th June 2010.  

Can we have the witness brought in court, Registry?  
MR. KIYEYEU:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, can the witness make the solemn declaration, please. 
(Declaration made by Witness T134 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, good morning.  
THE WITNESS: 
(No interpretation) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, turn on your microphone before you speak, and close it when you are done.  
THE WITNESS: 
Very well, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We -- we sent you a greeting and we didn't hear your response.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now kindly switch off your microphone, Witness.  

Before you begin your testimony, we wanted to advise you on how the proceedings will unfold in the Trial Chamber.  The first thing we would like to remind you about is to keep your microphone switched off when you are not speaking and only to leave it open when you are about to speak.  

And we would like to know from you which language you'll be using to testify.  Will you be speaking in Kinyarwanda?  
THE WITNESS: 
I will use my mother tongue, Kinyarwanda.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now that we know that you will be using Kinyarwanda to testify, Witness, we would like to advise you that there is a technical problem if you switch on your microphone and immediately begin to speak without pausing.  Part of your testimony is lost and the Accused cannot hear your testimony, neither can the Judges or anyone else in this courtroom.  We would, therefore, advise you to -- to observe a brief pause.  If you know how to count, count one up to three before you begin answering.  That will facilitate the hearing and recording of your testimony in full.  

Now, with regard to the procedures that will be followed, you will give your testimony first in examination-in-chief, and you will be led in this regard by the team for the Defence, which is seated on your left.  
THE WITNESS: 
I can see them.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecution team will, in turn, ask you questions in cross-examination.  And the Prosecution team is seated on your right below the translation booths.  

The Judges -- have you seen the Prosecution team, Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can see the Prosecution team.  However, there is something I would like to say before I begin.  Madam President, would you allow me to do so?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, first listen to the instructions.  Then we will find out whether we will allow you to address us.  We are in open session and you are a protected witness.  The public is out there listening to what you are saying.  So, first listen to the instructions.  It may be -- it may very well be that the question you want to ask me can be answered by the directions of the Chamber.  But if it is not, we will allow you to put the question to the Chamber at the end.  

So we wanted to also inform you that the Judges are entitled to ask you any question at any time during the proceedings.  It might be a matter for clarification or any other matter.  You are obliged to answer all questions put to you by any team and by the Judges.  Answer all the questions put to you directly and briefly.  Long narrations are difficult to interpret and understand and record.  We have interpreters interpreting your testimony in both English and French.  We also have recorders, who record it in these languages.  So they -- they need to -- to hear clearly what you are saying and to translate and record it.  And, of course, the Accused and the Trial Chamber and all the parties are interested to hear what you have to say.  So be short, brief and precise in your answers.  

We also require you to be courteous to all the parties and all the officers present in this courtroom.  Likewise, we require everybody here to extend the same courtesy to you.  
We have already indicated that you are a protected witness; therefore, some of your testimony may be taken in a closed session to safeguard your identity should the Chamber consider that the information that you may give may identify you.  You will, therefore, be testifying in both closed sessions and open sessions.  It is, however, up to the Trial Chamber to decide whether you should be testifying in closed session or open session.  

When we are in open session, the public is allowed to attend and to get hold of the record made of such a session.  Therefore, when we -- we are there, as we are now, we will be advising you and you must be careful not to mention people or places that may identify you.  

In a closed session, the public will be excluded and you may give any information, even if it may identify you, and you will be advised again that we are moving into a closed session.  

We believe that if you follow these simple instructions, your testimony will be quickly finished and you will return home to carry on with your life.  

Witness, are the directions of the Trial Chamber clear to you?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, they are.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you need any further clarifications?  
THE WITNESS: 
I don't have anything further to say.  If you have questions to ask, then you put them to me and it would be left to you to decide whether we would go into closed session or remain in open session.  I am ready.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness. 

Defence Counsel, we hand over the witness to you. 
WITNESS T134,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Counsel (sic), you have before you a document which is in French.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
So maybe an interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth may be so kind as to interpret it for the witness.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	On that document, there is information with respect to your identity.  So it is going to be translated to you.  And if you find errors therein, please, notify the Chamber.  But, please, I would like to caution you to be careful because we are in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could one of the Kinyarwanda interpreters come down to assist the witness, please.  

And as he comes down, Interpreter -- English Interpreter, we notice that you said "Counsel", in the question, and we believe it was a mistake.  You said:  "Counsel, you have before you a document which is in French."  We believe you intended to refer to the witness. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I meant it -- the witness, Madam President.  My apologies. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Yes, Witness, don't say aloud anything while the document is being interpreted to you.  And perhaps you should remove your earphones so that you can listen clearly to the interpreter.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
It is done, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Interpreter.  You may return to your seat. 

Defence Counsel.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Very well.  Witness, are there any mistakes in the document?  
A.	There are none.  
Q.	Could you kindly sign and date the document.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Now can this document be admitted under seal?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, any objection?  
MS. MAPOSA:
None, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification sheet of this witness is entered as a Prosecution exhibit -- Defence exhibit.  Sorry.  

MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 41. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 41, under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of this witness, who is a protected witness. 
 (Exhibit No. D. 41 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well.  As I'm going to begin with aspects of the identity of the witness, I would like to begin in closed session.  After that I will have more questions of a general nature, which I will put in 
	open session.  And then I would come back to questions which could lead to him being identified, and at that time I will apply again for another closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

We'll request members of the public to leave at this moment, as the questions that are being -- that are going to be put to the witness may identify him.  We hope it will be for a short time.  We regret this.  

Can we move into closed session, Registry?  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 18 to 61] were extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 11 to 17 by Lisa Smith)
















1630H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We would now like to revert to housekeeping.  

Defence Counsel, we would like to hear your submissions on the proposal to hand the documents 
in between witness testimonies.  And, also, we would like to know who your next witness is tomorrow morning.  If you could cover both before Prosecution counsel responds.  

Defence Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
The next witness will be Witness T97.  Ninety-seven.  

So with respect to the exhibits, I am not at all in agreement with the Prosecutor.  I can't say we have discussed -- I mean, I'm ready to discuss, but I really want to know what we're discussing about.  
So -- so I believe that with regard to the exhibits, there are exhibits which raise some difficulties for the Prosecutor.  As is likely -- I mean, that is his role to play.  But I believe that a vast majority -- majority of the exhibits do not raise any problems, be it statements -- Prosecution witness statements which we have used systematically during our cross-examinations.  

Those are documents that maybe we are not going to spend a lifetime talking about.  Those items were disclosed to the Prosecution in three files.  Those are things which I believe we can tender into evidence.  As for the others, the witness is waiting on the Prosecutor.  We can't tell you if there are difficulties which are going to be raised on a given item.  

What I would like to tell the Chamber is that we have done our best to ease the work of everyone.  
The items were disclosed in the files with tags.  And I believe that their identification will be at the time when the document will be used during proceedings, so it isn't difficult to familiarise -- familiarise ourselves with the document when and at what time it was used.  

So in sum, what I'm telling the Chamber is that to better manage the time of the Chamber, as from Thursday, we can begin.  So if there are some reserva -- reservations regarding some of the exhibits, our understanding is that maybe, if the Prosecution is so disposed, we can look at it at the end of 
next week.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Just before Prosecution counsel responds, Learned Counsel for the Defence, we have this question for you:  The witness who is beginning tomorrow is D -- T97.  When is the next witness scheduled to arrive? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
The following witness for Wednesday is expected to arrive on Wednesday evening, but we won't be able to see him.  So it's not going to be a witness -- we're not going to -- to see the witness at night.  It's not a witness who's going to -- he's not -- the witness is not going able to appear on Thursday.  

So I would like to remind the Chamber that we didn't bring many witnesses because we -- my calculations showed that in the past sessions, we had had 2.6 witnesses per week -- per week.  
So -- because, as the Bench is fully aware, we have a problem because the WVSS does not want us to bring people too long before they appear because it is costly and, of course, our prime concern of not wasting the Trial Chamber's time, so we brought witnesses in that manner.  

So I thought that based on the average of 2.6 per week that we calculated, then, 2.6 should be sufficient for this week.  And I was mistaken.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Our -- our question now is, given that this witness is arriving on Wednesday evening, if you're granted Thursday morning to meet this witness, can't we start this witness in the afternoon of Thursday? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, I'm going to be very candid -- candid.  Normally I'm not the person who is supposed to deal with this witness.  It was, rather, Counsel Larochelle because this is something that she (sic) is focused on.  It's a witness on Nyakabanda, and she's the one who did all of that.  So I know only part of the -- the file.  

Now, if there are two counsels here, it is because we have shared the work.  So I wouldn't have enough time in one morning, considering the fact that I've never met the -- the witness in order to have a -- I don't believe that I would have -- I will not have had enough time if it less than one full day.  

Furthermore, Larochelle arrives on Thursday, so -- since we still have one week to go -- one week to go for these two witnesses.

Furthermore, I would like to remind the Chamber that we have tried to be flexible.  As a matter of fact, we have been flexible in view of -- with respect to the organisation of this session which, I believe, will go on well.  

I believe that on the other side, we also appeal for some flexibility as well for us to manage our time with respect to the division of -- of labour that the counsel, who have agreed to change their timetable to enable -- to attend this July sess -- session.  

As a matter of fact, from the onset, what -- said -- that we were not in agreement with this, but we adjusted in view of ensuring some flexibility.  That's it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Firstly, Madam President, I think it was your advice to all of us to adjust ourselves better and to organise our work in such a way that it brings efficiency to this Chamber.  

Now I'm a bit taken aback when counsel says that he's not prepared to interview T117 in the morning.  
We had a big problem.  We had indicated to the Chamber that we were not even ready to start this session because of various parenting obligations.  But counsel forced us into it and we -- we adjusted ourselves, planned our work, and we're here now and we're doing a good job.  So he should do the same.  He cannot have his cake and eat it.  So on that score, I would leave it at that.  

Now, coming to the documents, it appears that my learned friend is behind the news because my team and his team have been talking.  And we have spoken to the other side and said -- pointed out some certain errors in the documents.  

For instance, it is the ruling of this Chamber that the documents that need to be put in should be underlined.  So when we pointed out some of those items, I think we were in agreement that some of those documents need to be underlined.  We can't just accept them as they are.  

And, secondly, there's a lot of cross-referencing in the justification to transcripts, and we 
need to -- to look at them and clarify those transcripts.  

So I still feel that we -- we need -- we need a bit more time to -- to clarify those -- those points.  And I think it would be too ambitious to have this matter done maybe on Thursday, as the Chamber proposes, but we can organise our work so that we have this weekend to work with the Defence team.  And most of them are quite agreeable.  It's only that some of the rules that have been set down by Chamber, in our view, have not been met.  

So instead of coming to argue it out here, I think we can agree that either this document is wholly going to be put in without any underlining or that they be underlined as the Court had directed.  So I think that it would be too ambitious to -- to target this -- this Thursday.  

We think that this Thursday -- the Defence wants this Thursday for these exercises only because Mr. Larochelle is not here to take a witness.  I don't think that we should be pressed to do something that we are not quite ready to do just because our learned friends are not ready.  

So in that respect, I would request that this -- we can organise our work so that next week -- in any event, we only have two witnesses for next week.  Then we can be able to do the documents then.  
As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Defence Counsel, briefly.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I would like to point out to the Prosecutor that we did not accept this session because we wanted 
to create problems for him.  We thought that we would arrange things for the Chamber because there are Judges who have obligations and commitments in various Chambers.  So we, counsel -- we thought that we'll have tiny sessions that are split up instead of two months of one session, which is complicated for us because we don't have just one trial going for us.  It was not to prevent Mr. Ng'arua from going on vacation.  I would have wanted to be on vacation myself.  

But, secondly, I would like to tell my learned friend, Mr. Ng'arua, that we've already worked with him because we've already had one corrected element -- or whatever you wanted to be underscored has been underlined -- treated.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

All right.  In the spirit of facilitating the continued discussion and rapport between Prosecution and counsel, and in the interests of serene proceedings, we will allow both parties to prepare on Thursday after the conclusion of the testimony of the coming witness.  And we'll take on the remaining witnesses next week.  And after the conclusion of their testimonies, we will deal with the documents.  

We hope that we will be done by Wednesday so that all of us can go and fulfil our respective obligations elsewhere.  Let's aim to do that.  

That said, these proceedings are adjourned to tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock in the morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1641H)
