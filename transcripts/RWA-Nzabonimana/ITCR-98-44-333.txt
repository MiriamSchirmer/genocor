P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we're now sitting in a status conference, and the major item on the agenda -- or the item that we want to put on the agenda is a discussion on the -- on the scheduling for the case, the time windows for activities as we see it.  I must indicate that we think that perhaps after the 
status conference, which we think should not last very long, that it might be appropriate then to break and commence the cross-examination of this witness after the luncheon break.  

I think I'm at liberty to say that the witness in the witness box will not be on the Ngirumpatse witness list.  I think we're at liberty to say that much.  

The calendar as we -- we think it will develop is that after we've completed our Karemera work this week, which I think we are still on schedule to complete the existing witnesses during the course of this week, that we will continue with the Kalimanzira sitting until the end of the month of May.  Then, our Chamber will take a two-week break and resume on the 16th of June, where we will continue with Kalimanzira.  

We expect that that case -- the Prosecution case will be completed by the end of June, whereupon we expect to resume with the presentation of Karemera's Defence for two weeks or thereabouts until the commencement of the -- the judicial recess, around the middle of July.  The judicial recess is approximately four weeks; it resumes around the middle of August and we expect that Karemera will continue with the presentation of Karemera's Defence to completion.  And we expect that completion to be on or about the first or second week of September, whereupon the Ngirumpatse Defence will commence.  

It will have approximately until the middle of October, when the Chamber will break.  After the break, we will commence with Kalimanzira's Defence, which, we expect, will take about 
four weeks - or, perhaps, five weeks to be completely presented.  And, thereafter, 
Ngirumpatse's Defence will continue until we break in December.  

It will resume immediately after Christmas.  That's -- I think that's around our first sitting time in January, and we expect that the Ngirumpatse Defence will complete -- will be completed at the beginning of February.  And then we'll have the Nzirorera -- will then put on his defence to -- to completion.  

Now, that's the -- I've deliberately used the language of time windows rather than specific dates, but I'll be grateful if there's any -- any reason why our vision could not be applied as we have expressed it.  

Yes, Ms. Diagne? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
In fact, the translation seems to have swallowed a term -- that is, the -- you were saying -- you were saying that the Joseph Nzirorera case will start in February.  And, when will it end?  
Question -- this is what we did not hear. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's logical that you should not have heard, because I did not say.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Oh, I see, that's where it was left hanging and when things are left hanging -- well, that's when I stand up because when each and every one of us is supposed to know when we start and finish, then I believe that Nzirorera's Defence team needs to know that too.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we also have had some filings from the Nzirorera Defence team, and as we have done with regard to Karemera and Ngirumpatse, we intend to have an ex parte conference with 
Nzirorera's team before making a final decision.  

Now, we had to do it in terms of sequence.  We had to do Karemera first, then we had to do Ngirumpatse, and then we have to do Nzirorera.  So over the next few days, we will be making arrangements to have our ex parte conference with the Nzirorera Defence team, and we'll have to deal with who is here.  So, Ms. Diagne, your question will be answered shortly.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I would just like to say on this subject and, once and for all, give you the position of Édouard Karemera's team as to the subject of ex parte meetings.  The other Defence teams -- and you, yourself, the Trial Chamber -- went ahead as you saw best; however, I would like to remind you of a principle, that is to say, the joint trial.  The only external party to my team is the Prosecutor.  So what I would like to say to you is that every time that a decision is taken to hold an ex parte meeting, then I expect to have at my side the team of Mathieu Ngirumpatse and the team of Joseph Nzirorera, because I do not forget the term joint trial, which is used to describe our case.  And nor do I forget the common indictment.  And nor do I forget the fact that we have been accused of being part of a joint criminal enterprise.  And for all these reasons, Mr. President, 
I would not like the Trial Chamber to call upon us separately.  

Now, as regards the team for Édouard Karemera, I would like you to know that whenever you invite us to hold a discussion, you must always call the two other Defence teams to attend.  
And I wanted to vehemently remind you of this fact, Mr. President, and I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have heard you and we'll take note of it.  It -- it introduces a slight modification to the general understanding of what an ex parte filing is, but we will understand that you wish us to adopt that interpretation to your ex parte filings in the future and we will take note of it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, on the Prosecution side -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I'm sorry, yes, Mr. President, except with the example of Édouard Karemera's team, we have never filed a request in so doing excluding our two friendly teams.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we'll take your word for it, but the -- the more obvious meaning of the submissions you've filed did indicate that to us.  But now you've made your verbal statements, we will take that into account when we read your future filings.  
(Pages 1 to 3 by Jean Baigent)
























1100H 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, on the Prosecution side, we also have some concerns about the ex parte communications and conferences that the Chamber has entertained.  I recall that on the 
18th of January 2008, this Chamber issued a decision on Joseph Nzirorera's motion for the unsealing of ex parte submissions and for the disclosure of withheld materials.  And I think that there was an opportunity that this Chamber used to explain how it felt about ex parte applications.  

And in paragraph 5 of that decision, the Chamber made it clear that ex parte applications may be necessary when they respond to the interests of justice, and when the disclosure to the other party of the information contained in the application would likely prejudice the persons related to the application.  

The Chamber also went on to say that when it decided ex parte applications, it would issue, more than likely, an interparty's decision explaining the reasons that it entertained an application ex parte and, presumably, setting forth the reasons that the ex parte application was granted.  

And I notice with the Ngirumpatse application, in regard to its witness list, there has not been an explanation in a recent decision as to why their ex parte application was needed in this instance.  

I recall that on the 17th of April, this Chamber denied, in toto, the Ngirumpatse application for witness protection.  And after denying that application, the Chamber went on to entertain, essentially, what was a witness protection application, where the Prosecution is not even allowed to know what type of information is being provided to the Chamber, in order for it to make decisions on how the Defence cases will run.  

So I would like to indicate to the Chamber our concern.  We are, again, in the dark in that we don't know why these particular questions need to be addressed on an ex parte basis, even given the definition that Ms. Dior Diagne wants to give to the motion of an ex parte application.  That's our concern.  We'd hope that the Chamber would address it by explaining somehow in its future decisions why the application had to be made on an ex parte basis and what the prejudice to the moving party was or would be for the granting of such ex parte applications.  

With respect to the management of the Defence case -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I can answer you quite simply and immediately on that particular concern.  We received an ex parte filing, and it was our opinion that the management of that ex parte filing would be facilitated by oral clarifications, and we invited the party to provide those clarifications.  When we deliver our decision, which we trust will be shortly, we will give a full explanation on that day.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The issue that seems to be addressed ex parte is the identity of the prospective Defence witnesses.  

With respect to Ngirumpatse, my recollection is this, starting with the projection of 150 Defence witnesses that mushroomed into 514 Defence witnesses when they were forced to file a Rule 73 ter submission.  And we are in the position right now of not knowing how to go about investigating their Defence case.  

Now, I realise that this is the type of issue we would like to resolve during this status conference, which is why I am moving it front and centre, because if we depart next week -- or at the end of this week, rather, without having that information, we will have at least four or five weeks ahead of us when we would like to be busy preparing to meet the Ngirumpatse Defence.  And we are not in a position to do that because we don't know who their witnesses will be.  We don't know how many are being called.  We don't know what the witnesses will say.  

The summaries that were provided to us are so brief.  In fact, for 189 witnesses, up to 514, there's no summary at all.  It simply bears the indication, "Investigation underway."  So, in order for us to use the four or five or six weeks that this Chamber anticipates being on break from this trial, and in order for us to use that time profitably, we have to have information so that we can organise our own missions, and do our own searches, and look for immigration records and all the things that need to be done in order to effectively confront Defence witnesses.  So I would bring that matter to the attention of the Chamber and, once again, urge the Chamber to require the Defence to give us information so that we can use the time profitably as well.  So that's the concern.  

On the scheduling issue, the way that the Chamber has outlined it, it seems appropriate and reasonable to us.  It seems now that we'll have a longer time on break than was initially anticipated.  It seems that we will be starting back in Karemera at the beginning of July as opposed to the second week of June, which is fine -- the 30th of June, which is a Monday, and then proceed into the month of July, which is comfortable -- which works within our plans, but only to the extent that we have the information that we need in order to do the investigations that we need to do.  The Chamber has anticipated that there will be -- the Karemera Defence case will continue into September, I believe, the second week of September.  Yet, as we now -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, the first or second; not necessarily the second.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The first or second week of September.  But the list of witnesses that we have for Karemera consists of four additional witnesses who, presumably, would be testifying by video link.  So we have no idea what case we are going to confront after we deal with those four video link witnesses.  And I believe that I can even give the Chamber the pseudonyms:  LOL, LSP, XFP and KBL.  Those are the additional witnesses that we anticipate as I stand before you today.  

When we resume in July, I don't think it would take two weeks to deal with those four witnesses, which means that there are additional witnesses that this Chamber has anticipated will be called on behalf of Karemera.  And we have no idea who they are and what they are going to talk about.  So these are practical considerations, but they are important considerations.  In order for us to do a responsible job and a good job, we need to have information.  

And this Chamber had ordered that this information be made available to us in January, the 7th, of this year, several months ago, and we still don't have it, and yet we are scheduling trial sessions to deal with evidence that we cannot anticipate.  So that's our concrete concern, and I think it is a reasonable concern.  I would ask the Chamber to address it before we finalise the matter of scheduling because they go hand-in-hand.  It doesn't assist the process of justice to schedule time in court when the parties cannot appear adequately to use the time effectively.  

So, to the extent that the Chamber wanted some response from the Prosecution, that is it, in a nutshell.  If there is anything else, I would be happy to respond to the Court's enquiry, but those are basic concerns.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Ms. Diagne, I think you need to respond to the enquiry about your witness list.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Mr. President, what was the question with regard to my witness list? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question seems to have been that there has been no indication of the witnesses you intend to call for the remainder of your Defence case, that is, that the Prosecutor has claimed to have received notification of four witnesses additional to be called.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Well, I would say in that case that the list of -- my list of witnesses includes 65 names, that it was the subject of a motion for amendment on notification on that has not yet been ruled upon --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Motion for variation, I think counsel means.

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
And that the motion has not yet been ruled upon, hence, I am unable to give any further information.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, unless I have missed something, I would have to contradict Madam Dior Diagne on that point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you have -- unfortunately, the answer to your comment is both yes and no.
MR. WEBSTER:
I haven't made the comments yet, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said you are not sure whether you missed anything.  And the answer is, yes, you missed something, but, no, you didn't miss anything that you should have seen.  It is true -- it is true that we are managing an ex parte motion from a modification of a witness list, and we expect to give our decision during the course of this week on this matter.  And so there is a level at which you did not miss anything that you could have noticed, but there is something that you do not know.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I am also relying on what Madam Dior Diagne said just ten minutes ago, that she has never filed any ex parte applications.  So there is -- there must be some confusion somewhere, because the Chamber is ruling on her ex parte application.  She just told us not more than five minutes ago that she has never filed an ex parte application.  

But, if I could just complete my thought, please, because I have before me the decision of this Chamber from the 17th of April 2008, where the Chamber decided the motion that was filed by the Karemera Defence team, which they filed on the 14th of April, which was a motion to vary the witness list, and paragraph 18 of that decision, the Chamber clearly stated that only two of the witnesses that were mentioned in that application of 65, as Ms. Diagne has indicated, were allowed to be added to the witness list.  

Now, that is the same decision of this Chamber with respect to the only motion that we are aware of.  So, that's where my concern lies.  As far as we know, the motion has already been decided, and it was granted only with respect to two witnesses, and those two witnesses are among the 15 that were scheduled to appear this month.  That would be including the appearance with the four video link witnesses.  So, my confusion is simply reflective of the information that circulates that does not arise with the Prosecution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it's -- let me put it this way.  No, no.  I think I should stop this discussion, and with a brief explanation.  
The Chamber has decided that its decision-making process on the three ex parte applications received would have been facilitated by oral clarifications from the parties.  It does not seem to us that it would have been in the best interests of justice to have made the ruling, which seems to be apparent, from a bare perusal of the written submissions.  And it was in the light of that that we decided to invite oral clarification of the submissions, which have been made.  

Now, as a result of the submissions that have been made to us, we are now in a position to adjudicate on the motions filed by Karemera and Ngirumpatse, and we will do that shortly.  I gave an indication of what our ruling is likely to be by giving you a picture of our overall calendar vision, which provides some indication of what we think is a reasonable and likely outcome of those rulings.  But I can assure you that you will get a more complete and formal information on these issues during the course of this week, which would clarify the questions that you asked a few minutes ago.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, when my learned friend opposite mentions me or involves me, I should ask to be allowed to speak so as to clarify things, not to indulge in polemics but merely to respond, because the Prosecutor seemed to say that he omitted a point, but he didn't omit one; he omitted several points.  

The question arises, was he actually present when the debate took place.  I think he presumed the situation where -- well for him, but still the fact is that he missed several buses in regard to questions he put to you today.  He did not follow the third of our discussions, and that is a pity, all the more.  So he shouldn't say these things to be involving me, impugning me.  

Now, as to ex parte motions, I said that I did not submit any ex parte motions, by which I meant in relation to the other Defence teams, that is to say, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera.  But as far as he is concerned, I do underscore that I did submit an ex parte motion, and in my understanding, ex parte is in their regard.  Those opposite there are ex parte, but here, together, we are all united.  And that is what I meant, and that is why I am surprised that he rose to say that five minutes ago 
Madam Diagne denied that she submitted an ex parte motion, which shows that he missed another bus in regard to the debate.  Now, that is now clear.  

However, Mr. President, I should like to add something with regard to your decision as to the submissions by the Ngirumpatse and Karemera teams.  However, before doing so, you did give us the broad outline of what is to be our calendar in the weeks to come.  So, if we put the two together, we can -- it can lead to a supposition as to what your decision will be, as to what indeed it will -- it 
would -- the tenor thereof will be.  You will be as a surgeon using your scalpel, and you will cut apart, sew together.  And this is the proper time -- this is the proper time for me to say, before you deliver a blow to the Defence, that we should see exactly what is to happen, and if it occurs to perhaps reduce the list of witnesses of the Defence teams, that it should be done in consultation with them because, in our opinion, Mr. President, even if you do have the legal power to reduce the list of witnesses, you do not, in my opinion, have the power to say that it will be such and such a witness instead of such and such another witness.  So this is a bit of a precaution.  It is a political discussion I should like to have with you so that you bear it in mind before coming to your decision, because, yes, we know that you do have powers.  We accept that.  However, we would call upon you to exercise them democratically and, as you have always done, in consultation with the parties concerned.  This was the concern that I wish to share with the Trial Chamber -- the Bench and the Trial Chamber.  And I thank you kindly in advance.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I should very briefly like to respond to my learned friend as far -- to the extent that I am concerned.  I think that your comments at the beginning of the status conference were clear enough to indicate at what -- at which moment they will be in possession of -- should be in possession of our witness list.  And that will not be in violation of the timeframe provided for by the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

With regard to your preliminary comments, you suggest that perhaps the Ngirumpatse's Defence could begin in mid-September, if Karemera's Defence has concluded.  And, to my knowledge, we are still within the timeframe of 30 days to know the identity of our witnesses as provided for in the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  That is all I wanted to say, and all the rest is decorative. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, my colleagues think that I should disabuse you of your suspicion that we might be engaged in an activity of micro-managing the way in which you should present your Defence.  

The result of our deliberations has been that, in light of the additional information that we have received, that it would be in the best interests of fairness to set time standards for the presentation of your Defence, so that we expect that the Defence will have the opportunity to choose the witnesses they intend to call.  They will choose how long each witness will be in the witness box and, therefore, they will have an opportunity to influence the number of the witnesses that will be called.  But they will be required to complete the presentation of the Defence within a predetermined number of trial days.  And that is going to be the ruling which we make.  And we have given you a hint as to the number of trial days that we think are reasonable in terms of the preliminary calendaring which we have suggested.  
I hope that will take away at least one of your concerns.  

Mr. Morley, how much time are you going to be?  How long do you anticipate your cross-examination 
to be? 

MR. MORLEY:
Notionally, I have an hour, the time standards which Your Honours put forward.  It may be that, as the evidence develops, I will be applying for a little bit more time than that.  So, what I would invite
Your Honours to consider is somewhere between one and two hours, but I will be working towards 
one hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Ms. Diagne, what other witnesses do you propose to call this week? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, we have Witness KTW, TZL, and LTL.  That's it, I think.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you give us an idea of the time you anticipate each of these witnesses will take in-chief? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I could do so, if I could take two or three minutes to consult my notes, the little table I prepared in that regard with -- by your leave, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we were just thinking that it might be safer to take this -- that you start now, because that would probably minimise the possibility that we would have to sit on Friday morning.
MR. MORLEY:
I have no difficulty with that.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, perhaps you can call the witness in.  

Bring the witness in, Mr. Registrar.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I have the impression that you have forgotten me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have not.
MR. NIMY:
I said I had two questions I wanted to put.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I am sorry.  I do apologise.  I had not forgotten that.  But we were trying to decide whether it was necessary to start the witness now, or whether we could have resumed after lunch.  But we think it's more sensible to take advantage of the hour that we have now.  That is what I was trying to find out.
(Witness entered courtroom)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have now disposed of the preliminary matters, and we can now proceed with your examination.  I remind you that you are under oath, the same oath that you took at the commencement of your testimony, and you will have, first of all, to respond to questions put to you by counsel representing Joseph Nzirorera.

Mr. Nimy.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, just to answer your question, so in all -- for all four witnesses, remaining four witnesses, five hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So we are on schedule to complete this week before Friday?  

Well, thank you very much.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Well, unless anything happens that's outside our responsibility. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Yes, Mr. Nimy, you may.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.
