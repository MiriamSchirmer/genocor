P R O C E E D I NG S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, Presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 22nd of June 2005, for the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case Number ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Fry.  I would just like to recall that we continue to sit this morning under   Rule 15 bis.  And, Mr. Registrar, could you confirm that the video proceedings are still being recorded?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  The witness is being recorded for Judge Hökborg.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you very much.  Before we commence, Mr. Witness, are you in good enough health to continue this morning?  
THE WITNESS:
I can make the effort and continue with my testimony this morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Did the relevant authorities make satisfactory arrangements for medical care for you?  
THE WITNESS:
I haven't received the medication yet, but I have been told that -- I have been promised that this afternoon I will be taken to the doctor.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, we'll keep on ensuring that satisfactory arrangements are, in fact, made.  Thank you very much.  

Ms. Fall -- you will continue giving evidence under the same oath that you took yesterday, to tell the truth.  

Yes, Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.



WITNESS GIT
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Madam Prosecutor.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday when we broke off, I was asking you whether the persons who had attended the meeting mentioned to you whether André Rwamakuba was present or not, and you responded in the affirmative.  Can you confirm that today?  
A.	Yes, you're quite correct.  
Q.	The persons who attended that meeting, did they inform you of what was said at that meeting?  
A.	Yes, they did.  
Q.	Could you please tell us what exactly they told you?  
A.	This is part of what they told me.  They said that during those meetings, especially those that were chaired by Rwamakuba, who, according to them, would be taking the floor most often during those meetings, it was said that the time has come to eliminate the Tutsis who are enemies and who are causing problems in this country.  This is some of what they told me.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you know, can you tell us who were those who participated in those meetings, who attended those meetings?  In other words, the category or rank of those individuals?  
A.	The people who attended those meetings were, first of all, members of the population.  There were also members of the population who had been displaced by the war and had left Byumba préfecture; and there were also intellectuals ****************; and there were also youths who lived in various -- the various secteurs in which those meetings took place.  
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whether it's the same participants who attended all rallies or the meetings, in other words, those that took place in Sha, Kayanga and Nduba? 
A.	When a meeting was convened, there was a method used in order to invite people to participate or attend the meetings.  People from here and there moved from one secteur to another to attend meetings, and there were also people from various secteurs who were invited to attend these rallies.  So we realised that people would be moving from one secteur to another in order to go and attend rallies or meetings.  In brief, I would say that people who attended these meetings were, more or less, always the same.  
Q.	Now, those who reported all this to you, did they say that during these rallies and meetings, the nature of the speeches made were -- was always the same?  
A.	The speeches that were made were aimed at sensitising the population present and attending those meetings and rallies in order to teach them that they needed to hate the Tutsis and to unite, so that they can try and find the Tutsis.  In fact, the aim was singular.  It was mainly to make the Hutus aware that they needed to kill the Tutsis.  
Q.	You told us that there were many teachers who attended these meetings; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	******************  
A.	As you will have seen on my identification sheet, you will have seen to what ethnic group I belonged.  And given the aim of those meetings, I didn't have the right to attend such meetings.  And I, myself, given the concerns I had for my security, I didn't feel safe enough to approach these people during meetings and rallies.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, in relation to the speeches and the content thereof, namely, inciting the population to carry out acts of -- of extermination, was there any reaction on the part of the authorities of the state?  
A.	No.  The authorities did nothing because the majority of the people in place were members of the MRND party.  I'm referring here to my commune, to our commune.  All the authorities in place were members of the MRND party.  And as I have told you yesterday, Mr. President, Your Honours, during these meetings, even if officially these meetings were convened by the MDR Power, they were accompanied by the Interahamwe, which was a youth wing of the MRND.  Be it members of the MRND or those of the MDR Power, they had the same objective, and this is why the authorities did not fight against these various activities carried out by the MDR Power.  That's why the authorities did nothing to change the situation obtaining within the MDR Power.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you were asked to give names of those -- all those persons who gave you this information, without that revealing your identity, would you be able to do so?  
A.	I can give you the names which come to mind.  
Q.	In order to be cautious, we will give you a piece of paper on which you'll write the names of those people who gave you that information.  I will ask you to number the names and, if possible, place the reference to -- the reference to the meetings you associate those people with.  And the same would apply to those who can confirm what you're saying.  
A.	Let me ask you for some clarification.  You want me to write the names of the people who told me what was said during the meetings and also you want the names of persons who can confirm what I'm saying?  I didn't quite follow you.  
Q.	Yes, there are two categories of persons I'm referring to, the first being those who informed you of what took place during meetings, and the second being those who can confirm what you are telling us here and now.  
A.	I've done with what I was doing, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, I noticed how long that took.  I'm wondering if there's a photocopier nearby rather than me writing them all down.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, I don't know the answer to that question.  Do you?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we have a photocopier on the first floor.  We can make copies.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, during your examination-in-chief, do you intend to invite the witness to add other entries to that paper?  
MS. FALL:
I do not believe so, Mr. President.  I think, as of now, we can admit this document as an exhibit of the Prosecution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, that's admitted in evidence.  The exhibit number is?  
MR. FRY:
P. 35, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 35.
(Exhibit P.35 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
This may be an appropriate time to make the copies.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Regarding ****************************************************, I checked with WVSS, and they confirmed that they have not been in the same safehouse and that they won't be until the end -- until both of them have testified.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Thank you very much, Mr. Registrar.  I should have made that inquiry at the commencement of the sitting, but I will wait for the confirmation.  

Mr. Hooper, that was in response to your inquiry yesterday. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You didn't hear it?  
MR. HOOPER:
So did the witness.  So did the witness.

BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please tell us the last time that you saw Rwamakuba arrive in your commune, still in the context of rallies that he was organising?  
A.	If my memory serves me right, I think the last time I saw him was in March 1994.  
Q.	Is it possible for you to give us more -- a more precise date?  
A.	I no longer remember the exact date.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Mr. Witness," I believe counsel meant to say -- 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	-- apart from these reports that were made to you about speeches made by André Rwamakuba rallies and meetings, were you able to hear of any speeches that he made?  
A.	From what I heard myself, these were broadcasts which were on Radio Rwanda, and this was in 1994, during the time of the genocide.  He spoke on Radio Rwanda, and he was speaking to Rwandans in general.  In fact, he had a press release made and broadcast on the radio, intended for all Rwandans.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  I'll come back to what you heard, but before that, I want to ask you, were you still in your commune at the time?  
A.	At that precise moment, I was no longer in my native commune.  
Q.	Counsel, can you please -- ensuring, nonetheless, that this does not jeopardise your identity, can you tell us where exactly you were?  
A.	Yes.  At that time I was in Byumba.  
Q.	When did you leave your native commune to go to Byumba?  
A.	I left my commune on the 10th.  In the evening of the 9th, I left my home, and I left the boundaries of the commune on the 10th, in the morning of the 10th.  
Q.	Can you please tell us exactly why you left your commune in the evening of the 9th?  
A.	I'll tell you why I left my commune.  It's because of the killings which had started in the secteur in which I was living.  
Q.	If you know, can you tell us who were the victims of the killings that were taking place in your commune?  
A.	Right from the beginning, the killings were targeting the Tutsi families.  Later on, the objective changed, and the attackers attacked those who were not Tutsis, but people who were opposed to the ideologies of the MDR and the MRND, and, therefore, Hutus were also included.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  So you're saying that you heard these broadcasts on the radio in the month of April in the year 1994.  Can you please be more specific about the period of time during which you heard these broadcasts?  
A.	I wouldn't be able to give you the exact date on which I heard all I'm telling you on the radio, but I know that the press release was broadcast on the radio three times between the 20th and the 28th.  And it was during these times -- these dates, between the 20th and the 28th of April 1994, that I heard    André Rwamakuba on the radio.  
Q.	How is it that you can be certain that you did, indeed, hear André Rwamakuba on the radio?  
A.	I'm relying on the following to tell you that it was, indeed, Rwamakuba who was speaking.  The journalist who was in the studio said that it was Rwamakuba who was going to speak, and as I told you yesterday and before Their Honours, I knew André Rwamakuba very well.  I had occasions to speak with him.  I knew his voice, and I also had the opportunity to hear him speak often.  Therefore, I could well identify the voice of the person speaking, and that's why I'm saying that it was Rwamakuba who was speaking.  
Q.	Can you tell us in what context André Rwamakuba was coming on the radio?  What gave him reason to come on air on Radio Rwanda?  
A.	At that time, André Rwamakuba was a minister in the interim government, which was led by           Prime Minister Jean Kambanda.  He was Minister of Primary and Secondary Education.  He was speaking on the radio in his capacity as spokesman of the government of the time.  
Q.	Why is it that you're saying that he was on radio in his capacity as spokesman for the government?  
A.	I'm relying on the following.  As I have told you, the journalist -- the radio presenter said that we had just heard of the spokesman of the Rwandan government, André Rwamakuba, minister for primary and secondary education.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you repeat the words spoken by André Rwamakuba on that day on the radio?  
A.	I wouldn't be able to give you a word-for-word repetition of what he said, but in summary, I can tell you what he said on that day on Radio Rwanda, and intending to have this heard by Rwandans.  "We have come from Butare.  There's no security problems in Butare.  We have exterminated the Tutsis.  There are no longer any enemies in Butare.  Now Butare is safe.  All the enemies who were in Butare have been set aside."  This is, in brief, what he said on that date as he spoke on the radio.  
Q.	Witness, you are -- seem to imply that you did hear Rwamakuba said -- say that there was security because we had exterminated the Tutsis.  Are those the exact words that he spoke? 
A.	That is what he said on the radio. 
MR. HOOPER:
May I say, I'm not sure that what my friend's just put to this witness, as being said by him a moment ago, was said by him.  I've got a different note of what was said by him.  My note might be wrong.  It sometimes is, but he didn't mention security, or did he?  It's a significant matter.  

We can move on and I can come back to it.  Mr. President, we can move on, and I can come back to it in my cross.  But just a note of caution. 
MS. FALL:
Sorry, Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can help.  I was deciding whether I should.  I do have the benefit of a realtime record here.  So I can confirm what the witness did say as recorded. 
MR. HOOPER:
	Yes, thanks.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And if I can read the answer that he made, he said, "I wouldn't be able to give you a word-for-word repetition of what he said.  But in summary, I can tell you what he said on that day on Radio Rwanda, and intending to have this heard by Rwandans.  'We have come from Butare.  There's no security problems in Butare.  We have exterminated the Tutsis.  There are no longer any enemies in Butare.  Now Butare is safe.  All the enemies who were in Butare have been set aside.'  This is, in brief, what he said on that date as he spoke on the radio."  So that's the verbiage in the transcript. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'd noted the word "problem" instead of "security," but I defer to the record.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President, for the President's clarification.  And I'd ask Mr. Hooper to be more attentive to what the witness is saying and not interpret what the witness actually states.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, I shall repeat my question then.  Are you categorically stating that you heard                    André Rwamakuba say that there was security in Butare because all the Tutsis had been eliminated?  
A.	I'm categorical about it.  I have no hesitation in confirming that.  
Q.	Witness, do you think that national radio, such as Radio Rwanda, can broadcast words that are inciting ethnic hatred in a way?  
A.	At that time, it was possible.  Radio belonged to government.  It depended on government, and it is this very government that was inciting the people to kill the Tutsis.  Also, you must remember that the radio was a very important tool used by this government to contact or to reach out to most of Rwandans -- to most Rwandans.  
Q.	So according to you, Mr. Witness, it was quite possible that at the time, the radio could broadcast certain statements which were, in a way, anti-Tutsi?  
A.	Yes.  It was perfectly normal at the time.  
Q.	Witness, apart from the statements that you heard and which you say were made between the 20th and the 28th of April, did you have occasion to hear any other statements made by André Rwamakuba?  
A.	I did not hear André Rwamakuba make any other speech at that time and afterwards, in the period that followed.  

MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Now, Witness, we shall move to the time when you were in Bundia (sic).  You said that you left on the 9th to avoid the massacres.  When you left, were you alone in Byumba?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Not Bundia.  Interpreter corrects.  
THE WITNESS:
When I was fleeing the massacres, I left alone.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	You were not accompanied by any member of your family?  
A.	No one.  
Q.	When you went to the place where you sought refuge, did you find any of your family members there?  
A.	The only member of my family that I saw was my old mother.  She's the one I met on the way.  So we went on together.  We lived together in Byumba, and we returned from our place of refuge together.  
Q.	How long did you stay in Byumba?  
A.	We arrived in Byumba in April, and we left it on the 20th of July 1994.  
Q.	When you left Byumba, did you return directly to your commune?  
A.	When we left Byumba, we did not immediately head for our commune.  We went to the neighbouring commune instead because our houses had been destroyed.  So we went to a trading centre.  There were empty houses there.  And we were able to occupy those houses pending the time when we'd get places to live.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I shall return to the massacres because your statement indicates that you fled -- your testimony indicates that you fled because there were massacres.  Can you tell us when these massacres began in your commune?  
A.	In our commune, I am referring to my own secteur, because that is where I observed the massacres for the first time.  The massacres began on the 8th of April 1994.  
Q.	Do you confirm, then -- do you confirm, then, that these massacres targeted the Tutsis and certain moderate Hutus, as you stated?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Can you tell us who were the perpetrators of these massacres?  
A.	The perpetrators of these massacres were civilians, these same people who -- who often took part in the rallies that were organised in our secteur -- the secteur I have told you about -- MDR Power rallies and MRND rallies.  It is these same people who perpetrated these massacres.  I told you that in my secteur, there were people in this secteur who lived there.  There were also people displaced by war who had come to our secteur.  These two groups, therefore, joined forces to perpetrate these massacres so that the massacres were perpetrated at astonishing speed in our secteur.  
Q.	When you referred to rallies organised by MDR Power, are you referring to rallies organised by     André Rwamakuba?  
A.	Yes, it is these rallies I'm referring to because no one else organised MDR Power rallies except those that were organised by André Rwamakuba.  It is he, himself, who chaired these rallies, who led these rallies.  
Q.	So you have told us about the perpetrators of these massacres.  Can you tell us whether these persons were armed?  
A.	To carry out these massacres, of course they had weapons.  They were armed with -- with various sorts of weapons.  
Q.	Can you tell us what sort of weapons these were?  
A.	They were armed with machetes.  Most of them had machetes.  Some were carrying clubs, spears, bows and arrows.  Those were the weapons that the assailants had during the attacks.  I do not know whether other people in this group had other weapons, but those are the ones I saw.  
Q.	Witness, you told us that you left your secteur on the 8th of April after the massacres started.  So how can you give us so much detail about what happened?  
A.	Mr. President, I can correct this.  I left on the 9th, not the 8th.  So I would say that when I left my secteur, I was fleeing the massacres that had just begun.  There was a group of attackers that was coming to attack us, and so when I saw the group of attackers and their weapons, the weapons that I have just referred to, I immediately fled.  But I had already seen the weapons that the attackers were carrying.  I was able to escape the attackers.  
Q.	Witness, can you tell us how many people were killed in your secteur?  
A.	The number of persons killed in our secteur is about 120 persons following the census that was carried out.  
Q.	You say "census."  What do you mean exactly?  What census?  
A.	You see, when the massacres began, people ran in -- they fled in different directions, but when we returned, each family would announce the number of dead people -- of people who had died within it.  As an intellectual, and as a representative of certain surviving families, we, therefore, organised a way to bury the remains of the people who had been killed in dignity.  We tried to find the remains of people who were killed.  That is how we were able to know how many people had been killed at the time.  
Q.	Witness, can you also tell us -- are you able to give us names of victims of these massacres?  
A.	I told you that it was about 120 persons.  I remember most of the names, but I don't remember all of them.  For example, there were little children whose names I don't remember.  But I think I know most of them.  I remember most of the names of the people who were killed.  
Q.	Witness -- Witness, tell us how many victims there were in your family.  Don't give names.  Just give us an approximate number if you can.  
A.	Our family lost about 30 of its members.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, if I limit myself to the indictment and the witness statement, I can say that I have concluded my examination-in-chief at this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Prosecutor.  
Mr. Hooper?  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, it's -- you want to say something?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, you may speak.  Yes, you -- I invite you to say what you wish to say.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, as I said yesterday before this Court, in 2004, on the ****************** of 2004, I gave testimony in the Rwamakuba case.  Before the lawyer starts putting questions to me, I would like to know whether the questions he puts to me and the answers that I gave him at that time were written down somewhere.  The reason I put this question is that I was informed that in the meantime, this trial had been stopped.  The trial has been resumed anew.  So I would like to know whether this -- these documents pertaining to the first trial are valid today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Although I know the answer to your question, I am not certain if it is appropriate for me to give it to you at this time.  Is there any particular reason why you asked that question?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I wonder, as Defence counsel is going to examine me, I would like to know whether he has these documents at his disposal.  If he has access to these documents, I would like to know whether he has the right to use these documents to put questions to me.  That is why I am asking my question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the way I'll answer it is this, right, the job of the Judges here is to make certain that the proceedings are conducted according to law and in a fair and proper manner.  I can assure you that we would not allow any questions that are improper or inappropriate to be put to you.  So if at any stage, you are uncomfortable, you may appeal to me, but in any event, I will be monitoring what transpires and ensuring that nothing happens that is not strictly in accordance with the law which governs how these proceedings are conducted.  You understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
(Pages 1 to 10 by Wendy Molnar)

1000H
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. Your Honour, while that was going on, I was reflecting on where I am in respect of in-closed session, and I notice that there is list of names which I may be touching on which, plainly as they have been written down, this witness may be sensitive to.  And if I'm to include questions about that, I just need a little time to go through what records I have in respect of names, which I haven't had the opportunity of doing.  I don't think I have seen that list before -- or I haven't seen that list before.  So it's a very early in the morning, but if I could persuade Your Honours that this would be the appropriate moment to take the morning adjournment, then I can start again at 1015H and we can continue straight off.  I can deal with all the in-closed session material then at the beginning as I'd intended to, including those matters.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When - did the possibility -- are there any other aspects of your examination you could deal with first? 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, that's true.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because it would be mean if we start at - if we followed your suggestion, it would mean that we'd go about two hours and 50 minutes without - this might be a bit long.
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, you are quite right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Perhaps if we ask the -
MR. HOOPER:
Well, then, let me continue and we'll see how it goes.  I can certainly accommodate that, but that's not a difficult reflection 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If we broke - if we broke at --
MR. HOOPER: 
Your Honour, I suspect -- in fact, I haven't yet learnt from experience.  I suspect there won't be a problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I would think, unless it proves difficult for you, I would suggest that we stop at 10:30.
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I just deal, Mr. Witness, with your previous evidence and let you know so that your mind is at ease, as it were, on this subject that I do have access, of course, to what you've said before.  Now, have you ever had access to what you've said before?  Has anyone discussed that evidence with you prior to your getting into the witness box today? 
A.	I haven't discussed with anyone those documents.  That's why I put the question to the President, the presiding Judge, to find out whether they exist.  Otherwise, I haven't discussed anything about those documents with anyone. 
Q.	Let me put it in an -- another question to you.  Since you gave evidence on ******************** as you said yesterday, but as you corrected yourself today, ****************, last year, coming to the trial again this time, had you spoken to the Prosecutor about your evidence? 
A.	Since last year until the day I returned to Arusha, I did not meet with the Prosecutor. 
Q.	And between your return to Arusha and today, have you had any meeting with the Prosecutor? 
A.	Since my return to Arusha, I met the Prosecutor and we discussed the statement, and this statement is in your possession. 
Q.	May I ask you how often you met the Prosecutor this time, and how long you spent discussing your evidence? 
A.	I met the Prosecutor only once.  As for the duration of our meeting, I would say approximately one hour. 
Q.	And was any reference made to what you'd said on the last occasion? 
A.	We considered the testimony I gave, testimony which was available last year, the statement which you have.  We briefly spoke of the content and the lady asked me to be ready to testify, and that's what I'm doing. 
Q.	Did you go through the evidence that you'd given last time? 
A.	I just answered you.  I said that we only talked about my statement, as was presented last year and even today.  Everything I said was based on the statement that you have, and that's what I persist in saying.  I stand by that.  We did not rely on my testimony of last year.  I didn't even take notes of that testimony; I didn't take notes, I didn't record, so I wouldn't have any recall of my testimony of last year. 
Q.	My last question on the subject: are you saying your testimony of last year was not touched upon, in any way, during your meeting with the Prosecutor; yes, or no? 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, at this point in time I would wish to take the floor, by your leave, in order to ask Mr. Hooper to explain himself.  I think the witness has explained himself.  Yes, I was with him.  I was with him.  I'm the only person to speak with him, and he answered my questions honestly, and I think if we need to continue in the manner Mr. Hooper is going would be inappropriate, and I therefore wish to invite Mr. Hooper to move on to another matter on the agenda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I did not think that the questions asked up to now have been improper.  I would just like to let the witness know that it is not considered wrong for the Prosecutor to speak with you, to prepare you for testimony.  So there is not a suggestion that the meeting with the Prosecutor was wrongful.  But I think counsel is entitled to ask if it took place, and certain questions about it.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And my last question I will repeat, and it is my last question on the subject: Are you saying, sir, that during your meeting with the Prosecutor, that no reference was made, in any way, to the testimony that you gave on the last occasion; yes or no? 
A.	Regarding my testimony provided last year, let me say the following: Just as the Prosecutor prepared me before that testimony, the same was done and the Prosecution relied on the statements that exist and we prepared for this current testimony.  That's how things went. 
Q.	I think you have evaded the question, with respect.  Was your testimony, your evidence on the last occasion, discussed or referred to at any time; yes or no?  And then we can move on.  
A.	Mr. President, I would like to have myself understood.  What we discussed with the Prosecutor is the content of the statements that I made, but we didn't discuss anything with the Prosecutor regarding last year's testimony.  We didn't go into the transcripts of my testimony last year. 
Q.	That's as far as I need or wish to take it with you, sir.  Now, my next questions are questions that touch upon you personally and may possibly, by your answers, reveal your identity.  And to avoid that, I therefore apply that we go into closed session.  I estimate that it would take about three-quarters of an hour altogether.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that three-quarters of an hour would include some time after the break where you would deal with the names on the list.  
MR. HOOPER: 
If I come to those, I will do that after the break, but I've got quite enough to take us up to half past -- half past 10.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's just 20 minutes to go.  You see, I'm concerned about telling the public the duration of the closed session.  And as I'd mentioned earlier, I would prefer if you are able to compress your -- all of your closed session issues into one segment, so to speak.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So 45 minutes would include -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Will take us to 11 o'clock. Well --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are going to have a 15 minutes break. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
We go into closed session now, and for the benefit of the members of the public who are present, we expect that we would resume in open session at approximately 11:15. 

Mr. Hooper, we will take the break at 10:30, or thereabout.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 15 to 24] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now back in open session.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Thank you for doing that.  If you have the document in front of you can I just draw your attention to number 8; do you know that person? 
A.	I do not know that person, no. 
Q.	He wasn't a member of the Parti Libéral, to your knowledge? 
A.	I told you that I don't know this person, consequently, I wouldn't be able to answer your question. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, in what capacity do you know number 1? 
A.	As for the person appearing under number 1, if I am not wrong, the person bearing that name is someone who, by virtue of the position I held, that person was conseiller of a secteur in Gikomero.  It was, therefore, necessary for me to know that person by virtue of my job and his. 
Q.	Very well.  Thank you very much.  Number 7? 
A.	The person who bears that name was an official of the commune, as I was myself, therefore, it was possible and, even I would say, necessary for me to know that person. 
Q.	Well I, obviously, don't need to trouble you with number 10.  Can I just ask you, though, to look at number 6 again, and just confirm that you don't know anyone, or have heard of anyone with that name? 
A.	This is the second name that I have already heard -- I have already heard it on several occasions, I don't know the person who bears this name, the second name. 
Q.	Perhaps you would know the name is (By order of the Court this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  Does that help you? 
A.	No, this doesn't help me at all.  The persons whom I know who bear this name do not have that first name.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel please help the interpreters by spelling the name; once again, problems with pronunciation and for the record. 
MR. HOOPER: 
If you have got the sheet still in front of you, it is (By order of the Court this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  And I understand the -- 
MS. FALL: 
I think we are now in open session and the names which have been given are names of protected witnesses. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, we didn't know that until you just said so.  That is the trouble. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registrar, please strike that from the record.  I understood that the name you had put to the witness was not a name that was on the list. 
MR. HOOPER: 
It is the same name, but it has got, what I understand, to be the female --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A different spelling. 
MR. HOOPER: 
The feminine, I understand, in Kinyarwanda is affected in the initial word or letters, M-U-K.  I stand corrected about that, so that there would be M-U-K, or perhaps M-U-K-A -- I'm getting a nod.  I think.  M-U-K-A would precede the name that first appears at number 6.  So the name that appears -- that starts with M there, if one puts M-U-K-A would be another form, a female form of the name, or a female usage of the name.     
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Does that help you at all, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I had already understood you, but that didn't help me at all. 
Q.	And so you don't know that person at all.  And I will move on.  Before dealing with events prior to -- I'm sorry, events after April 6th -- I'm sorry, let me start again.  

Before dealing with events before April 6th, can I ask you very briefly, about your own movements that you have referred to, and you told us that after witnessing the commencement of killing where you lived, you left.  And I understand you to say that you left on the -- on the 9th of April; is that correct?  Yes or no, if it is possible for you to say yes or no. 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And when you left, you left quite alone; is that the position? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You didn't, for example, go with your brother or any other relative until you met your mother on the route; is that correct? 
A.	No one accompanied me, as you have just stated.  Later on, I met my mother, who was also alone. 
Q.	And I understand your evidence to be that on the 9th you got to the town -- or settlement of Rutongo, R-U-T-O-N-G-O, Rutongo; is that correct? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question; I didn't quite understand you. 
Q.	Did you reach Rutongo, R-U-T-O-N-G-O? 
A.	Yes, I got to Rutongo later on. 
Q.	Was that on the 9th? 
A.	I reached a place known as Rutongo, at the presbytery of the parish on the 11th.  But in the meantime, I had already reached Rutongo commune before getting to Rutongo parish itself.  That means that on the 9th I crossed Nagabagogo, and I reached the territory of Rutongo commune but I hadn't actually gotten to the Rutongo parish itself by then. 
Q.	But you say you got there on the 11th; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	And that is -- we can refer to that as Rutongo parish.  Would that be correct? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	And when you got there, did you meet the RPF or Inkotanyi there? 
A.	At the parish, I found members of the population who had sought refuge there, I didn't find any Inkotanyi there.  I mean, on that day I didn't find any Inkotanyi there, on that day. 
Q.	I'm going to refer you to a question and answer that you made on a previous occasion in May, you said, "I met the RPF at Rutungo parish."

Question: "Were they in force there?"  

Answer: "Yes." 

Then you said:  "The soldiers left."  And that you had to flee the parish.  And you explained that that was why you went down to Jabana, J-A-B-A-N-A, Jabana.  Do you remember saying that, and is it true?  
A.	What I said, and it is what I have said now, I reached Rutongo parish where I found the members of the population on that very day.  Subsequently, I saw soldiers, but the people who I saw for the first time were members of the population. 
Q.	Did you meet the RPF there in force, yes or no? 
A.	If you were to look at it closely, this was an area which was in the hands, as it were, of the RPF because acts of violence had been stopped.  People were no longer being attacked, and that is what makes me say that that area was in the hands of the RPF -- had been taken by the RPF. 
Q.	So let me ask you again:  When you arrived at Rutongo parish, is it correct that the RPF were there, yes or no? 
A.	As I have already said, this place was safe, and it would seem to me that it was in the hands of the RPF.  And, subsequently, I saw soldiers.  That is what I have said.  This means that going by what I saw that area had been taken over by the RPF. 
Q.	Very well.  And, finally, do you agree that you said this: "I met the RPF at Rutongo parish.  Question:  "Were they in force there?  Answer:  Yes."  Do you remember saying that and is it correct? 
A.	I don't think there is any contradiction between what I have said now and what I said then.  I have just told you that I saw RPF combatants at that time. 
Q.	Do you remember stating in your statement of 1997:  "On the 9th of April I took refuge in Rutongo parish."  Before you answer that, let me just -- yes, I will read it from your statement at GIT 4, in the first paragraph, second line:  "On the 9th of April 1994, I took refuge at Rutongo parish."  Do you remember saying that?  
A.	Let me explain.  I said that I left my house on the 9th and I went to look for refuge at the Rutongo parish.  I was on my way, I was seeking refuge.  I thought that if I got there, I would be safe.  So, I put myself on the road to Rutongo on the 9th.  This is also a hill which is known as Rutongo.  From there I left that hill to go towards the parish.  That is what you need to understand by that sentence you have just read. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And I understand your evidence to be that what you witnessing of the genocide, of the killing, was limited to the events of the 8th of April; is that correct? 
A.	I said that the killings started on the 8th on my hill, so on the 9th I was still there.  When I saw the attackers who arrived there on the 9th, it is at that point in time that I decided to leave that area to go and seek refuge elsewhere.  Now, what I said means that I was still at home on the 8th and on the 9th,  and I left my home area only on the 9th, and in the evening of that day. 
Q.	And on the 8th or the 9th, did you see your brother, the brother whose name appeared at number 10 on the list; did you see him, speak to him? 
A.	Could you please remind me of the dates, Counsel. 
Q.	On the 8th or the 9th, did you speak to your brother, number 10 on the list? 
A.	During those days, I would even include the day of the 7th, nothing would have stopped me from meeting him, just like I did with other neighbours.  We didn't know what to do and we were wondering about what to do.  So we would be discussing along those lines.  We were wondering what we should do given the problem of insecurity we were facing. 
Q.	Did you tell your brother you were leaving? 
A.	You understand there was a surprise attack.  Under those circumstances, I was not able to tell him that I was leaving, that I would take this or that direction.  What happened is that we scattered and everybody went where he could.  We did not discuss and come to an understanding that we would act in one way or another. 
Q.	I understand that there were a multitude of displaced persons settled on the hill by the Nyacyonga bridge -- the name as it appears on the plan.  Is it your evidence that those people, in fact, participated in the genocide? 
A.	I think I have said this before, these people actively participated in the genocide.  And if you understood my testimony correctly, I said that these people, amongst the people who came to the rallies organised by Rwamakuba, there were these persons who had been displaced by war; which means that during the genocide these displaced persons also actively participated in perpetrating the crimes of genocide. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And now let's come to André Rwamakuba.  You know him because you know his family, you tell us, and you visited them, and met him when he was there on family occasions, and other celebrations and events.  And you had first met him at holiday time when there was a scheme or arrangement for activities for students on holiday.  Is that all approximately correct, what I have just said? 
A.	I have explained that there are two stages.  When I was a student, ******************************.  When I was a pupil, there were meetings of pupils and students, they included parents on some occasions.  *************************************.  That is how I got to know him. 
Q.	Very well.  Well, let's deal with the first matter first.  You told us that in 1977 to 1979 you would meet him at holiday times with other students; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And in 1977 you were 16; is that correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	How old were you? 
A.	In 1979 I was 18 years old. 
Q.	I asked you how old you were in 1977, sir.  You were 16 or 17; is that right?  We can see your birthday, we don't need to refer to it out loud. 
A.	In 1977 I was 16 years old. 
Q.	Yes.  And André Rwamakuba was 27; is that right?  Does it seem right to you that that kind of age difference existed? 
A.	I don't know, I don't know when he was born, so I cannot tell you what age he was at that time. 
Q.	You told us how you all used to stand up one at a time and state which school you were at.  In 1977 he was a practicing doctor, he wasn't at those meetings, was he? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Well, what is your evidence? 
A.	I don't know where you got your information.  It is contrary to what I know. 
Q.	In 1978 to 1980, Dr. André Rwamakuba was at Kibungo hospital working as a doctor, not playing football with you.  He wasn't playing football with you, was he, and he wasn't attending those student meetings, was he? 
A.	It is true that I may not -- perhaps -- it is true that he may not have been playing football, but are you claiming that he could not have attended a football match?  It was an organisation, it was all prepared by students but it does not mean that he could not have been there.  I shall add this, which you seem to be unaware of. 
Q.	You told us that -- please listen to the question.  You told us yesterday that there were meetings, and that you students would sit down and exchange views and that is where you met him; is that correct? 
A.	If I said it, then it is true. 
Q.	Do you want to think about it again, and just confirm that it is true, or maybe you are mistaken about that.  What do you think? 
A.	Even if this gentleman is not present in this Trial Chamber, I can assure you that if you were to put the question to him, he would -- he might confirm to you that it is true and it happened in the circumstances as I described it.  This person was my neighbour, he lived in our commune, and I used to go pass his parents' house.  I know this man.  It is unlikely that I am making a mistake.  And he, too, knows me very well. 
Q.	And you can describe the house where he lives, can't you, or where his family lived? 
A.	His parents' house was covered with metal roofing sheet --  
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I just interrupt you? 
A.	I don't know whether the walls -- I do not know whether the walls were of wood, I cannot tell. 
Q.	It doesn't sound to me that you know very well at all.
A.	I don't know whether a question was put to me, was it?  
Q.	Now, you described the house maybe -- you don't seem to know it very, very well, do you? 
A.	You interrupted me, I hadn't finished my description.  This house was roofed with medal roofing sheets.  I was saying that I did not know whether the walls were made of wood or other materials because when the house was being built, I wasn't present.  But I think that the wall --  the walls were made of wood.  And since I could enter the living room, I can say that the living room was -- the floor was cement, and the roof was four cornered.  That is the description -- the description of the house of Rwamakuba's parents.  
Q.	Now, when you met André Rwamakuba back in 1977 to `79, where did you understand he was studying? 
A.	He was studying in Butare. 
Q.	Had he been abroad at all? 
A.	I have no idea, because he could go abroad without my being aware of it.  Since he did not reside with his parents, he might have been able to go abroad without my being aware of it.  So, I have no proof as to whether or not he went abroad at that time. 
Q.	You were born in the early  '60s as we can see.  André Rwamakuba didn't, in fact, come to live in your area at all until 1965 when his family returned from the Kayanga copper fields; is that something that you know? 
A.	I know nothing about that.  As you have said, I was born in 1961.  In 1965, I was four years old, or perhaps you are referring to events that occurred in 1965?  I have no information to give you about that. 
Q.	From 1970 to 1974, André Rwamakuba was studying at the University at Louvain in Belgium.  Is that something that you know?  I take it from your earlier answer that it is not. 
A.	I know nothing about that. 
Q.	In 1994, he was a married man with three children; did you know the children? 
A.	I do not know how many children he had.  And when I went to his home I met so many people, there were many children, and I cannot tell you whether such and such a child was Rwamakuba's or not.  So I could not know who his children were.  So I cannot answer that question.  I do not even know how many children he has. 
Q.	In 1994 he had a daughter of 12, another daughter of 9, and a son of 7, not anonymous little tiny tots you don't ever remember meeting them? 
A.	During that time, and I'm referring to 1994, we were going through a tough time in Rwanda; and Rwamakuba had decided to join the MDR Power wing which was planning to kill people in 1994.  In 1994, I saw him going to political rallies.  I had no contact with him.  So I don't know his children. 
Q.	In fact, you generally rather grossly exaggerated your knowledge of André Rwamakuba.  Would that be fair to put it like that, you greatly exaggerated your knowledge of André Rwamakuba? 
A.	No, André Rwamakuba is someone I know.  I cannot make mistakes about him, I know him.  I would have preferred him to be here so I would say hello to him and so he could say hello back to me. 
Q.	I doubt that he would do that given your evidence, sir, about him, which we are going to come to explore now.  Can you describe him to us, please? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  You have raised your hand.  You would like to say something to me?  I give you permission to do so. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I am beginning to have health problems.  I feel pain in my belly.  I am going to ask to be given a break so that I can recover. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you approach the Bench, please?  

Yes, I was just confirming that the registry had previously informed the Chamber that arrangements had been made for the witness to get medical attention when we broke at 12:30.  So I know that arrangements have already been made for that.  We could take the luncheon adjournment early and resume at 2 o'clock, which would ensure that the medical attention had been arranged and obtained during that period.  And so we would expect that if we took the adjournment now, that your testimony would resume at 2 p.m.

Madam Prosecutor, I think that in any event there should be a contingency plan in case the outcome of the medical visit is unexpected.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I hope and pray that the witness will be available this afternoon because the next witness, Witness GIE, regarding this witness, in spite of all of our good will, in spite of all of our efforts to avoid -- it would be difficult to bring him to the stand this afternoon.  So I really do hope the witness will be available this afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you will be receiving medical attention.  I don't know what the result of that will be,  but you have heard the appeal made by the Prosecutor, which I would like to repeat that it would really be preferable that you continue with your testimony after we break.  So during this period you have an opportunity to seek medical attention, and also have lunch.  And we will resume at 2 o'clock.

Now, Ms. Fall, in any event, I would like to state that I would expect a contingency plan to be always in place, always in place, because I would not want ever to be in a position of having to adjourn for non availability of a witness.  So I would encourage that those plans are always put in place whatever your expectations are in these proceedings.

Now, Mr. Witness, you wish to say something?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, as you wish, I agree with you that I myself would like to continue to give testimony, but I have told you, I have just said that I have stomach ache.  I do not know what medicine the doctor will give me.  I do not know if the medicine will calm down the pain I feel, so that I will be able to give testimony.  I get the feeling that I have my problems -- that my problems are more acute.  I request, instead, that I should be allowed to take the medicines and retire for the day so that I can start giving testimony tomorrow, because if I come back here, if I am forced to come back here, I might have more problems.  That is my wish, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will take it step by step.  If, in fact, your condition makes it ill-advised for you to continue this afternoon, we expect that the doctor will say so.  If, in the doctor's opinion, your condition would make it appropriate for you to continue giving evidence, we would expect you to conform to the medical opinion.  So, we would like our decision to be based on the result of the medical examination and treatment that you receive, and on the advice of the doctor.  So, we will abide by that and we would expect you to abide by it as well.  
THE WITNESS:
I shall abide by the doctor's decision, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, before we adjourn, I would like to make sure that the document that was tendered into evidence as P. 35 is to be placed under seal in view of the confidential information that the document contains.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Fall.  The order has been made, and I can see from the reaction of the registrar that that is so.  

Mr. Hooper, in the circumstances we will take the adjournment now.  We will resume at 2 o'clock. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Court recessed at 1222H)
(Pages 25 to 32 by Donna M. Lewis)


(Court resumed at 1442H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, we are back in session.  

Now, Witness -- Mr. Witness, now what is your condition right now?  I've got before me the medical certificate signed by the doctor whom you saw.  How do you feel? 
MR. WITNESS:
I still have problems; I don't really feel very well.  I am still feeling the same pain because I have not yet taken any medicine.  I am still in the state I was in before.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the doctor has confirmed that your condition is stable and that your treatment has commenced and certain other tests are still being processed.  The doctor expressed the opinion that you can continue to attend court to give testimony as scheduled.  So that's the opinion the doctor expressed.
I presume you have seen the doctor's report or you spoke with the doctor on this issue? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know whether the doctor understood what I told him.  Perhaps there were communications problems because we do not speak the same language, the doctor and I.  But I told him that I did not feel strong enough to continue to give testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe the doctor disagreed with you because this morning, when we were just about adjourning, you had undertaken -- you had promised that you would abide by the doctor's recommendation.  Just as we had promised to do the same thing, so your -- your -- when I saw the doctor's certificate, I must say, I expected that you would keep the promise you made this morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I met with the doctor.  I told the doctor the problems I had.  Actually, the doctor knows the problems that I've been having.  I have been feeling this way since Monday.  I went to see the doctor on Monday.  Blood samples were taken, so were urine samples and another test was conducted to see whether I had kidney stones.  So far they've not told me what the results are; however, some medicine was given to me.  I think that this medicine is for malaria.  I have not yet taken this medicine. I've just received the medicine about a quarter of an hour ago.  So in view of my current state, I'm -- I'd like to say that I'm not able to continue to give testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would have been far easier for me to accept that statement if the doctor had said so.  But the doctor said -- expressed the opinion that you could continue to attend court.  You know, you have come all the way here to give testimony in this trial and now it's important that your evidence is concluded.  

There are several people here in court who have -- and if we have to adjourn, a lot of people have been put out.  All of the workers you see here, have come here just to attend this session, and if it had been a situation where there was a condition which the doctor had recognised as being really difficult, the doctor would have said so.  So I have to ask you to, actually, you know, steel yourself, you know, strengthen yourself and complete your testimony this afternoon.  

I'm quite certain that the facilities -- the medical facilities that have been offered to you will be continued so that whatever treatment is required will be completed before you return home.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, please believe me.  I'm not well and I do not feel strong.  Please, this is all I can tell you.  I'd like to thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, is there anything you would like to add at this stage? 

I don't know if counsel -- if you and Mr. Hooper have seen the medical certificate.  I don't know if it's something that you would like to see.  But I can assure you that the doctor has indicated that the witness has a condition that requires some treatment, that the treatment has commenced, that the doctor felt that the witness's condition was stable and he could continue to give evidence as scheduled. 

Now, you have heard what the witness has said in the witness box.  Do I compel him to remain? 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think that you asked us a while ago to take emergency measures.  We have not been able to do that because we tried to find out whether our witness was able to come this afternoon and we were assured that he was in a position to do so, which is why we did not take any supplementary measures to arrange for the calling of a new witness.  

I have not seen the medical certificate.  But I think I know what it says.  We can only ask the witness to do everything in his power to continue with the testimony.  I think that the fact that he is there is -- shows that he can make this effort.  So we ask him to do that because we might get -- run into trouble if he is not able to finish his testimony.  

Mr. President, I'm insisting on this because both the medical certificate and the information we received implied that he was in a position to continue giving testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor. 

Mr. Hooper, do you wish to continue on the discussion?  

MR. HOOPER:
No thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, I have to ask you to continue with your testimony as long as possible.  It's now about 8 minutes to 3:00.  

Mr. Hooper, do you have an idea about how much longer you will be if you -- 
MR. HOOPER:
No, but I bear in mind the witness's stated condition in my approach to the evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, I have to ask you to continue.  We will keep on monitoring the situation and re-evaluate the position, if necessary, in due course.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So -- so let's see how we -- how we can get on then, Mr. Witness, and perhaps, if I may say so, the more pointed and shorter your answers, the quicker we'll be.  
	
	Can you give us a description, please, of André Rwamakuba as you remember him in 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President.  Mr. President, you have asked me to continue to give testimony.  However, I am telling you, I would like to warn you that I'm giving my testimony in a state of illness.  I am still in pain.  For the time being, I do not feel well and I beg of you, please consider -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And witness continues -- 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I don't feel at all well.  I know how my health is like.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, after what the witness has said and since he says that he's not able to answer the questions put to him by the Defence in an adequate manner, in order, perhaps, to feel better I'd like to make a suggestion.  I'd like to suggest to the witness that if he were given some time to take his medicine and return later, I would like to ask whether he would be able to continue his examination.  

I understand that he received medicines 15 minutes ago and that he had not had time to take the medicine.  Is it possible to adjourn so that he can take his medicine and perhaps feel better, because I'm beginning to get the impression that he is not very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.

Mr. Witness, it has been suggested that I should inquire whether, if we had a short break now, we should permit you to take the medication you received, if you'd be able to resume giving your testimony later this afternoon, say, in 15 minutes' time or within 15 minutes or 30 minutes' time?
THE WITNESS:
This is what I can say, Mr. President.  I have just undergone a medical examination and this medical examination does not enable me to continue to testify.  I have just left the doctor's consulting room to which I was sent.  The various procedures that the doctor carried out have actually worsened my state of health.  And, Mr. President, this forces me to ask you to understand because it is very important to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but my question was that if you had a few minutes, between 15 minutes and 30 minutes, which would enable you to take your medication that you received and to rest a bit more, whether that would enable you to continue giving your testimony this afternoon?  
THE WITNESS:
I'm not sure, considering how I feel right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, sometimes a Chamber is put in an invidious position, and it may be we're approaching that.  The only matter I'd raise in our interests is that I understand that Judge Hökborg will be back tomorrow.  It's always preferable for the Judge to see a witness in our view.  So we have another and a separate distinct advantage perhaps in that.  

I can only say that if we were to rise this afternoon, for our part, it won't be wasted time.  And it may be, in any event, given the nature of the evidence, that I can deal with this witness in a reasonable amount of time tomorrow morning.  

I won't commit myself to more than that for obvious reasons that, Mr. President, you have already experienced and witnessed.  But I think I can say that I could deal with this witness in half a morning, if -- if the witness is better and able to answer a question tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Witness, you seemed to have found an unexpected ally.  Now, do I understand from your position that you will be able to testify tomorrow morning? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I myself want to go on and testify.  It's only my health that is standing in my way.  If I wanted to -- if I were able to rest and take my medicine, tomorrow if I wake up and I feel stronger I shall come and continue to give testimony.  And if there is a problem, I would not feel bad because I will have tried, done my best.  But if I get the opportunity to take my medicine and rest, I think I should be able to continue tomorrow.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I'm sorry to again interrupt your train of thought, but if it were the case that this matter goes over tomorrow now, we'd be concerned to ensure that the witness is kept incommunicado overnight and that means access to phones as well.  He is in the middle of his evidence, at a significant point in his evidence, and we feel that the Defence's interests should not only be maintained, but be seen to be maintained in these circumstances if there is an adjournment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I should just mention that from tomorrow we will be resuming in Courtroom 4.  I think the problems have been rectified there now, and we will be assigned to Courtroom 4 from tomorrow morning.  

Well, I think we have decided that -- that the sensible response to the statement made by the witness is to take the cautious approach and to stop today's sitting at this stage.  The witness is reminded that he's in the middle of his testimony in judicial proceedings and that the rules governing his behaviour will require him not to discuss the case with anyone because you are in the middle of your testimony.  

As far as the concern expressed by Mr. Hooper is concerned, I'm advised that those arrangements are in place as a matter of routine.  They have already been put in place and they are routinely maintained by the witness section.  I don't know if that answers the inquiry that you've made? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, yes, it does.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we are going to excuse the witness now.  We expect him to follow up the medical advice he has got and we want to resume tomorrow morning at a quarter to 9:00.

Ms. Fall, I will just let you know that we'll accept the problems you have had today.  But in the future, I would not consider this a good reason to adjourn the trial.  Because I will expect that the parties, both parties, would have more than one witness prepared.  So in the event of problems of this nature, we can always proceed.  But I accept that it has caught you by surprise today and we will take the adjournment now.  But I trust that this would not happen in the future again.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President, but as I said, this is a case -- something we couldn't avoid.  We were told that the witness could give testimony.  We wished to do what we could in spite of the problems that it might have caused for us to bring another witness.  But a message was sent to me that this witness could give testimony, which is why I did not take the emergency measures.  In the future we shall do our best to ensure that this does not occur again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Well, in fairness to you, I -- I must say, that I also received the certificate from the doctor, where the doctor clearly expressed the opinion that the witness's condition was stable, and in the doctor's opinion he could attend court this afternoon.  So I know that was information which was communicated. 

Mr. Witness, do you understand that we expect you to be available to testify tomorrow morning?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have told you that I would take my medicine and rest good -- rest early, and depending on how my health is, if I recover quickly, I am ready to continue my testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, on that note we will take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.  We will resume in 
Courtroom 4. 
(Court adjourned at 1514H)
