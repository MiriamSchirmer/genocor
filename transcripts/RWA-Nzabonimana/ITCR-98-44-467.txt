CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Albert.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Mr. Albert, are you married? 
A.	I do not understand your question. 
Q.	Are you married?  Do you have a wife? 
A.	Yes.  I have a wife, and I have some children. 
Q.	How many children do you have? 
A.	Five.
Q.	In 1994 were you married? 
A.	I was single, but I was the father of a child. 
Q.	Did you live with this child in your house in 1994? 
A.	No.  The child lived with its mother. 
Q.	Did you live with anyone else in your house in 1994? 
A.	I lived with the children of the family where I lived. 
Q.	Do you mean that you did not live in the house of your own? 
A.	I have already told you that I used to live in a house with the children of the owner of the house. 
Q.	Did the owner of the house live with you? 
A.	Yes.  He lived with us but in his own house.  The young people lived in a separate house to the back of the property. 
Q.	How often did you visit your child and the mother in 1994? 
A.	Maybe once a day in the evening. 
Q.	And was this the case in April of 1994? 
A.	When that residence was attacked, that is, the residence where the child lived in 1994 -- I tried to visit them at least twice a week -- or, rather, twice a day. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction from the Kinyarwanda interpreter. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	And when you visited them, would you spend the night at the house, or it was a visit for a few hours during the day? 
A.	I did not spend more than five minutes there because quite often I went to visit them when I was on duty.  So the visits had to be brief so that I could return to my place of work.  I never spent any night there because I spent the nights at my job site. 
Q.	How far was Mr. Karekezi's house from the house in which your child and the mother lived? 
A.	The distance was less than 1 kilometre.  It was in the same secteur, in the same cellule.  So it must have been around 800 metres.
Q.	You testified yesterday that you and one Selemani were assigned to protect Mr. Karekezi in
	April of 1994 and you worked in shifts; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That was my testimony.  But I said that we worked in shifts before the death of President Habyarimana.  After the death of President Habyarimana, we did not leave Mr. Karekezi's residence. 
Q.	But you explained that when you talked about shifts you meant that there were times during the day when one of you will be working and there were times -- and while one of you was working, the other would be resting at home; am I correct? 
A.	Let me repeat what I said.  I said that before the death of President Habyarimana, when politicians were being attacked and their -- and their security was threatened, the authorities of the secteurs and communes asked for protection.  And it was during that time that we worked in shifts.  One of us would rest in the morning while the other would rest in the afternoon.  

However, that situation changed with the death of President Habyarimana.  Upon his death my colleague and I no longer left Mr. Karekezi's residence. 
Q.	Did the both of you follow him around Kigali in April 1994? 
A.	It was around the 15th of April that Selemani took ill and was no longer able to go around with us.  But before he took ill, Selemani and I went along with Karekezi wherever he went. 
Q.	Given that your task was to protect Mr. Karekezi and his family, who was left behind to protect the family when you and Selemani accompanied Karekezi around? 
A.	When Selemani and I both accompanied him, we would ask Karekezi's children to provide security for the family.  His son, Majid, had a firearm, and we would ask him to provide security for members of the family.  There were also neighbours who could of -- who could have come to their assistance whenever such a need may have arisen. 
Q.	I put it to you that yesterday you said nothing -- you made no distinction about your method of working before the death of the president and after the death of the president.  You testified that you worked in shifts, and while one of you accompanied Karekezi around, the other would be resting at home, and you would both spend the night at Karekezi's house.  

You have now modified your testimony.  And I am suggesting to you that there were times when you were not in the company of Karekezi. 
A.	Maybe you did not quite understand what I said.  There were two periods:  The period before the death of the president and the period after the death of President Habyarimana.  Those are two distinct periods. 
Q.	Okay.  Sometime after the 16th of April, Mr. Karekezi instructed you to take his family to Nyanza; correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you remember the date on which you made this trip? 
A.	I have forgotten the date.  Although I had a road map, I do not know the date on which that road map was signed.  But it was in mid-April.  It was in mid-April after the 16th of April. 
Q.	Approximately what time did you leave your locality, and when did you return from Nyanza? 
A.	We must have left at about 11 a.m., and by 3 p.m. (sic) I was already back -- I was already back home. 
Q.	And you confirm that you did not travel with Mr. Karekezi.  You left him behind in Kigali.  
A.	Yes.  I do confirm that. 
Q.	So when you testified yesterday that you were always in Mr. Karekezi's company, that would not be accurate because when you travelled to Nyanza, he was not in your company; correct? 
A.	If you had followed my testimony, you would notice that I said that I was always with Karekezi except when I took the children to Nyanza and when I took them to Kigali and also when I went to Cyangugu and upon my return.  So I said that apart from those occasions I was always with him. 
Q.	You agree that in April 1994 the préfet of Kigali held regular security meetings to address the security situation in Kigali? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And yesterday you testified that you specifically recall accompanying Mr. Karekezi to three meetings:  One on the 8th of April, another on the 12th of April, and another on the 16th of April.  Is that accurate? 
A.	Yes.  That was my testimony.  And I remember those three meetings.  Those are the most important three meetings that I can remember. 
Q.	When you were asked about those in attendance at the meeting on the 12th of April, you testified that no political figures attended that meeting.  Do you still stand by that testimony? 
A.	Yes, I do.  But I can confirm that.  When I talk about political authorities, I am referring to leaders of political parties.  However, secteur conseillers and bourgmestres were in attendance at that meeting.  But there were no political party leaders in attendance, although conseillers and bourgmestres were present. 
Q.	When you testified about this particular meeting in a previous -- in another trial before this Tribunal, you testified under oath that you did not know -- you were not aware of those who participated at this meeting.  
MR. SENDZE:
And I am referring to the transcripts I have distributed at page 31, lines 14 to 17 in the English version and page 34, lines 34 to 37 in the French version.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	You said you did not know those who had participated in this meeting.  But in this trial you are ready to state that there were no political authorities and there were only conseillers and bourgmestres and others.  Could you explain to us the difference in your testimony.  
A.	I believe that I already answered that question when I said that I did not see any other persons.  I stand by my previous testimony.  

However, I added that we were in the parking lot where drivers of bourgmestres and conseillers were there.  So we were all together chatting.  And going by the fact that I saw all those people there, I can assert that the political party leaders were not present because they had their drivers and 
police officers, and it would have been very easy to identify any other person who would have attended that meeting in a vehicle.  
You see, I do not know the identity of those who were in the hall.  But I know that there were drivers and bodyguards of conseillers outside in the parking lot with me.  And that is why I can assert that those whom I saw were those who were present, and that is why I believe that my present answer is not at all different from the answer provided previously. 
Q.	The answer you provided previously is as follows -- reading from lines 16 to 17, page 31 of the 
	English transcript:  "It was in April.  A meeting was held at the préfectoral office.  I do not know the participants at that meeting.  On that occasion we remained in the parking lot." 

That is very different from now stating the participants at that meeting.  Don't you think so?  
A.	To my mind that answer is not different from the previous answer.  I was asked whether there were politicians at that meeting, and I said no.  At least I said I did not see any.  And that was my answer at the time. 
Q.	Okay.  Yesterday you testified that, except for the three specific occasions when you accompanied Karekezi to the préfecture office, there were other occasions when Mr. Karekezi visited the préfecture office in your absence.  Confirm? 
A.	I am not aware of any occasion on which he went to the préfectoral office in my absence, except he did that when I was in Nyanza.  Otherwise, whenever he went to the préfectoral office, I accompanied him. 
Q.	I am going to refresh your recollection and read from the draft transcripts of yesterday at page 43 in the English, lines 18 to 24.  You were asked:  "Mr. Lavie, since you were assigned to ensure Mr. Karekezi's security, how many times did you accompany him to meetings that took place in the préfecture office of Kigali town?"  

And your answer:  "I remember having accompanied him there three times when he went to the préfecture office of Kigali town to attend meetings convened by the préfet.  Apart from the three occasions when we were at the préfecture office to attend meetings, he used to go to the préfecture office but not to attend meetings.  He went there for other reasons." 
A.	You asked me a question, and then you read out the answer I gave yesterday.  It appears that it is different from what you said.  

Yesterday I said indeed that I did go around with Karekezi to those meetings and that sometimes he would go to the préfectoral office and not spend much time there.  Maybe he would go there to get an authorisation for a member of the population to travel.  He could also go to the secretariat to ask for a laissez-passer, and that would be very brief, and we would return to his residence.  

Now, the question that was put to me was about meetings, and no one asked me anything about the other occasions on which I may have gone along with him to the préfectoral office.  For example, whenever he bought a new vehicle, he needed to go to the préfectoral office to obtain the relevant documents for that vehicle.  And whenever he went to the préfectoral office for any reason whatsoever, I would accompany him. 
Q.	Okay.  In the previous trial at which you testified about these meetings at the préfectoral office, you testified that, except for the meetings of the 8th, 12th, and 16th, meetings were held at the préfectoral office every other two days or every other three days.  
MR. SENDZE:
And I am referring to the transcript I distributed at page 54, lines 29 to 34 in the English version; page 61, lines 19 to 22 in the French version. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	In this trial you have testified that there were no other meetings after the 16th of April.  But when you testified in the previous trial, you said after the 16th of April meetings were held at the préfectoral office every other two days or every other three days.  Can you explain the difference in your testimony? 
A.	I think I have already explained that I do remember the main meetings of which Karekezi attended upon invitation from the préfet.  This does not mean that the préfet did not organise any other meetings.  As for the meetings to which I accompanied him, it is those three meetings which dealt with security issues within the commune.  

However, the préfet could have organised other meetings with his collaborators.  And quite often, when Karekezi and Bizimana met, they would share ideas about what had been discussed at various meetings, including security issues.  And in that connection, he had told him that they held security meetings every two days.  

And so my testimony in relation to those meetings that held every two days was flowing from what I heard Bizimana tell Karekezi in relation to what had been discussed during those security meetings.  And those security meaning -- meetings are different from the three meetings to which I accompanied Karekezi and to which he had been invited, the three meetings which he attended and which I talked about. 
Q.	So now you are admitting that meetings took place after the 16th of April.  And yesterday when you were asked about the likelihood of a meeting having been held on or about the 30th of April, you said whoever testifies to such a fact is a liar.  Do you now withdraw that comment? 
A.	I believe that the person who testified that there was a meeting on the 30th of April is a liar.  I say so because Karekezi and myself never attended such a meeting.  If such a meeting held, I am not aware of it.  And you, therefore, need to put that question to the witness who testified along those lines.  It is my consistent position that anybody who made that assertion is a liar.  

I am aware of the three meetings which Karekezi attended, and I can assert that he did not attend any meeting which allegedly held on the 30th of April.  I do not believe that such a meeting took place.  And if anyone did claim before this Court that this meeting took place, that person is lying. 
Q.	And when you talked about these meetings that were held every two days or every three days -- every other three days, you went further to explain -- when you were asked whether the conseillers and other -- of other secteurs would attend the meetings, you explained that sometimes they will go there to attend the meetings and there were times when they will meet with the conseillers.  On what basis were you giving this information? 
A.	The conseillers were holding meetings at the level of their secteurs and not at the préfecture office. 
Q.	But the question was in relation to the préfecture office.  It had nothing to do with meetings at the level of their secteurs.  
A.	My answer to you was that I was aware of three meetings that took place right through to the 16th.  I witnessed the holding of those meetings because I was standing in the parking lot after having accompanied the conseiller to those meetings.  And I am saying that there were no other meetings that took place after those three to my recollection. 
Q.	If Mr. Nzirorera was present at the préfecture office sometime in late April, say, 28th to 30th of April, you would not know if he was there.  
A.	I would not know.  But quite simply, I am telling you that, given the situation that was prevailing at the time, after the 16th almost all the authorities had left Kigali except the préfet of Kigali-ville.  I did not see Nzirorera.  Had I seen him, I would have confirmed to you that I saw him.  Almost all the authorities had run away from the town. 
Q.	Okay.  Let's discuss weapons.  You agree that in April 1994 weapons were distributed to members of the population, don't you? 
A.	Yes.  But not to all members of the population.  I would rather put it this way:  Some members of the population received weapons. 
Q.	And Karekezi himself received six guns on or about the 12th or 13th of April 1994? 
A.	I think that is correct. 
Q.	Where did he get these weapons from? 
A.	I know that the person who gave him the weapons had the rank of a commander.  I witnessed when the guns were being distributed.  I do not know the name of that soldier, but I know that it was a soldier from Kigali camp who hailed from Byumba and who had the rank of commander. 
Q.	It is also true, is it not, that weapons were also distributed to members of the population by political parties such as the MRND and the CDR? 
A.	I do not agree with you on that point.  It is not the officials of political parties but certain members of the MRND and the CDR.  And when I talk about the distribution of weapons, I'm limiting myself to Biryogo secteur because I did not witness any dis -- distribution of weapons anywhere else. 
Q.	Yes.  I was simply asking you to confirm that weapons were distributed by political parties, such as the MRND and the CDR.  You agree? 
A.	I do not totally agree with your phraseology.  You started off talking about representatives of political parties.  Now you're talking about political parties.  I am ready to concede to you that some members of those political parties distributed weapons.  But not the parties, as such, or officials of those parties who distributed weapons but, rather, some members of the political parties. 
Q.	Who were the members of the MRND who distributed weapons? 
A.	As concerns MRND members I can talk about Karekezi, who was a member of the MRND even if he was a secteur conseiller.  There was Haji Ndayitabi, Sued.  Those are the two members of MRND who distributed weapons in Biryogo secteur. 
Q.	These distributions were done in April 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And the Interahamwe received some of these weapons? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Could you tell us what kind of weapons were given to these Interaham -- to the Interahamwe.  
A.	There were three types of weapons:  Kalashnikovs, G3 guns, and Lee-Enfield.  Ndayitabi distributed Kalashnikovs.  Amri distributed two Lee-Enfields, two G3s, and two Kalashnikovs. 
Q.	You agree that the Interahamwe were involved in killing -- in the killing of innocent Tutsis in Biryogo? 
A.	I do. 
Q.	And they used these guns to execute the killings? 
A.	They did. 
Q.	Can you tell us who the leaders of the MRND party were in April 1994.  
A.	I believe the -- the leaders of the MRND are sitting in the courtroom.  There was a chairman, a vice-chairman, and a secretary. 
Q.	That would be Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Karemera, and Mr. Nzirorera; correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Now, can you confirm that you had roadblocks in Biryogo secteur in April of 1994? 
A.	I so confirm. 
Q.	Who had ordered that those roadblocks be set up? 
A.	If my memory serves me correctly, this was following Kambanda's communiqué.  I believe he is the one who asked members of the population to erect roadblocks in order to block the passage to the enemy and the enemy's accomplices. 
Q.	And by Kambanda you are referring to Jean Kambanda, the prime minister? 
A.	Yes indeed. 
Q.	And by accomplices you are referring to the Tutsi? 
A.	The accomplices of the Inkotanyi were not only Tutsis.  There were some Hutus too. 
Q.	Who were those manning the roadblocks in Biryogo? 
A.	In Biryogo secteur the roadblocks were manned by members of the population of that secteur. 
Q.	And the Interahamwe joined them in this exercise, didn't they? 
A.	The Interahamwes were also members of the population who were manning roadblocks. 
Q.	And following the instructions of Kambanda, identity cards were checked at these roadblocks to identify the Tutsi who were then to be killed.  Agreed? 
A.	That was the case on some roadblocks.  But that does not mean that any Tutsi who attempted to go through a roadblock was killed. 
Q.	So following instructions from the high authority, the prime minister of the government, Tutsis were identified at roadblocks, innocent Tutsis, and killed simply because they were Tutsis.  
A.	Prosecutor, with all due respect to you, I am referring only to Biryogo.  There are Tutsis who were killed at roadblocks, but there are also Tutsis who were killed in their homes. 
Q.	You have admitted that the Tut -- the Interahamwe were involved in killing Tutsis in Biryogo.  Do you also confirm that these Interahamwes were involved in rapes? 
A.	I agree with you.  What you said happened.  Women were raped. 
Q.	And these women were not RPF elements; right?  They were just innocent Tutsi women in Biryogo.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Yesterday you talked about a man named Suedi Ndayitabi, and you admitted that he was in charge of the MRND Interahamwe in Biryogo; is that correct? 
A.	I spoke, rather, of the MRND youth wing, that is, Interahamwe of Biryogo.  I remember talking about the youth.  And yes, he was the one who represented the youth. 
Q.	And by that you mean he was the president of the youth wing in Biryogo? 
A.	You are absolutely right. 
Q.	Did you know any other local Interahamwe leaders in Biryogo? 
A.	Are you talking about the officials of Interahamwe?  No.  It was only Ndayitabi who was an official of Interahamwe in Biryogo. 
Q.	Who was responsible for setting up the Interahamwe in Biryogo? 
A.	I do not know who was responsible for the recruitment of Interahamwe.  I saw Interahamwe in Biryogo, but I do not know who recruited them. 
Q.	So if someone were to state that Mr. Ndayitabi was not a leader of the Interahamwe in Biryogo, that information would be false?  Do you agree? 
A.	There is a recurrent problem here and there when it comes to defining Interahamwe.  Ndayitabi was my neighbour.  I knew him very well.  I know that he was the president of -- or chairman of the youth wing of the MRND, which was referred to as Interahamwe.  

Now, were you or some other person to say that Ndayitabi was not the president of that youth wing, then I would tell you that you would be mistaken because it was Ndayitabi who was the president of the Interahamwe in Biryogo. 
Q.	So when Mr. François Kare -- Karera states that Ndayitabi was not the Interahamwe leader in Biryogo, he is not telling the truth.  
A.	Prosecutor, with due respect to you, Mr. Karera does not know Biryogo as well as I do.  Neither does he know Ndayitabi as well as I do.  Ndayitabi was my neighbour.  I knew him very well.  He was the president of that youth wing.  

And when I was in Karekezi's on the 7th, I had the opportunity to get to know the organisation chart of Interahamwe.  In Biryogo there was the president, the vice-president of the Interahamwe.  And I am confirming once again that it was Ndayitabi who was the president of the Interahamwe youth wing in Biryogo secteur. 
Q.	Thank you.  So the Interahamwe was well structured and it had an organisational chart with the president, the vice-president, and so on, a chart you saw.  That's what you testified to; right? 
A.	I do not know if you understood me well.  I talked about MRND in Biryogo.  They had an organisation chart, the president, the vice-president, and the president of the Interahamwe youth wing in Biryogo secteur. 
Q.	Thank you.  One last thing.  Yesterday you testified that at some time -- sometime in May you accompanied Karekezi's family to Cyangugu; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you took them to the home of Munyakazi? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	How long did they stay at Munyakazi's house before leaving for another location? 
A.	In any case, I know that they did not return to Kigali.  The last news I got of members of that family was that they were already in Zaire. 
Q.	Isn't it true that during the time when they were at Karekezi's house -- at Munyakazi's house, Karekezi would visit them to check on their welfare and well-being? 
A.	Prosecutor, Amri Karekezi was in no position to visit them.  When he attempted to do so, he did not succeed.  We went towards Cyangugu, and we just remained in Gikongoro. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, thank you for your time.  Thank you for responding to my questions.  I have no further questions to put to you.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I will move for the admission of the excerpts of the transcripts I distributed in French and English. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What we are considering is whether it needs to go in under seal.  We have modified his protective orders with regard to this trial.  But -- but this is with regard to another trial. 
MR. SENDZE:
Yes.  I think it should be --
MR. PRESIDENT:
So --

MR. SENDZE:
-- admitted under seal, because I also avoided mentioning the name of the trial.  So under seal will be fine. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy -- Mr. Nimy, do you agree?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I have no objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We admit this exhibit under seal. 
MR. MJUI: 
The exhibit number will be P. 499, 4-9-9.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 499 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, do you have any redirect examination?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I have two, three, or four questions for -- for Mr. Lavie, the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please proceed.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- Lavie, good morning once again.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Tell me, a short while ago in his cross-examination the Prosecutor placed before you the transcript of 2 July 2007 and referred to page 39 and drew your attention to the fact that you were not aware of the agenda of the security meetings.  I would like to ask you to refer to the same document.  Is that document still before you, or has Mr. Issa withdrawn it? 
MR. NIMY: 
Please, Mr. Issa, kindly place that document before that witness again, the document which the Prosecutor used a short while ago and which has just been admitted into evidence under seal. 
THE WITNESS:
I still have the document with me, Counsel. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Lavie, kindly turn to page 39 of the French version of this document.  Page 39, French version.  

MR. NIMY: 
Maybe the Prosecutor could assist us in locating the relevant page in the English version. 
MR. SENDZE:
What portion of the page do you want to refer to?  
MR. NIMY: 
Lines 21 and 22.  Page 39, lines 21 and 22 of the French version. 
THE WITNESS:
I am there.  I can see line 21 and 22. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, why don't you wait for the Prosecutor to indicate to us the corresponding part in the English version.  
MR. SENDZE:
I am afraid this may take some time because I -- I printed the pages depending on what I was going to address.  And sometimes the French page does not always correspond with the English page number.  So I will need to take time to find out where Mr. Nimy is referring to.  But I have no objection to him proceeding. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Mr. Nimy, if you just read out the section, we may be able to follow you. 
MR. NIMY: 
That is what I was going to suggest, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Lavie, can you read, or should I read the excerpt myself?  Let me read it.  It might be better to do so.  

The issue was in relation to members of the préfecture and those who attended the meetings at the préfecture office.  And your answer was -- and I read:  "The meetings that were held at the Kigali préfecture office were security meetings which were attended by the préfet, the bourgmestres, and the conseillers of the secteur." 

Was that your answer, Mr. Lavie?  Was that your testimony?  
A.	Counsel, as you can see, I too can read French, and that is what is written down, and that was my testimony, and that is what happened. 
Q.	Very well.  I have a few other questions for you, Mr. Lavie.  The Prosecutor talked about distribution of weapons with you and about the Interahamwe who had received those weapons.  Was this indeed an exercise of weapons distribution in Biryogo to the Interahamwe of Biryogo? 
A.	Counsel, when I talk, it is in reference to the situation in Biryogo.  That situation took place in Biryogo, and I already talked about the origin of those weapons in relation exclusively to Biryogo. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, did the MRND national leaders have anything to do with the distribution of weapons in Biryogo? 
A.	Counsel, I have answered the Prosecutor that when Kigali was being shelled members of government had fled the city as well as the national leaders of the MRND.  And it is only Karamira who remained for a while but subsequently fled as well.  

Therefore, when those weapons were being distributed, there -- there -- I know where those weapons were obtained from.  And there was no national leader who was in any way and manner whatsoever involved in the distribution of those weapons. 
Q.	Mr. Lavie, a short while ago you used a word which may be misleading.  Was it Kara -- Karamira or Karemera?  Which one is it? 
A.	I talked about the leaders of the political parties, and I said that almost all of them had left Kigali except a member of the MDR whose name is Karamira.  I saw him in his vehicle, his Nissan vehicle, a red Nissan, in the company of gendarmes.  So apart from Karamira, who every now and then would visit MDR militants in Biryogo, I did not see any other political party leaders during that time. 
Q.	Now, about roadblocks which had been erected upon instruction from Prime Minister Kambanda, did the national leaders of the MRND have anything to do with the setting up of roadblocks in Biryogo? 
A.	Counsel, I don't know any role they would have played in the erection of those roadblocks.  Karekezi attended a meeting at the préfecture office where it was said that a meeting of cellule responsables would be organised.  We were outside the hall.  But we heard it being said to people that they would implement the instructions by setting up roadblocks and that the process had to start by an identification of the locations at which the roadblocks would be set up and that the responsables of cellules would play a key role in that exercise, namely, the members -- or the responsables of -- of the cellules.  But later the roadblocks were not heeded because the roadblocks were set up haphazardly and in a disorderly manner.

So apart from that, I am not aware of any instructions or orders that may have come from the MRND national leaders.  All I know is that it is the responsables of the cellules who gave instructions for the roadblocks to be set up.  

But subsequently, members of the population erected other roadblocks, sometimes even in front of their own personal residences in order to ensure their own personal security.  And these were different from the roadblocks that had been set up upon instruction from the responsables de cellules. 
Q.	Did the national leaders of the MRND have anything to do with the appointment or designation of Ndayitabi as Interahamwe chief for Biryogo? 
A.	Counsel, I already knew Ndayitabi.  But I only found out that he was the president of the Interahamwe of the MRND on the 7th when the issue was being discussed with Karekezi.  I do not know who appointed him to the position of head of the Interahamwe.  On the 7th of April, when I met him, he was already the head of the Interahamwe.  And I know that he had a position in the leadership of the MRND.  

But as to his leadership role for the youth wing in Biryogo, I only became aware of that on the 7th of April. 
Q.	What is Mr. Suedi Ndayitabi's ethnicity, Witness? 
A.	You may be surprised, Counsel.  But let me tell you that Biryogo is a -- was a very complicated secteur.  Most of the inhabitants were Tutsi and foreigners.  

And the majority of MRND members in Biryogo were Tutsi.  Chairman and vice-chairman were both Tutsi.  Ndayitabi himself, the president of the Interahamwe, was Tutsi.  President Zuber, Marko was Tutsi.  Hassan Ali was Tutsi but a native of Tanzania.  Ndayitabi was also a Tutsi.
(Pages 1 to 14 by Tanya West)

























1015H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So Ndayitabi, the head of the Interahamwe in Biryogo was Tutsi; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That is what I have just told you, Counsel.  He was Tutsi. 
Q.	Now, I would like to ask you a last question.  Karekezi, Amri, was he involved in the killings in Biryogo? 
A.	He was convicted to death for the killings that took place in the secteur.  And he played a major role in most of those killings.  Those who were first killed in Biryogo were actually handed over by him, the very first cases.  He had some documents about one Vincent, and it is a gendarme from one brigade who was known as Ngurumunsi who brought a document bearing some names and codes referring to members of the RPF in Biryogo.  

The list was not only drawn up, but Karekezi also had video cassette recordings of residents of Biryogo visiting the RPF at the CND.  These people had been filmed as they went to visit the RPF members at the CND.  Some members of the CDR committed some of the killings, but most of those who were killed in Biryogo were killed because of Karekezi. 

Even the rapes that occurred in the secteur were initiated by Karekezi.  He was the first one to rape the women who were detained at the bureau of the Biryogo secteur. 
Q.	Did the national leaders of the MRND play any role in the rapes that took place in Biryogo or in the killings that were committed by Karekezi? 
A.	Counsel, I have already told you that those leaders had already fled Kigali and we could not see them.  They, therefore, were not in Biryogo. 

By the way, the killings in Biryogo were committed by members of the population in Biryogo.  And the head of the Biryogo cellule was one of the leaders of those killers.  When we went to the 
préfectoral office, instructions were given to the heads of the secteurs not to kill, but, rather, to provide security for the inhabitants.  

During that meeting the préfet actually said that it was not the ordinary citizens who had brought down the president's plane.  He told them that he had heard mention of the fact that people were looting and were tracking down Tutsis.  So the préfet did not ask them to do the same thing but, rather, to provide security for the inhabitants.  I therefore do not see how it can be said that the national leaders of the MRND played any role whatsoever in those massacres and rapes. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness Lavie.  I have no further questions for you. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I am done with my redirect. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I found the reference in the English transcripts of what my learned friend read.  And it came from page 35, lines 25 to 26. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, allow me to apply for authorisation for the witness to greet Mr. Nzirorera and the other accused persons. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. 

Yes.  Yesterday it was drawn to our attention by the court reporters that there was a reference in the transcript to the trial in which -- in which this witness had previously testified.  We're saying that that reference should be redacted, and we make the order accordingly. 

Now, Mr. Witness, your testimony before the Tribunal, before our trial, has now been completed.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us with our work.  But you're now excused and free to leave.  The registrar will make arrangements in relation to the request of counsel for you to visit the accused persons. 
(Witness excused)
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, the next witness -- our next witness is Mr. Léon Habyarimana.  It is now almost a 
	few minutes to the mid-morning break.  I do not know whether it would not be appropriate to take the break a little early and resume later. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, everybody else seems to be in approval of your application.  Even the Prosecutor can't keep a smile off his face. 

So we take the mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1025H to 1055H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  You now can hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  I can hear you very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good.  Well, you're here because the statement you made has been admitted in evidence, and you're here to facilitate cross-examination on that statement. 

As a preliminary, you have to take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will assist you to do that now. 
(Declaration made by Léon Habyarimana in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, in order to save some time, we think the witness's identification particulars are already included in the menu to this statement which is now going to be admitted into trial.  So I think that we can simply, at this stage, make an order admitting that statement as an exhibit in our trial and proceed immediately to cross-examination. 

Do you agree?  
MR. NIMY:
That is indeed the case, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good.  Thank you very much.  Well, we make the order admitting the statement in evidence now.  

Do we have an exhibit number?  
MR. NIMY:
829.  D. NZ829, Mr. President.  If I can assist the registry.  Sorry, 830.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ830 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Now, Mr. Witness, the purpose of your attendance here is to permit the Prosecutor to cross-examination you on your statement.  So I now invite the Prosecutor to put questions to you. 
LÉON HABYARIMANA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, Léon.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	My name is Takeh Sendze, and I represent the Prosecutor. 

In your statement that has just been admitted, you stated that you were at some time in school in Canada.  Could you tell us what school you attended. 
A.	In Canada I first attended the Quebec minor seminary.  And then I went to the CÉGEP of Sainte-Foy. 
Q.	Could you spell those French words, please.
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	The -- not that one.  The other -- the other school. 
A.	CÉGEP.
Q.	Yes.  
A.	CÉGEP is C-É-G-E-P.  That is an acronym.  Of Sainte-Foy.
Q.	When -- when did you enroll into this -- first of all, into the Quebec minor seminary? 
A.	If my memory serves me correctly, I went to Canada in 1989, and I started studying in the
	Quebec minor seminary in 1990.  And I was admitted into CÉGEP in Sainte-Foy in 1992, if I remember correctly. 
Q.	When did you complete your programme at CÉGEP?  
A.	I had to finish at the end of 1994.  But, unfortunately, as everybody knows, there was an attempt against my father's plane.  I was in France, and I remained in France because Canada refused to grant me a visa to return there. 
Q.	To return to Canada from France or from Rwanda? 
A.	From France.  Because in 1994, I went to Paris, France, on holidays. 
Q.	Between 1989 and 1992, how often did you go back to Rwanda? 
A.	I went to Rwanda mainly during the long holidays, that is, the holidays from July to August principally.  But on some occasions I would be there for Christmas holidays. 
Q.	So were you in Rwanda at any time in 1991? 
A.	In 1991 I was studying in Canada.  And I believe I went to Rwanda for the long holiday from July to August.
Q.	What about in '92? 
A.	Same thing as in 1991.  I went back home every year for the long holidays. 
Q.	Do you know the building referred to as the Védaste Rubangura building? 
A.	No.  No.  I do not know that building. 
Q.	Were you in Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	Could you be specific as to the date you want me to answer to. 
Q.	Were you ever there in 1994? 
A.	I was in Rwanda in 1994, towards the end of May or early June.  I spent some time in Gisenyi, and I went to my father's grave site.  And then I left. 
Q.	So you had come from France to Rwanda, or did you travel from Canada to Rwanda in May 1994? 
A.	As I told you, after my father was assassinated, Canada refused to grant me a visa, and so I remained in France, and I was able to go to Gisenyi from France. 
Q.	While you were in Gisenyi, who was in your company during that time? 
A.	Throughout my stay, I was with part of the Presidential Guard which had remained in Gisenyi at our house.  And they are the ones who took me to the remains of my dad -- my father, which were at BRALIRWA in the mortuary. 
Q.	Did you ever have occasion to meet with either Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Karemera or Mr. Ngirumpatse when you were in Rwanda? 
A.	In 1994?  
Q.	Yes. 
A.	No.  If my memory is correct, I did not meet them. 
Q.	Does the name "Interahamwe" mean anything to you? 
A.	Yes.  That name means something to me.  Like everyone else, I read the newspapers, and I know that this was the name given to the youth wing of the MRND. 
Q.	Do you know when that youth wing was established? 
A.	No.  Not at all.  I don't know. 
Q.	Now, you say that your father was killed in April 1994, and we are referring -- referring to
	President Juvénal Habyarimana.  Who do you blame for his death? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, that's a very difficult question for me.  I think that this Tribunal was created to answer these types of questions.  It is very difficult for me to answer this question and -- but humbly speaking and as far as I know, I know that my father was killed by the RPF in order to get power. 
Q.	And how does that make you feel about the RPF? 
A.	I don't know how I can answer that question.  Feel, what do you mean by how do I feel?  What do you mean?  I -- I don't quite understand the thrust of your question. 
Q.	You blame the RPF for having caused the death of your father.  Would it be right to say that your sentiments towards the RPF are not friendly? 
A.	In any event, I cannot have friendly feelings towards people whom I do not know.  I do not know the members of the RPF.  All I can tell you is that they killed my father in order to get to power.  They have gotten it, and they are in power.  That is my feeling. 

Well, in any event, I don't have any animosity against anybody whosoever, but they did this in order to get to power, and they are keeping the power. 
Q.	Where were you in April of 2006? 
A.	I think the answer will be repetitious, because I already told you that I was on holidays in Paris. 
Q.	2006. 
A.	Oh, 2006.  No.  2006 I was in France.  Yes, France.  If I -- if I remember correctly, I was in France. 
Q.	You were not in Brussels at any time in 2006? 
A.	It is possible that I might have travelled to Brussels.  It's very possible, because I have family members there too.  And as you know very well, Paris and Brussels in the TGV is 1 hour, 15 minutes.  And with the EU it is possible to go to Brussels or to any other European country without any problem.  So it is possible that I -- I could have gone there at some point. 
Q.	Isn't it true that sometime in April 2006 you participated in a public demonstration against the RPF regime in Brussels? 
A.	Yes, it is possible.  Very likely. 
Q.	Would it be true to suggest that you consider those before this Tribunal to have been victimised? 
A.	Please can you repeat the question.  I -- I did not quite understand your question. 
Q.	Let me go back.  What -- what was the purpose of the demonstration you participated in in April 2006 in Brussels?  What were you demonstrating against? 
A.	In April 2006 we demonstrated to ask for the truth and the whole truth about the death of the president and the entire truth about the Rwandan tragedy so that whosoever may have been involved in those crimes should be brought to book and be punished. 
Q.	In a news article which I have distributed, a news article I got from the Internet, it was reported that you were demonstrating with other family members of yours to raise awareness on the Hutu victims of the RPF genocide.  Is that far from the truth? 
A.	I don't know which article you are referring to.  And I don't know which paper may have produced it.  But as I told you a short while ago, the purpose of our demonstration was to bring to light the entire truth about the Rwandan tragedy and to ask that all those who were involved in the conflict be brought to book and tried. 
Q.	Do you know a person by the name Julien Twagiramungu? 
A.	Julien.  No.  I don't have any recollection of that name. 
Q.	What about General Yves Germanos?  Y-V-E-S.  Then G-E-R-M-A-N-O-S. 
A.	I do not know that person.  Is he Rwandan, French, Belgian?  Or what is his nationality?  
Q.	What about a certain Colonel Gilles Bonsang?  G-I-L-L-E-S, B-O-N-S-A-N-G. 
A.	No.  I do not know that person either. 
MR. SENDZE:  
Issa, please show the witness the second document. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Have you ever seen that document, Witness? 
A.	Yes.  I saw it in one of the reports published in Kigali.  I don't know whether it's the Mucyo or the Mutsinzi report.  I -- I don't know which one of them.  But I have seen the document. 
Q.	Do you see your name on the document? 
A.	Well, I see a name that looks like mine, but this is not the spelling of my name.  I can spell out my name for you, if you want. 
Q.	I see on the document "Léon Habyarimana". 
A.	No.  I see "Léon Habiarimana".  My name is Habyarimana.  That is not my name. 
Q.	In the -- I have in the -- in the article -- in the document which I obtained from the Internet an English translation was provided.  
And I can hand that over to the Court.  And it is stated that the letter is addressed to
Habyarimana's son.  Did your father have any other child named Léon Habiarimana? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, let me make one point clear:  Anything can be written.  And I want to say that this is not my name.  My name is Habyarimana, not Habiarimana. 

Secondly, the address is 76 rue de Cèdre in Nice.  I never lived in Nice.  So I don't know what this is all about.  If you have any article which can tell me who is the -- which you can tell me the author of, then very well.  But, you see, on the Internet you can find anything and all manner of things. 

So I do not know whether we can rely on articles that have been published by X, Y, Z.  Because I have seen some journalists who claim to be experts on matters relating to my family, while others claim to be experts even on my own person.  So I believe that we should not pay too much attention to these types of materials.  And I -- I really am sorry about it. 
Q.	So how did you come about this letter considering that you're saying this is -- this is not your name? 
A.	I told you that I saw it in one of the reports.  There were two reports.  Whether it's the Mucyo report or the Mutsinzi report, it is in one of them that I saw this letter. 
Q.	I suggest to you that this is your name that has been misspelt. 
A.	Well, Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm really sorry, but I repeat I have never lived at the address mentioned here.  If it is my name which has been misspelt, then tell me who is the author so that we can make the appropriate corrections.  I don't know that person. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I have nothing further for you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

Mr. Nimy, do you have any redirect for this witness?  
MR. NIMY:
No.  No, Mr. President.  No re-examination.  Well, the war has come to an end because there are no fighters. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Now, Mr. Habyarimana, that concludes your testimony in our trial.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us in our work.  But you're now excused and free to go.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to ask for permission for the witness to meet Mr. Nzirorera and the others. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The registrar will make the usual arrangements so the request of counsel can be addressed.  But you are now free to go. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, our next witness will be Mr. Nzirorera.  We would like him to return to the witness box, and then the Prosecutor can proceed with cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Nzirorera, would you please move forward. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, while Mr. Nzirorera is moving to the box, could I have the assistance of the registry to distribute some documents that I've prepared.  

We have a binder of materials.  The bulk of the materials are exhibits that have already been admitted in evidence.  So no one needs to -- to fear that we're going to be weighted down with admitting exhibits.  I would say around 80 per cent of these have already been admitted, but for everyone's ease of access, we've reproduced them again.
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Mr. President, Your Honours, in conformity with the practice of this Chamber, I wish to inform you that the examination-in-chief of Witness Joseph Nzirorera lasted 17 hours, 10 minutes in total.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Good morning, Mr. Nzirorera. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Welcome back to the witness stand.  I suppose after nearly 18 hours of examination-in-chief, it's almost like your new home. 
The Prosecutor will now have an opportunity to cross-examine you on the testimony you've given.  You remain under the same oath that you took when you first began your testimony.  And this cross-examination will commence now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

Let me begin by wishing everyone a good morning, to the Bench and the parties.
JOSEPH NZIRORERA (continued)
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	And to you, Mr. Nzirorera, my greetings and good morning. 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Webster. 
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, you and I have a long history.  I think we first encountered each other back in 1999 during your initial appearance, and we've had a great deal of interaction over the years, both in court and when I've had to deliver documents to you and -- or for inspection to your -- to your belongings and so on and so forth. 

And before we start this exercise, I simply wanted to let you know, if it's not clear to you already, that throughout these years the Prosecution has tried to give you a fair trial.  And I will try to be fair in my questions to you in cross-examination. 

And I'll simply offer the same words of advice that I have for every other witness, which is that I will never try to stop you from presenting your case but that I would appreciate it if you would just listen to my questions and answer them as directly as possible so that I can move through the issues that I think will be important for this Trial Chamber. 

So can you give me your assurance that you'll assist me in that regard? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  I know that you are a very polite man, that you are a very competent man.  So I'll try to cooperate with you so that we can proceed as efficiently as possible.  So we can proceed now. 
Q.	And then I'd ask you to look over at me and -- from time to time, and any time you see me wave my hand, I'd ask you to simply pause for a second, and I will give you some further instructions.  And if you insist on going forward, then the Chamber can let us know if you should proceed or if I should proceed.  But it's just decorum, how we are going to handle the way we move through the examination.  

And, for your benefit, let me just tell you how I plan to organise my questioning.  Mr. Robinson, in his direct examination, started with the events of the month of April 1994 and covered them quite thoroughly in his first day.  And then he went back in time when he finished almost with your departure from Rwanda in July of 1994.  Then he went back to the 1990s and made a whole sweep, taking us all the way back to the 6th of April, which is where he started when he began his examination. 

And my approach is going to be slightly different.  I'm going to start with background material, politics and background issues in Rwanda generally.  And after I deal with that, then I'll deal with the MRND and the Interahamwe, and we'll spend time discussing the MRND and the Interahamwe.  And then I'll finish by asking you questions about the interim government and its policies. 

So don't feel compelled to try to get everything in during our first set of questionings -- the first set of questions today, because I'm just really going over background politics.  But just for everyone's benefit, I wanted to let you know, and for you in particular Mr. Nzirorera, I just wanted to give you an outline of how we'll proceed.  So we can start now. 

So can -- can we begin by agreeing that Rwanda has an extremely sophisticated political culture? 
A.	Well, I do not know.  Maybe that is your point of view. 
Q.	Well, what I would suggest to you is that Rwanda and the Banyarwanda people are recognised for having a very sophisticated politics, so much so, that it has attracted the interest of scholars well before the events of 1994.  

And just by way of example, I'd mention Alison Des Forges, who you probably aren't too fond of.  But before she started writing on the genocide, she had done a PhD dissertation on the court of a Musinga.

And then there is Catherine Newbury and her husband.  I don't recall his first name.  But they write in English, and they have a very well documented career -- academic career studying Rwanda and the Great Lakes.  

There's René Lemarchand, a Belgian who writes in French.  

A man by the name of Vamsina, or Vansina, V-A-N-S-I-N-A.  Jan, I believe is his first name, a Belgian as well.  And there are many others.  But those are the three or four that come to mind immediately.  But these are western scholars who have been studying and writing on Rwanda and the Great Lakes long before 1994 and the genocide.  

In addition to these western scholars, there are Rwandese, Banyarwanda scholars.  We can start with Alexis Kagame.  And we can even mention Ferdinand Nahimana, who testified in this Chamber.  And if we take the example of Nahimana, is this someone who is recognised for his scholarship long before he was deemed the international proponent of Hutu power?  
And all of these people are writing on the history and the politics and the culture of politics in Rwanda going all the way back to the 18th and 19th centuries. 

Having said that, would you agree with me now that Rwanda has a history of very sophisticated and intellectually challenging politics? 
A.	I do not share that point of view.  And, in any case, I have not read what the authors you have mentioned wrote. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Nzirorera, I can accept your response.  I would simply suggest to you that the political sophistication that has intrigued scholars for so many generations continues through persons like you who have been involved in politics from very early in your professional career.  And I say that as a compliment to you, that your political gifts and your oratorical gifts and skills are really to your credit.  
A.	Thank you for your compliments.  But I do not agree with your proposition. 
Q.	Well, during your direct examination, you yourself touched on some of the political themes in Rwanda that have been recurrent over the last several centuries.  One is regionalism, in other words, competition between the north and the south as a factor in politics.  Certainly you remember that portion of your testimony, right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when you discussed regionalism as a factor in Rwandan politics, you were even discussing regionalism as an issue within the MRND party as separate from the other parties who had regionalist concerns.  Even within the MRND there were regionalist tensions, isn't that so? 
A.	No.  I said that the problem of regionalism dates back to the first republic. 

During the second republic, there were attempts to correct those problems at regional and ethnic levels, but their success was not as expected.  So I just told you that that problem existed, but I did not say that it was the MRND that was advocating regionalism.  Quite to the contrary, the MRND was for the politic of balance, ethnic and regional balance. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Nzirorera, I understand the point you're making there, but I'm making a separate point, which is that even within the MRND, which we can all acknowledge was -- had its base in the north, 
	which is -- and here I'm referring to Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Byumba -- that even within the party with its base in the north, party officials knew or -- or took the precaution of making sure that responsibilities within the party and various ministries and designation of who would be the chef de cabinet in the various ministries that were attributed to the MRND so that they could be assigned regionally so that you could have a minister of defence from one préfecture, a minister of family from another préfecture, director of cabinet for the same ministry as to other préfectures.  

So you took the care, even within the MRND, to ensure a regional balance in how you divided up authority within your party. 
A.	Yes.  The principles of MRND were based on regional balance and ethnic balance.  As much as possible, the regional disparities had to be corrected. 
Q.	And all I'm suggesting to you is that was part of the art of politics, as you played them.  Not you alone, but as -- as they were played back in Rwanda in the early '90s. 
A.	I would say, rather, that that is a -- and -- a political orientation and not an art as such. 
Q.	All right.  So -- and we can quibble over terms, but all I'm doing is suggesting to you that there's a political sophistication to the way that politics were conducted in Rwanda generally and politics were conducted even within your party. 

Another issue that you developed before the Trial Chamber was political pluralism, the introduction of multiparty politics, the strategy for introducing multiparty politics.  That was an issue back in the
early '90s.  We can agree on that certainly. 
A.	Yes.  In the 1990s Rwanda was on the path of multiparty politics. 
Q.	And you also discuss the competition between Tutsi and Hutu, or the ethnic question, which was an issue in politics not only in the early '90s but back in the late '50s and probably even before then.  So these are all issues in the art and science of politics in Rwanda going back for many decades and probably a few centuries.  We can agree on those -- that simple proposition. 
A.	No.  I do not agree with that proposition.  I talked about ethnic problems in the years preceding independence but also after independence.  I talked about the newfound unity from the advent of the new republic, '73 to 1990, and that the ethnic balance that had been broken by -- and that the balance had been broken by October war, the 1990 war.  But apart from that, I do not see the point you're making. 
Q.	It's a general point.  It's not -- we don't have to be too worried about it.  I'll just move on. 

Without blaming any party or any person, can we acknowledge that Rwandans generally take note of the competition between northerners like yourself, the Bakiga, and southerners, who are referred to as the Banyanduga. 

Banyanduga people, as I understand it, are from Butare, Gikongoro, Gitarama, from the south and centre of the country. 
A.	As I told you, these problems started around 1968.  When President Habyarimana took office, he tried to resolve all these problems which had become a reality in Rwandan society, the ethnic problem and the regional problem. 

So from the first days of his presidency, he advocates peace and national unity.  He says that all Rwandans are the same.  So that problem was there, and a solution had to be found for it.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes.  But Habyarimana became president because he successfully executed a coup d'état against Grégoire Kayibanda who comes from Gitarama and whose government represented the interests of the southerners, the Banyanduga.  And Habyarimana and those associated with him in that coup were blamed for having Kayibanda die miserably in jail and for having killed a whole generation of politicians that were associated with Kayibanda.

Isn't that so?
A.	Yes.  There was a coup d'état in 1973 which toppled President Kayibanda's regime.  That I conceded. 
Q.	And that coup was viewed as the triumph of the north over the south.  It was a reversal, wasn't it?  The Kayibanda regime represented the centre, Habyarimana in particular, and Habyarimana's government that was in put in place after his successful military coup was criticised for representing the interest of the north.
A.	Unfortunately, that was not our construction of what was happening.  You talked about the 
	Kayibanda government which was defending the interests of the south.  I do not think that Kayibanda was there to defend the interests of the people of the south only.

Similarly, Habyarimana was from the north.  But he didn't only have to defend the interests of the north.  When one becomes head of state, he is head of state for all Rwandans, for all people, not part of the people.  So my vision is not the vision you have.  I do not share that vision. 
Q.	Well, in an ideal world government would represent all of its constituents.  But unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world.  And what I'm suggesting to you is that the history of Rwanda is one where 
	Tutsi elites were pushed aside and displaced by Kayibanda in the early '60s with the introduction of the first republic and that in 1973 those southern Hutu elites were pushed aside by the northerners like yourself.  

And that these three political groupings who were vying for power at the beginning of the 20th century are basically the same political groupings that were vying for power in 1994, the Tutsi elites that had prospered under colonialism, the Hutu elites from the south that prospered under Kayibanda, and the Hutu elites from the north that prospered under Habyarimana which could include people like you from Ruhengeri.  

Now, I know that is not a nuanced history, but isn't that really sum and substance of the political conflicts in Rwanda over the 20th century? 
A.	The beginning of the conflict should be placed in history earlier, in fact, four centuries of domination by the Tutsis over the Hutus and then count or take into consideration the years of the first republic and then the second republic.  That is part of Rwandan history.

So the history of Rwanda did not start in 1959 or with Grégoire Kayibanda.  It started long before. 
Q.	Well, on that we're agreed.  Rwanda has a very long history, and the only thing I'm suggesting to you is that the same conflicts that you confronted in 1993 and 1994 were the conflicts that had raged over previous centuries, Tutsi elites versus southern Hutu elites versus northern Hutu elites.   

So we're in agreement on that, are we not?  Or do you want to clarify it a bit further?
A.	In my view, the conflict in Rwanda in the 1990s resulted from the October 1990 war.  Taking this opportunity of the war, some people also wanted to settle their scores.  That is my construction of the situation.

And in that war people also had other scores to settle. 
Q.	All right.  I'll just ask you one more question on this issue, and then we'll move on.

Couldn't we agree that the Tutsi elites that took form in the early '90s as the RPF were somehow derived from those Tutsi who left Rwanda in 1959 because they felt chased out by the social revolution of 1959 that was led by or supported by Kayibanda?  You can agree to that, can't you?  
A.	I think that in the course of my testimony in-chief I clearly stated that the movement of refugees started with the 1959 revolution.  That we agree on.  But I also indicated that calls were sent out to these refugees requesting them to come back to the country, both by president Kayibanda and Habyarimana.  I believe I even referred to the necessary documents dealing with this issue of refugees.

Quite simply, what should be noted is that amongst these Tutsi refugees there were people who were nostalgic for power, the extremist Tutsis who wanted power by force, and this is what caused the problems in the decade '60 up to '70. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And then after the Tutsis were displaced in 1959, then we have the southern elites who were largely represented by the PARMEHUTU party or Kayibanda in 1991.  And that party was reborn as the MDR in 1991.  So we can consider the MDR as the inheritor of Kayibanda's Hutu party.  Can we agree with that proposition?  I know it's a broad proposition, but in substance, isn't that the case? 
A.	I believe I'm not quite in agreement with you because you did clearly say that before that there was the MDR-PARMEHUTU, and this was a party of 1957/'58 which took part in the Rwandan revolution.  What took over was the MDR of 1991, and the MDR was totally different from the MRND.

Quite simply, MRND recognised, like most of Rwandan parties, the achievements of the 1959 revolution because that revolution was necessary for the people of Rwanda.
So I agree with you that the MRND did recognise the achievements of that revolution and exposed them. 
Q.	I think maybe we mis-communicated with each other or there was a translation -- an ambiguity in the translation.  All I'm suggesting to you is that the MDR that took form in 1991 is basically the inheritor of the PARMEHUTU that was in power in the early 1960s.  So there's a direct line of continuity between Kayibanda's PARMEHUTU party and the MDR that took form in 1991.  So that's all I'm asking you to agree to.
A.	We agree when you talk about the MDR, but what I heard from the interpreters was "MRND". 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  And then we have the MRND nouvelle formule ou rénové which is the MRND that was reformed or reborn in multipartyism in 1991 but still had its base of power in the north.  That you can agree to as well.
A.	The MRND nouvelle formule or "renovated" had its headquarters in Kigali but had militants here and there in the republic.  It had a majority in certain areas of the country certainly.  So you could say that it was a bastion if you want.

But I would say that the MRND was a national party.  It was not based only in the north.  The majority representation might have been in the north all right, and that is the nuance I would like to add. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.  Now, you told us during your direct examination the MDR party split.  The PL party split.  The PSD party split, all of this occurring in late 1993/1994.  But it was the MRND alone that never split within itself.

That was your testimony, wasn't it?  
A.	What I can tell you is that at 6 April 1994 there were 17 political parties in Rwanda.  Some of the parties experienced problems -- namely, the PL, the MDR.  The PDI had problems and to a lesser extent the PSD.

Those are the parties I know to have had problems.  I don't know any similar problems having occurred within the MRND.  And if you are aware of them, maybe you should point them out to me, and we can talk about them, concrete cases. 
Q.	Well, that's exactly where I want to go, Mr. Nzirorera, because no doubt there was a split or a schism within those other opposition parties.  But contrary to your assertion, I would suggest to you that there was also tensions and competition within the MRND between a wing of the party that could be characterised as reformist and a wing of the MRND that could be characterised as conservative.
A.	Personally, I am not aware of those factions.  If they did exist, please kindly tell me who their leaders were.  In any event, I do not know who were the reformists or progressive wing, and I don't know who were the conservatives.  Because we never had any split congress within the MRND for all the years that I was in the MRND.
We never had separate political bureau meetings.  So maybe you are in possession of information that is not available to me. 
Q.	Well, you know, I'm not suggesting that it was a split that took the dramatic form that it did with the MDR party.  But in context, it's understandable because those who were in the progressive wing of your party had to leave the country because their lives were threatened.

You don't have anybody in the MRND that complained and left your party and not only left your party but left the country because they felt they would be killed for expressing reformist views within the MRND party?  
A.	I think that if I were to answer your question, maybe it would be best to refer -- maybe you're referring to the minister of defence, James Gasana.  And I'll give you my thoughts on him, James Gasana.  

That minister was the minister of defence.  He was afraid of an unidentified organisation.  So imagine that you have a minister of defence who has an entire army behind him and who flees a 
ghost organisation.  So to my mind he was simply a coward. 
Q.	Yes.  But he's still alive because he fled.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, when Ferdinand Nahimana was in the box, you read excerpts of his book to the extent that Ferdinand wanted to kill him, Uwilingiyimana wanted to kill him, Nzirorera wanted to kill him.  

Honestly speaking, for a minister of defence to say that he was attacked by a group of civilians, unarmed civilians, how can you believe that?  How can you believe those people?

In any way, that is the Prosecutor's case, but I don't accept it at all. 
Q.	Well, you're familiar with the writings of a Rwandan scholar by the name of Nkiko Nsengimana, aren't you?  I'll spell the name for the record.  N-K-I-K-O is the first name, second name N-S-E-N-G-I-M-A-N-A.  He's a doctor of political science.  That's not a name that's unfamiliar to you, is it?
A.	I have heard mention of that name, but I don't know him in person.  But it has been said that the gentleman worked at the Iwacu centre.  I-W-A-C-U, Iwacu centre.  So that name rings a bell, yes.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Nsengimana -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Nsengimana submitted an expert report for one of the Trial Chambers of this Tribunal in Defence of Jean-de-Dieu Kamuhanda.  So he was a Defence expert.  Jean-de-Dieu Kamuhanda is one of the MRND ministers of the interim government that was arrested, and tried, and convicted here at the Tribunal.

But he relied on the assistance or the expertise of Nkiko Nsengimana to help him defend himself.

So I'll ask you:  Have you read that expert report that I'm sure was circulated at the UNDF, the 
expert report prepared by Nkiko Nsengimana in defence of the MRND minister Jean-de-Dieu Kamuhanda? 
A.	Unfortunately, I did not see that report. 
Q.	Well, let me provide you with an excerpt that I'd like us to look at, and then I'll have your reaction to some of the things he says.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
So if Mr. Issa could hand up document B2 in my bundle.  It's just an excerpt of the report, but as it says on the cover page, it was prepared by Nkiko Nsengimana, doctor of political science.  Unfortunately, I only have it in French, but its title -- and I'll read the title in French -- some elements of political analysis of the Rwanda (inaudible) in 1994.

And I'd direct us all to page 12 of the excerpt I've provided.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And, Mr. Nzirorera, you can read that page 12 deals with the MRND.  And if you look at that 
	first paragraph -- I'm just going to summarise it in English, but if I've correctly -- if I've been inaccurate in my summary, you can bring it to our attention.  

But basically he's saying that the MRND came into power in 1993 on the basis of a military coup and that it had two currents, a conservative current and a reformist current, but that basically its main source of support or recruitment was in the north -- Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Byumba.  

And then when you go to the second paragraph, he starts to talk about these two currents within the MRND.  And he says that the conservative current was constituted by the relics of the former single party who were allergic to evolution, allergic to democratic evolution.  They were afraid of all change and didn't want any compromise with the opposition and wanted to maintain its exclusive hold on power and that it wanted to use war to assure its military and political supremacy and that the leadership of that conservative current was maintained by the Akazu which he explains as a tight circle around the president whose primary representative was Joseph Nzirorera, the future national secretary, who was the incontestable head or chief of its Interahamwe militia.

So what I'm suggesting to you is that this was an analysis offered in defence of another MRND minister who was tried and convicted at this Tribunal.  And it's an analysis offered by someone who was trying to be intellectually honest but still defend an MRND minister who was accused by the ICTR Prosecutor.  

Do you have any reaction to this analysis of the Akazu as represented by Joseph Nzirorera being in the leadership of this conservative wing or conservative tendencies within the MRND?
A.	My point of view is that this is an erroneous analysis.  The author has expressed his point of view, his analysis.  And I do not share the same opinion as Mr. Kamuhanda.

What I would have liked to see would have been for you to call him to this Court to defend his ideas.  All I can say is that I am not at all in agreement with what he states here.

For example, he talks of an army that was essentially an MRND army.  Question, was he looking at the single-party era or the multiparty era?

During the single-party era, all Rwandans were members of the MRND party including himself.  During the multiparty era, soldiers were not members of any political party because it was forbidden by the law on political parties.

He has talked about the Akazu, the president's inner circle.  And I have told you that my relations with the president were one of head of state and minister.  Now he claims that I'm a member of the Akazu.  Yet I have told you what the origin of the Akazu was.

It was an opposition idea.  So the thoughts put forth here can only commit the author.  He alone is responsible for his thoughts, and I cannot share his opinions.  I do not share his opinions.

Maybe if he were here, we would be able to put some questions to him.  But unfortunately, he cannot be here. 
Q.	In any case, he goes on to describe the reformist tendency within the MRND.  And let me say that I agree with you, Mr. Nzirorera, that there wasn't a split as such within the MRND party.  

All I'm suggesting to you is that there were two amorphous tendencies, one that was conservative and reactionary led by yourself or championed by you in any case, and at the end of the continuum, those who wanted the MRND to adapt itself to political pluralism for which one of the leading proponents was the name you've just given us, James Gasana, who was appointed minister of defence back in 1992.   

According to Nsengimana's analysis, Gasana wanted to impose the neutrality of the army but that he was unseated by the Akazu and was forced into exile.  But he's not the only one.  

You yourself talked about Désiré Murenzi, Désiré Murenzi who forthrightly acknowledges having been the moving force behind the creation of the Interahamwe, openly takes credit for having gathered a group of colleagues and young professionals together to start an organisation that would later be known as the Interahamwe but who had to flee Rwanda in fear of his life because of threats that were coming from within the party, within the MRND.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I think that when Murenzi was appointed member of the central committee of the MRND in May 1991, I had just been dismissed from that very central committee.

When Nzirorera (sic) fled, was he fleeing from Nzirorera?  That is very serious.

Secondly, Mr. James Gasana -- at the time I left government on 30 December 1991, he remained in government.  I had just been dismissed.

Now, in 1993 when he fled, I was not a member of government.  When Gasana was fleeing, was he running away from Nzirorera?  That's very serious.

So I believe that these people are engaging in manipulation and intoxication because they try over and over again to explain by their cowardice by saying that "We fled for such and such a reason."

When shells exploded in front of Murenzi's office in Kigali in 1992, you may want to ask which organ of the MRND I belonged to at that time.  I was in the wildness, so to speak, and grenades were exploding in Kigali.  And can he now claim that it was Nzirorera who was lobbing those grenades?

Now, you see a director of a parastatal organisation claims that we held it against him because grenades exploded here and there.  Well, I don't blame him because he is free to say whatever he chooses to say.  The only thing is that I cannot share those opinions. 
Q.	All right.  We have your response.  But returning to this issue of whether or not there was a split within the MRND, my suggestion to you is that the most extremist elements within the MRND actually reconfigured themselves as the CDR and that for all practical purposes, the CDR was just a splinter or a wing of the MRND.
A.	That is incorrect.  That is false.  
Q.	Well, why don't we have a look at what James Gasana has to say because I do have an excerpt of his book for us to look at also, which is document B1 in my bundle for which I have a few pages excerpted, and I'd like us to look at page 97 which is only available to us in French.   

MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could collect this for me.   
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, James Gasana, even though he left the country in 1993, still defends the MRND party.  I'm sure you've read his book or are familiar with it, and he criticises tendencies within the party, but the book is still largely a defence of the MRND and a criticism of the RPF.

But what he tells us on page 97 in that first paragraph -- and I'll just read it in French so that we have the exact translation.  It's only three or four sentences:  "Some believe that this party is a transformation of the right wing of the MRND.  However, its creation is perceived differently within that party.  According to some, it was a strategy to break away from the isolation of the MRND, which within the context of a national conference, did not have an allied party with which to work.

"Furthermore, the creation of the CDR was designed to express that which the MRND was not able to, particularly in terms of ethnic relations, particularly on the grounds of its main principles.

"The purpose of the faction was to take advantage of the moderation and extremism space that was created."

Doesn't he say some of the same things that you told us in direct examination?  I mean his analysis is a little more subtle.  You told us last week that the CDR was just saying what other parties -- and I assume you mean the MRND -- were afraid to say openly?  And that's what he's saying here in his analysis.
A.	That is not the expression I used, and I think the transcripts can bear me out.

First of all, James Gasana -- I do not know on whose payroll he was.  I don't know who he worked for or whom he supported.

You see, with the birth of the CDR in February 1992, I was not a member of any of the central organs of the MRND.  I think this should be taken down, noted, and established.

When he targets Mr. Nzirorera, there must be other reasons for which he does so, probably things that came into his mind later on when he was in exile.

When he wrote his book in 2001, where was I?  I was here in prison.  And we know how things are delegated.  So when we have people who are already handcuffed, those people who were not able to say a thing in the past are now able to talk.
I was part of government at the same time with this man, but he never expressed these types of -- these types of opinions.  Why did he not raise those problems for us to discuss them within government in 1991?

What I'm telling you, therefore, is that I don't know who Mr. Gasana is working for when he writes this type of material.  Now, as for the CDR, I have told you that its ideology and platform are contained in the manifesto of this party.

I have already pointed out to you the issues that were raised by the CDR.  Namely, their position was that the Arusha negotiations were not properly conducted because they should have been organised pitting Hutus and Tutsis against each other in those negotiations.  If that is what you refer to as extremist, then it is unfortunate because the reality is there, namely, that Hutus and Tutsis exist.  And that was the problem that was meant to be solved in Arusha.   

I, therefore, say that it is not because someone was my opponent or my enemy that I would not acknowledge any valid statements that such a person would make.  I think that you are prosecuting me, but if I am right on a point, you would agree with me because I know you to have a logical mind.

Now, if the CDR talks about Hutus parastatal and Tutsis on the other hand, don't you think that I could express an opinion on that?  So this has nothing to do with extremism or moderation or what have you.

Are you saying that all Tutsis are moderates while all Hutus are extremists?  No.  Unfortunately, I cannot agree with you on that point. 
Q.	No, Mr. Nzirorera.  My statement is actually following the logic of some of what you're saying which is that there was diversity within the MRND.  That diversity expressed itself through a conservative wing where you were represented and a more reformist wing that your group usually chased out of the country and that those who weren't concerned about their political future or about decorum simply went off into the CDR and said the same things out loud that you yourself were thinking privately.

And if we go to your transcripts from last Thursday, the 20th of May, at page 40 in the English text, what you say is as follows -- and I'm quoting you here -- "What I know is that the CDR party was very outspoken in respect of the relations between Hutus and Tutsis.  The CDR spoke loud and clear what other political parties did not dare mention."
Further down on the page there's a phrase from you, "It simply said publicly what others could not say."  So now is your opportunity to explain what you mean in greater detail.

Wasn't the CDR just saying what you yourself was thinking but dared not say openly back in 1992 and 1993 and 1994?
A.	I think you are manipulating words.  I did not say that the CDR was saying what I was thinking.  I said that the CDR simply said aloud that which others did not say.  And I said that in answer to a question from Peter Robinson when he sought to find out whether the CDR was an extremist party.  So my answer was if one is deemed to be extremist simply because one is speaking loudly about what others are not saying, that might be your definition.

I don't share that point of view.  I never said that the CDR was proclaiming loudly things that I thought in my mind.  Where do you find that in the transcripts?  Can you read any part of the transcripts where I said any such thing?  Where are you getting that from?  I was speaking in French. 
Q.	Well, I mean you can tell us now.  Do you disagree with the political positions that were taken by the CDR back in 1992 and 1993? 
A.	What the CDR said in terms of what had to be done at the Arusha negotiations was an expression of its own criticisms.  I cannot say that the CDR was a perfect party in much the same way I couldn't say that of the MRND or any other political party.

Are you asking me to tell you whether I am a supporter of the CDR?  Well, I was a member of the MRND.  I was not a member of the CDR. 
Q.	Tell us which one of the CDR policies you disagreed with.
A.	The policies of the CDR were contained in its manifesto.  Now you are asking me which policies I did not agree with.  It is not for me to pass any judgement on the CDR. 
Q.	I'm not asking you to pass judgement.  I'm asking you a simple question.  Which one of the 
	CDR policies did you disagree with? 
A.	Do you want to list out the policies?  Then maybe I will tell you the ones I agreed with and the ones I disagreed with. 
Q.	I'd like to hear your testimony.  Tell me the policies of the CDR as you remember them and whether you disagree with them.
A.	I do not agree with the political orientation of the CDR in general because if I had done so, I would have opted to be a member of that party. 
Q.	Explain to us that orientation as you understand it.  That's what I'm trying to get from you, Mr. Nzirorera. 
A.	Well, you have the constitution of the CDR.  You have their manifesto.  You can read through them.  I did not learn or study by heart the constitution or the manifesto of the CDR.
So please bring the document forward.  And if you want us to go through it, we can look at it.  But don't ask me questions about the constitution of the CDR.  You can ask me about the constitution of the MRND. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I see the time.  And I think this would be a convenient moment to break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take the luncheon adjournment now.

(Court resumed at 1403H) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good afternoon, everybody. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good afternoon to you, Mr. Nzirorera.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	Now, in your responses this morning to my questions, you've stated on at least three or four occasions that you cannot be blamed for the threats against James Gasana or Désiré Murenzi because you weren't in politics at that time, you were not a minister and you were not a member -- no longer a member of the MRND central committee.  And every time -- my recollection of one of your last responses is that you were dismissed from the government.  And I'm wondering if that was what you intended to say, if that was the case.  Did you withdraw from politics or were you dismissed? 
A.	First of all, as regards James Gasana, I told you that we were members of the same government and that I left the government on 30 December 1991 while he remained a member of that government.  Therefore, I do not see how I could have threatened him.  

Secondly, Counsel for the Prosecution, I would like to remind you that James Gasana was on the list of your witnesses, that is, the list of Prosecution witnesses.  The list you gave to us mentioned 
Mr. James Gasana.  I believe you thought it necessary not to call him as a witness because I should have been able to challenge him.  So I think that you should not blame me for that.

Furthermore, James Gasana remained in government until July 1993.  I would like -- I'd like to point that out.

As regards Murenzi, I told you that when I left the MRND central committee that it was in the 
month of March 1991.  That is when James Murenzi entered the central committee.  I never sat with 
Mr. Murenzi in any meeting of the central committee of the MRND.  I do not know how that man came to know me.  I do not know where he met me.  I would like to draw your attention to that point.  

Secondly, as regards Murenzi, you said that Mr. Murenzi fled because he was about to be killed.  I would like to inform you that when Murenzi left the MRND in 1992, Mr. Murenzi did not leave the country.  Mr. Murenzi was a director of PETRORWANDA.

This clarification is very important.  When you say Murenzi fled, I do not agree with you.  Mr. Murenzi left the country on the eve of the assassination of the president in the month of February 1994.  Therefore, I would like to make this clear.

Now, as regards the clarification on the question you asked -- you don't want me to go on with the answer, Counsel?  
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, with all due respect, you've been going on for around five minutes now and I asked you one simple question, which is whether you withdrew from public life or you were dismissed.  And I'd allowed you to go on because what you have to say about James Gasana and Murenzi should interest the Chamber, but it's going on a little bit too long now.  The only point of enquiry is whether you were dismissed from government or whether you withdrew, and you answered that a long time ago.  So we'll get to Murenzi and Gasana.  

In partial response to you, you've discussed Murenzi and said that he only left the country right before the president was killed in April 1994.  The information I have, and I think you have it as well, because we did disclose his two statements, was that he left in 1992 and he was away for a while and he came back to the country and then left again, but we'll get to that probably tomorrow.

So I'd like to continue.  If you have something that you can say in two sentences, please offer it now, but otherwise let me continue.  So if you need to make a brief response, do so, but please just take a moment.  
A.	I think I'll be very brief.  And I do not want to bother you at all.  I was dismissed from the government, if that is what you want to know.  I did not withdraw voluntarily.  I was dismissed by 
	President Habyarimana. 
Q.	And you were dismissed because you were an embarrassment to the government, isn't that so, because of the allegations of embezzlement that were weighing against you? 
A.	Perhaps that is your point of view, but there were many ministers who were appointed and who were also dismissed.  In general, when you become a member of government you are told that you are being appointed for political reasons and when you leave you are told that you are also leaving for political reasons.  But the president never told me that I was dismissed because he wanted to get rid of me because I had misappropriated any funds. 
Q.	You're aware of allegations against you back from 1990 and 1991 that you were stealing money from the government.  Whether those reasons were made explicit for your dismissal or not, you were aware that those were allegations -- or those allegations were being made at the time, not so? 
A.	Who made them?  
Q.	I'm asking you if you are aware of any such allegation.  The appropriate response would be yes or no.  
A.	I was attacked by the media.  I told you that and I repeated it here.  The media accused me of all sorts of ills. 
Q.	Do you know someone by the name of Majambere, who was the chamber of commerce -- I believe he was the president of the chamber of commerce and industry of Rwanda back in 1990, 
	a Mr. S. M-A-J-Y-A-M-B-E-R-E (sic), Majambere.  
A.	I know Majambere, Silas.  He was a businessman.  
Q.	And back on the 26th of October 1990 he wrote a letter, an open letter, that was published in Europe actually in a newspaper called La Libre Belgique on the 26th of October 1990.  Do you recall that publication in particular? 
A.	I am not aware of that publication.  But all I know is that at some point in time Majambere withdrew from the country and joined the Inkotanyis. 
Q.	Well, let me place a document in front of you.  It's G1 in my bundle.  I only have it in French.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could collect it from us.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Perhaps this will refresh your recollection.  G1.  In any case, you know the newspaper Liberal Belgique, right?
A.	Yes, it was a newspaper published in Belgium. 
Q.	Well, what the document I've placed in front of you informs us is that on the 26th of October 1990 this was the allegation that was published in that newspaper, and I'll read it French:  "In his open letter published in the La Libre Belgique  of 26 October 1990 Mr. S.  Majambere, president of the 
	chamber of commerce and industry of Rwanda, accused" -- 

And then below, the second paragraph:  

"The misappropriation of 320 million Rwandan francs, about 20 million French francs, money misappropriated by Mr. Nzirorera, minister of public works, when he was in charge of construction of the road from Gitarama to Ngororero.  The minister allegedly preferred awarding the contract for the construction of the road for two companies which had nevertheless exaggerated their costs.  It did so to the detriment of companies that produced lower quotes.  

"Having been aware of this irregularity, the minister of finance refused to sign the contract.  The contract was signed by another minister, Mr. Désiré Murenzi, minister at the presidency, even though the file did not come under his authority.  As a reward for his loyal services to the republic, the 
minister of finance was sent to prison." 

Was there any truth to those allegations? 
A.	First of all, they are false.  Furthermore, if all your informers are like Majambere, then I regret that you don't know anything about Rwanda.  

Since I am here I can enlighten the Chamber.  Mr. Majambere is or was an illiterate who was elected president of the chamber of commerce by his colleagues, other businessmen.  He did not know anything on the award of public contracts.  Public contracts -- or before awarding a public contract you have to invite international tenders.  Before signing any contract there are appropriate organs that do that.  

Since you raised the question, I would now like to enlighten you, because I'm familiar with this area.  The first organ which had to make a decision was the -- was the council for the awards of contracts.  

Counsel, please allow me to speak.  You raised a question and I have to explain. 
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, your denial is sufficient.  We don't need to know the details of how public contracts are awarded.  If you say these allegations are not true, none of that really matters.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I do not want to intervene in the cross-examination, but considering the manner in which the Prosecutor couched his reproach, it is necessary for Mr. Nzirorera to give the details of the procedure for the award of contracts.  

Just the mere use of the word misappropriation in law requires that he gives his explanations.  I think the Prosecution must allow him to explain, to speak. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I would add to that that the Prosecutor did not limit himself to making the allegation.  The Prosecution went to read an article.  The Prosecution brought to your attention all the terms of the article.  And I think Mr. Nzirorera has the right to challenge that allegation, to challenge all the terms that the Prosecutor deemed necessary to bring to your attention.  I think equity or fairness calls for that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I'm more than willing to listen to Mr. Nzirorera's explanation.  My only concern is for efficiency.  My understanding is that he has denied the allegations and the evidence on the trial record is his denial.  So we really don't need to hear the details of how contracts are awarded -- are awarded.  But I'll defer to the Chamber's discretion on this issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, the problem we see is that you have launched an attack on the witness, and he's an accused person.  So we think he's entitled to respond. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no -- no -- no objection whatsoever, Your Honour.  I'm certainly willing to listen.  I was simply trying to move us ahead more expeditiously.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, I apologise for interrupting you.  Please continue with your explanation.  
A.	I also want to make progress.  But I do not want to make that progress to the detriment of my reputation and that is why I'm going to give you a picture of the reality of the facts, what led the minister of finance to prison, the then minister of finance, what led him to prison.  

So I was telling you -- well, you were talking about the procedure -- the procedure for the award of a public contract in the republic of Rwanda.  And I will be talking specifically about that contract, the contract for the construction of the Gitarama-Ngororero-Mukamira road.  

As I told you, the project was financed by international donors.  The funds were not Rwandan funds.  The funds came from international donors.  Contracts were always awarded through an international call for tenders.  And the procedure for awarding contracts had to go through the various organs concerned.  These organs were the council for the awarding of contracts of the republic of Rwanda, and that council involved at least five ministries.

On the award of a contract -- or for the award of a contract, the minister of finance had to intervene.  The minister of finance was called the awarding authority acting on delegation of authority by the president of the republic.  Then, of course, you needed the opinion of the donor before the technical ministry signed the contract.  The contract would always be visited by the minister of finance and donors.  This is what applied with regards to the invitation to tender and the award of the contract.  

For this specific project, as a matter of fact, there was an international call or invitation to tender.  And at the time the contract was to be awarded there were two companies that had been shortlisted, so that contract should be awarded to two different companies.  One of them was a Chinese company.  Another was an Italian company.  

It happened that there was a third company, a German company, which was by far the most expensive.  That company wanted to obtain that contract but by going through the chamber of commerce and industry of Rwanda.  That is how Silas Majambere said on the behalf of so-called businessmen, businesswomen, Strabahn (phonetic), well, we said that Mr. Majambere had nothing to do with public contracts and we silenced him.  

Mr. Majambere sought the adjudication or the support of the minister of finance.  The minister of finance was his friend.  The minister of finance tried to ignore -- to overlook all the technical opinions, including the contracts award council, which was immediately under his authority.  He wanted to settle the matter at his level.  

And the minister of finance was called by the -- or summoned by the president of the republic himself in my presence, in the presence of the minister of -- minister delegate at the presidency at the time, Mr. Siméon.  And the president put the question to the minister of finance, a question as to how he could object to all organs that are involved in the process of awarding contracts, even though the powers that he's exercising are the powers delegated to him by the president.  

The minister of finance, unable to explain, had to resort to another game.  And I believe that is what cost him his post.

Not having agreed with the opinion of the president of the republic and the minister at the presidency in charge of contracts, when it was decided that the recommendations of the contracts awards council should be followed for the awarding of that contract as well as the technical opinions of the 
technical ministries, the minister of finance, who represented the president of the republic, making use of his power as a governor or member of the African Development Bank, which was one of the donors, sent a telex to denounce the position taken by the presidency or the president of the republic.  

He asked -- or he asked the African Development Bank not to give a green light to the implementation of that decision, even if the decision was taken by the president of the republic or services under the president of the republic.  And that is how the president called him and told him:  Sir, know that you are a member, a board member of the bank, because I have appointed you minister of finance.

So it was rather a conflict which came about between the minister of finance and his boss, the 
president of the republic.  Mr. Majambere subsequently said that he did not understand how that it was Nzirorera who understood -- who influenced the president.  That is not true.  I simply told Majambere that he was ignorant, that he was an idiot, that he didn't understand anything, and Majambere became agitated.  And, as I told you, later on, following the attack of the RPF, he joined the ranks of the Inkotanyi.  

So what Mr. Majambere may have written -- if you have evidence, if you have proof that I misappropriated 60 million Rwandan francs, you could bring that proof or that evidence forward.  Those forms came from the African Development Bank.  You can carry out verifications.  

And in any case if you have -- if you carry out verifications, if you have informers, like this person, one would understand why your theory is unsustainable.

Mr. President, I thank you.  I tried to be brief, but I nevertheless sought to give the essential -- but I do not accept this allegation. 
Q.	In any case, going back to 1990, when these counter-allegations were launched, these were all internal MRND quarrels, right?  There's no opposition parties.  You cannot claim to have been victimised because of subterfuge by the opposition parties.  These are MRND ministers and appointees accusing you of embezzlement, isn't that so? 
A.	Which minister?  In which government was Majambere a minister?  
Q.	My suggestion to you is that all of these persons who are involved in accusing you or defending you were all members of the MRND, because this was taking place when the MRND was the single party.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	He accused me?  What did he accuse me of amongst his ministers?  
Q.	You characterise Majambere as an illiterate.  Did you mean that literally or figuratively?  Are you suggesting that the president of the chamber of commerce of Rwanda was so lacking in instruction that he couldn't do his job? 
A.	You are defending him.  He could do business.  He could count money.  That is all his business.  But as far as I'm concerned, he was an idiot, and I told him so.  If you are defending him, prove the contrary.  I know him.  You don't. 
Q.	In any case these weren't the only allegations that were made against you back in 1990 and 1991.  We can agree on that much, can't we? 
A.	Yes, I told him that when I -- told you that when I left the government and multi-parties -- him -- started to -- journalists started writing what they wanted to write.  It looks like that's what comes with democracy and I accepted the situation.  

At one point I decided to take somebody to court for defamation.  And I won the case at the 
trial chamber level and after, the appeal.  But in spite of that, with all the articles which were coming out, I could not be in the court every day.  I went to court when I was a minister.  I asked that that fellow should be punished.  But at one point in time I wanted him to be punished seriously.  

But they were doing what they wanted to do.  And that is what democracy was all about.  I let it go.  And that is not the only one.  There were many others.  If you're interested in it, you can bring all of them.  And if it can help your case, you can all -- you can tender them in as exhibits in your case.  I do not see why you're wasting time on that.  There were many articles.  That I concede to you. 
Q.	You recall that when Anatole Nsengiyumva testified, he told this Court that he was in charge of intelligence back in 1990, military intelligence.  I believe he identified himself as G2.  

I'd like us to look at another document.  This is G2 in my bundle actually and I have it in both 
English and French.  And what interests me is on the last page of the document in French, which is page 35 in the English text that follows right behind it.  

And here if we look at the cover page, which is dated the 22nd of May 1990, you will notice that it's a letter signed by Anatole Nsengiyumva and it's directed to the chief of the army.  And he's talking about his reflection on the current situation.  
And at paragraph 1 he explains that he's forwarding him a memorandum on his observations during that period.  But the paragraph that interests me is the top paragraph on the last page in the 
French text, which is, as I mentioned before, page 35 in the English text, where he says, and he's reporting on various ministries in the government: "It would appear that some workers in the ministry have for long been misappropriating state property, equipment, displacement of boundary markers, 
et cetera.  And all this became evident in the lifestyle of some employees of the ministry.  No effort should be spared to prevent a repetition of such offences.  I have deliberately avoided making mention of the case of Minister Nzirorera, who is accused by malicious gossips of embezzling state funds.  I have never believed such allegations.  Besides no evidence has been produced in support of such allegations."  

So Colonel Nsengiyumva is not crediting the rumours that are being repeated, but certainly his memorandum to the army chief of staff is reliable documentation that these were the things that were being said about you back in May of 1990, which is before the article appeared in La Libre Belgique in October 1990, all right? 
A.	Yes, it says that I intentionally avoided to raise the issue which evil tongues are accusing.  They are not saying that I misappropriated.  He says:  I have never believed it.  You can read it in French, I guess. 
Q.	Well, weren't these rumours at least?  Even if unsubstantiated, weren't these constant rumours or allegations the source of your being dismissed from government by President Habyarimana back in the early '90s? 
A.	You referred to me and said that I was dismissed.  I concede that.  But I'm telling you also that journalists write what they want.  If you want to believe them, you are entitled to do so.  

They wrote a good number of things about me, about President Habyarimana.  They said that 
President Habyarimana had -- had houses here and there.  And when he died, the wife did not even find a house.  In Greece, in Canada, they even talked about boats.  If you want to believe, you are entitled to do so.  But I -- I'm telling you that all what was said was false and nobody accused me.  Had that been done, I would have been taken to court.  No funding body complained that I took money intended for international aid.  

And then talking about corruption, nobody told me who corrupted me.  You know that is -- when there is corruption, it is not only the corrupted who is there, there are people who corrupt too.  So if you know one, bring that one to me.  

So I am telling you that they spread rumours.  It would appear that that is part of democracy, this information intoxication, and that I concede.  I'm not trying to contradict that.  I am telling you if you have all those articles and they can help you, bring them here.  But those articles do exist.  But their truthfulness remains to be established.  If you want to kill a dog, give it a bad name. 
Q.	Well, tell us, Mr. Nzirorera, what is it that led you back into public life in 1993?  Because I believe your testimony was that you were elected national secretary of the MRND at the congress that was held on July 3rd and 4th of 1993. 
A.	Yes, I wanted to do politics.  And when I was dismissed from my position as member of the 
	central committee and then I left the government in 1992, right through to July 1993 I was practically going through the desert.  I was trying to recover.  I stepped back in order to reflect and I decided to continue with politics, and that was in July 1993.  That is when I bounced back into politics. 
Q.	Well, I'd like to offer another explanation.  And I'll rely on the analysis that is provided by James Gasana in his book to support my suggestion to you.  

So if we could look at the document I circulated this morning, B1 in my bundle, and turn to page 208 in the excerpt.  I believe you have that with you already, if I'm not mistaken.  I only have a French text.  But if we start at page 208, in the first sentence, where James Gasana was your 
former minister of defence in the MRND explains that in July 1993 -- and I'll read it in French so that we have on the record exactly what he's saying:  "In July 1993 there was already pluralism within the MRND and in terms of fight for inference or voice between the conservatives and the ones who were for renewal, and this was at all the levels of the party." 

And a little further down I begin:  "At the highest level intense pressure from Akazu were on Habyarimana for him to remain at the helm of the party in order not to give the opportunity to a candidate who did not hail from Gisenyi during the presidential elections." 

Second paragraph:  "On the whole the trend" -- 

Let me start somewhere below:  "There was tension between Mr. Ngirumpatse, who was being supported to take over the party, and the Akazu, supported by those who were for a renewal.  Ngirumpatse won on the 3rd and 4th of July 1993 at the MRND national conference."  

And then the next sentence again:  "Most of the participants were aware of the intrigue that had been fabricated and showed their support.  The intrigue was very complex and those in 
President Habyarimana's circle and their allies had felt that the post of chairman of the party was going to" -- "they were going to lose that position and that they had already started fighting in the background for -- to ensure that there was some rebalancing at the headquarters of the party or the leadership of the party.  The Akazu wanted the post of national secretary to be given to an ally, that is, 
Joseph Nzirorera in particular." 

I will stop there for a moment.  I didn't mean to read as much.  But rather than paraphrase, I wanted us to have exactly what Gasana is saying.  

So what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Nzirorera, is that your coming back into politics in July of 1993 was really to be a rallying point for the conservative wing of your party; hat because Habyarimana was losing out to the more reformist wing of the MRND, you were proposed as national secretary of the party to give strength or a reinvigorated élan to that conservative wing of your party that was fumbling with Habyarimana at the helm.  Does that sound unreasonable as a suggestion to you? 
A.	Not at all.  It is false and I cannot accept it.  I would first of all like to draw your attention to this name of conservatives and progressives or reformists.  I am telling you that I do not agree with that theory.  If I am a conservative and Mathieu is a progressive, where do you put Karemera?  

We were four in the leadership of the party.  The first national secretary was Karemera and then Mathieu and then I got there in 1993.  Up to then, we held all the meetings of the party together.  If I am a conservative and Mathieu is a reformist or a progressive, what is he doing here?  

I am telling you, therefore, that Mr. James Gasana was a member of the national committee of the MRND.  If he had these problems, he should have raised them in the party and they would have been discussed there.  It is to show you that this gentleman is not serious.  He took advantage for reasons that I'm not aware of when he was abroad.  I do not know what his purpose or intention is.  He wrote everything he wanted to make himself look good.  So I do not accept that.  

Mr. James Gasana should have raised that -- or these problems at the level of the party, because he was one of the members of the party.  He was your witness.  If you took these -- these things seriously, you should have brought him here so that he should face us.  It would have been more logical.  Now you -- now you're speaking yourself.  Where is Gasana?  I would like to see him and face him.

1445H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So is it your testimony that you and Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera were on the same wavelength, that you agreed with each other in terms of the party policy?  Is that what you're telling us? 
A.	In any case, I told you that I chose the MRND party because as far as the ideals of that party and I liked the leadership of that party.  So I'm telling you that we led that party together.  If we did not 
agree -- or anybody who was not happy should have left, and we stayed together up till today.  We always held meetings together.  We always led the party together. 
Q.	And you were agreed on basic party policy; is that right?  
A.	The principles of the MRND, peace, unity and development -- peace, unity and development, we agreed on that.  If you want to talk about something else, you're on your own. 
Q.	Well, let's look at the last paragraph on page 209 from that same series of -- that same discussion by James Gasana.  And I'll read that as well in French.  

"The victory of those who are for change at the helm of the party is shared between the progressives who are -- who have the presidency and the conservatives who have the national secretariat.  Members of Akazu and their clients are feeling sort of defeat and do not see how they're going to exercise control over the party.  

"However, this congress will be the last show of democratic new deal within the MRND.  In fact, the election of somebody who is close to the Akazu in the post of the secretary general will make it possible for the allies to actually completely leave out the party.  The national secretariat will henceforth operate without taking into account the opinions of the organs of the party.  Nzirorera will therefore be -- inherit from Habyarimana at the head of the party and not Ngirumpatse, who is the true heir."
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, should we now accept that all the communiqués I tendered which said that it was -- it was the meeting of the political bureau of the MRND, so what is written in it is false, that I was acting without consulting the other members of the steering committee or the central organs of the party?  I would have liked James Gasana to come here so that I can put questions like those to him.  So I do not accept what you're saying here.  And all James Gasana told were tall stories.  He must have reasons why he wrote what he wrote, but I do not agree with them at all. 
Q.	All right.  We have your response.  But -- and let me clarify for you, I am not adopting the entirety of Gasana's analysis.  I am suggesting propositions to you, and we have your answers in relation to those questions as the evidence on this trial record.  So I've asked you the questions, I've read you the passages, I have your response to them, and the Judges can consider it afterwards.  

But nonetheless, my suggestion to you is that you were the candidate of the Akazu, of the conservative wing of your party, and you were called back into public life to engage in the political struggles that were going on within your own party and to give a boost to the most conservative elements of the party.
A.	Any Rwandan was free to be a candidate, so I decided to be a candidate.  You can say that I was the Akazu candidate.  And who was Mathieu a candidate for?  Who was Karemera a candidate for?  Who elected these people?  So those are the questions you should ask yourself before you say we were elected.  So who elected me?  

Now you say that the conservative wing had already lost.  So who elected Nzirorera?  How was I elected, since all the people of the progressive wing, or so-called progressive wing, were there?  How could I have 80 per cent of the votes during that congress if the conservatives were losing and I was coming there to boost them?  Those are questions that you should put to yourself before you put that proposition to me, and I do not accept the proposition. 
Q.	In any case, let's get back to a topic that we had paused with a bit from this morning, and this concerns the analysis of Nkiko Nsengimana.  
MR. WEBSTER:
	And I would direct us all to document number B2 in my bundle at pages 14 to 15.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And I believe you have that before you already.  And again this is only available to us in French.  

And here I'm going back to my suggestion to you this morning of the major thrusts or the major poles on the political stage in Rwanda in 1992, 1993 and 1994.  So let me read you passages of what 
Nkiko Nsengimana has written, and then you tell me what you think of his analysis.  Under section 2(a) in the middle of that first paragraph, and I'll read in French:  

"As it was said earlier, the MRND, the RPF, the MDR are political -- political parties which are hegemonic and they are in competition."
A.	On what page?
Q.	Page 14.  And under 2(a), the first paragraph, second sentence:

"As earlier mentioned, MRND, RPF and MDR are hegemonic and competing political parties.  They are the three main poles of attraction in the political game.  All the alliances are going around these 
three political areas."
A.	Mr. Webster, what paragraph did you read?  I'm on page 14.  Are you talking about 2?
Q.	There is a 2(a), and then that first paragraph under 2(a) is where I've been reading from.  But you've heard it twice.  We don't necessarily have to read it again.
A.	I've found it. 
Q.	And what I'm suggesting to you is Nkiko Nsengimana talks about the MRND, the FPR and the MDR being the three political currents.  And to be even more summary or more vulgar in -- with the analysis, or more direct, what I'd suggest to you is that the MRND was representing the north, the FPR was representing the Tutsi, and the MDR was representing the south.  Those were really the 
political currents that gave rise to the violence in 1994, the competition between the north, the south and the Tutsi; the northern Hutu, the southern Hutu and the Tutsi.  

Isn't that so?  It's not a subtle analysis.  It's a very gross analysis.  But really that's what it comes down to.
A.	I don't believe it.  You do.  You are entitled to that. 
Q.	Well, let's continue with what Nkiko Nsengimana is saying.  And here I'd refer you to the last paragraph on that same page.  And he's going to tell us a bit about the MDR and the domestic political opposition in Rwanda.  And I'll read in French again:  

"The third pole, a central one dominated by the MDR, is not armed.  That is the pole of the 
democratic forces for change, comprising, in addition to the MDR, the PSD and the PL.  It's partisan of the strategy of peaceful political competition, whereas war is a political asset for the two -- or for the 
	first two poles."  And they are referring here to the RPF and the MRND.  

And he continues:  "For the non-armed pole, as long as the war continues it is a major handicap which prevents it from emancipating itself, hence its decision to favour negotiations which incontrovertibly will give them a supremacy over the MRND and the RPF."
A.	And the question?
Q.	Let me continue.  The third paragraph on that page:  

"In short, it could be posited that but for the MRND pole as well as for the RPF pole, the main adversary is the FDC pole, in particular the MDR, who are seeking to weaken and cause a dysfunctioning.  And they will succeed in doing that in order to impose a situation where the actors will be reduced only to two.  For the FDC pole, the main adversary is one of the actors of the military pole who, depending on the situation or context, would be stronger."  

So my question to you is:  Doesn't that analysis describe the situation that you were confronting as a politician on behalf of the MRND back in 1993? 
A.	I do not agree with you.  First of all, you should know that the FDC declared themselves to be 
RPF allies.  They never hid the fact that they also had their forces who were RPF soldiers.  Therefore, the analysis made by Mr. Nsengimana, whom I note to be very close to the MDR, I do not believe in that analysis.  In other words, you want to say that MDR problems were caused by the fact that the MRND undertook steps to dislocate to cause some dysfunctioning among their ranks.  You saw the rivalries that existed within the MDR.  
When these people fought Mr. Nsengirange (sic) and Twagiramungu for the post of prime minister, well, each of them wanted to be included in the Arusha Accords as the prime minister.  Mr. Prosecutor, does that mean anything to you?  When Mr. Twagiramungu -- during the Kabusunzu congress the 
political bureau, the members of the congress met and excluded him from the party, dismissed him from the party, did the MRND play any role in that congress?  

Rivalries in MDR cannot in any way be attributed to the MRND.  There were internal rivalries that ruined the MDR as well as the PL.  I am categorical about that.  Mr. Nsengimana can write whatever he wants.  He can make analyses according to his views.  I would not take those views into consideration.  The reality is what I have told you.  You were told stories.  But if you believe them, bring them here before this Court.  We are here.  We were political actors.  We are going to question him.  He's hiding.  They hide and they write from their hiding places.  

He was your witness.  You put him aside, and you are coming to defend his theory here.  This is unacceptable. 
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, your own witness, Eliézer Niyitegeka, that you called before this Tribunal came into this courtroom and said the same thing.  

If I recall accurately, his testimony was that the MDR was splitting because your president, Habyarimana, empowered the minority wing, even though he disagreed with it.  The minority wing composed of Twagiramungu and Uwilingiyimana, who were recognised as being pro-RPF, were supported by the president.  And that wing was empowered through the Arusha Accords, which caused a split in the MDR, which was ultimately to your advantage in the MRND.  

That's the clever politics that were being played back in 1993.
A.	Counsel, I value -- who should we believe, you or Niyitegeka?  You accuse us of having supported what was referred to as the MDR power.  Eliézer says that Habyarimana and the MRND supported Mr. Twagiramungu.  My question is -- you are not compelled to answer:  Who should we believe?  Who should we not believe?  

The letters that they wrote, did you find an MRND signature on any of those letters?  When they went to negotiate in Arusha, they included the name of Twagiramungu in a constitution.  Did you ever see a constitution anywhere in the world which bears the name of a prime minister?  Even if the president's name is not in the constitution?  

It is not the MRND who suggested that Mr. Twagiramungu -- that his name be included in the 
Arusha Peace Accords, which accords were going to become the constitution.  Come on.  
So I believe that people should assume responsibility for what they did.  If you are a man, if you are a politician, if you are on the political scene, you should be willing to accept responsibility for what you did.  These people did not want to accept their responsibility.  They made a pact with the devil, and when they had the consequences of that pact they turned around and said, "Well, it is said to be the MRND and the president, Habyarimana, who are the cause of our problems."  That's not possible.  We were observers.  We never had problems.  
Q.	Who was it that included Twagiramungu's name as prime minister designate in the Arusha Accords? 
A.	You don't know that?  The head of the Rwandan delegation was the minister of foreign affairs.  He was an MDR member.  It is not the MRND that was piloting the negotiations here.  
Q.	My suggestion to you is exactly what Eliézer Niyitegeka said when he was testifying before this Chamber.  President Habyarimana conspired or agreed with Twagiramungu to give him his support so that he could be the designate with the ultimate consequence that the MDR party, which would have been the strongest force politically, was split.  Your own witness said as much.
A.	Yes.  I agree with you.  But I would also like to tell you that it is strange to hear that witness say that President Habyarimana supported Twagiramungu, who is close to the RPF -- who was closer to the RPF than the RPF itself.  In fact, that pleased me.  
Q.	The bottom line is that both the MRND and the RPF needed an alliance with the FDC, with the 
Forces démocratiques de changement, which was the grouping of the opposition parties.  The RPF could not run things by itself.  The MRND could not run things by itself.  Either of those 
	two protagonists, the armed protagonists, could only prevail politically to the extent that they had an alliance with the opposition parties in the middle, which was the Forces démocratiques de changement, which was dominated by the MDR.  

And it was the clever politics of Habyarimana that split the opposition parties into a Hutu power wing and a pro-Arusha wing.  Isn't that so?  
A.	That's not true.  That is so wrong.  It is completely, totally wrong.  The FDC made a pact with the RPF.  That was on the 3rd of June 1992 in Brussels.  

Now, whether or not there were problems within the FDC, the reasons are known.  The reasons are known.  You cannot dismiss them within a single sentence that according to which it was Habyarimana who was behind that.  We know the men.  We know the people involved.  You do not know them.

First of all, people did not agree on the true objectives of the RPF because of its multiple attacks and ceasefire violations.  They went to Brussels.  They reached an agreement.  They said that they had agreed on a ceasefire.  And the following day the RPF surprises them with an attack.  
You can read that.  That was on the 3rd of June.  The first letters issued by the MDR dated 
1 June -- well, 3 June 1992, where they condemned these acts.  They condemned the meeting of Brussels.  The MDR members themselves condemned the meeting of Brussels.  

Secondly, internal rivalries which happened, there were problems.  People were fighting or vying for positions.  Habyarimana had no role to play in that.  He was just an observer.  The MRND withdrew and allowed the allies to solve their problems amongst themselves.  When the allies did not agree, you cannot say that it was the MRND who was responsible for the disagreement.  When they went to meet in Brussels, they went discreetly so as not to inform the MRND.  I'm sure that you are aware of that.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, I'm not suggesting that President Habyarimana or the MRND was involved in brokering an alliance between the FDC and the RPF in June of 1992.  Let's consider things in a proper context.  My only suggestion to you was, back in July of 1993, as you were moving closer and closer to the final Arusha Accords, that it is at that point that there was some collusion that led to the split within the MDR.  

But if we're focusing our attention on June of 1992, which is where your last response was directed, clearly the MRND was very threatened by any alliance between the MDR, the PL, the PSD and the RPF, so frightened, in fact, that that led you to form your own alliance overtly with the CDR just 
three or four months later.  Isn't that so? 
A.	I will answer your question in two phases.  I will begin with the last part of the question.  First of all, the alliance between the MRND and the other parties -- the four other parties was not reached in 1993.  It was reached in November 1992.  Therefore, since you want to talk about the period of '93, this is what I have to say.  This was to --
Q.	I'm not talking about 1993.  I'm talking about 1992.  That's where we -- that's where our conversation is headed now.  You were telling us about the alliance of the FDC and the RPF in June of 1992, and my suggestion to you is that alliance was so threatening to the MRND that you embraced, in a very public way, the CDR, which was clearly an extremist party.  So focus your attention to the events of late 1992.  
A.	At least you should admit that in politics alliances are allowed.  Do you admit that?  You may answer or not answer.  But in politics alliances are accepted.  Today, you could ally with X and the following day you change your opinion and ally with Y, with someone else.  At least we should agree on that.  If we agree, then I continue.  If you do not agree, you will tell me why you do not agree.  
Q.	We're not debating with each other, Mr. Nzirorera.  Clearly, in politics alliances are permissible.  So give us your response or your reaction to what I've just -- to my previous suggestion to you.  
A.	Your suggestion, according to which we created alliances because we were threatened -- well, you can find an ally.  Recently, in elections in Great Britain you saw how people moved here and there to form a government.  At least there they carried out elections.  

In Rwanda, there were -- we didn't even have elections in order to know the political weight of each political party.  Therefore, people could ally with whoever they pleased or chose.  If we decided to form an alliance with four other political parties, we could've done so, just like we could not have done so. 

When the CDR slammed the door in 1993, we didn't bother.  Similarly, the people of the RPF -- or the people of the FDC didn't have to bother or didn't have to be ashamed when one of their members tried to denounce the balance -- the political equilibrium that was struck here in Arusha, because it is this problem of political balance which ruined everything.  
Q.	You would recall that -- even if you were not present on the 15th of November 1992 -- that rally in Ruhengeri was the occasion by which Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced your formal alliance with the CDR.  Isn't that so?  The alliance -- the formal alliance between the MRND and the CDR was announced on the 15th of November.  The document that we have in evidence that memorialises that alliance -- that alliance is dated the 11th of November 1992.  

Both of those things are matters that you're aware of, even if you were not present on the 15th of November.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Yes.  I was aware of that alliance which was reached on the 12th November 1992.  And as you say, Mathieu declared it during his speech in Ruhengeri, a speech that I read and which I have.  So I agree with you on that point.  
Q.	And that rally on the 15th of November 1992 was also the occasion in which President Habyarimana made his notorious speech where he characterised the Arusha Accords as scraps of paper, and promised to dress up his Interahamwe and go with them down to the grass roots in the south.  
(Inaudible)...it doesn't quite translate exactly in English, but he was going to go down with the Interahamwe; right? 
A.	I do not agree with the distortion that you are making.  The speech by President Habyarimana was given in Kinyarwanda.  He never talked of scraps of paper.  I think you should endeavour to render things as they were said.  So on that we will never agree.  You can continue speaking.  I will never believe you.  

Secondly, when the president talked about the Interahamwe, he was referring to election campaigns.  The manipulation which followed his speech -- the manipulation that was done in the prime minister's letter dated 17 November 1992, it is there where you have the Gordian knot of the problem.  That is where you have the problem of the interpretation of the president's speech. 

And you, yourself -- you took over that misinterpretation and you -- you made your witnesses testify to that against all professional ethics.  I cannot accept that.  
Q.	In any case, regardless of how we interpret Habyarimana's words on that date, we can agree that his speech making public reference to the Interahamwe was viewed with restoring legitimacy on the Interahamwe by the president and by your party in November of 1992.  Surely that much you can agree to.  Not so? 
A.	Yes.  The Interahamwes were MRND members or militants.  The president talked about them.  Mathieu talked about them.  Casimir Bizimungu also talked about them.  I do not see where the problem is.  He never said that those people -- that is, the Interahamwe, should go and kill.  
Do you have a passage where the president -- Habyarimana said, "Interahamwe, go and kill"?  Do you have any document where Casimir Bizimungu said, "Interahamwe, go and kill"?  Or where Mathieu said, "Interahamwe, go and kill"?  
Q.	And by November of 1992, the Interahamwe already had an international reputation for being killers and for committing violence against the Tutsi and against the political opposition.  Isn't that so? 
A.	I do not know what you mean by international reputation.  But the fact is that the Interahamwe movement was strongly attacked by the opposition, and there was reason.  So they were demonised.  I was demonised, yet I was not an Interahamwe.  But I was a member of the MRND.  
Q.	And then the following week on the 22nd of November 1992, Léon Mugesera made his notorious speech in Kabaya; right? 
A.	I heard about it.  I was not there.  And I believe Mugesera appeared before this Court.  He testified and he gave explanations.  
Q.	You've read the text of that speech, haven't you, even if you weren't there to hear it as it was given?  
A.	I saw the text.  I have a version.  I have -- I saw several versions.  Some people say the speech was not recorded.  Others say it was recorded.  What is now the true version I do not know.  I think I am not 
well placed to explain or interpret what Mr. Léon Mugesera said.  
Q.	Well, you do understand Kinyarwanda, the language he was using when he made that speech.  
A.	Yes.  But I am telling you that he himself said that what was presented was a manipulated version.  
If -- if that is what you want to confront me with -- even though the author of the speech refuted it, denounced the manipulated version -- I will not be helpful to you.  
Q.	Well, let's review a passage from that speech that we already have in evidence.  It's P. 254 in evidence.  It's document C8 in my bundle.  And I'm looking at page 8 in the English text.  

And at one point Mugesera says:

"I recently told a so-called PL militant that the mistake we made in 1959...was that we allowed them to get away scot-free.  

"...your country is Ethiopia and we are soon going to dispatch you back to your country via the 
River Nyabarongo on an express journey."

I think it was that line -- or that was one of the lines in the speech that generated most of the concern.  How many different ways are there to interpret that passage? 
A.	I do not have any interpretation to give.  First of all, I was not there.  That is the first point.  Secondly, the author is free and I am in prison, even though I was not there when the speech was made.  And thirdly, you had the opportunity of questioning him.  I do not have to add any comments on what he said.  
Q.	He goes on at the end of the speech -- and this is at page 10 in the English text -- again, it's still document C8, which we have in evidence as P. 254, warning his -- the people that are listening to him.  And he says:  

"Remember that the person whose head you have not yet cut off is the one who will cut off yours."

How many different ways are there of interpreting that last parting word from Mugesera? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I would like to tell you that, if those words are -- had to be true, they should be condemned in all -- in every respect.  That is my position thereon.  

So if, really, the words attributed to Mugesera were spoken by him on 22 November 1992, those words should be condemned.  I, therefore, cannot support them.  I would not agree with that, if, indeed, what is alleged is true.  

But when he appeared before this Court and gave evidence, he said that, first of all, his speech was not recorded, that it was manipulated.  That is what I know but, otherwise, I would have -- I would agree with you if indeed he said those words.  
Q.	Well, what we have in evidence, Mr. Nzirorera, is a text which, I think, was also used in his trial in Canada.  And we also have a transcription of the recording as it was replayed.  I believe it was either in April or May of 1994 while the country was in the midst of war and genocide.  

So we have two different texts, both essentially saying the same thing.  So I don't know how Mr. Mugesera can dispute the recording that we have or the transcriptions that were made of the recording.  But what we have just reviewed -- those two passages are the most alarming passages in the speech, but for our purposes I don't think that they are the most important.  

What I'd like to you do is look at what we have as page 7 in the English text, which is page 5 in the French text, and I'm going to hand that up to you right now.  And it's the passage that has never garnered that much attention in the discussions of Mugesera's speech, but for our purposes I think this is really where we need to focus our attention.  

So look at page 5 in the text that I'm handing up to you now, which is again at page 7 in English of document C8, and it's the first full paragraph in the English text.  And since we have it in both languages, I don't need to read it into the record.  But bear in mind that Mugesera is making the speech on the 22nd of November, which is after the first series of protocols from the Arusha Accords have been signed.  

And what he's saying is that the Rwandan delegates that were negotiating the Arusha Accords do not represent Rwanda.  The Rwandan delegates, presumably to the Arusha Accords, to the negotiations that generate -- that resulted in the Arusha Accords, some of which have already been signed. 
The most recent protocol to have been signed when this speech is given is the protocol of the 30th of October 1992 on power-sharing; the most critical protocol in the Arusha Accords.  

And what he says:  

"...those Rwandan delegates you hear of do not at all represent Rwanda.  They are representing the Inyenzi instead, and they themselves are Inyenzi."  

It goes on to say:  

"Inyenzi go to Arusha to dialogue with other Inyenzi, that's the long and short of it.  It is these same disguised agents of the Inyenzi who were going to Brussels not long ago who are going to Arusha today to continue plotting.  None of all what is said in Arusha is coming from the Rwandan government.  Know, therefore, that what people are calling 'the Arusha negotiations' today, is an internal affair of the Inyenzi and, naturally, it is only binding on the Inyenzi.  That is the situation, but it does not mean that we are refusing to negotiate."

Isn't that the critical issue, Mr. Nzirorera?  Your party never really supported the Arusha Accords.  
A.	I would, first of all, like to tell you that, when Mugesera was speaking in Kabaya, he was not speaking on behalf of the MRND party.  He was not at all committing the MRND party.  I would like to make that clear.  

Secondly, I would like to tell you that I read attentively the judgements that were delivered in the Mugesera trial -- or the decisions in that trial in Canada.  I realised that all the jurists or judges do not agree on the importance and strength and severity that should be ascribed to the utterances made by Léon Mugesera.  

On the contrary, as I told you, if what Mugesera said -- or rather if that is what Mugesera said, 
then, as I told you, that should be condemned.  I wonder why it is to me that you are putting this now, as if I am the one who has to answer for what Mugesera said on that day, even though I was not present when he said it.  So that is my position on this point.  

Furthermore, I told you that, in 1992, Mugesera gave his speech.  He fled.  No one saw him again.  I do not know what is happening today with him.  I realise his -- I realise that his speech has been brought here today, even though none of us -- no one amongst the three of us was present when he made his speech.  
Q.	Let me direct your attention away from Mugesera the person and from the more alarming comments that are usually invoked when people discuss this speech, and let's focus on the passage that we just reviewed together and on its contents, not on its alarmist emotional overtones.  

Do you think -- you, Joseph Nzirorera -- that when the Arusha Accords were negotiated -- the protocol on power-sharing was negotiated back on the 30th of October 1992 -- was the MRND party in support of those protocols on power-sharing? 
A.	Yes.  Because by accepting that the institutions be democratised, and by also accepting that the party be reformed, furthermore by accepting the formation of a coalition government, the MRND and President Habyarimana were in favour of sharing power.  This is a matter of principle.  

Now, the manner in which matters went -- if that manner was the subject of some criticism -- today -- or, perhaps yesterday I told you that criticising something does not necessarily mean that you are rejecting that thing.  No.  Otherwise, negotiations would not even have meaning.  

Someone could make a proposal, and he would tell you, "Well, this proposal is to be accepted or to be rejected."  We were part of those sharing negotiations -- power-sharing negotiations.  Some people even sought a lion's share, even though they were not represented in the population, and we always criticised that.  

So I must tell you and confirm to you that we were in favour of the Arusha protocol.  We supported the idea of sharing power, but, of course, power didn't have to be shared anyhow.  So I want to reconfirm this publicly.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I -- I see the time, and I think we can pause at this juncture and return to this topic tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We will take our adjournment now.
