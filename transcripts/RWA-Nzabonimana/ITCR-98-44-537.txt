MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday the 25th of January 2011, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your evidence continues this morning.  Mr. Weyl will continue your examination.  
MR. WEYL:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours.  I greet all present in the courtroom.  

Mr. President, I would like to specify that this morning I will be continuing the examination-in-chief, and in the course of this morning it may be possible for me to hand the baton to Ms. Hounkpatin, who would then continue with part of the examination-in-chief.  I just wanted to bring that to the Chamber's notice.  
MATTHIEU NGIRUMPATSE,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl.  When you hand the baton to Ms. Hounkpatin, she will be carrying it to the finish line?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I may have to handle part of the examination-in-chief towards the end.  I believe Ms. Hounkpatin will deal essentially with the period subsequent to the 6th of April 1994, and it is possible, quite possible, that I take up the exercise later on to deal with some questions of a general nature and additional matters.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	How are you this morning?  
A.	Relatively well.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, let us continue along the lines of questioning that we had begun.  And I think yesterday we mentioned the testimony of Witness AWD.  Allow me to quickly revisit that testimony in which AWD stated that:  "When the RPF battalion was at the CND, it was said that that battalion could capture the city.  And so the MRND went on to organise youth who had received training in Mutara or elsewhere so that they can assist soldiers of Camp Kigali and Camp Kanombe, as well as the gendarmerie, and other persons in order to provide security for the city."  AWD goes on to say that:  "It was in order to pool forces in order to exterminate all the Tutsis who were in Kigali town without any difficulty."  

Did the training he refers to in his testimony, as far as you know, take place?  
A.	No.  Yesterday I dealt at length with this matter, and I really would not like to revisit it, in order to avoid wasting the Court's time.  The simple answer is no.  
Q.	Witness GOB makes similar allegations, referring to training in Kigali, first of all, in a building belonging to Kabuga, and then in Muhima, and then in military camps and on Mount Kigali, Mount Jali, in Rutongo commune, at the Gako camp.  And goes on to say that:  "Interahamwe allegedly received military training at the Mutara."  And then specifies that because of his duties he was able to receive information about Interahamwe having participated in that training.  Nzabanterura, for example, Claude Nshimiye, N-S-H-I-M-I-Y-E, being some of such persons.  What is your reaction to that?  
A.	It is still the same answer.  We had a witness here who did not corroborate GOB's testimony, and this witness was Nzabatura (sic).  He did not corroborate GOB's testimony.  
Q.	It was GOB's testimony that the parties decided to mobilise reservist soldiers and members of the Presidential Guard to train Interahamwe.  What is your reaction to that?  
A.	Same reaction; it is false.  As far as I know, no member of the party contacted those people.  And, by the way, reservists generally are within the orbit of the army, so to speak, and they cannot just be mobilised in any manner.  
Q.	GOB went on to say that there were reservists and soldiers in office who wore Interahamwe uniforms.  He claimed that in each secteur those soldiers provided training for the Interahamwe up until 1994, when roadblocks were set up and those who were deemed to be Interahamwe also put on military uniforms at some point.  What is your reaction to that statement by GOB?  
A.	I am not aware of that, but allow me to say something about the part of his testimony relating to the Interahamwe uniform.  There was no such thing as the Interahamwe uniform.  The kitenge fabric which was displayed in this trial was not for the youth only.  It was a fabric for all party members.  
Let me add that the fabric was produced as part of the activities of the 15th anniversary of the one -- or, the single party, MRND.  And you may want to recall that there was an inscription on that fabric "1975-1990, 15th anniversary of the MRND".  As far as I know, and because of the events at the time, including the advent of multiparty politics and the war, that anniversary was never celebrated.  

So this fabric was borne by all persons, it was worn by party members, and so there was no uniform as such for the Interahamwe.  You see, maybe because they didn't have anything else to wear, some youth may have put on that fabric more often at that time.  

So I am not aware of any particular fabric that was earmarked as Interahamwe uniform.  We viewed a video here, and we noticed that many party supporters, including old persons, women and men alike, were wearing that fabric.  And I would like -- that is the only point, Mr. President, I wanted to make in relation to that fabric.  
Q.	Thank you.  Let us proceed with the witness statements by Prosecution witnesses.  

Witness G claims that in 1993 a meeting allegedly held between yourself and opposition parties which were experiencing some problems, and during that meeting you allegedly asked members of the MDR Power, particularly Froduald Karamira, whether he could send a few MDR youth to receive similar military training as was being given to the Interahamwe.  What are your remarks to that?  
A.	Once again, this is a fabrication.  I could not have made any such proposal to the MDR.  The only person of the opposition who came to my residence -- and, again, I must draw the Court's attention to that point -- is Landoald Ndasingwa.  He came on the day of the funeral of Rwambuka.  He came to my house because he -- there were problems within the Liberal Party, and he came to seek advice from the MDR -- or, rather, from the MRND to solve the problem.  

I think that we all know Mr. Landoald Ndasingwa, may his soul rest in peace.  That is the only person from the opposition who came to my house to deal with some political problems.  He came in the evening; we spent at least one hour together discussing political matters.  That is the only figure, political figure of the opposition who came to my house.  So any other narration is a pure fabrication.  
Q.	Witness XBM testified before this Trial Chamber and claimed that in January 1994 he was invited to the Mutura communal office, where training was being provided for youth at that location.  He alleges that weapons were distributed.  Question:  Are you aware, or were you aware of any such training for youth at the Mutara (sic) communal office in 1994, in January 1994?  
A.	Is it Mutara or Mutura?  
Q.	Okay, Mutura.  
A.	Mutura is in Gisenyi préfecture.  No, I am not aware of that, and this is the first time -- it was in this Tribunal that I heard mention of that for the first time. 
Q.	Witness AWE alleged that towards the end of 1992 or in early 1993, the Interahamwe chairman in his area allegedly showed him a circular signed by you and addressed to all secteur responsables, the subject of which was to issue certificates of good conduct to youths of various secteurs in order to enable young Hutus to be selected for military training.  Did you write any such circular?  
A.	No.  No, no.  Never.  If I had ever drafted any such letter, a copy would have been found in the archives.  I know, as I mentioned before, that our archives were seized, all our archives.  

And so, in addition to that, let me say that I could never have undertaken any such action without the approval of administrative authorities, because if such a letter had existed it would have been channelled care of the préfet and the bourgmestre.  So I never wrote any such letter.  It is false, it is absolutely false.  
Q.	Maybe I have already raised this question from another angle, but let us look at what UB says in relation to the matter on which I seek your comment.  UB claims that after the 1993 MRND congress -- or was it 1992 -- the Interahamwe dispatched to Gabiro and Gako military camps for military training.  He went on to say that later on he understood that the MRND leaders had provided training for young Interahamwe with a view to preparing the killings.  What is your reaction to that statement by Witness UB? 
A.	The statement is false.  The statement is entirely false.  
Q.	Before concluding on this issue of training, Mr. Ngirumpatse, training for MRND youth -- maybe we will revisit that issue when we will be talking about Turatsinze.  I want to draw this to the Court's attention, because this is a more specific issue.  I felt that some additional or follow-up questions should focus on Turatsinze subsequently.  

Before we move on from this area of Interahamwe training or Interahamwe -- or, training, rather, for youth of the MRND, I would like you to confirm what you referred to yesterday.  We have distributed to all parties the document that was written by General Nyilimana (sic), which you referred to yesterday, "Critical observations on Alison Des Forges's book".  And with the assistance of Mr. Issa, I would like that document to, once again, be placed before you.  

Do you now have that document, Mr. Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Is that the document you referred to yesterday during your testimony?  
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	Would you please point out, for the benefit of the Court, the aspects you referred to when you talked about General Ndindiliyimana's conclusions to the effect that he was not aware of military training for MRND youth or the M -- the Interahamwe za MRND.  
A.	I am trying to locate the excerpt, and I think I am there now.  It is on page 7 of the document, at the top of page 7.  With your leave, I could read that excerpt.  I could read out the excerpt:  

"During that same period, the commander of the Kibungo gendarmerie squad, Major Havugiyaremye, had sent a telegram to the general staff and to all units of the army and the gendarmerie, pointing out that he had learnt that buses transporting the Interahamwe had gone through Rwamagana from Mutara for the purposes of military training.  I ordered the said officer to conduct an investigation into the matter.  He submitted a written report stating that policemen for guarding the park had been receiving training.  

"This matter, which had raised a lot of dust, was subsequently studied in the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  There was no military camp between Gabiro and Kigali.  The camp being referred to is a gendarmerie camp, and the commanding officer was a gendarme.  I personally took steps to request that a report be submitted, and a written report was submitted along the lines of what is mentioned above.  

"Your version of the facts on page 176 is simply a matter of extrapolation that seeks to support your thesis of planning by the entire state apparatus."  

This is the paragraph I was referring to.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Going by that document, I believe that it is already in evidence as D. K14 -- D. K14 in another trial.  That is what I seem to understand from the first page of that document.  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct, and the case is ICTR-99-98-T.  That is the case number.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did General Ndindiliyimana confirm to you the authenticity of this document?  
A.	Yes.  He even issued an affidavit in support of the authenticity of the document.  
Q.	Is that affidavit the document -- is that affidavit part of the document before you, the cover page?  
A.	Yes, it is.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to produce this document and the appended affidavit.  I would like to produce that into evidence, D. NG195, I believe, with Mr. Issa confirming.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning to everyone.  Good morning to the Court and to the parties.  

Your Honours, I did discuss this document with Mr. Weyl yesterday, and he indicated to me that he wanted to move it into evidence.  And I'm not going to object, but I am going to comment.  

There really is no evidentiary basis to admit the document.  It's essentially a witness statement that was written in 1999 after Dr. Des Forges published her book, and it's Mr. Ndindiliyimana's response to some of the analysis in Alison Des Forges's book.  It's not a contemporaneously generated document from 1994 or before, it's not the type of document that we usually admit in evidence during the direct examination of a witness.  

But in view of the fact that we've already admitted three other out-of-court statements by General Ndindiliyimana, the Prosecution doesn't seek to prevent the court from having access to this information.  And I will make reference to them.  It's D. NZ833, which was an out-of-court statement after the events that was admitted by the Nzirorera Defence team; and P. 477 and P. 512, which were documents used by the Prosecution on cross-examination.  

So with that proviso, the Prosecution will not object to this document, but I will indicate to the Court and to Mr. Weyl that we also have a few documents by Ndindiliyimana that we'll be using in cross-examination.  So I hope that it's not going to be a problem when the Prosecution also attempts to offer other evidence from Ndindiliyimana, who could have been a witness for the Defence if Mr. Ngirumpatse so desired.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG195 admitted) 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And I want to thank Mr. Webster, too, for indicating that he actually does support this approach, because he, too, will be producing similar evidence.

One last word, Mr. President, at this juncture, in relation to training.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	And, once again, I want to talk about Witness AWE who -- talking about the 12 young Hutus whose moral conduct he had to certify.  He stated that he had seen them aboard an ONATRACOM bus, and he learned that they had gone to Gabiro camp for military training, spanning a three months period.  

Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, at this juncture, what is your reaction to this statement by AWE?  
A.	I refute the entire statement, and reject it.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, let us turn to the issue of distribution of weapons, which the Prosecutor charges you with in his indictment.  Did you order, authorise, facilitate, issue instructions for weapons to be distributed to the Interahamwe in 1993 or 1994, as spelt out in the indictment and supported by some Prosecution witnesses?  
A.	No.  The only activity involving arms is what I stated yesterday relating to the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe and the ministry -- and the minister of defence.  Yesterday I said that the purpose of the distribution was not to kill, but was to provide protection, personal protection for members of the national committee.  And that is all.  Otherwise the indictment does not contain any iota of truth in that matter.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did you participate in the clandestine importation of arms during 1993 to nineteen -- to April 1994? 
A.	No.  
Q.	For your answer to be more complete and exhaustive, did you participate in the clandestine importation of arms before 1993?  
A.	No, I did not.  Not before, not after 1993.  In any event, I do not see what interest I would have had in involving myself in such an issue.  There was a minister of defence in place who could have handled -- or, who should have handled that kind of transaction.  So I do not see what interest I would have had in involving myself in that transaction -- or, that type of transaction.  
Q.	Did you hide any arms or issue instructions for arms to be hidden at the headquarters of the MRND, or at any other location under the supervision of the MRND, or of officials or members of the MRND?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Were you informed of the distribution of arms by anyone whosoever to the youth of the MRND?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you use resources and the logistics of the ministry of defence of the Rwandan armed forces, and of -- the services of the ministry of territorial administration for the distribution of weapons to youth organisations belonging to political parties or to other members of the population? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you order or facilitate the dissimulation of firearms that were hidden in order to avoid any seizures of the said weapons by the UNAMIR upon arriving Kigali? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, let me turn to a number of statements or testimonies by Prosecution witnesses who claim that the contrary actually took place.  

According to UB, most Interahamwe bore firearms, whether it be those he saw at roadblocks or those he saw moving about on the road.  According to his testimony, they were carrying rifles, guns, and he claims to be sure that these weapons came from the MRND.  What is your reaction to that?  
A.	His statement is a fabrication because he makes assertions about things for which he has no evidence, claiming that they came from the MRND.  

Secondly, I wonder why somebody who was in a position of authority would see people moving about with weapons and not do something about it.  That is quite paradoxical, isn't it.  So I don't believe his testimony.  
Q.	He alleged that there were no other sources apart from the MRND from which those weapons could be obtained, and that it was the ministry of defence that was the source of those weapons, and that the MRND worked together with the said ministry.  What are your comments on that testimony?  
A.	That is a gratuitous assertion.  He has no evidence for what he says.  It is just speculation; that's all.  
Q.	He insisted and went on to state that 600 guns received by Turatsinze were deposited in the highways department that was located in Kigali.  That it was therefore the brother-in-law of Habyarimana who was in charge of that unit, and that subsequently the weapons were taken away and taken to Kuyimana (sic), in the house of Kubwimana, Silas, who was an MRND official in Taba commune.  What are your comments? 
A.	I am not aware of all those operations, and I will go further:  Clearly what he says is false.  I say so in view of the position he occupied; I would be surprised he would allow all of that to happen, or not tell anyone.  
Q.	Now, let us move on to Witness G.  Witness G stated that well before the distribution of weapons during the second half of 1993, there was a distribution of firearms at the ministry of defence -- or, rather, a distribution of firearms by the ministry of defence to the population that were being attacked by the RPF.  What are your comments?  
A.	I think I have elaborated well enough on that point.  It was in the préfectures of Gisenyi and Byumba.  That is a reality, but that was under the control of the government.  I pointed out that the firearms in question were used at night during the patrols, but that they would be deposited in commune offices in the morning.  I also stated that the RPF, its supporters as well as opposition parties, had claimed that those weapons had been withdrawn.  I admitted that; it is a matter of public knowledge.  It is official.  
Q.	Witness G claims to have obtained that information from Colonel Rutayisire, and according to the information he obtained, 5,000 weapons were distributed in préfectures of the north for the personal protection of the population.  Do you confirm that?  Does it appear to you plausible?  
A.	Regarding the number of weapons, I cannot confirm that.  I did not follow up the matter.  As for the facts, yes, because the war was taking place in the north, the guerrilla warfare waged by the RPF was taking place in the north.  So I agree with that; that is a matter of public knowledge.  But as for the number of weapons distributed, I do not know.  Rutayisire was a soldier, he was even in charge of external security. 
Q.	Witness G, after mentioning those weapons, stated that about 800 guns were given by MINADEF, and the MINADEF was headed by the member of the MRND, that those weapons were given to the chairman of MRND, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Is that correct?  
A.	Completely false.  It's completely false, I repeat.  
Q.	According to Witness G, after the 800 guns that were handed out there was a meeting between Dallaire and the minister of defence.  During that meeting Dallaire made it clear that UNAMIR was going to carry out a search, and that on the basis of that information you were alerted and you took steps to hide the weapons in anticipation of the search.  What is -- what are your comments on that?  
A.	That is completely false.  It doesn't indicate that I was in that meeting together with Dallaire and the minister of defence.  And I do not think that he himself was invited to that meeting between Dallaire and the Rwandan minister of defence.  Therefore that evidence is based on rumour.  Otherwise -- or, rather, I would add that what he says, his testimony, is completely false. 
Q.	Nevertheless, Witness G asserted that you summoned some members of the Interahamwe provisional committee to give them that information, and that you underscored that whenever there will be a search conducted by UNAMIR you should -- or, you will be warned or alerted by the chief of staff of the gendarmerie, and that, in that manner, the Interahamwe would be informed in advance of any search so as to enable them to move the weapons.  What do you say to those allegations?  
A.	The allegations are completely false. 
Q.	When Witness T says the same thing, more or less, he adds that you warned him by cautioning him and by stating that those who will be negligent and who will be caught during a search should not count on you or on the party.  What do you say about that testimony given by Witness T?  
A.	It is a false testimony.  
Q.	Once again, according to Witness T, Turatsinze and Kajuga distributed weapons to the Interahamwe around the month of December 1993.  According to the same witness, the distribution of weapons was carried out under the coordination of Matthieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera, as well as the army.  The said weapons came from the Rwandan army.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Once again, the testimony is false.  
Q.	Witness HH testified that he noticed that there were weapons at the headquarters of the MRND party, because shortly after the death of the president of the republic a certain Georges Rutaganda gave firearms to some Interahamwe members.  At that point, continued the witness, he, Rutaganda, understood that the weapons which had just been given out to the Interahamwe had been taken from weapons stored at the party headquarters.  What are your comments -- what are your comments on that testimony by Witness HA (sic) regarding the storing of weapons at the headquarters of the MRND party?  
A.	I never saw weapons at the MRND headquarters.  So that testimony is false.  
Q.	Witness AWE makes reference to the indirect -- indirect testimony of Jean Habyarimana who, that is Jean Habyarimana, told him in 2004 that in 1993 the MRND party ordered weapons from Europe, that some of those weapons were distributed to Interahamwe, and furthermore, that that could not have been done -- that could not have been done without the approval of Matthieu Ngirumpatse.  So, what are your comments regarding the testimony of AWE, and testimony which he attributes to Jean Habyarimana?  
A.	I am categorical:  This story of the importation of weapons by the party is completely false.  That testimony is completely false.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, the Prosecution called *************************, *******************.  Do you know the said *************************?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you know him before he came to give evidence before the Court here in Arusha? 
A.	It wasn't possible for me to put a name to his face, but since I was counsel for the -- the enterprise he was working for, I may have come across him without knowing him.  In fact, I really would say I knew him when he came here at the Tribunal.  
Q.	************************* said many things concerning you, not only regarding matters of weapons.  But before going to the issue of weapons, I would like to have come clarifications from you.  

According to *************, according to his evidence given before this Chamber, he said that he met you many times during the construction of a house, a house belonging to Denis (sic) Niyonizeye, N-I-Y-O-N-I-Z-E-Y-O (sic).  He said that you were the person in charge of paying for the construction of that house, and you were also in charge of giving orders, or directives regarding the construction of the said house.  What do you say to that?  
A.	That is false.  I know Mr. Niyonizeye for having worked with him at the embassy in Germany, in Bonn.  But he -- I was never involved in the construction of his house.  Certainly he had other people who would have taken better care of the construction of his house.  So that testimony is false.  
Q.	According to *************************, he was attacked by the Interahamwe around February 1994, or around that period.  And he stated that he came to meet you in your law practice, in your office, on that occasion to ask you to intercede for him.  What do you say to that?  What is your recollection regarding that allegation?  
A.	It is a false allegation.  
Q.	Once again, according to that witness, you wrote and handed to him a letter intended for a certain Aminadabu Buhake -- A-M-I-N-A-D-A-B-U, Buhake, B-U-H-A-K-E -- to give instructions regarding those attacks.  Did you ever write such a letter?  
A.	I do not remember having written such a letter. 
Q.	Still according to the same witness, the same Aminadabu Buhake wrote to you a report.  Did you receive any correspondence at all whatsoever from Aminadabu Buhake? 
A.	I became aware of that correspondence here at the Tribunal.  But whilst in Rwanda I never received such correspondence.  I don't remember having met such correspondence in my office at the headquarters of the party.  No, I never received that correspondence. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, **** *************************told this Court that he wanted to help one of the members of the Office of the Prosecutor, who was a member of his family, by providing that member of the OTP evidence.  Do you remember that statement given by *************************? 
A.	Yes, perfectly, I do.  Of course, I can also see his cousin who was sitting behind him on the Prosecution side of the court.  But that person disappeared and never returned to court.  But, otherwise, I remember that evidence.  I can still see the picture -- I still have a picture of the courtroom where he was sitting.  I have a picture of -- in my mind of the courtroom where he was sitting.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, counsel for the Prosecution sought to disclose to us documents made available to him by *************************.  I do recall the extreme caution exercised by the Prosecution.  The Prosecution -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Before Mr. Weyl even completes his question, I take objection to it.  I suggest that he be more precise in how he's putting the issue to the witness with regard to this specific matter.  

My recollection is that ************* identified or suggested other persons who could make available certain information to the Prosecution.  It was not coming from *************himself.  He was -- all ************* did was identify other persons who may be helpful to the Prosecution in its investigations.  

So Mr. Weyl can modify his question if the way I've put it is correct, or he can direct me to the transcripts where the information, as he put it, is documented.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it is not a passage of the court records that I'm referring to, but I'm rather referring to one of the will-says prepared by the Prosecution, seeking to disclose to us the documents he had received from *************************.  In that hearsay (sic) the Prosecution itself mentioned the fact that the said documents seemed to him to be highly suspicious.  

I would simply like to confront Matthieu Ngirumpatse with document number D. NG50.  This document is one of those documents which was given, in photocopy form, by ************************* to the Prosecution team.  And I would like Mr. Ngirumpatse to comment on that document.  That is document number D. NG50.  

Mr. Issa, perhaps you should pick up this document and show it to the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I've looked at D. NG50, and it's -- it's in evidence, clearly.  It's a letter reportedly written by Mr. Ngirumpatse that was put in evidence by the Ngirumpatse Defence team around this issue that we've been addressing, but I don't think Mr. Weyl has addressed my concern, the concern that I voiced earlier, in terms of how he's couching this information.  So if -- if he could address my concerns, or if the Court could rule on the matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, hasn't he rephrased the question already?  Hasn't he, in effect, withdrawn the question and moved on?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That wasn't my understanding, but if that's the situation we can move forward.  

MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I did not understand what you said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It seemed to me that after Mr. Webster made his submission you moved on to another issue, or attempted to approach the matter in a different manner.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President, I want to Mr. Ngirumpatse be given document D. NG50, which is the first annex, annex 1 to the will-say statement, the will-say statement through which the Prosecution disclosed to us documents received from *************************.  And I would like Mr. Ngirumpatse to make his comments on this document, that is document D. NG50.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My objection is to Mr. Weyl suggesting that these documents came from *************************.  They did not.  That was the whole point that I made earlier.  So if Mr. Ngirumpatse could give me the date of the will-say, I'll look at it.  But, as of this moment, I'm still objecting to the way that Mr. Weyl is putting the issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
During whose testimony was the document admitted?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not quite sure.  (Microphones overlapping)... was through ************* testimony.  There was information that the Prosecution received in its investigations based on information from another person, from other persons that ************ had suggested to the Prosecution that they consult.  And we determined that the information was false.  And since it raised Rule 68 issues, we disclosed it to the Defence in a will-say statement.  

But the way that Mr. Weyl is dealing with the issue, he's suggesting that this information, which we recognised was false, came directly from our witness, *************, which is not the case.  ************* suggested other persons who the Prosecution should interview, those other persons provided information that the Prosecution determined was false, and we disclosed it under Rule 68.  

But I -- my -- my suggestion to the Court is that Mr. Weyl is misrepresenting the issue in the way that he's putting the question to the -- Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So that's my concern. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the three documents -- the three letters attributed to Matthieu Ngirumpatse, one of which has been entered into evidence as D. NG50, were disclosed to the Prosecution as an annex to a will-say dated 6 June 2007.  We have the trans -- the French translation of that document as 5706 et seq.  And precise reference is made in that document to correspondence, including D. NG50, and I would like Mr. Ngirumpatse to tell the Court whether he recognises himself as the author of this document.  

Perhaps, to simplify matters at this stage, it would suffice for Mr. Ngirumpatse to have before him document D. NG50, and he should tell the Court whether he is the author of this document.  
THE WITNESS:
Can I answer, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
THE WITNESS:
I'm not the author of this document.  Neither the writing nor the signature are mine.  I have a letter which also was the subject of a lot of discussion.  That letter is mine, it is my writing and my signature.  The comparison of the two letters would easily show that I have nothing to do with this document.  The signature is too grotesque, the writing is totally different from mine.  I have nothing to do with this document.  I do not know this document.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, would you be someone who would -- who would mister -- who would misspell, sorry, his first name?  
A.	No, my first name I have been writing it since I was a child with two Ts.  Two Ts.  M-A-T-T-H-I-E-U.  That is how I spell my first name.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, at this stage, what are your comments on this document, that is, document D. NG50? 
MR. WEBSTER:
At this stage I'm going to object again.  I don't understand the purpose of this line of questioning.  The Prosecution has never maintained that this document came originally from Matthieu Ngirumpatse.  The Prosecution disclosed this document under Rule 68 because we thought it was false.  So what is Mr. Weyl trying to get at by having Mr. Ngirumpatse comment on a document which we acknowledge is inauthentic?  The reason that the document surfaces in this trial to begin with is because we disclosed it under Rule 68 because we thought it was false.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
I have taken note, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, let us come back to what *************************says regarding your implication or involvement in the arms trafficking, arms that came to complement the weapons you received from the ministry of defence. *************** testified that he often saw you in the office of what is referred to as Établissement rwandais, and that subsequently he learned that you were a lawyer or a counsel for "Établissement rwandais".  Does that allegation more or less tally with reality?  
A.	It is true that I was a lawyer for Établissement rwandais.  It is also true that I usually went there when the boss of that enterprise needed my advice or counsel, yes.  
Q.	************* claimed before this Court that some day -- or, one day, whilst he was climbing up to the office of the manager of Établissement rwandais, Mr. Bandali, he heard you speaking to Mr. Mandali (sic) asking him where he was with the order.  And that Bandali replied you that he was waiting for the next step.  What are your comments on this conversation between you and Mr. Bandali overheard by the witness? 
A.	The allegation is false for the good reason that I never had to order anything from outside through the Établissements Bandali.  So the allegation is false. 
MR. WEYL:
I would immediately like to apologise to the courtroom reporters for having forgotten to spell Bandali.  B-A-N-D-A-L-I, Bandali. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness ************* stated that Établissement rwandais allegedly was used as a cover for importing arms.  He goes on -- or, he went on to say that towards the end of 1993, one Dudule Rahamatali, D-U-D-U-L-I (sic), R-A-H-A-M-A-T-A-L-I, who used to work with him, allegedly gave him information relating to a shipment of arms which arrived by aircraft at the Kigali airport through an aircraft or an airlines known as Romanian Airlines, Romanian Airlines in the plural for airlines.  And that the said craft, Romanian Airlines had unloaded huge crates at the airport, and that one of such crates had dropped and split open, and that he saw firearms in the said crate.  What are your comments on that statement, statement by Witness *************?  
A.	That is a statement that is slanderous and false.  I had no interest to be involved in any such thing.  Établissements Bandali works with a number of ministries, with many ministries, they repaired their vehicles, and they could have dealt directly with the government and not with me.  So the statement is entirely false.  In fact, it smacks of a rare kind of wickedness.  

I do recall other prior statements in which it was claimed that I offloaded the plane with an MRND vehicle, a 504 in which I drove around with my driver, my usual driver.  How can one offload a planeload of such huge crates and boxes in a small 504 vehicle?  Maybe if one used a lorry that could happen.  But with a small car, I don't see how physically that could have been.  

And, by the way, how much time could such a plane have been parked at the Kigali airport waiting for those crates to be offloaded?  It would have taken a very naïve craft owner, or businessman, to immobilise a plane for four to five days simply to have its cargo offloaded.  

So this is testimony that is pure fabrication.  
Q.	According to *************, Dudule is said to have shown him a document bearing a list of the arms, and he had told him, that is *************, to keep that information as a secret.  But Mr. ************* corrected himself later on, testifying that the list was actually a list of spare parts.  What is your reaction to those statements, the one made after the other?  
A.	I think it is all a figment of his imagination.  That is the only conclusion I can come to.  
Q.	************* also claimed that Dudule allegedly told him that it was pursuant to your orders, and those of one Bosco Sezirahiga -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If counsel would please slowly spell out the name, it would help the interpreters, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the interpreters have requested you to spell out the name.  
MR. WEYL:
Pardon.  Sezirahiga is spelled S-E-Z-I-R-A-H-I-G-A.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Sezirahiga was the boss of a transport company known as TAC, T-A-C.  What do you know in that connection?  
A.	It is also false. 
Q.	Did you have any business transactions with Bosco Sezirahiga involving the importation of spare parts for Établissement rwandais or for any other client? 
A.	No, never.  
Q.	According to Dudule, when the arms were offloaded they were sent to Kimihurura, to the residence of one Ndindiliyimana.  And I think reference is being made here to the house of General Ndindiliyimana.  And that the said weapons were subsequently distributed to Interahamwe officials, particularly those in Gitikinyoni, in Muhima and elsewhere, as well as to Habyarimana, the president's sister, known as Godelieve.  What are your comments on that statement?  
A.	That is a false statement, and I have a small additional remark.  Sister Godelieve came to testify here.  The Trial Chamber heard her testimony on this matter.  Let me also comment that as ************* testimony developed, he put all his evidence on Dudule.  And, you see, Dudule is no longer alive, and witnesses can avail themselves of that situation to ascribe everything to Dudule.  So the testimony is false, and I was never involved in any arms importation transaction of that nature.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Ngirumpatse, after having relied indeed on Dudule's statements, ************* sought to corroborate them by testifying that he had driven Dudule to the airport after having heard the things that he had mentioned, and that ************* himself saw about 10 boxes of four cubic metres each near a Romanian airlines plane.  And on which boxes was written "spare parts for Établissement rwandais".  Once again, what is your reaction to that testimony?  
A.	I cannot say that he did not see any boxes for Bandali on which was written "spare parts".  I can't say anything about that.  But what I refute is that those boxes would have contained imported arms with my involvement.  That is entirely false.  

Let me further add that a pilot of a similar craft came to this Trial Chamber and explained that boxes of that size could not have been shipped in that type of plane.  As a good pilot, and as a professional, he explained that this was not possible.  So it is all a fabrication.  It was not possible.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, maybe you were not involved, maybe you did not issue any instructions, but did you become aware that weapons or arms were clandestinely imported using a Romanian airlines plane in 1993, or even in 1994?  
A.	Never. 
Q.	To conclude on Mr. ************* testimony, he goes on to say that, with the outbreak of the war, he had opportunity to visit a number of houses, and states that he did so with RPF soldiers.  And he said that he got to Rwabukumba, Seraphin's house -- R-W-A-B-U-K-U-M-B-A -- in Kiyovu, opposite the gardienne school in that neighbourhood, and that he saw soldiers at that house taking boxes of weapons which resembled those which, according to him, he had seen at the airport.  And that is where, according to him, he was able to confirm that firearms had been distributed here and there.  There were boxes, wooden boxes on which it was written "spare parts Établissement rwandais".  

What would be your last remarks on this matter?  
A.	I am convinced 100 per cent that this witness lied.  Let me simply remind the Trial Chamber that this witness, before this very Trial Chamber, during his testimony, acknowledged that the -- he had been in contact with Captain Karamba -- K-A-R-A-M-B-A for Karamba, Captain Karamba -- who was the head of the intelligence service and in charge of security or -- with the RPF battalion at the CND in Kigali.  This very Captain Karamba is implicated in a case against the RPF, and I simply want to say that we must look at this witness's testimony with a lot of care and caution.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, do you know one Turatsinze?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Can you tell us the Turatsinze whom you know, who he is? 
A.	The Turatsinze I know is Abubakar Turatsinze, alias Kassim.  That is the name under which he registered when he became a member of the MRND, and at the time of his employment.  I employed him on the request of Mr. Faustin Munyazesa, who was then minister of -- minister of the interior -- Munyazesa, M-U-N-Y-A-Z-E-S-A -- Munyazesa, who was then the minister of the interior.  He had just lost his position as a driver and had come to look for a similar position.  And, yes, indeed, there was a position for a driver, and he was hired.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court at around what period he was recruited?  
A.	It was in 1992 when I had just been elected national secretary.  Unfortunately, I do not remember the date and I do not remember the month.  
Q.	Did he perform any other duties apart from being a driver of the MRND during his tenure as driver with the MRND?  
A.	No, no.  He was a member of the party, he was part of the staff of the national secretariat of the MRND, and was therefore also used for quick delivery of messages.  And I do recall that at the congress of 3 July 1993 he was assigned to work at the reception.  And he used the vehicle he was driving for certain purposes at the time.  So, in short, he was a member of the party and he attended party activities, just like any other member of the party.  
Q.	Did he have an office?  Did he have some space at the MRND headquarters?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, to wrap up on that particular question:  Witness HH testified that he met Turatsinze in his office at the MRND headquarters.  What is your reaction to that statement -- testimony by HH?  
A.	One has to be very cautious when considering HH's testimony.  This statement is false; he did not have an office.  
Q.	According to some Prosecution witnesses Turatsinze was in charge of coordinating the activities of the Interahamwe.  Is that correct?  
A.	No, not at all.  You see, the Interahamwe had their own committee in place.  So he was not in charge of anything whatsoever.  Let me recall that Turatsinze's educational background went only as far as primary school.  He could not even speak French.  And maybe we will get to the point.  Maybe there is another Turatsinze, but he is different from this one whom I know.  I believe that we will get to that point at some point when we deal with Turatsinze.  
Q.	Some Prosecution witnesses also argued that Turatsinze was your right-hand man.  What do you say to that?  
A.	That is false.  How can a driver be somebody's right-hand man, that is, the right-hand man of the national secretary of a political party?  
Q.	Some witnesses also stated that he was your liaison officer, and that he was in charge of transmitting your instructions to the leaders of the Interahamwe, to the Interahamwe themselves.  What do you say to that?  
A.	That is false.  I have already testified that Witness T was a worker at the commercial bank.  I also mentioned that Robert Kajuga stayed not far away from me in Kicukiro, and so I did not need any liaison to reach the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe.  They knew where to -- they could reach me, either at the minister's office or at the national headquarters or at my residence.  

So I did not need a liaison officer.  I had a telephone at my disposal.  They, too, had their telephones, and all these persons could have contacted me whenever they needed to.  So it was not necessary for me to have a liaison officer.  And even if it were to be necessary, you see, one would then be saying that I was working on a daily basis with all these people and members of the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe, and that is not true.  
Q.	Do you know when Turatsinze stopped working for the MRND, and in what circumstances -- what circumstances did he stop working for the MRND?  
A.	It was in November 1993.  He was dismissed, dismissed under circumstances relating to his past.  In 1992 I had given him money to hand over to someone.  He did not hand over that money.  This was a $100 note.  He took it for himself.  And I sanctioned him, I suspended him, and even deducted his salary.  So this was a clear case of -- of swindling.  

And so when Joseph Nzirorera became the national secretary he did exactly the same thing, and that is how he was dismissed.  And it is under those circumstances that he was dismissed from the national secretariat of the MRND.  And the national secretary at the time notified me accordingly.  So from November 1993 he no longer had access to the national secretariat of the MRND.  I thank you, Mr. President.

1030H 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, would this be a good time for the break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It's 10:30 now.  We take our mid-morning recess.
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1053H)
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, we were discussing Turatsinze, Abubakar.  Do you know one Turatsinze, Emmanuel? 
A.	No. 
Q.	According to Witness G, it is one Turatsinze, Emmanuel who used to work with the MRND who was in charge of liaison between the president of the MRND and the Interahamwe.  According to Witness G -- rather, is what Witness G saying correct? 
A.	No.  That is not correct.  To start with, I do not know Turatsinze, Emmanuel.  And, furthermore, I do not know of the existence of any liaison officer between the national secretariat of the Interahamwe and the -- of the MRND and the provisional committee of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	That witness's testimony is specific to the extent that between '93 and '94 he alleges that 
	Turatsinze, Emmanuel was the intermediary between Matthieu Ngirumpatse and the Interahamwe whenever there was need to exchange information between Ngirumpatse, Matthieu.  And whenever Ngirumpatse had not seen number one -- number one being reference to number one on the Prosecutor's list -- then he would use Turatsinze (sic) to locate Turatsinze.  He would use number one to locate Turatsinze, who worked for the MRND at the MRND office in Kigali.  What are your remarks to that testimony by the witness? 
A.	All of that is false.  You see, Turatsinze was a driver.  Now, if we were to convert him into a 
	liaison officer, that would be an entirely different ball game.  So they are simply trying to fit that individual into the Prosecution case. 
Q.	Witness T and other Prosecution witnesses make, more or less, the same accusation claiming that Turatsinze -- and this time bearing another first name -- Jean-Pierre -- Turatsinze, Jean-Pierre was on the payroll of the MRND national bureau, and that his duties entailed collecting all questions or matters raised by the Interahamwe and transmitting them to the general secretary of the party.  He also was in a position to convey instructions from the national secretary to the Interahamwe and report to the national secretariat accordingly.  And that would have been reporting to you because you held that position at the time.  Is this testimony correct? 
A.	All of that is false.  I heard mention of that first name, Jean-Pierre, after Dallaire had narrated his fable or story.  What we knew -- or whom we knew to be our driver was called Turatsinze, Abubakar, 
	alias Kassim.  He was not a Christian.  He was Muslim.  So all these issues, I am convinced, were matters that were simply fabricated to prop the Prosecution case, and it is all false. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Turatsinze -- and in this case Jean-Pierre -- is in fact the cornerstone, the very crux of the case made in Witness Claeys' testimony.  C-L-A-Y-S (sic).  Do you recall Witness Claeys' testimony before this Trial Chamber?  

And before we even delve into that testimony proper, can you give us your comments on the statement, and can you say a thing or two about how that testimony tends to rely, more or less, exclusively on Turatsinze.  
A.	I am very convinced that Claeys simply heard what he wanted to hear.  Going by his testimony and his duties and his position -- and the position of his government, one can only say that he made an irrational use of the situation that obtained in Rwanda at the time.  

I wonder what this would have meant.  Because if he had wanted to act within the movement, he could have simply gotten some arms and dropped them in the secretariat of the party if UNAMIR were to go with that. 

You see, this is what I can say as a general statement on Claeys' testimony.  I thank you. 
Q.	According to Witness Claeys, up until the 10th of January 1994, UNAMIR was not in possession of any information establishing a link between the Interahamwe, the MRND and the army, and that it was only through intelligence from Turatsinze that such visible connections or linkages were established.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Maybe we need to discover how Turatsinze was introduced to UNAMIR.  It was by the opposition.  Let me recall that Minister Gasana was a member of the opposition, and on the 9th, even before UNAMIR became involved or informed, he had issued a press release through an interview challenging the Interahamwe for exterminating the opposition and not Tutsis.  It is from that time on that Twagiramungu, who was the prime minister delegate, a member of the opposition, linked up with UNAMIR and then introduced Turatsinze to them. 

The documents available also point to the fact that Turatsinze had links with an agent within the headquarters of the MDR.  So, as you can see, all of these things are fabrications, and they are false. 
Q.	How can you explain the fact that Witness Claeys was able to lend credence to such information that was gathered from his informant, Jean-Pierre Turatsinze, and to appropriate such information to the extent that it became part and parcel of his own testimony before this Trial Chamber? 
A.	There may be several reasons for that, and allow me to give you some background.  First, I wonder whether we are talking about the same Turatsinze.  

General Dallaire in his book refers to Jean-Pierre as if it were a code name, a code name used by Dallaire in the book, and has subsequently become the password -- first name.  But maybe there is a Jean-Pierre Turatsinze and that person is different from the Turatsinze we are talking about, because it would seem that this very person convinced UNAMIR that he was an officer of the Rwandan armed forces, that he was an officer of the Presidential Guard, that he had received training in Egypt and Libya, that he was a soldier, that he was a trainer of the Interahamwe, that he was a high-level or senior trainer of the Interahamwe.  And this is according to what we find in Dallaire's book. 

So is there anyone here who can tell me whether we are talking about the same Turatsinze?  Can someone explain to me that responsible officials of UNAMIR did not check the authenticity of the identity of their informant and yet this information could have been obtained quite easily?  If somebody claims that they are an officer with the Rwandan armed forces or with the Presidential Guard and that they went on military training in Libya and in Egypt, that must be somebody who would have a rank.  

But no one asked him what his rank was.  Nobody asked him where his residence was.  Nobody asked him which unit he served in.  No.  He simply claims that he was a soldier, that he was a senior trainer, and everyone believed him.  

You see, we brought a witness, we called a witness here to tell us who Turatsinze was, and this person who was hired as a driver.  So I believe that we are not talking about the same person here. 

The Turatsinze I know was a driver.  He did not speak French.  And in all these transactions, there is no reference made to the presence of a -- an interpreter between Colonel Marchal, Dallaire, Claeys, and what have you, in all their communications.  So there is something that is not clear.  And my belief is that this was a fabrication and some UNAMIR officers simply wanted to build a case against Rwanda. 

And, by the way, the conduct of UNAMIR throughout the months and years subsequent do prove that these people were committed to the RPF, for all intents and purposes.  Those are the explanations I can offer. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I have so many questions I want to ask you, but as I read through them, I notice on each occasion that Witness Claeys asserts that he received information from the said Jean-Pierre Turatsinze to the effect that the said Jean-Pierre Turatsinze was a senior military trainer of the Rwandan armed forces, of the Interahamwe, and also testifies that distribution of weapons to the Interahamwe had started in December 1993.  Reading through all of that, my question then is:  Is it Witness Claeys who testifies that he cross-checked something, or are these the words of Turatsinze being used by others?  

When Claeys states that he received information from Turatsinze, what is your reaction to that? 
A.	I have already testified that Jean-Pierre -- Jean-Pierre, the, should I say, infamous Jean-Pierre -- but I am referring to Turatsinze.  The Turatsinze I know no longer had access to the national secretariat from November 1993 when he was dismissed.  

Now, when Colonel Claeys -- I believe today he is a colonel.  When he asserts that arms existed, he did not see anything.  He simply said that he and the other captain, Captain Deme, went to the MRND headquarters.  They did not get in.  Captain Deme himself did not testify, and Claeys himself did not see anything whatsoever. 
Q.	Claeys claims that he received information from Turatsinze whereby Turatsinze received 
	150,000 Rwandan francs from the MRND on a monthly basis in order to provide training for the Interahamwe.  Did Turatsinze receive 150,000 Rwandan francs from the MRND on a monthly basis in order to train the Interahamwe? 
A.	Is it possible to pay someone who has been dismissed from the coffers of the party?  That would not have been possible.  Why would we have been paying somebody who was no longer working?  And yet the national secretary, Nzirorera at the time, never received any salary.  The two vice-presidents and president of the -- chairman of the party -- all three, actually -- never received any salaries because they simply volunteered their services. 

Whenever we needed resources, we would raise funds from well-to-do members of the party.  So we could not raise those funds and use them to pay such a person. 

150,000 Rwandan francs was about 1,500 US dollars.  No one earned that kind of salary at the time except maybe the president of the republic. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	I repeat my question, and I am sorry for jumping in too fast. 

Did Turatsinze provide training for the Interahamwe free of charge? 
A.	Well, that is not my position.  He did not train anybody.  So it is as simple as that. 
Q.	Witness Claeys testified that Turatsinze told him that he received equipment from government forces which he used to control demonstrations.  Were you aware of this testimony or relating to what Turatsinze said and put forth by Witness Claeys? 
A.	Well, I do not see how he could have been useful in controlling or checking demonstrations.  Whenever there were any rallies or meetings, what was required was, first of all, an authorisation from the préfet.  So the préfet who issued such an order at the same time requisitioned the services of the gendarmerie to provide security.  

It was not those rallying or having such meetings who were in charge of providing control.  It was the gendarmerie or the police.  So how could it then have been possible for any rally or demonstration to hold without the use of the gendarmerie and hoping that the rally would be controlled by one individual?  How could we -- how could it have been possible to trust -- or to entrust that type of operation to one individual, be it Turatsinze, be he the soldier, or be he the genius that he claims to be?  So that is entirely false. 
Q.	According to Witness Claeys, Turatsinze claimed to have had direct access to you and to receive instructions directly from you.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That is false.  That also is false.  When the national secretary informed me -- or, rather, when I left the national secretariat, I no longer had any contact with the staff.  

Now, when I went to the office, I said hello to people; I went into my office; I looked at my mail.  And in that office I chaired meetings of the steering committee and the executive committee, and then I would go away.  I was not in charge of the daily running of the party.  So that was impossible. 
Q.	According to Witness Claeys, Turatsinze allegedly told him that if any further attempts were made to organise a swearing-in ceremony on the 15th of January 1994, there would be an onset of unrest and that people would have six hours to close their shops and all buses and taxis would be parked or, otherwise, defaulters would be punished and their premises will be burnt down and their vehicles would be destroyed. 

According to Claeys, Turatsinze was referring there to measures taken by the Interahamwe in order to paralyse the city.  Were you aware of any such plan or any such measures or steps that were taken under your authority and involving Turatsinze or placed under his control? 
A.	No.  I am not aware of that.  But just in order to understand things, we need to refer to what Colonel Marchal said when he testified, that Turatsinze may have been an RPF agent, and that he was using intoxication tactics to create discord between MRND and the UNAMIR. 

There was no reason for us to provoke unrest.  The swearing-in ceremony had been programmed, and we were looking forward to it.  

I have already testified to the Trial Chamber that in the morning of the 6th April, the steering committee had had a meeting with the cabinet of the president's office and called for the swearing-in to take place on the 8th of April.  So when the director of cabinet was going to the airport to receive the 
president of the republic, he was going to raise -- or he would have raised that question with the president and a radio communiqué was going to be issued mentioning the date of the swearing-in. 

Now, anything other than that is pure fabrication designed to cause unrest and to sow seeds of discord and amounting to intoxication. 
Q.	Once more, according to Claeys, Turatsinze told him that he was able to provide a complete and exhaustive list of all Interahamwe who had received military training amounting to some 2,000 persons who were in Kigali, and this list was never published.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Unfortunately, I am not in a position where I could raise questions.  My question would have been:  If he had such a list, why did he not disclose it?  Why did Claeys not seek to obtain that list?  Did such a list really exist?  
Q.	Claeys also talks about information from Turatsinze whereby from the time of the arrival of UNAMIR, he trained 300 people over sessions of three weeks each in Rwandan army camps for a total of some 17,000 men broken up into groups of 40 and located in Kigali.  According to him, from the time of the arrival of UNAMIR, he received orders to draw up a list of all Tutsis in Kigali. 

And Claeys goes on to add that Turatsinze allegedly told him that he feared that the purpose was to proceed to the extermination of the said Tutsis.  

Your comments.  
A.	I have already made my comments on the fact that given his training, Turatsinze was not in a position to provide military training for anybody.  Because of his level of education, he could not have been in charge of military training. 

But let me counter this point by referring to his own very testimony, because Turatsinze testified that he worked directly with the chief of general staff, General Nsabimana, spelled N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A.  He was the chief of general staff -- unfortunately, perished in the plane with the president because they were on that flight together. 

I have already testified that on the 30th of March 1994, General Nsabimana had already expressed concern about lack of protection for the city.  He actually convened -- he requested that a meeting be convened of the area commander, the préfet of Kigali-ville in order to seek ways and means of providing protection for the city. 

Since Turatsinze claimed to have been working with the chief of general staff, why would the chief of staff not have relied on those 17,000 men, who add up to a battalion, to use for that purpose?  If he had distributed weapons, why would he have referred to the use of traditional weapons at that other meeting, because there were no firearms?  

So you know and we know that one of the reasons for the defeat was the lack of arms and ammunition.  So I do not at all believe any word of what Turatsinze -- or is it Claeys? -- is narrating in this matter. 
Now, as for the list, everybody has talked about a list of Tutsis to be killed.  But that is false.  That is entirely false. 

Captain Claeys, as he then was, used this as an -- as the cornerstone of his case.  It was an essential document for UNAMIR, and it should have been a document that should have been in their possession, that they would use to convince the international community as to what was transpiring.  

Why did he not seek to obtain that list?  No, he did not.  What they did simply was to disseminate rumours within the context of propaganda, and people ended up believing to the extent that it was claimed that there was a planning of the genocide.  That was part of the RPF plan, a plan which has now been further supported by false accusations.  

So that is what I can say.  There was no list.  And I want to say again that General Nsabimana would not have been concerned about protection of the city of Kigali if he had been aware that there were 17,000 men, trained men in Kigali town. 

What he simply would have done would have been to use those men, provide more sophisticated training and deploy them.  So I do not believe at all in Colonel Claeys' testimony to this Trial Chamber. 
Q.	Still according to Claeys, Turatsinze allegedly told him that 122 Interahamwe had been trained by Israelites in Nyungwe forest, N-Y-U-N-G-W-E, and Gishwati, G-I-S-H-W-A-T-I.  Your brief comments on that point, which I must say you already raised before the Trial Chamber yesterday.  
A.	Yes, indeed, I raised it spontaneously.  Now, my brief answer would be the following:  The Americans and Belgian administrations supported the RPF.  I do not see how Israel would train opponents of the RPF to fight against the RPF, whereas, Belgian and the United States were on the other side.  I know what I am talking about, particularly in terms of geopolitics and diplomacy.  

So my position is consistent.  This is false.  This is whimsical. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters missed out on the question from counsel.  If he would kindly repeat the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the interpreters request that you repeat your question. 
MR. WEYL:
I will try to summarise my question, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness Claeys indicated that Turatsinze allegedly told him that, given sustained military training, his staff would be able to kill up to 1,000 Tutsis in 20 minutes.  Mr. Ngirumpatse, what do you say to that?  This statement which is attributed to Turatsinze, what do you say about its veracity? 
A.	All I can say is that I am not aware of the training of any group that would have been able to do so.  I am not aware of any training of any group whatsoever. 

At this juncture, all I can say is that witnesses, such as Witness T, testified that they were not aware of the existence of a list to kill Tutsis.  Now, whether they be killed in 20 minutes, I believe that this is an impossible exaggeration which cannot be implemented. 

Witness T also said that Dallaire's facts was a fabrication.  So nobody believed him when this story of killing a thousand Tutsis in 20 minutes arose. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, still according to Witness Claeys, he allegedly received information from Turatsinze whereby an important weapons cache of about at least 135 firearms was in place, and that 110 weapons were distributed, 35 of which had ammunitions, and that he was in a position to point out the location of the arms cache.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I am not aware of that. 
Q.	According to Witness Claeys, on 12 January 1994 he allegedly saw Jean-Pierre Turatsinze again, but he was late because he did not arrive at the expected time.  Witness Claeys goes on to specify that there was a meeting with party officials, and the party officials questioned him on the distribution of arms and asked him to speed up the operation, and that it was in the evening of that day that he took us to the party premises to point out the stock of weapons that he had previously identified.  What do you say to that testimony by Witness Claeys? 
A.	It is false.  I have already testified that Turatsinze no longer had access to the headquarters of the party from the time he was dismissed in November.  I do not recall holding any meeting, and I do not know which party official he may be referring to.  There was no meeting on that day. 
Q.	Do you know whether on that day Turatsinze showed Witness Claeys weapons that were allegedly hidden at the MRND headquarters? 
A.	I would be surprised.  Claeys says that he did not get in.  Because of the colour of his skin, he didn't want to be seen.  So who am I to believe?  Claeys testifies that he did not get in, so how could he have seen anything?  
Q.	Had he gone in, would he have seen anything? 
A.	No.  As far as I know, there was nothing to see.  

What I think and I believe is that this is -- it is clear that Claeys knows because Turatsinze had asked him to bring other weapons if UNAMIR had considered undertaking some action.  So there is no way we can dismiss the fact that Turatsinze may have plotted with Karenzi -- spelt K-A-R-E-N-Z-I -- to undertake this manoeuvre in order to put the MRND in a bad state.  And that is how Colonel Marchal suspects that Turatsinze was an RPF agent and also recognises that Turatsinze made 
seven (sic) proposals to him.  In any event, Claeys himself says that he didn't see anything because he didn't get into the premises. 
Q.	Is it true that the following day, on the 13th of January, a meeting took place at Amahoro hotel, a meeting between you yourself; the secretary general, Joseph Nzirorera; General Dallaire; and Claeys, and that you were questioned about weapons which were hidden? 
A.	Yes.  We denied that we had hidden any weapons, and we spontaneously invited them -- I should not hide that from you.  We spontaneously invited them to carry out a search.  We told them that we were ready to deal with a search.  They did not want to do such a search, and we do not understand why. 

How can it that -- we suggested that they carry out a search for the weapons, and they refused.  It sufficed for them to ask for a written authorisation, and we would have given them such an authorisation to carry out the search.  That's all.  

But I do not know why they preferred to make of that a big issue right up to New York; whereas, they could have asked us for a written authorisation, and we would have given them the 
written authorisation.  We made that suggestion to them. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I will soon be done with Turatsinze.  Witnesses appeared before this Court and talked about Turatsinze.  It was Turatsinze who calls himself Abubakar.  Witnesses before this Court testified to how Jean-Pierre Turatsinze was able to deliver information, give information to UNAMIR.  On the basis of the information available to you today, who is Jean-Pierre Turatsinze? 
A.	In my opinion, he was an RPF agent in charge of misinformation.  I rely on the statement given by his wife.  That statement was disclosed to us by the Prosecution.  

First of all, Turatsinze asked for a passport to enable him to leave Rwanda and foreign embassies were reluctant to give him or grant him asylum.  When he realised that he had a bad image, he left Rwanda and went to Mwanza in Tanzania.  I believe Mwanza is well known, but for the court reporters who are not Tanzanian, Mwanza is spelt as follows:  M-W-A-N-Z-A.  Mwanza is located in Tanzania. 

On the 27th of March, he gave instructions to his wife regarding what the wife had to do in his absence.  And on the 28th he left from Mwanza with two other people for Mulindi telling his wife that he was going to report to the RPF.  No one heard about him any longer.  It was only his mother who told Turatsinze's wife around the end of 1994 that Turatsinze had died.  

But on leaving Mwanza -- he was going to Mulindi to report -- he was executed as an agent who had failed.  Was he killed on the battlefield, because this was a period of war?  I am unable to answer that question. 
As far as I am concerned, he was in charge of misinformation.  Thank you. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Now I would like to briefly address a few other aspects of the indictment regarding planning, incitement, organisation.  

You are charged with having participated in fundraising, raising money for the Interahamwe.  Can you give or make a general comment on this charge of raising funds, collecting funds for Interahamwe activities.  
A.	I never attended a meeting for the collection of funds.  I never attended such a meeting. 
Q.	It was stated that on the inception of the Interahamwe in 1991, they did not have funds, and that it was through some subsidies, a subsidy of 500,000 francs given by President Habyarimana, that they were able to hire buses, buy uniforms, refreshments for the rallies they attended.  Do you have any information on that allegation? 
A.	I have no information in that regard.  Neither the president of the republic nor the Interahamwe ever told me of that contribution.  I became aware of that when I arrived here at the Tribunal. 

I know that the president received a group led by Murenzi, but I do not know who gave them money.  I was not aware of that. 
Q.	It was also stated that it was the MRND executive committee which hired buses to enable the Interahamwe to travel to the préfectures where rallies were held.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Those buses were not hired for the Interahamwe alone.  The buses were hired for members of the party who wanted to attend rallies.  Besides, the buses were not always hired.  But I am saying that the buses were not hired only for the Interahamwe.  They were hired for members of the MRND in general. 
Q.	The same witness stated that this situation continued until 1993, a period during which the 
	president of the republic organised the -- a fundraising organisation at Rebero hotel.  During the fundraising event, there were many members of the executive committee of the MRND, and that there were many financiers on that occasion.  Did you ever attend the meeting described, and are you aware of it? 
A.	No, I do not remember that event.  I do not -- I did not attend such a meeting, if ever -- if it ever took place.  

I would also like to state that the hiring of buses did not continue.  In fact, the party subsequently became so poor that we put an end to that practice.  In fact, in 1993 we did not resume the hiring of buses.  We did not have money for such expenses. 
Q.	The same witness testified that during the fundraising event at Rebero hotel, 
	one million Rwandese francs were -- was not put into the official account, but that that amount was given to the executive committee of the MRND, and that the executive committee used that money in a clandestine manner.  Do you have any comments on that? 
A.	I am not aware of that money handed to the executive committee or allegedly handed to the executive committee. 
Q.	As for the indictment, the indictment attributes to you -- in a general manner attributes to you that in general you were involved in fundraising events, funds for the Interahamwe, and that many banquets for the purpose of raising money and celebrating the Interahamwe were organised at the 
	hotel Horizon Rebero in Kigali in 1993 and 1994.  What do you say to that allegation? 
A.	That allegation in the indictment is totally baseless.  The only comment I can add is that the -- our account in Rwandan banks in Kigali was available.  The Prosecution could have verified that account, and they will realise that there was no money; that there was nothing we could do; that the situation was difficult; and that we worked -- we ourselves worked on a benevolent basis. 

The party vehicle I used, I fuelled it myself in order to be able to travel.  Moreover, I used that vehicle only on very rare occasions.  That is to show you the financial situation in which the party was at the time referred to. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, let us now move on to another charge that we have already mentioned.  But we did -- but we would now do so in a more precise manner.  Did you establish or had established lists of persons to be killed? 
A.	No.  I have given sufficient explanations regarding that allegation.  I will not revisit those explanations.  My answer is no. 
Q.	Were you aware of such lists? 
A.	No. 
Q.	According to Witness HH, Turatsinze took lists of Tutsis, Tutsis who had sent members of their family to be trained by the RPF, or lists of Tutsis who were saying things against the MRND, and these lists were taken to the secretary general of the MRND.  Did you receive such lists? 
A.	No.  I have already stated that our records are in the possession of the RPF.  You would understand that if such lists had existed, that would be the first thing they would send to this Court.  So such lists do not exist. 
Q.	Are there lists of Tutsis who attended rallies or meetings at night, Tutsis who had given funds to the RPF? 
A.	No.  Nevertheless, I would like to add something to my answer.  Everyone notices that there is a tendency to attribute to the MRND what comes under the state.  That is a matter that falls under national security, and national security was not under our scope of duty.  So we didn't have to take care of that.  So my answer is no. 
Q.	Once again, Witness HH stated that even before October 1993, Interahamwes established lists of alleged infiltrators who came and were housed, and Tutsis who had sent their children to join the ranks of the RPF, and that Matthieu Ngirumpatse was aware of all this.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  Those are lies. 
Q.	Witness AWE stated that during a meeting in Kabuga's building in August 1993, Nzirorera gave instructions for the preparation or the establishment of lists of Inkotanyi accomplices and told an 
	MRND agent who was in charge of that exercise -- I would add in square brackets sic, S-I-C, because the -- well, this is not clear.  This is AWE speaking.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I am not aware of that. 
Q.	Witness UB testified that in 1994 he was informed by a cellule official that Interahamwes were establishing lists of Tutsi families in his secteur, that Interahamwes in the cellule were establishing lists and that they forwarded the lists to their supervisors, right up to the executive committee of the MRND.  When killings began in April 1994, soldiers went with those lists.  What do you say to that testimony given by Witness UB? 
A.	In fact, it's nonsensical because he carried out administrative functions.  If he had seen such lists, he would have acted.  Anyway, I am not aware of such lists. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, were you a shareholder of the RTLM radio? 
A.	Yes.  I bought two shares.  I bought two shares in that radio. 
Q.	What was the reason for your buying two shares in RTLM? 
A.	It was an investment.  It was an investment.  That's all. 
Q.	Perhaps we should exercise more discipline.  Can you repeat your answer.  
A.	It was for purposes of investment.  The two shares were 2,000 (sic) Rwandan francs, that is about 
	100 US dollars at the time referred to -- in fact, less than 100 dollars. 
Q.	To your knowledge, that radio, was it created to spread an extremist ideology, a pro-genocide ideology? 
A.	No.  Before buying those shares, I read the constitution of the RTLM.  There was nothing in the constitution indicating what you suggested.  No. 
Q.	But beyond the constitution of RTLM and under the cloak of the constitution, did you decide to contribute to the creation and financing of a radio station, a radio station that subsequently will be used for spreading a pro-genocide ideology?  Was that your intention? 
A.	No.  Moreover, at the time referred to, no one knew how events were going to unfold.  Perhaps the person who caused and executed the assassination of the president knew that the situation would become catastrophic, but at the time referred to no one in Rwanda thought that the country was going to move towards a catastrophe.  No one knew that. 
Q.	Do you know and were you interested in knowing the ethnic origin of the other shareholders of RTLM? 
A.	No.  I bought my shares, but I never sought to know who else had bought shares and who hadn't. 
Q.	Before or during the events, did the RTLM assist you in broadcasting utterances or an 
	extremist ideology or a pro-genocide ideology? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you play any role whatsoever, did you participate in any manner whatsoever in the running of RTLM and its activities? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, if I told you that Colonel Bagosora had bought 15 shares in the RTLM and that -- 50 shares and that the judgement delivered on 18 January 2008 states that that does not in any manner established that he played any role in the activities of the radio, that is, RTLM, what would you say?  And bearing in mind your small two shares.  
A.	The Court was wise.  That would also be my assessment.  When you buy shares in a radio station like that one, you look at the constitution.  What would happen after that, you wouldn't know.  So the Tribunal's assessment was fair -- was proper. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I do not think that you are a shareholder of Radio Muhabura.  Did you, nevertheless, have the opportunity of listening to that radio station? 
A.	Not much.  In fact, once or twice.  But I was not really a keen listener.  And, moreover, I was not available during their airtime or broadcasts. 
Q.	Do you know the founders of Radio Muhabura? 
A.	I know that it is the RPF radio because they themselves said so.  But the founders, I do not know them by name. 
Q.	What was the type of message broadcast by that radio station? 
A.	Violent and hate, full of hate.  It would have been useful to have the transcripts, all the transcripts of the broadcasts made by that radio, because what was disclosed to us was, rather, RTLM broadcasts captured by Muhabura.  It was not broadcast by Radio Muhabura itself. 
Q.	On the basis of what you were able to hear and also on what you know about Radio Muhabura, do you think that this radio station contributed or made its contribution to peace, security and calm among Rwandans? 
A.	No.  No, because I remember that on the 7th of April, I believe, or perhaps on the 8th, that radio said that RPF troops will come and punish the people of Kigali.  Punish, that was the term used by that radio station.  I do not think that such an utterance was to bring calm in the minds of people, so, in my opinion, no.

1200H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, have you ever heard of Abakozi, A-B-A-K-O-Z-I; Zero Network, the Dragons? 
A.	Yes, here before the Court.  Here at the Tribunal.  But the Zero Network -- well, I've read a document by Christophe Mfizi -- Mfizi, M-F-I-Z-I.  But that document did not mention any name as far as I can remember.  It was a criticism; otherwise, the names that -- all the other names you mentioned, I heard them here at the Tribunal during my trial.  Before I came here, I was not aware of those names.  
Q.	According to Witness ZF, the initiators and sponsors of those networks and squads -- death squads, the MRND, was included.  And the name most mentioned in those circles included, inter alia, the name of Matthieu Ngirumpatse.  

There was also the name of members -- there were also the names of members of a political party that was also aligned to the MRND, that is, the CDR.  And the people most mentioned as belonging to the network were Bucyana -- Bucyana, Martin, B-U-C-Y-A-N-A, Martin and Barayagwiza, *************.  There was also -- there were also people who were members of the administration or who were politicians or businessmen.  

What do you have to say to that, Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	All these organisations are organisations that were made up for the purpose of ruining the reputation of certain people.  To my knowledge, human rights organisations, tribunal -- or experts of this Tribunal, none of them puts Ngirumpatse's name among those who were members of the death squads -- death squads, to my knowledge I say.  

Therefore, this is something that surprised me when I arrived here at the Tribunal.  I was surprised by the existence of such an allegation against me.  
Q.	However, in information provided by Turatsinze to Witness Claeys, that idea emerges.  According to Claeys, Turatsinze claimed that the death squads were headed by Zigiranyirazo.  Z-I-G-I-R...

Mr. Z -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.  
MR. WEYL:
-- to be more simplistic about the matter.  

Zigiranyirazo was spelt out.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, he stated that there was a plan to sabotage and to murder the president of the supreme court.  Were you aware of any such schemes or plans? 
A.	No, I was not aware of any such plan.  And I would like to mention in passing, Zigiranyirazo -- Mr. Z was acquitted by this Tribunal and is a free man.  Therefore, the theory of the death squads -- I don't know how it can be supported; in any event, I did not hear about this.  
Q.	Well, let me correct you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Mr. Z has been acquitted, but it may be difficult and premature to say that he is a free man, just like all the other acquitted persons.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse, I have some six more questions to put to you with a few subsidiary questions, which I will try to handle as quickly as possible before handing over to Ms. Hounkpatin.  

My first question is in relation to a meeting which I skipped.  

Witness HH claims that a meeting was held in your presence, in the presence of Nzirorera and Faustin Munyazesa, in a building belonging to one Charles Bandora, B-A-N-D-O-R-A, in Ngenda, N-G-O-N-G-A (sic), around 1993, or thereafter, where Witness HH was introduced in his capacity -- or new office to which he was appointed.  And I would keep it at that in order not to disclose his identity.  

Did you attend any such meeting in a bar belonging to Charles Bandora in Ngenda or in any other location at which HH was introduced? 
A.	No.  I do not know Bandora.  I was not in Ngenda at that time.  And the furtherest I went was in Kanzenze -- in Kanzenze commune, which I have already spelt, and it was for Rwambuka's funeral.  That is it.  Otherwise, every other allegation is a fabrication.  
Q.	Matthieu Ngirumpatse, Witness GOB, among other Prosecution witnesses, testified about a goat having been stolen and skewered by the Interahamwe as they left a rally.  Do you remember any such activity by the Interahamwe? 
A.	I think that this matter was even raised on the radio, and a lot of noise was made about the matter.  But it is the contrary that was proven; namely, that those young people were attacked as they returned from a rally.  

You see, it would have been more -- more interesting for us if those accused had appeared before the Tribunal or before the Court.  We, as a party, did not want to defend anybody.  So we used a law firm as defence counsel for people who had problems.  You know, the kubohoza system was in place, and I have already talked about it.  

I signed the contract with the law firm, myself and Mr. Karemera.  And the law firm in question had lawyers from various political leanings, including members from the PSD and from the MDR.  And we handed over the defence of the interests of our members to this law firm with which I signed a contract.  
So, so long as the matter was not settled by a court, let me simply say that I heard about it but I questioned it.  

And I have already testified that, when we held rallies, whether in Kibungo or in Gitarama or in Butare, it often happened that we were attacked as we returned from the meetings.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, GOB gets even more specific and testifies about a goat having been stolen on the 29th of September (sic), 1991, in Gitarama.  He goes on to testify that those acts of violence led to several members leaving the MRND, and he points out that the issue was raised with the leaders of the MRND at the time, namely, the chairman of the MRND at the time, Juvénal Habyarimana, and the general secretary of the MRND, Matthieu Ngirumpatse.  

Then he says that you allegedly told them to leave those youth to have a free hand and to engage freely in their acts of aggression.  But that "we" were supposed to provide them with the necessary guidance while allowing them to continue to engage in those acts of aggression, because "we" would need them later on.  

GOB went on to add that Habyarimana and Ngirumpatse supported those acts of violence.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That is a total lie.  I am not aware, and I do not remember that he said such a thing.  I do not see the context in which he may have made such an allegation.  What I can say is that when those young persons committed questionable -- or reprehensible actions, we even blamed them publicly, as the case may be.  So he lied.  
Q.	The third question:  Mr. Ngirumpatse, a Defence witness testifying before this Trial Chamber stated that you attended his wedding, that is, the wedding of the son of Kayibanda, in September 1993, instead of attending the funeral of one of the members of the president's family, which was taking place on the same day, and that for that decision, you ran into some problems.  

I have two questions to ask you in relation to that point.  One, why did you, in view of 
your personality, choose to attend Kayibanda's son's marriage rather than the funeral of President Habyarimana's relative? 
A.	It seems to be obvious to me.  My choice was a political and beneficial choice, beneficial to the extent that it promoted dialogue in the party and between parties.  I know that the decision did not please some people.  But then, again, you must wonder whether a public figure has the right to prefer private relations over and above issues that are of a public interest and which are to the benefit of the majority of the people.  That is the choice I made.  
Q.	The witness went on to say that you paid dearly for that choice.  What do you say to that?  Please tell this Court -- tell this Court your own testimony about the consequences of your choice to go to Kayibanda's son's wedding rather than to the funeral.  
A.	It is true that some young people -- some persons blamed me for having made that choice.  Well, these were simply verbal utterances which did not amount to any acts of physical violence as such.  But the utterances were strong enough to point out to me how it was important for them and for the party that I made such a choice.  But this was simply an emotional fleeting moment, which didn't last long.  

You see, Twagiramungu was -- well, Hildebrand is Twagiramungu's brother-in-law, and Twagiramungu was the president of the MDR and who, subsequently, would become the prime minister-designate -- or who was already the prime minister-designate at the time of the wedding.  So people did not understand that I had a long-standing relationship with those people, people whom I had known for a long time, even prior to the multiparty era, particularly the Kayibanda family.  So I was quite friendly with the Kayibanda family as well.  

However, for reasons of national interest, I had to operate a more useful -- a more judicious choice.  
That is my answer to your question.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, all decency observed, you stated that the person who was referred to as having the authority over the youth of the MRND, that is, having hierarchical power over them, that person was actually blamed because of what he did in relation to those over whom he is supposed to have had authority.  
A.	Yes, that is true.  But as I say quite often, one does not have authority if one cannot sanction.  I did not have any authority over the young people.  All what was said is theory -- vague theory.  Authority can only be authority when one can sanction.  And I had no sanctions over them.  The only thing that I could use was persuasion, and persuasion was my only weapon -- the only weapon I could use.  
Q.	Matthieu Ngirumpatse, witnesses before this Court have testified that Eden Garden was the 
unofficial headquarters, the assembly point of the Interahamwe.  What do you know about that, and did that give you any authority over the Interahamwe? 
A.	First of all, that assertion is not true because I did not manage that facility, and I do not see any manager who would agree that youth should come and occupy the restaurant, which was a business premise.  And, by the way, that business premise was open to everybody.  

I met Mr. Twagiramungu, Mr. Mbonampeka -- people of the opposition at the Eden Garden discussing their political issues at that location.  So it is wrong to claim that this was a meeting point or a rallying point for those youth.  That is false. 
Q.	The last question before I hand over to Ms. Hounkpatin, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  At the beginning of my examination-in-chief, you stated that you had never considered resigning from your duty post.  If one looks at your duties at the time and the arguments that have been saddled on you in that connection, then one can see that you made a choice.  
But let me ask whether there was any time whatsoever at which you threatened to resign or to use 
your -- to use the threat of resignation in order to influence your decisions -- the decisions of the MRND and the decisions of other persons.  I would like you to clarify that point for the benefit of the Court.  
A.	When you asked me the question, the issue was whether I had attempted to resign because of the supporters and the members of the party, and my answer was no.  But there was one point at which -- or a case in which I resigned, but the cause for the resignation is not the party or supporters of the party, but it is for reasons relating to those who want to make a gain out of democracy or out of party politics.  

What I'm saying is the following.  I have already told you how -- how the president of the republic had resigned from the position of chairman of the party.  And I want you to understand me clearly.  I don't want to speak evil of the president because he's a man who did much good for his country.  

Now, that I talk about him, I remember the sentence by B-O-S-S-O-U-E-T (sic).  Bossuet -- B-O-S-S-O-U-E-T (sic), who delivered the Mass at the Prince of Condé, and said he was a great man in action and a great man in death.  I can paraphrase this phrase for President Habyarimana:  He was a great man in action and a great man in death.  

I want to leave it at that.  But I still have to clarify to the Trial Chamber on this part of my life and in relation to this trial.  So what I will do is make this clear and tell the Court how he came to resign from the chair of the party following pressure from the opposition, from the embassies in Kigali and the international community.  

What happened was that he consulted a small group of persons, including myself, and our opinion was that it would be a good thing to maintain him as president of the party and still keep him as head of state, just like was the case with other political parties.  So he asked me to convene a meeting of the national committee so that the decision should be conveyed to them.  

I convened a meeting of the political bureau before calling on the national bureau.  So the political bureau agreed with the president's decision, so the party was in agreement.  However, some sycophants went to tell him that these were manoeuvres by certain individuals who wanted to take the position of chairman of the party.  So he called me and asked me to stop the process.  So I stopped.  You do not argue when a head of state has given you instructions.  

Now, after some investigations, I noticed that this was in the interests of some sycophants, and so I resigned.  And when I resigned, I submitted my letter of resignation, and he said, "No, no.  You cannot resign."  
So those who try to weave in a number of ideas around this issue will always be mistaken.  When he received me in his office, we were only two of us together.  We discussed this issue, and we came to an understanding, and that is how I withdrew my letter of resignation which I had already tendered.  

Now, what I did not like was the sycophancy within the party, whereas decisions could be taken within the various organs of the party.  And since then, things have gone well, and no one complained about the fact that decisions by the various bodies of political parties could be modified elsewhere.  

That is the answer that I can provide for your -- to your question.  I am really sorry to have to speak about someone who is supposed to be resting in peace.  And I'm very sorry about that.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. WEYL:
At this juncture, Mr. President, with your leave, I will pass the baton to my lead counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I think I should say good afternoon to you all.  Thank you for giving me the floor, Mr. -- thank you for giving me the floor, Mr. President.  

Oh, I noticed you didn't hear me, Mr. President, when I said good afternoon.  Good afternoon to all, to you and the other Judges who are disturbing you from listening to me, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, good afternoon to you.  I can assure you I was not being disturbed by my colleagues.  But you're welcome to take the podium and to continue the examination of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Counsel Weyl has been examining you over the past three or four days and has covered various aspects of the indictment prior to the 6th of April as exhaustively as possible, and touching on the tragedy as well as the happy events that took place in Rwanda at that time.  

I will be talking to you about the period running from the 6th of April, and we shall be discussing what happened in Rwanda.  

First question: Where were you on the 6th of April?  Where did you spend the day?  And can you talk to the Court about it.  
A.	You mean the day? 
Q.	Yes, the day of the 6th of April.  
A.	The day of the 6th of April was an ordinary day.  And as I have already testified, we had a meeting with the director of cabinet of the president of the republic at which we discussed the setting up of the transitional institutions.  And the rest of the day was a routine day.  And the only main activity that stood out would have been that meeting with the director of cabinet at the president's office.  
Q.	Did you leave your home in order to attend that meeting, and, if so, where did the meeting take place? 
A.	I think the meeting took place -- maybe at the presidency of the republic in the office of the director of cabinet.  I no longer have a clear recollection of the location at which we held that meeting.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did you -- did you take part in the assassination of President Habyarimana? 
A.	No, no, no.  
Q.	Were you part of a conspiracy to organise that assassination or a plot? 
A.	No.  Let me refer to something that happened in this court.  When the report by the government of Kigali on the assassination of the president was published, Mr. Robinson called for an amendment of the indictment to insert the words "murder of the president" because his client and several others were implicated in that publication.  But apparently there was no reaction from those in charge of amending the indictment.  

I did not participate in any conspiracy or plot.  But I would have desired that this Court look more deeply into the issue of the assassination of the president.  That is my -- that would have been one of my desires.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Now, can you tell the Court whether you heard -- as many witnesses appearing before this Court said, whether you heard on the 6th of April the explosion of the 
president's plane.  Did you hear the explosion, or you didn't? 
A.	I remember that I was on the piano.  I was distracted.  I was playing music.  I did not take note of that.  But people who were in my home told me that there was some noise, an abnormal noise.  We were used to grenade explosions, gunshots and so on, but they told me that it was a noise that they had never heard.  Personally, I was engrossed in my music.  I did not hear anything.  I was lost in my music.  
Q.	When were you informed of the attack, the murder of the president?  And under what circumstances did you have that information? 
A.	At around 8:30 p.m., at around that time -- that is, 8:30 p.m., I received a telephone call from the president -- or, rather, the director of the president's cabinet.  He told me that the president's plane had exploded; that he did not know whether the president was in that plane and that no one knew whether there were any survivors or not -- whether all those on board had died.  At the time he was speaking to me, he did not yet have details.  He told me that he was going to call me again.  
Q.	Can you clearly -- or give the name of the director of cabinet who called you.  You stated the time when he called you.  Can you also tell the Court, approximately, how long the conversation you had with him lasted. 
A.	Now, his name is Enoch Ruhigira, R-U-H-I-G-I-R-A.  Ruhigira, Enoch.  

The duration of our conversation was about four minutes, something like that, between three and -- I would say between three and five minutes.  The conversation did not last long because he told me that he, too, was waiting to know the truth -- to know whether the president was in the plane; what was his fate, and what was the fate of the other passengers on board.  And he said that he was going to call me back.  
Q.	So the conversation you had with him -- or, rather, according to that conversation, you were informed of the explosion of the plane, but he did not know whether the president was on board the plane, and he did not know the consequences of the explosion.  It was just to inform you that the president's plane had exploded? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	At the end of that conversation, did you call the people you knew, or did you wait since Mr. Ruhigira had promised to call you again? 
A.	I waited.  I waited that -- I waited for him to call me again.  
Q.	At what time did he call you?  After how long, following the first call, did he call you?  Did he call you or he didn't call you? 
A.	I think he called me again to tell me that -- perhaps I answered too quickly.  I apologise to the interpreters. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I think he called me about 30 or 40 minutes after the first call and told me that the president was in the plane and that probably he had died.  He added that there were other persons -- other delegates in the plane and that there was no survivors.  

I believe he called me again about 45 minutes -- one hour or maybe 30 minutes after the first call.  I do not have any precise recollection of the time that had elapsed between the first and the second call.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	What was your reaction at -- what was the time when he called you?  How did you take that information? 
A.	It was night.  By the time he called me for the second time, it was about -- it was beyond 9 p.m.  The situation in Rwanda and in Kigali, in particular, was not certain.  People made an effort to return home on time, and, above all, not to move about at night.  In fact, people avoided going out at night.  

Quite often I was cautious because I told you that -- or, rather, you know that many people had been killed during that period.  

In front of my house, two people had been arrested.  People with no identity, but they had a lot of money in their pockets, and certainly they were trying to study -- to find out how to lay a bomb at the entrance to my residence because the entrance to my residence was not cemented.  It was cemented inside the compound but not outside.  So those two individuals were arrested.  

But somebody said that they should be sent to the gendarmerie -- to the gendarmerie headquarters.  And I learnt subsequently that they were released.  So we were very careful -- we were very cautious.  

During that night I did not see what else I could do.  I remained there.  I could not do anything.  So I waited.  
Q.	Were you alone in your house?  Did you make any comments on the information you had received?  Were you alone?  Were you with your family?  Can you give us more details. 
A.	Yes.  I was with my family.  My wife was there, my daughter as well.  There was my nephew, Léonidas; there was Frank, a Ghanaian friend.  I think those were all the people in my house.  

At the time referred to my family was not a typical large family.  Our children were studying abroad.  It was only the younger child whom, moreover, has come before this Court.  It was only that per -- that young one who was at home.  I believe those were all the people I had at home that evening.  

Of course, we made some comments.  And we were able to feel that the situation was serious because such a death is -- is always -- always leads to an explosive and dangerous situation, as we have seen in other countries.  
Q.	During that evening, did you receive any other phone calls? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Which ones?  Can you specify them to the Court.  
A.	After midnight, I received a phone call from Colonel Bagosora.  That was between midnight and 1 a.m.  He told me that he wanted to -- that he would like to receive directives from the MRND.  He didn't -- he said -- he didn't tell me the reason why.  He didn't tell me why.  

That was the call I received immediately after the two calls that came from the director of the president's cabinet -- that was Bagosora's phone call after the first two calls.  

But I do remember that before that, perhaps I called the director of the president's cabinet to ask him what he had in mind -- what had to be done.  He said he did not know, and he dropped the phone.  The third call, as I said, was Bagosora's call.  
Q.	How long did the conversation with Colonel Bagosora last? 
A.	Very brief.  Very brief.  I told him that I was going to consult -- that I was going to consult my colleagues; but that, in any case, it was impossible for me to come at night; that I needed time to contact them.  

Then I raised another problem -- that was a security problem, a problem of movement.  I told him that, under those circumstances, it was impossible for us to come at night; that I could not expose my colleagues to such a dangerous situation at night.  So I told him that it was difficult, but that, in any case, I was going to consult them.  And then he told me he was -- that he was going to call back or call again.  He said he was going to call again.  
Q.	Very well.  Colonel Bagosora called you and wanted you to come immediately.  And you said you would come later on the 6th of April? 
A.	No.  He did not say the same night.  He said the following day, in the morning.  He said the following day because I -- I retorted that if we had to come that evening, it would be impossible.  So he said, "No, no," that we should come the following day.  So I also raised the issue of escorts and travelling.  So he said he was going to call me again.  

So these are the facts as they happened.  
Q.	Did you inform the other members of the political bureau to have them move, and did they agree to go to that meeting? 
A.	Bagosora did not ask for members of the political bureau.  He asked for members of the steering committee of the party.  There were four of us.  We were four.  So I took my phone, I called the three other members.  I called Mr. Karemera; I called Joseph Nzirorera, who was national secretary; I also called Ferdinand Kabagema, who was the second vice-chairman.  I gave them the content of Bagosora's message.  

I asked them to go and listen to the message that he had for us.  Karemera agreed.  Joseph agreed -- Joseph Nzirorera, I mean, was in agreement.  And Kabagema told me that it was impossible for him to leave the place where he lived because the place where he lived was near the CND -- that is, the parliament building where the RPF battalion was stationed.  

So he told me that his neighbourhood had already been surrounded by the RPF and that it was impossible for him to go out of that neighbourhood.  Therefore, he said he could not come because it was not possible for him to go out.  So up to that point, this is what happened.  
Q.	The following day, that is, the 7th of April -- am I correct? -- did you go to that meeting?  First of all, can you tell this Chamber the circumstances under which you went to that appointment and the place of the appointment.  
A.	At about 1 a.m., I received a phone call from an officer.  I do not know whether it was a headquarters officer or an officer at the ministry of defence.  But the officer informed me that he was going to send an escort together with a vehicle to pick us up.  

So I informed the two others because Kabagema had told me that he would not be available.  Joseph told me that it was necessary -- or it was -- it was not necessary to send a vehicle for him; that he was going to find his own means.  But I informed Karemera of the availability of an escort and a vehicle.  

Indeed, the vehicle came in the morning at 6 o'clock.  I sent the vehicle to Édouard Karemera's home.  And when the vehicle came back, we left.  We left for the ministry of defence.  We went together in the same vehicle where there was a military escort.  
Q.	How long did it take you between your house -- or, rather, how long did it take you to travel from your house to the ministry of defence where you went in the company of Édouard Karemera? 
A.	Perhaps 20 minutes.  The distance is 9 kilometres.  So it probably took 20 minutes.  There was no obstacle on the way.  
Q.	At what time did you arrive there? 
A.	At about a few minutes to seven -- 7 o'clock, 7 a.m., a few minutes to 7 a.m.  Yes.  Because you have to consider the time that the vehicle took to come to our place -- to my place, to go and fetch Karemera.  Yes.  So we arrived at the appointment place at about 7 o'clock -- 7 a.m.  
Q.	Who received you once you arrived at MINADEF? 
A.	Colonel Bagosora was in his office.  But we entered -- only the two of us, that is, I and Édouard Karemera.  Joseph Nzirorera had not yet arrived.  Joseph Nzirorera arrived late.  He arrived between 7 a.m. and 7:10 a.m., but it was Colonel Bagosora who received us.  He gave us seats in 
the -- in the waiting room also.  But he was alone.  
Q.	You said that Joseph Nzirorera arrived about ten minutes later.  Did you wait for him in order to start the meeting, or you started before he arrived?  What happened? 
A.	We waited for him.  Bagosora did not give us the message before the arrival of Joseph Nzirorera.  Besides, I believe Bagosora was waiting for someone else because there was another important person -- it was, in fact, General Ndindiliyimana who also came.  He was there.  

General Ndindiliyimana -- I think that name is well known here.  

Ndindiliyimana was chief of staff of the gendarmerie.  He was already a general at the time referred to.  
Q.	When Colonel Bagosora told you the purpose of the meeting, Karemera, Nzirorera and General Ndindiliyimana were present? 
A.	Yes, plus myself.  
Q.	What then did Colonel Bagosora tell you? 
A.	He told us that he wanted to give us the message from Mr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, the 
Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in Kigali.  Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh was the head of UNAMIR.  

Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh had told Bagosora at night that he should look for the management -- the leaders of the MRND party in order for them to replace the president of the republic, to propose a replacement for President Habyarimana.  I think, in his mind, he thought that we were capable of carrying out that exercise.  In fact, he talked of the leadership of the MRND to designate a replacement for President Habyarimana.  

That was the message that Bagosora gave us.  
Q.	And what was your response?  Who took the floor?  How did that meeting go on?  Can you tell us whether you accepted the -- the suggestion.  What happened? 
A.	Yes.  I was the first person to speak.  I told him that the designation for a candidate to occupy the post of president of the republic did not depend on the steering committee which, besides, was incomplete.  
I said that was a matter that fell within the purview or the ambit of the national congress of the party, but that we were unable to come together to convene the congress, considering the distances separating us; the number of members of the congress; matters of security and the time.  

We told him that it was not possible for us to -- to convene the congress which had to designate -- or which would designate a replacement for the president of the republic.  

We discussed at length explaining to him the mechanisms -- the procedures that obtained within the party for the designation of a candidate for the position of president of the republic.  In fact, we -- or I would say "I", because I was the first person who spoke.  I regretted to tell him that it was impossible for us to convene a congress in Kigali in view of the prevailing circumstances.  

My two colleagues supported my idea.  And we did not designate a replacement for the president of the republic, considering the statutes or the constitution of the party and even the -- the law.  A president of the republic cannot just be replaced anyhow, just like that, by three people.  That seemed to us to be quite funny, rather strange.  So that is what happened at that time.  
Q.	In fact, your words bring to mind some question.  Why did the Special Representative of the UN ask you to replace or designate someone to replace the deceased president? 
A.	I can only guess.  I can only speculate because he gave a rough message to Colonel Bagosora.  Colonel Bagosora did not interpret the message.  He just forwarded it to us.  But I can only guess or speculate that the Arusha Accords provided that the president of the republic would be provided by the MRND party.  But that was the -- a living president -- a president in office -- a sitting president.  And I believe that is what led Mr. Booh-Booh to think that the MRND could replace the president of the republic.  

But as the discussion went on, we realised that -- in his mind that did not correspond to the Arusha Accords.  And that is a difficulty that emerged subsequently.  
Q.	Can you clearly tell the Court whether Colonel Bagosora and General Ndindiliyimana participated in the discussion, provided advice, whether they said something at that stage?  You said that you took the floor and that your two colleagues were in agreement with what you said.  Did the other two people say something? 
A.	Some time had already been spent.  They asked us questions on our objections.  It took some time to explain to them the mechanism that obtained within the party.  The applicable procedures -- we had to explain to them why we were not able to do that.  

There was at least one thing they agreed with us on, and that was the security issue.  Members of the congress were between 300 and 400, something like that.  It was a huge number of people who were members of the congress.  And considering the situation that obtained, it was difficult to bring them together in Kigali town after the assassination of the president without the necessary guarantees for their safety and security.  

Now, after my colleagues also expressed their opinion, which was identical or similar to my opinion, we discussed and explained to the two soldiers -- to the two officers.  Even Ndindiliyimana did not take the floor.  In fact, it was Bagosora who spoke.  

Therefore, after explanations, Bagosora did not stay for a long time.  He said that he had a meeting with the United States ambassador and with other diplomats as well.  And the meeting was to take place in the residence of the United States ambassador.  

So we broke up on that note.  He said that he was going to forward our message -- or bring our message to the attention of Booh-Booh and also to the attention of his fellow officers.  

He said that he will send me another message after that meeting.  So he left.  He left for that meeting with diplomats and Mr. Booh-Booh.  

We remained there.  We waited for an escort to enable us to return home.  
Q.	A last question before I request the President to grant us a recess.  That meeting of the morning of the 7th at MINADEF, how long did it last? 
A.	The meeting continued right up to 8 o'clock, half-past eight, because I do not remember the time when he had his appointment.  But he left quite early at about 7:30 a.m.  In fact, my recollection of that is rather hazy.  The meeting lasted about one hour, perhaps one and a half hours.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, perhaps -- or would I -- should I say this is the time for us to take the lunch break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.  I do think we should adjourn now.  

We adjourn until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1301H)
