GEORGES RUTAGANDA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good morning to you, Mr. Rutaganda.  
A.	Good morning, Prosecutor.  
Q.	We left off yesterday with the excerpt from an expert report from -- written by Augustin Ndindiliyimana in August of 1998, and I trust that you've been able to read through the two or three pages that I copied for you overnight.  Is that the case? 
A.	Yes, that's the case.  
Q.	So now that you've read through the entire section that was numbered number 4 from 
pages 7 through 9, wouldn't you agree with me that, at least in this document, 
General Augustin Ndindiliyimana is suggesting that there was confirmation of the reports initially made by the commander of the gendarmerie in Rwamagana that sometime in December 1993 he had observed busloads of Interahamwe coming back from training in Mutara?  
A.	I don't see where you draw that conclusion from -- or, maybe you should tell me the sentence.  But if it is a suggestion, I don't even find where a suggestion of that kind would spring from.  And if you look at page 8, the fourth paragraph, it says, "As regards military training, which is cause for so much talking, 
I did not have any specific information on the contents and the programme or schedule of that 
training -- and even on the number of participants."  

Now, this is an assertion of the head of joint staff.  It's not just anybody who is speaking this.  
Now, the -- as -- in his position, he should know exactly what is happening.  To my mind, therefore, proof should be that he should be representing all these elements if, in fact, he believed in such 
training -- military training to the Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	Well, wouldn't you agree with me that if you read the second paragraph on page 8, he's essentially saying that the intelligence service of the prime minister had looked into the matter and confirmed that there was some accuracy to the report of truckloads of Interahamwe being ferried back from Mutara.  
And, then, when you look at the bottom of page 8, he talks about Kajuga and Kajuga leading the Interahamwe and participating -- or assisting the army.  And on the following page, at the top of 
page 9, he talks about the Interahamwe and other armed civilians leaving to go to Gitarama 
where they perpetrated massacres with the population, notably in Runda, Taba and Muginya -- Mugina communes? 
A.	As a matter of fact, you raised three different topics at the same time.  Now, concerning the intelligence officers of the prime minister's office, which confirmed such training, yesterday I told you that it was only proper that they would assert or confirm the information which they had additionally sent out against the MRND.  And to that I would contest by putting forward what the MRND said, which is to the contrary.  
I did not know how an opposition party would attribute events or operations to another party.  It's just their word against the other's word.  

And as regards Kajuga and the Interahamwe, he used the word "ordered" or "commanded".  But maybe he used that word because he's a soldier.  But I believe that in the first place, taking this literally word for word, I don't think that it was possible that Kajuga on the 7th of April participated in such activity because I explained yesterday that he was in the village of Urugwiro.  

While the situation even got worse once he heard the assassination of members of his family, I can only take this figuratively to mean that he wanted to say that Kajuga was the president of the Interahamwe za MRND.  

But that the Interahamwe -- to think that the Interahamwe had gone to support the army in fighting the RPF, that -- I must say, yes, that happened, and -- as members of the population went and participated and they supported the army, like all other civilians who were close by and were interested in what the soldiers were doing.  

But that's the committee.  It played a role in sending these people.  That cannot be said.  We did not play any such role.  When I say "we", I'm talking about the committee or myself.  We were never contacted by whosoever for such persons to -- for these persons to go out there.  

It was not only destined to the Interahamwe za MRND.  It was all the people -- the population.  All the youths voluntarily who wanted to support the army left and followed them.  And they were guided by the soldiers, and they were given the necessary equipment.  They would eat with them, and they fought alongside the loyal forces, the forces loyal to the government. 
Q.	Well, you mentioned this report from the commander in Kibungo or Rwamagana yourself.  I mean, the initial discussion came from one of your own responses.  And I'm curious to know where you had heard about that report initially back in 1994 or 1993.  
A.	I learnt about that report while I was in prison, after I had been arrested.  It was only after having left the country.  
Q.	Well, let me show you another document.  And here I'm referring to document numbered 22 in my bundle.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could assist me by handing up the French and the Kinyarwanda text to the witness.  

And I've highlight the portion on the French text that interests me.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And you'll agree with me that this is a letter dated the 21st of April 1993.  It does come from the MDR, which you've identified as the opposition party, but it's the MDR in Kanombe.  And the subject is military training of the Interahamwe in Busanza.

And if you look at the text of this letter, particularly the portions that I've highlighted, you'll see that the three persons who are sending this letter, who are the MDR secretaries in Kanombe, are complaining about training sessions that are held on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays in the afternoon and often end around 7 p.m., that take place sometimes at the Busanza secteur office or on the Nyarugunga rock, sometimes in Harerimana grove or in Nshunguyinka.  And, essentially, they're complaining about Interahamwe being trained militarily in Kanombe.  

Did you hear about that back in 1993 or 1994 when you were in Rwanda?  The complaint.  I'm not asking you if it's accurate or not.  Did you hear about the complaint of Interahamwe being trained in Kanombe?
A.	No.  
Q.	Well, if you look at the bottom of the letter, this letter was copied to the president; to the prime minister; to the minister of interior, who was Munyazesa at the time; to the chief of staff of the gendarmerie who, I assume, was General Ndindiliyimana at the time; to the préfet of Kigali, Renzaho; to the representatives of the political parties; to the representative of the Interahamwe in Busanza.  None of those persons ever discussed complaints of this nature with you or with your national committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I told you I was never informed about the existence of this letter, but I'm not surprised about it.  It's a letter from an opposition party, as you said, and which can only be seen from the viewpoint of manipulation done to back the manipulations they had launched concerning the Interahamwe.  

I don't know how this -- such training could've taken place at 7 o'clock in the night.  I -- I don't have any comments to make on this letter, but all I can say is it is part of the framing-up, the malicious manipulation fomented to accuse the Interahamwe.  

Talking about this training which you are alluding to, so far as I am concerned, it would have been better or preferable that the role of the national executive committee of the Interahamwe in this 
training -- not once do you find the president, Kajuga, nor myself, nor Ruhumuliza going to find branches of people who stated that they were trained.  How could such persons have not been trained without the knowledge of the committee?  It's not a question.  It's just a thought.  

As far as I'm concerned and as I said in 1999 during my testimony, it is one of two things.  Either the training took place unknown to me -- and, yet, I should have known, and so, if such training took place and I never was aware, it means that -- so that training was not done by Interahamwe za MRND, and that group should be known by the Prosecutor.  And if I was supposed to know it and I did not know it, I take a simple proposition.  I cannot give more than what I have.  What I have and what I know is that I did not know about any training carried out by Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	Well, the issue of these allegations against the MRND -- against the Interahamwe specifically concerning military training of the Interahamwe, was that ever a topic of discussion between you and any member of the national executive committee, talking about Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, Karemera back in 1993 or 1994?
A.	To my knowledge, we never discussed that topic.  
Q.	Not once? 
A.	Not once.  Not at all.  
Q.	Even though you've already suggested that the opposition parties were making these allegations, it never came to pass that you discussed these allegations, whether they be false or true? 
A.	We never discussed -- well, we -- we could not always be attending to rumours.  Knowing the reality, knowing the truth and that which was unfolding out in the field, we were not going to waste time discussing rumours.  And, by the way, we were used to such -- we were used to listening to such information spread by the opposition.   And even then, we were not involved without knowing who was behind it all, who was responsible, and they were saying it is the response -- it was the -- the Interahamwe that was responsible.  

Let me give you an example.  When Gatabazi was assassinated -- 
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda -- 
A.	Please, Mr. Prosecutor, let me -- 
Q.	I appreciate that you have a lot to say.  But I would appreciate it even more if you could answer the question that I asked very concisely because I'd like us to complete this examination this morning.  
So just direct your response to the question.  Once you have responded to the question, allow me to pose my next question and if anything else -- if you wish to add anything else, do it with Mr. Robinson in redirect.  Okay? 

I'm not telling you not to be responsive.  Answer the question.  But once the question is answered, let me proceed with the examination.  
A.	Can I complete my answer? 
Q.	Bearing in mind my -- my comment to you, yes, go ahead.
A.	I was saying that to buttress or illustrate the said manipulation which was done against the Interahamwe, when Minister Gatabazi was assassinated, immediately over the international media it was proclaimed that it was the Interahamwe that has -- has killed him.  And the reality is that everybody now knows that it is the RPF that killed him.  That's just a very, very grave accusation.  But all showed that, in the same manner, they could also have been behind all such stories.
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  It was with respect to the assassination of Gatabazi and then Bucyana the next day -- it was in reaction to those killings that you say Ngirumpatse organised the meeting with you and the minister of defence and the minister of interior.  I'm just recapping what you said yesterday, because I've suggested to you that your meeting with them took place in February, and I'm clarifying for the record that the reason I suggest February is because that's when those killings took place.  
Can we agree on that?  February of 1994.  The end of February, to be more precise.  
A.	The meeting took place after the assassination.  
Q.	Now, this was not the type of meeting that the MRND president would necessarily want to conceal from his vice-president or his national secretary.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	I do not know whether it was necessary for the entire bureau to be convened to discuss this problem.  What is certain is that, in the presence of the ministers in charge of security, coincidentally being of the MRND, yes, he had the authority to convene us and to ask our opinion and also to inform us that we had received material.  It was not a meeting of the... 
Q.	Did you have any conversation with anyone in the MRND, including Nzirorera and Karemera, that would lead you to conclude that Nzirorera or Karemera were aware of the contents of your discussions with Ngirumpatse, and the minister of defence, and the minister of interior back in February of 1994?  
A.	I never discussed that question with Karemera nor with Nzirorera.  In fact, our understanding was that -- and this is the reality -- this was the reality at the time, is that they worked in an atmosphere of confidence.  And so if we had been convened to talk about these things, then he definitely must have informed them.  

If he didn't do so, that must be another issue.  I'm not in a position to tell you whether it was necessary for both of them to be there so that we could discuss the problem.  Why would the bureau have delegated it to them?  Really, I don't know.  Your question is asking of me an opinion which is beyond my knowledge.  
Q.	But Nzirorera and Karemera would equally be threatened, would they not, or be concerned about security, which is what your meeting with Ngirumpatse and the minister of interior and the 
minister of defence was supposed to address?  Wouldn't they be equally concerned? 
A.	What I am saying is that it is only my assumption that if issues of protection and bodyguarding for political leaders was involved, then they would definitely have been also involved.  But that did not take place.  
Q.	Did you ever complain to them -- and here, I'm referring to Nzirorera and Karemera -- about your suspicions that Kajuga and Turatsinze had sold MRND guns to the Burundian rebellion?  
A.	No.  No, we didn't do so because, as I stated yesterday or the day before, it was information that we received like that.  And it might have been necessary to have further explanations as to why the referenced material was not present or absent.  So we could not rely on rumours to bring any matter to the attention of the national bureau.  
Q.	So the only person you discussed this with was Ngirumpatse?  Is that your evidence? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  
Q.	I'd like to look at several of the documents with you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could assist by handing up number 12 and number 13 in my bundle.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, these are excerpts from your own pamphlet as you described it.  I didn't copy the entire thing, but the pages that may be of interest to me are included in those two bundles.  

And first I'd like to look at document 13.  And if you turn the page, I'll begin by saying that there are annexes to your pamphlet.  And annex number 2 is your ID card with the MRND that we've looked at already, which is already an exhibit in our case.  If you go to the next page, it's the Interahamwe ID card, which we've also looked at through your testimony, which is an exhibit.  And then annex 4 is a letter that was submitted under the signatures of the officers of the -- and as it is mentioned in the final page of this letter, "Comité...(no interpretation)...Interahamwe", dated the 27th of May 1992.  It's also an exhibit in our case.  It's P. 10 in our case.  

And you'll see at the bottom there is room for five signatures.  And then if we go to the next one, which is dated the 19th of January, which is also an exhibit in our case -- it's P. 13 -- this is a letter signed by the Interahamwe national committee, but this time there are 11 signatures.  

As far as I'm aware, the letter of the 27th of May 1992 is the first time or the first document that bears the signatures of the five members of the official committee.  And the letter of January 1994 is the 
first document that I'm aware of that bears the signatures of 11 members of the commission.  

So my question to you is, when were these commissions formed?  The various commissions that were headed by Serugendo and -- excuse me -- Maniragaba and Nkezabera, Kanimba?  It's called in this document the corps des conseillers.  It must have been sometime between the 27th of May 1992 and the 1st of January 1994.
A.	The corps des conseillers or body of advisors was set up, I believe, after the first meeting with the chairman of the party.  When we left that meeting, there were some criticisms to the effect that the committee that had been set up was not well balanced at the national level.  That is why we promptly sought to include other members to the committee in order to reflect that regional balance in the committee.  

And that is why, as it was said, that most of the members came from the south and centre.  You would realise that the second group in the committee is made up of persons from préfectures in the north essentially.  So I would put the date at early or mid-December 1991.  
Q.	Well, I don't dispute the reason for -- that you've suggested for creating these commissions.  But I'm left with the question of why they didn't sign the document that's dated the 27th of May 1992, if they were part of your organisation as early as December 1991.  
A.	There was no obligation for the committee to cause the advisors to sign the document.  
Q.	All right.  Can we look at document number 13 -- excuse me, 12 -- which is still your book but it's from the text of your book.  And if we turn to page 7, we have the list of the 11 members of the national committee.  And as you have suggested, the first five are the officers most of whom are from the south with the exception of Mbarushimana who comes from Gisenyi.  And then the six conseillers are mostly from the north with the exception of number 5.  Mudahinyuka is from Gitarama.  

But I -- I certainly don't disagree with your suggestion that the officers were mainly southerners and the commission or the corps des conseillers were mostly northerners.  But what I'd suggest to you is that these commissioners were not added prior to July of 1992.  I think they were added sometime in 1993.  And I suggest that to you because Désiré Murenzi, who left the organisation in July 1992, knows nothing about the corps des conseillers.  He knows the individuals, but the setup to structure the Interahamwe za MRND with an additional group of officers, who are designated as advisors, did not exist when he was associated with the Interahamwe and the MRND.  

In light of my suggestion to you, do you have any additional thoughts about when the conseillers were incorporated into the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Your suggestion is incorrect because at the second meeting with the chairman of the party, the conseillers were present.  During the operation for the distribution of membership cards, they were actively involved in the printing of the membership cards as well as in the distribution thereof.  

I must also state that the idea of the committee, which I explained, is that people felt that some of the leaders superseded the instructions relating to the distribution of cards.  There was a category of members known as honorary members, and their cards were designed accordingly.  And I do recall that some of the conseillers or advisors in the committee received substantial amounts of money in order to issue membership cards to some persons.  And these contributors had felt that they were making their contribution.  

But all of this was happening, should I say, in early 1992.  So if anybody claims that they were not aware of the existence of conseillers at that time, that would be untrue.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Rutaganda, I'm not disputing that Nkezabera and Serugendo and Maniragaba and these various conseillers were involved with the Interahamwe as early as 1992.  I believe Nkezabera was involved as early as November of 1991.  What I'm suggesting to you is that his status as a conseiller, given a particular office with the national committee, probably didn't happen until sometime in 1993.  
So the individuals were definitely involved, but I would suggest to you that they didn't have any particular status until later on.  

Now, with that clarification, would your answer be the same? 
A.	Yes, my answer would be the same.  At the second meeting with the president of the party, we -- the conseillers of the party were in attendance.  And that is true; it is authentic.  Your informants could confirm that if you cross-check. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'd like to raise an objection here.  But I think it would be better if it's done outside of the presence of the witness because he speaks English.  So maybe we could just briefly excuse the witness so that I could be heard on one small point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Registrar -- Mr. Registrar, could you assist.  We would like to have the witness leave the courtroom for a short while.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the Prosecution has had two witnesses who have testified who were members of this committee, and it's Witness T and Witness G, and both of them testify contrary to Mr. Webster's suggestion.  And the testimony of Witness T was that the conseillers were appointed shortly after the national committee itself was formed, and that they attended this meeting with President Habyarimana just as Mr. Rutaganda has said.  

And I believe that the testimony of Witness G was exactly the same.  And I don't think it's proper for the Prosecutor to put a proposition to a witness or a suggestion to a witness that's contradictory to the evidence that he's led himself.  I think, at the minimum, if Mr. Webster wants to indicate that he doesn't believe the testimony of his own witnesses, he ought to ask that that testimony be withdrawn so that you're not concerned with it in your deliberations.  

Or he should, perhaps, put to the witness that there's evidence from the Prosecution's own witness that contradicts his suggestion.  But I think at this late stage of the case to start switching your theories and putting propositions to a witness that's contrary to the Prosecution's own evidence is not proper, and I would object to that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think it's necessary, Your Honour, to deal with the issue as -- in the terms that Mr. Robinson has presented it.  I can reformulate the question to make the point that I'd like to pursue.  It's really not an issue of giving a specific date for the creation of these commissions.  I'm simply trying to elicit from this witness information that would explain actually the testimony of Witness G that there was a parallel committee -- or some sort of parallel chain of command within the Interahamwe.  So if I've inartfully put it to the witness, I can change that.  

Quite frankly, I don't recall with as much detail as Mr. Robinson the testimony of Witnesses G and T on this specific point.  But I can rephrase the question so I can elicit -- that I can make the enquiry that I'd like to pursue without contradicting, as he puts it, Prosecution evidence.  I don't see it as contradictory, quite frankly, but I can do it a different way, and we can proceed in that manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we can proceed on that basis? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Could you call the witness, please.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, in your absence a matter has been resolved, and your examination will continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I'd still like to look at page 7 of the excerpt of your book where you have the list of the various members of the international -- provisional internat -- excuse me, provisional Interahamwe national committee.  If we look at Bernard Maniragaba who was the commission -- president of the commission of social affairs from Ruhengeri, this was a person that was related to Joseph Nzirorera; isn't that so?  Or do you know if he was related to Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	I was never aware of any relationship between Maniragaba and Nzirorera, any family ties.  
Q.	In any case, there's other evidence to suggest that they were actually related to each other, but if that's not something that you know about, we can move on.  In any case, when you suggested that conseillers had to be appointed in order to bring some regional balance to your committee, can you explain why that was a concern.  
A.	The main purpose of politics within a party is to win elections, and the MRND is no exception to that rule.  When the Interahamwe za MRND was born and became a popular movement, obviously the main objective was to secure as many members as possible.  

One of the main ideals of the party was regional or national balance.  It would, therefore, have been inconceivable for a provisional national committee of the Interahamwe to be set up comprising exclusively of persons from the centre-south.  

It would have been difficult, therefore, to explain to persons in the north during rallies in the north why we had excluded the northerners from the committee.  The same would have applied if members of the committee had been exclusively from the north to the extent that it would have been difficult for the southerners to understand why they had been excluded from the committee.  

So the idea was to try to avoid any regional connotation being given to the constitution of the committee.  So if people had noticed that there was an imbalance in the constitution of the committee, I think they were right.  And, therefore, the necessary corrective measures needed to be taken to include members from the other regions of the country.  
Q.	Are you suggesting that the MRND was worried that it was not strong enough in the north and needed northerners in your national committee in order to entice the north to its support? 
A.	No.  That is not what I said.  What I'm trying to say is that it was necessary to have national representation within the committee so that whenever rallies were conducted, all persons from all regions would feel represented.  

You see, when we went to meet the chair of the party, a question could have been put as to why those people went to see him; whereas, they're only from the south.  And the next question would be why was the north not represented.  So our idea was to try to address that idea and deal with it, and that is why we called in other persons into the committee.  
Q.	Well, would you agree that Joseph Nzirorera, being a northerner himself, would be likely to have a greater affinity to members of your committee that were also from the north, particularly those who were from Ruhengeri? 
A.	Not -- not obviously, except you have evidence to substantiate your suggestion.  That was not obvious because I myself -- I hailed from Gitarama.  But I did not have any particular affinities with members of the MRND or the MRND za -- or the Interahamwe za MRND from Gitarama.  It is not an automatic proposition.  
Q.	Well, in your direct examination answering questions from Mr. Robinson, Mr. Robinson raised the issue of Dieudonné Niyitegeka suggesting that somehow there was a parallel committee within the Interahamwe, because he got the sense that there was direct communication between four or five members of your national committee and Nzirorera that seemed to eclipse the majority of the officers.  And what I'm suggesting to you is that discussing that phenomenon and calling it a parallel committee may be too strong.  

Doesn't it seem likely to you that Maniragaba, Serugendo, Sebanetsi and Nkezabera, who were members of the commissions who were from the north, may have been communicating with Nzirorera, who was also from the north, in a manner that may have been offensive or curious to someone like Niyitegeka who was from Butare?  
A.	Well, I -- I will not share your opinion on what you've just said for the simple reason that if Nzirorera had sought to speak to me, I believe he had the latitude to do so.  He had access to me to do so without going through any conseillers.  I don't know why he would've had to create a small group within the committee itself.  

I never got the feeling that there were any persons who were working behind the back of the CNPI.  I already explained to you that, rather, there was that feeling -- there was that -- that feeling from the fact that people were collecting money from the party and which caused people to believe that they were acting behind.  

But the CNPI was one and was intact, and we remained within the CNPI until we left the country, including Dieudonné Niyitegeka whom you mentioned.  He did not -- he never told you that he resigned.  Not once did he ever raise this issue -- bring it to the table for us to study it.  And so he cannot come here now and say that there was a parallel committee.  
Q.	Well, when Nzirorera became the national secretary in July of 1993, was there any -- was his exercise of his authority in that position any different?  Or were the policies that he pursued any different from those of Mathieu Ngirumpatse who had previously been the national secretary? 
A.	From what I saw, it was a continuity.  And the policy that had been adopted could not be attributed to any individual -- to the national secretary.  It was a policy put in place by the party through the 
political bureau and the national committee.  So I cannot attribute that to the change of an individual -- the individual occupying the office of secretary general.  That could not have had a direct influence or impact on the policy of the party, going by what I noticed and what I observed.  
Q.	But you would agree that it's the national secretary that is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the party and its youth wing; right? 
A.	Not -- well, I don't know why you are insinuating or you want to say he was in charge of the youth.  The youth wing of the Interahamwe za MRND was under the party.  And if there was a policy to be executed among the youths, the policy was supposed to be proclaimed by an individual but dictated by the political bureau or the -- the steering board or even the national committee.  That's what I'm telling you.  It was not to be done by an individual.  It was not an individual who -- well, contrary to what some people think about the MRND, there was democracy within the party.  That I can assure you.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know André Nzabanterura? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	And what was his role within the Interahamwe? 
A.	I -- I think he was -- he must have been president of the Interahamwe for Kimihurura -- or Kimicanga.  Something like that.  
Q.	What about Séraphin Twahirwa?  
A.	Twahirwa was president for Gikondo.  Yes, yes, president for Gikondo.  
Q.	And Aloys Ngirabatware? 
A.	He was president for Remera. 
Q.	And you've already told us that you know Bernard Maniragaba, who was president of the commission for social affairs; right? 
A.	Yes.  I know him, and I knew him since a long time.  I explained to you that I got to know him while we were at university.  
Q.	Did he also have -- did he have any other status among the Interahamwe in Gitega or Nyamirambo, 
for example? 
A.	I don't understand your question.  
Q.	Well, in the way that you've identified André Nzabanterura as having some sort of status in Kimihurura and the other two individuals, Twahirwa and Ngirabatware, being linked to a certain commune or secteur in Kigali, I'm wondering if Maniragaba, in addition to being a national commissioner, also had links to local Interahamwe in his neighbourhood.  Did he have any particular status in Kigali beyond being a conseiller for the national committee? 
A.	To my knowledge, I -- I don't -- I cannot say any other activity in which he was involved.  
Q.	Now, did you have any interaction with any of these four individuals during the period 
April 6th to July of 1994? 
A.	I -- well, I'd see some go past, but I did not have any direct relationship with them except maybe when they came to buy beer, but I cannot recall having had any contact with them.  And I saw Maniragaba.  I saw him in Nyamirambo when he was passing through a place known as Pécos.  I met him there having a drink.  
Q.	This would be at the bar that he ran or his wife ran with Pécos, wouldn't it, in Gitega?  
A.	Pécos was not his wife.  Pécos was one of my clients who was selling Carlsberg.  He had a little bar in Gitega.  And during the events, since he had obtained supplies not only from my store, he -- he -- he managed to find things from here and there.  People would meet there to take -- to share a glass of drink, including people from UNAMIR.  
Q.	Okay.  Perhaps I didn't make myself well understood.  My understanding from other evidence in this trial is that Pécos and the wife of Bernard Maniragaba ran a bar somewhere in Gitega in Nyamirambo or in the direct -- I believe Gitega is -- is close to or part of Nyamirambo, isn't that so?  And there was a bar there that they ran together which was a gathering place? 
A.	First of all, Pécos was not the wife of Bernard.  That's not true.  Secondly, Gitega is Gitega.  Nyamirambo is Nyamirambo.  It's different.  So to say people went to drink there, yes.  I told you people would stop there to have a drink, including UNAMIR elements.  At a certain point in time I went there with UNAMIR staff.  We shared drinks.  We had some things to eat -- some meat to eat.  That's what was happening there at that time.  
Q.	There's evidence in this trial that that location served as almost a headquarters -- or perhaps saying headquarters is too much, but it was a meeting place where Interahamwe leaders would gather and exchange information during the course of events -- during the course of the war from April to June -- excuse me, to July of 1994.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	I do not agree because what was said about the headquarters of the Interahamwe, that Amgar was it's headquarters -- and many areas are given as the headquarters.  Anybody who wants to show the importance of his testimony would tell you the same thing.  

Now, I -- that -- the bar we're talking about, Pécos in Gitega, is located a few metres away from -- or maybe 200 or 300 metres away, and I'm not exaggerating.  Maybe about 500 metres because I did not take time to measure it from Amgar -- from the Amgar complex.  For us to -- why would we meet at Pécos even when we could meet at Amgar to do the coordination there you're talking about?  We never went to Pécos's to discuss or to hold any meeting whatsoever.  
Q.	Well, can you tell us the nature of your coordination with other members of the 
Interahamwe national committee or with any of the individuals I've just named during the period 
April through July of 1994? 
A.	There was no coordination activity.  There was no activity that required coordination per se.  Everybody did what he could, managed to do this or that, whatever it was to survive.  There was no coordination activity per se.  There was no activity as such.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I'll go on to something else.  Now, you claimed that you were not able to control the Interahamwe back on the 3rd of May when Captain Deme took you to SOPECYA.  But you'd agree, however, that Tharcisse Renzaho was able to control them.  Wasn't it Tharcisse Renzaho that ordered the convoy to be returned to Mille Collines? 
A.	Tharcisse Renzaho could not control persons who were at SOPECYA Kanogo.  Why?  For the simple reason that as a witness of the events, they had categorically refused and rejected the proposal put to them.  And his stance was that the population was supposed to allow the convoy to continue its course on its way.

Now, to say that it was him who suggested the -- that they return, I want to tell you that it's not fair -- it's not correct, first of all, because it was contrary to his own stance; and secondly, it is -- it is -- it is known because even Captain Amadou testifies about it.  Colonel Yaache, who was also of UNAMIR, testifies about it.  

I was the one who did it.  I'm not just attributing credit to myself regarding this operation, but I was the one who made that proposal after having talked about it with Amadou Deme.  

Secondly, now to say that these persons who were at SOPECYA were Interahamwe za MRND is not correct, Mr. Prosecutor, because these were people that were on the spot -- the population that were there, and they were mixed up with soldiers.  
Q.	You're aware of the broadcast on the 18th of May made by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, which was repeated quite a number of times on Radio Rwanda, where he directly appealed to the Interahamwe to allow the convoy to go through, are you not? 
A.	I was never aware of any such intervention.  
Q.	You didn't listen to the radio regularly back in April and May of 1994? 
A.	No.  Not at all.  As a mat -- as a matter of fact, I was not or I am not -- or I was not those people who always have their ears stuck to the radio.  I would listen to the radio whenever the opportunity arose, but I did not stick to the radio.  I did not feel any obligation to listen to the radio.  Maybe -- I love 
music -- and -- rather than listen to news over the radio.  
Q.	Well, let me inform you, Mr. Witness, that there's a transcript that has been admitted in our trial as a Defence exhibit; it's D. NZ38.  And in it Mathieu Ngirumpatse is identified throughout the transcript as the president of the MRND, and -- Éliézer Niyitegeka, the minister of information, are both addressing the population of Kigali.  

And they were interviewed, and their interview was replayed over and over again.  We have a text of the same interview being played at least three times in this particular excerpt, and they're making an appeal to the Interahamwe to allow for persons to be removed from the Mille Collines. 

And then you've told us that on the 27th of May, a convoy actually was allowed to leave the 
Mille Collines and make its way to the other side of the city.  Do you think that the direct appeal from Mathieu Ngirumpatse may have had something to do with the Interahamwe allowing the convoy to go through? 
A.	There are some facts which you just shared which I did not mention.  And I must say that concerning the second attempt, which was successful moving the refugees to the RPF side, I played no role.  I was never aware of the preparation of this operation.  And so that Mathieu Ngirumpatse could have appealed for the Interahamwe to allow that group to go past, I don't think there's anything surprising about that.  

I am not among those who hold that during the events of 1994 the Interahamwe could have deposited things on the table, fold their arms and did nothing.  I'm not among those who said that their 
population -- their youths folded their arms and just looking to that which was unfolding.  No.  That -- what I am saying is that the Interahamwe za MRND was part of the population in the same manner as all other persons and that they participated in the civil defence and the protection of their neighbourhood, as people of the PSD, people of the PE -- EL (sic).

So that -- that -- that -- that appeal was launched.  It was only normal that the party should give its stance or its position such that when people hear it, they should know that our party was in agreement.  We did not exclude ourselves -- we're not excluding the fact that there were other people who -- with whom they were there at the roadblock carrying -- ensuring that they were secure.  But I am saying that the most important group -- the group that was most important in the transfer of refugees, it was the armed soldiers.  Because I explained to you it was the front -- it was at the forefront of the fighting.

1020H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	During your direct examination you made mention of several communiqués that you signed along with Kajuga.  I believe there were at least two or three, one from the 24th of April; I think there was another from the 2nd of May.  Here I have a communiqué from mid-June 1994.  I believe it's on the 14th of -- it mentions the 20th of June.  This is already in evidence as D. NZ39, and it's signed by Robert Kajuga, André Nzabanterura, Tharcisse Nzabandora, Dieudonné Niyitegeka and Joseph Setiba.  This is document number 30 in my bundle.  

And these individuals are calling upon Interahamwe who were originally from the town of Kigali and Kigali-rural to return to Kigali by the 20th of June 1994 at the latest to receive new instructions.  

Can you think of any reason why Setiba would have had reason to issue a communiqué with Kajuga and Niyitegeka from the national committee?  
A.	I can only -- I can only conclude that they -- they abused their will.  Well, I don't know.  I never saw this communiqué.  And if you show me where it was drafted, that would help.  But to my mind, certainly Kajuga and Dieudonné certainly used the others whom you mentioned to give importance and to lend credence to what they were doing.  But I do not believe that they could have been calling people to return to Kigali when they themselves could not go back to Kigali. 
Q.	Well, wouldn't it suggest to you that Setiba was viewed by Kajuga, at least, and Dieudonné Niyitegeka, at least, as having more importance than you seemed to be willing to give them when you were answering questions from Mr. Robinson? 
A.	Importance?  Well, I don't think so.  Setiba was not important.  What I was reading in the communiqué, the group that was with Kajuga went with him because he was very, very sick, and in Butare they took up Dieudonné and went all the way to Cyangugu and from Cyangugu they went on to Gisenyi.  And I think I see the picture of people around him rather than the importance of these people.  
Q.	Do you have any information to dispute -- that would dispute the statement that Setiba went to Murambi to meet with members of the interim government?  I know you suggest that you did not accompany him.  But there is evidence in this trial that he went there.  Do you have any reason or any basis to refute that? 
A.	All I must say is simply the fact that such action never existed.  You did not need Setiba to be able to go to Murambi.  I went to Murambi many times.  I went many times to my home in Masango commune.  And I could go past Murambi very easily.  I did not need Setiba to be able to go and see members of the party.  

And, by the way, I will recall the incidents which took place with Setiba were not on good terms because he was doing things which I did not accept.  I would not remain in the company of someone who apparently had become maybe a bootlicker.  That was not part of my personality.  I wouldn't do that.  
Q.	All right.  We will move on, Mr. Witness.  Concerning Robert Kajuga, you've characterised him as a Tutsi.  And are you aware of how Kajuga himself described his own ethnicity?  Did you ever have a conversation with Kajuga directly on the issue of his ethnicity? 
A.	I never addressed the issue of his ethnicity with him.  I am saying this because that was not our concern.  We were not looking at him from that angle, from the ethnic angle or viewpoint.  We saw him as someone who knew how to address the crowd, someone who'd represent the interests of the party there at Kibungo.  That was it. 
Q.	Well, Robert Kajuga was interviewed by a journalist in an article that was published back on the 
3rd of July 1994.  And here I'm referring to document number 15 in the bundle.  This is an article that was published in The Observer.  And apparently this journalist, Lindsley Hilson, spoke to him about the conduct of the war, the Interahamwe and about his own ethnicity.  

And according to Kajuga -- or, I should say, according to this journalist, Kajuga's explanation to her was that his father was Hutu and his mother was Tutsi.  And here I'm referring to the bottom of the 
first column in that article, and I'll read it.  

"Kajuga's story reveals the almost incomprehensible contradiction of Rwanda's ethnic conflict.  A declared Hutu supremacist, he nonetheless admits that his mother was a Tutsi."  And then it goes on in the next paragraph to talk about his father or talk about how ethnicity is defined in Rwanda.  

And the article continues by saying, "All Rwandans carry identity cards introduced by the 
Belgian colonial authorities which declared their ethnicity, which is passed on through the father's line.  Kajuga, with a Hutu father and a Tutsi mother, is officially a Hutu."  

Now, assuming that this journalist is accurately reporting what Kajuga told her, do you have any reason to dispute Kajuga's explanation of his own ethnicity? 
A.	Yes, I have reasons to dispute that.  I, first of all, said that that was not our concern or our preoccupation to know whether he was Tutsi or Hutu.  That is from the start.  

But it was understood that many people passed for Hutus even though they were Tutsis.  There are current examples which you can identify in Kigali where mainly people from Kibungo, natives of Kibungo, were saying that it was known his identity as a Hutsi.  Well, in fact, they were Hututsis, because when the RPF arrived they revealed their real belonging or their ethnic belonging when the RPF came.  

So it is not astonishing, it's not a surprise, that Kajuga in this article stated that he was Hutu because he could not officially state that he was Tutsi.  But those who know his stock, his family genealogy, now state that Kajuga was Tutsi. 
Q.	Well, you talk about his family being killed.  You referred specifically to Jean Houss, the older brother.  Wouldn't you agree with me that Jean Houss was a member of the PL and was clearly identified with the Lando wing of the PL? 
A.	I did not say Jean Houss because I did not know -- well, I knew him by the name Houss.  And, by the way, he was a friend of mine who would always converse from time to time, and he would guide me.  He was -- had more experience.  We'd exchanged ideas whenever we met in a drinking place.  That he was of the Lando branch, the PL branch, I do not know.  I was not aware.  I did not know that he belonged to any political party. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...as a Hutu?  Or did you not know? 
A.	I did not know his ethnic -- his ethnicity.  As a matter of fact, this whole issue of ethnic group was not in the pattern of behavior for people.  I just told you a few minutes ago that this was a friend.  We discussed business.  He gave me advice.  He was a mentor.  The concern of Tutsi-Hutu, Hutu-Tutsi, these were -- I would say all that arose only after.  This was only a posteriori that we now use 
Tutsi or Hutu.  But in Rwanda we had Tutsi friends with whom we shared most intimate issues.  We had relatives.  And so at the time it was not my business.  I did not concern myself with that.  I was looking into that which concerned me. 
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, I'd remind you that you are the one that made a point of identifying Kajuga as a Tutsi in your efforts to suggest that the Interahamwe were multi-ethnic.  And what I'm suggesting to you is that Kajuga himself identifies his ethnicity.  And if we rely on what he's reported to have said, his father was Hutu and his mother was Tutsi.  And my understanding is Jean Houss, his brother, was also identified as a Hutu.  So the issue of ethnicity is one that you introduced.  I'm simply responding to it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I don't think that's fair to the witness.  I was the one that asked the question to the witness, "So what was the ethnicity of Robert Kajuga?"  So I don't think it's fair for Mr. Webster to suggest to the witness that he was the one that introduced that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  I stand corrected.  

But, Your Honour, I see the time.  I am at the tail end of my examination.  I think if we take the break I'll finish before the luncheon recess.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1105H)
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Rutaganda, taking you to the 6th of April 1994, you told us about being stuck at a roadblock and not getting home until 5 o'clock the next morning, or something along those lines.  But you described the roadblock as fierce, but you didn't go into detail on that point.  So I'm asking you now, what do you mean when you say that the roadblocks were fierce, or the one where you seem to have been detained? 
A.	If you are talking about the night of the 6th, I was stopped at two roadblocks, the one around Kimihurura and the roundabout at Kicukiro.  So there were two.  I don't know which one you are referring to. 
Q.	Whichever one you described as fierce, because that's what I'm trying to get you to explain.
A.	I think it's important to specify the roadblock you are referring to.  I said that I was stopped at 
two roadblocks, and at both roadblocks the guys were not nice at all.  They were fierce. 
Q.	Well, can you be more descriptive?  What made them fierce? 
A.	Well, that's what I noticed.  I realised that they were all furious, and they were not ready to listen to anything, and all they wanted was just to see us obey instructions as they were given.  And that is what prompted me to say that they were angry, they were insultive, just not normal at all. 
Q.	And these were soldiers or civilians or Interahamwe?  Who were manning these roadblocks on the night of the 6th?  Gendarmes?  
A.	I explained by saying that at the first roadblock where we were stopped it was soldiers who were there, and, as a matter of fact, we noticed that these were government soldiers and later when we heard them speaking, because this was in the dark.  As for the second, this roadblock was manned by gendarmes. 
Q.	Did you encounter any roadblocks manned by civilians, armed civilians or Interahamwe that night? 
A.	No.  I did not come across any such roadblock.  The only -- the one which I went past and where we had some obstructions, the two I just described to you. 
Q.	When did you first become aware of roadblocks in Kigali being manned by armed civilians? 
A.	Approximately it was around the 10th, because that was when I left and went a bit further away from my home.  I told you that I went to Nyamirambo for the burial of some relatives, and that is when I realised that there were some roadblocks which were manned by both civilians and soldiers, civilians who were armed. 
Q.	And it's your testimony that it wasn't apparent to you that there were roadblocks manned by armed civilians or Interahamwe prior to the 10th?  You didn't see that on the 8th or on the 7th of April?  
A.	On the 7th that was impossible.  I could not step out of my home.  On the 8th I was busy.  I was busy trying to evacuate my family towards Hôtel Rebero.  I did not see any roadblock manned by civilians.  But for a group, a small group that I met at the Kicukiro centre on my way to Kibungo, I saw a small group of people gathered there at ETO, and that was on the 8th. 
Q.	When did it become apparent to you that Tutsis were being targeted at the roadblocks?  When did it first become apparent to you? 
A.	I did not -- I never said that I was told that Tutsis were targeted at the roadblocks.  I told you that as a result of many conflicts that were raging nationwide, virtually everybody was targeted and, of course, maybe not to the same degree, depending on who was targeting who.  But when I said that I was afraid that I could not take the direction going towards my commune of origin, it was simply because I too -- I felt myself targeted.  

There was war, in effect.  And I do not wish that your country knows war, but when war breaks out, when the bombs are flying, you do not know who is doing what.  You cannot organise yourself.  Authority is in the streets.  I really cannot say that I may have stopped at the time or said that, that Tutsis in particular were targeted. 
Q.	I'm not really understanding your response.  Is it your testimony that you were not aware that Tutsis were specifically targeted at the roadblocks?  
A.	I did not know.  That was not my role. 
Q.	You never knew that from -- I'm not talking about the 8th or the 9th of April now.  Reflecting on the events of 1994, is it your testimony that Tutsis were not being targeted at the roadblocks in Kigali? 
A.	By the way, you are talking about activities of April, April '94.  If I talk about Kigali events, killings had stopped the first week after the 6th.  As for the rest, the victims, there were many other victims.  We only learnt the death of this person or that other person.  But it was not obvious that we would be able to say that it was Tutsis that were targeted individually.  

And the proof is that you can see the Hôtel des Mille Collines full of Tutsis, and not just any type of Tutsi.  This was the elites of the Tutsis.  You also had the Saint Paul parish.  It was full of Tutsis.  If we had that intention of attacking Tutsis, it was not difficult to attack.  Tell the Mille Collines, which I explained that I even worked with the person in charge for their survival. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I can appreciate that there were Tutsis sheltered at the Mille Collines and at 
Saint Paul and at those locations.  But my question to you, and this is the last time I'll ask it, is, are you saying that you were never aware that Tutsis were specifically being targeted at the roadblocks in Kigali, which is where you spent a good deal of time during the period April through July 1994?
A.	I just told you that it was not only Tutsis that were targeted.  That is my answer.  And I can give you another answer by way of food for thought.  How could Tutsis have been targeted and allowed them to have gone through roadblocks on to the Hôtel Mille Collines and even to Saint Paul parish?  I even had Tutsis on my block in the compound.  There were many of these Tutsis.  

I have explained to you recently, the last time, how I transported them in my berline vehicle in the back part of the car.  How could I have been part of a team which had the conviction that they were going to target Tutsis and at the same time host them, take care of them, treat them, transport them, Mr. Prosecutor?  How would I do that?  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Your response is clear.  
Now, you said you had to accompany Kajuga and introduce him around town at the various roadblocks, and you were doing that in order to protect him.  Who were you introducing Kajuga to on these roadblocks?  
A.	We did not do introductions as such.  It was the procedure just to get ourselves seen or to make ourselves known.  He did not want to go out.  He felt threatened.  He did not want to go out at all.  And he did not want that, whenever he went out, he would be treated as people wanted and talk about him.  He wanted to get used to people and to know what was happening outside, because it had been long before he -- since he went out.  There were no introductions as such.  We just were in the vehicle.  We were driving past.  We would greet people.  And we were looking.  Nothing more. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...to the Interahamwe on the roadblocks.  Wouldn't that be more accurate?  
A.	Interahamwes -- well, these roadblocks were not manned by Interahamwe za MRND.  The roadblocks were manned by the local populations under the instructions of the hierarchy, the administrative authorities, the civilian authorities. 
Q.	That would be the préfet of Kigali; right? 
A.	Each locality had its official, and those who were in charge of the roadblock was in his or her zone.  You certainly got to know -- there are some Prosecution witnesses who said that the conseiller for Cyahafi, particularly him, he explained to you how he put in place roadblocks.  I don't know how here you are telling us that it was Renzaho who did what.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said the civilian authorities, and I am suggesting it would be -- at the top of the hierarchy would be the préfet of Kigali, Renzaho.  But we will go on to something else.  I'm still curious about you driving Kajuga around to the various roadblocks.  What was your presentation of Kajuga supposed to accomplish and who did you present him to? 
A.	I told you, and clearly too, that there were no formal introductions.  I explained to you that it was just an opportunity for him to get used to the situation, to be conversant about what was happening 
because -- also to get himself seen.  It had been long that he had not been out.  There was no introduction, no stopping at the roadblock to say, "Oh, this is Kajuga, I am this or that".  No.  Let me say it again.  We went out.  We were driving around just for him to be conversant of what was happening.  There were no introductions per se.  That was not necessary. 
Q.	So your concern was that the persons manning the roadblocks see Kajuga with you?  Your association with Kajuga was what was going to protect him?  
A.	That was not my basic concern.  It was his concern.  He who felt threatened and who was coming out from his hiding place needed to know exactly much more, much better how the environment was.  And so he asked me and I took my vehicle and we drove particularly through Justice Street. 
Q.	And his concern was based in what -- or on what?  Because he was perceived as Tutsi and Tutsi were being targeted?  Explain it to us.  If it's not that, what was the basis of his insecurity and your reassurance? 
A.	I explained that, from what he told me, this feeling derived from what happened to his family.  His father had been killed.  His elder brother had been killed.  His sister-in-law had been killed, the wife of his elder brother, and other persons whose names I cannot mention but who were there at his 
elder brother's home.  And so it's obvious that had I gone through the same events regarding my family, I also would feel threatened. 
Q.	Was he being targeted as a Tutsi?  Was that the concern? 
A.	No.  I didn't feel -- I didn't get that sense from his behavior.  As a matter of fact, I myself, when I decided to leave Kigali -- and this was at the end of May -- I left because there were rumours going around that I was a traitor, I was a double agent, that I was working both for the RPF and for government, and that I was filtering information to the RPF.  

Why was this?  This was because, from the communiqué which we signed with the Red Cross, their driver abused this communiqué and acted that he was wounded in Gikondo and he was stopped -- that he was driving passengers who were not wounded but that he was covered in blood or rubbed himself with mercury chrome.  

And they said, "Oh, you're the one who is giving documents which enable the institution of the RPF."  And that was where people based themselves to say that we were working for the RPF and for the government at the same time.  And so, feeling that I was threatened, I decided to leave Kigali.  And each one had the right to feel a threat looming over him or her. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I think I have gotten as much of an answer from you as I'm going to get with respect to Kajuga, so I will move on, because that was my question.  Because that was my question.  I wasn't asking about your affairs.  I was asking about what would be the basis of the threat to him at the roadblocks, and why would your being with him and going with him to the roadblocks change that?  If you want to comment further, you can do so.  If you think you have already responded to that question, then I will move on.
A.	When I gave my own case it was a matter of buttressing that which I have been saying.  Otherwise I do not have anything else to add to my answer. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  You didn't participate in the so-called pacification tour with the other members of your national Interahamwe committee, did you? 
A.	You know that I did not participate in this pacification at all. 
Q.	When did you first learn about it? 
A.	That was when I had already been arrested. 
Q.	So you're saying not until long after the events did you hear of a so-called pacification tour.
A.	Never. 
Q.	In any case, Joseph Serugendo admits to having participated in this pacification tour on either the 10th or the 11th of April, but he has an interesting explanation for that pacification tour.  He supplements other information that has been made available to this Chamber.  And what I'd suggest to you is what Serugendo has included in his sworn statement, which is that the pacification tour was contradictory, because it was apparent to him when he was meeting with the MRND leadership and the other members of the national committee that other members of the national committee had been out on the roadblocks days before, as early as the 7th and the 8th, encouraging people to kill, and then they turn up again on the 10th asking them to stop killing, that there was something contradictory in the message that they were delivering.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  
A.	In fact, I have no comments to make apart from the fact that Serugendo is a collaborator of the Prosecutor, and he would only make the speech that would please the Prosecutor.  And I don't know exactly.  In fact, what you just said is proof that if the committee had launched an appeal calling upon people to carry out the killings, massacres or attacks, it could not again come up to say, "Stop killing", while I know, I am aware, that after the tour some people obeyed the appeal and the killings and the massacres had dropped in intensity as compared to what it was before they came on their pacification tour.  All I would suggest to you is to take note of what you just said.  But as for me, I did not take part in that tour and I cannot tell you exactly whatever happened. 
Q.	Well, if you were, for example, distributing guns at the roadblocks on the 8th of April, wouldn't that appear to be contradictory?  You, as a member of the national committee of the Interahamwe, if you were delivering guns to the roadblocks on the 8th of April, wouldn't it appear contradictory to have other members of the national committee turn up a day or two later and suggest that the killings should stop? 
A.	That indeed is the same argument I make, namely, that if the second vice-president of the 
Interahamwe za MRND distributed weapons on the 8th, the same committee could not turn around and tell people to stop killing.  That would be my argument.  

Now, in any event, as for the arms distribution alleged to have taken place on the 8th, I must state clearly that I never distributed any weapons to anybody.  I never distributed any weapons to anyone.  That is the truth.  And the truth shall always prevail, even in the context of history. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Rutaganda, that may have been your testimony in your own trial, but Trial Chamber I convicted you or made factual findings specifically with regard to the 8th of April, at paragraph 198 of its judgement, and found that you had distributed weapons.  And I will read it to you, 198 of the 
Trial Chamber I judgement of the of 6th of December 1999:  

	"The Chamber finds that on the afternoon of 8 April 1994, the Accused arrived in a pickup truck at a place in Nyarugenge where the Interahamwe had been taking and killing people from the commune.  The pickup truck was filled with firearms and machetes, which the Accused distributed to the Interahamwe.  He ordered them to work and said that there was a lot of dirt that needed to be 
cleaned up.  The Accused was armed with a rifle slung over his shoulder and a machete hanging from his belt."  

	That factual finding was confirmed on appeal, was it not, Mr. Rutaganda? 
A.	With all due respect to the Tribunal, particularly to the Judges of the Tribunal, all I can say simply is that those findings are unfounded and untrue.  They were predicated on lies given by way of testimony to this Tribunal.  So I hope that the Prosecutor himself would be cautious as to dealing with the truth in this matter.  

As for weapons distribution, I was convicted for three exercises.  On the 
15th and the 24th of April 1994, in which case at the same place known as Cyahafi, Gakinjiro, it was alleged that I distributed weapons and launched the killings.  

Now, could I have distributed weapons on the 8th and ordered killings and then come back on the 15th to distribute weapons again and order killings at the same location and then return on the 24th to distribute weapons and order killings at the same location?  That is not possible.  

There has been a poor assessment of the evidence.  Rather than consider these to be three distinct events which could not have taken place at the same location, the Trial Chamber rather subdivided facts into various events.  

But the truth is that from the testimony of various witnesses there was the description of one and the same event spread over a contradictory approach.  There were some contradictions.  Your witness, Mr. Haragirimana, has testified before various cases here.  Cyahafi -- that is the conseiller of my secteur.  And the allegation was made that I distributed weapons there.  But he never told you that I distributed any weapons in that secteur.  

So without dealing directly with my own case, I would simply like to say, Your Honours, that the Prosecutor should be in a position to recognise that there was a legal error in this matter.  I have never distributed any weapons in Cyahafi.  Now, whether there was reference made to Nyarugenge by the Trial Chamber, the whole point was simply to make that distinction.  The evidence, however, is that all the testimonies were relating to the same location.  

I don't want to be sadistic, but my question is, did I order those killings and did I order people from Cyahafi to be killed?  And if they were killed, they must have been resurrected so that I should have had to come back on the 15th to ask for them to be killed again, and they must have been resurrected a second time to require I come back on the 21st -- on the 24th, rather, to ask for the same people to be killed. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Rutaganda, you had your opportunity to defend yourself.  You did so.  You also launched an appeal.  And both the Trial Chamber and the Appeals Chamber convicted you of distributing weapons, as you have reminded us, on the 8th of April, the 15th of April and 
the 24th of April, and that's at paragraph 197, 198 and 199 of your Trial Chamber judgement.  

And at paragraph 200 the Trial Chamber states, "In its findings on these three incidents, the Chamber notes certain common features.  In each case, the Accused arrived in a pickup truck with guns, which he distributed or had distributed to Interahamwe in Nyarugenge commune.  The distribution of these weapons was immediately followed by the killing of people who, in at least two of the incidents, had been gathered together at these places prior to the arrival of the Accused."  

In addition to distribution of weapons, you were also convicted of ordering killings in your own 
Amgar garage locality.  And here I am referring to factual findings at paragraph 226, 260 and 261.  

At paragraph 226 the Chamber states that, "Based on corroborated testimonies, the Chamber finds that as from an unspecified date in mid-April, a roadblock was erected by Interahamwe on the
Avenue de la Justice near a traffic light not far from the entrance to Amgar garage at the 
Cyahafi secteur boundary...The Chamber holds that at the said roadblock the Interahamwe checked the identity cards of those who crossed it and detained those...whose identity cards beared the 
Hutu" -- excuse me  -- "the Tutsi ethnic reference."  Right?  

And it goes on to make factual findings that some of the persons that were removed from that roadblock were then brought to Amgar garage where they were killed under your supervision and buried in a pit on the very premises of Amgar garage, your property.
A.	Your premises is faulty.  Now, this is where we need to get some clarification about the Exhibit 168 relating to the mass grave.  Now, the mass grave was visited by Mr. Haglund, the Prosecution expert.  And all that was found in the grave does not at all tally with the Prosecutor's testimony in my case.  The same witnesses identified this mass grave as being the same that was identified by the Prosecution expert.  

Now, the Trial Chamber dismissed the Prosecution expert witness's testimony and relied rather on the factual witnesses, because the Trial Chamber was not convinced that they were dealing with the same mass grave, whereas evidence, all the evidence, pointed to the fact that reference was being made to the same mass grave as testified to by Prosecution witnesses.  

So I believe that all what you have referred to is in line with the findings of the Trial Chamber, but that is not the truth.  And mine is not the first case in which injustice has prevailed based on events that were simply fabricated in order to indict me.  

The persons you refer to who were allegedly arrested at the roadblock and taken to Amgar -- by the way, let me tell you that not a single soul was killed in my property.  Everybody who went to my property left that property alive.  

Now, you refer to persons who had been arrested, but you did not state that those very persons testified that they had been taken to a prison where I held more than 200 Tutsis in the Hindu Mandal building, which I mentioned here.  Allow me to say that the Hindu Mandal building was, rather, used to host Anaclet Butera's family, which I have explained I helped to evacuate in groups of two, part of the family going to Mille Collines and the other to Hotel Kiyovu.  

Now, that family had jumped over the fence in order to access the Amgar property, and that family is alive.  That family is still here.  But they were not called to testify because I was told that that would not have served the Tutsi cause.  

Your Honours, that family is still alive.  That house for which I am being accused of having hosted a prison was actually the residence of a family which is still alive and which has not been called to testify.  How could I have used this house as a prison for Tutsis, whereas there was a family in it for which I did everything?  I provided them food.  I provided them health attention.  They had malaria at some point.  They caught malaria at some point and they were shivering.  I was called in and I tried to get Nivaquine for them.  I did not know what doses they had to administer to each of them, but I asked them to take two tablets every two hours in order to get treated.  Fortunately they got well.  

And so how could things have been otherwise?  This building had no toilet, and we had to give them buckets to use to meet their needs.  And so we needed to do this quite discreetly to make sure that nobody became aware that there was this family in that building.  

Now, Mr. President, if the Prosecutor were honest, he would think twice before ascribing any intention whatsoever to me.  I could not at the same time have provided food and medication and even a 
radio set to enable them to listen to news to this family.  I couldn't have been doing this for that family in my property and then subsequently go out to distribute weapons and ask for Tutsis to be killed.  If I had had that intention, I would have eliminated that family in the first place. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Rutaganda, you've had your day in court.  The Court convicted you.  The 
Appeals Chamber confirmed that conviction.  And if you have other legal remedies I'm sure that you will pursue them.  But at paragraph 439, Trial Chamber I made the finding that you were "...in a position of authority vis-à-vis the Interahamwe militia..." and went on to state that, "Testimonies in this case have demonstrated that the Accused exerted control over the Interahamwe, that he distributed weapons to them during the events alleged in this indictment, aiding and abetting in the commission of the crimes and directly participating in the massacres with the Interahamwe."  
So, contrary to your testimony, a Chamber of this Tribunal has already found that you could exercise control over the Interahamwe and did so with the intention and result of killing Tutsis.  Right? 
A.	I have already explained to you that I am a victim of a legal error.  I don't know what else I can say.  But you forget to mention, Mr. Prosecutor, that the Trial Chamber also acknowledged that I did not have any authority over the roadblocks.  I think that is -- that can be found somewhere in the judgement.  If I did not have any authority over the roadblocks, how could I have had authority over those who were at the roadblocks, including, among others, the Interahamwe za MRND?  

You have said that other remedies are available to me.  Yes, indeed.  By mentioning these things, I am simply trying to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to who the witness before the Court really is.  I'm not the kind of villain that has been portrayed in the movies.  Whenever I have had opportunity to assist people in danger, I have done my level best.  Yes, it is true that I am serving a life sentence, but the truth of the matter is that I was not and am not one of those.  

Let us look at Mr. Amadou Deme's testimony, for example, in which it is stated that, for example, in relation to the SOPECYA, which we talked about a short while ago -- I can read this and I know that you have a copy of it.  I simply want to refer to that testimony. 
Q.	When you say testimony, are you suggesting that Amadou Deme testified in a trial in this Tribunal? 
A.	That is not what I mean.  What I'm saying is that I want to refer to a statement made by someone with whom we collaborated and not to the statement by the Prosecution witnesses who told lies.  This is somebody who represented the international community.  What did he say about me?  What did he say was his experience and his encounter with me?  That is what I want to refer to. 
Q.	Did you not have an opportunity to call him as a witness in your defence? 
A.	Very well.  When I arrived here in Arusha and went to the UNDF in 1996, I met Amadou, who was a security officer at the UNDF at the time.  So I told him that I had put his name on the list of persons who would be called as Defence witnesses, and he told me he was ready to assist me and that there was no problem.  But since things dragged on, I raised the matter with the deputy registrar who came to visit us, and I told him that I wanted the meeting to be organised with Amadou so that Amadou may provide his own version of the facts in the presence of the registrar so that at the timely occasion I could put this before the Trial Chamber.  And I think that it was Mr. Veritas, whom I was dealing with at the time, who advised me to apply for such a meeting in writing.  

I submitted such a letter and I waited and waited, and two weeks later he came to tell me that they had done their level best to see what could be done with Amadou.  And so I was not involved in what transpired, but I asked him whether it was possible for him to provide an official answer to my application.  This was never done.  
What happened was that Amadou was withdrawn from the UNDF.  He was brought here, and my lawyer followed up with him here, but he was transferred to Rwanda.  Then we tried to reach him from this distance because my lawyer -- but, Mr. Prosecutor, you put this question to me.  Let me explain these things to you, and I can tell the Court how Amadou was hidden.  That is my objective.  So hold on, please. 
Q.	I'm not trying to stop you from giving useful information to the Chamber, but I think the information that you are giving us now is better suited to a redirect examination from Mr. Nzirorera's counsel.  So why don't you reserve that portion of your answer for Mr. Robinson if he cares to explore this.  Okay?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think the witness has to be allowed to complete his answer.  We can't interrupt the witnesses and say it's on the party to go back to it in redirect.  He hasn't completed his answer.  I think just courtesy alone ought to allow him to be able to do that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, the matter is left to the Court's discretion.  I would like to complete my examination.  The responses are overly long, and I think that this is something that could be addressed more effectively in redirect.  But I'm certainly willing to listen if the Court finds it useful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We'll allow the witness to complete his answer but remind him of the preference for brevity.  
THE WITNESS:
What I was saying then is that Amadou was hidden.  He was taken away.  We tried to contact him here at the headquarters of the Tribunal.  We tried to contact him in Kigali and even through another 
human rights organisation.  But everything was done to keep him away from testifying here because it would have been embarrassing.  It would have been an embarrassment.  

Now, I would like to read this text out because it is very important for the Trial Chamber to understand.  Now, with regard to the SOPECYA incident, which we talked about a short while ago, this is what he says:  

"The story has been changed and the truth hidden.  A possible answer occurs to me.  The man who confronted the angry crowd and did the most to save all our lives is known to Mr. Rusesabagina.  He is known to Mr. Rusesabagina, and his name is Georges Rutaganda.  He is an old friend of 
Paul Rusesabagina, and he is portrayed as a villain in the film Hotel Rwanda.  Sometimes the truth can be very awkward.  I know that Mr. Rutaganda came to that roadblock because I am the one who brought him there."

One more paragraph.  "Consideration is said to be part of the mandate of the international justice.  Averting our eyes from the truth because it is personally or politically awkward is bad for our collective conscience.  Georges Rutaganda is serving a life term for crimes against humanity.

"As a representative of the international community and witness to the events and someone with whom we worked, I believe that his position here is clear.  The Prosecution -- the Prosecutor should not continue to look away from the truth because the truth will emerge some day, whether he will be alive or not.  I am sure that the truth will prevail some day and I trust the judiciary."  

It is true that people have the right to act within the ambit of their rights and their conscience.  But, Mr. President, one thing I have asked for right from the beginning is that we identify those who are truly guilty, because I am innocent. 
(Pages 17 to 30 by Claudette Ask)



























1200H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your explanation, Mr. Rutaganda.  But what I would point out to you is that your Trial Chamber judgement of the 6th of December 1999 does include a copy of your indictment.  And that the charges that were laid against you are pled in paragraphs 10 through 19 of the indictment.  And with the exception of paragraph 19, which accuses you of ordering people to bury the bodies of your victims in June of 1994, every other paragraph concerns events that transpired in April.  

Now, certainly you're not suggesting that Captain Deme's testimony or information concerning an event, a single event on the 3rd of May, should acquit you of all of these other charges that were the substance of your trial, and your Defence, and your conviction.  You were never accused of wrongdoing on the 3rd of May, were you? 
A.	Well, there's also the fact that I think the testimony of Deme revealed that I never had the intention.  And maybe -- I think we are -- and this is my point of view -- and if it wasn't important the Prosecutor couldn't have acted towards hiding Amadou.  And what about the case -- I did not complete my answer because what I wanted to say was that after Congo -- or after Rwanda, he was taken to Congo, where he was followed.

	But I want to remind you that I got to know my president -- the president of the chamber that judged me was a Senegalese.  And as -- and just like Captain Amadou Deme they -- they will ask -- they -- they knew themselves it would have been much easier in the interests of justice for Amadou to be identified, but here.

Now talking about the period when I identified him in Congo, I told my investigators when they came back here they were all dismissed, their contracts were terminated because of that.  I think that the importance of Mr. Amadou is very, very -- it is crucial, because it was he who was going to prove that I did not have the intention -- I never had any intention of exterminating the -- the Tutsis' ethnic group, and that is the truth.  You are saying that it was on the 3rd of May.  But even before that he himself met me a number of times.  He came to Amgar.  He even said that there at Amgar he never found anything extraordinary, anything special, but the business that I was carrying out myself.  And so the Prosecutor cannot pretend that he wasn't of any critical use for my testimony.  

But, contrarily, my testimony will remain entire, and -- and it will be faulty so long as the testimony of Amadou is not taken into consideration here in the trial.  
Q.	In any case, Mr. Rutaganda, during your trial you offered the same lengthy description of your whereabouts in April that you gave to this Chamber about going to Gitarama and not being in Kigali after the 11th of April, and the Trial Chamber discounted all of that.  
Paragraph 298 of its judgement, it found the Prosecution witnesses to be credible and found your defence of alibi to have been an afterthought which only came to light after the Prosecution had closed its case and based on its assessment of all of the evidence in the trial, convicted you of the massacres that took place at ETO, l'École technique officielle, on the 11th of April where thousands of Tutsis were killed.  They were killed at the school.  Those that survived, or some of them, were removed to Nyanza, people were killed there.  And at both locations you were on the scene and are alleged to have either controlled the Interahamwe or ordered them to attack the Tutsi.  

And this is at paragraphs 299, 301 and 302, and 304, of the Chamber's judgement.  There is nothing that Amadou Deme would have to contribute to those allegations, or defending you against those charges, is there, on the 11th of April?
A.	No.  Amadou Deme was not a witness to the events of the 11th of April.  I personally, I was not a witness.  And maybe that is why I have the witness of -- only denying that I was not there.  

However, when the Prosecutor puts forward the -- his story, or the decision of the -- the sentence of the Trial Chamber that the alibi which I put forward had been mounted after presentation of the evidence by the Prosecutor, I must tell you that this approach totally undermined all the arguments put forward by the Defence, because, in other words, I was accused of having mounted the defence in light of that which was -- I was accused of.  

We put -- we brought these arguments at the appeals, and if the Prosecutor was more honest he would be telling the -- the Trial Chamber what the trial -- the Appeals Chamber came up with.  

But briefly, the Appeals Chamber stated that the first -- the charge -- the Trial Chamber should not have rejected the alibi that we had submitted about the 11th, and that the fact that they talked about "concocting of evidence", if I can use the term, was not real because the alibi was presented much before the beginning of the trial.  The facts are there.  

And I must add to all this the fact that I was not at Kicukiro on the 11th.  On the 11th I was on my way home.  I have lengthily established or narrated this -- this trip and the circumstances of that trip.  

But contrarily, the Prosecutor, since May 1997, that is two months after the beginning of my trial, heard the testimonies whereby I never went to Kicukiro.  He heard the testimonies.  But he had this information, but he hid this information.  Your Honours, he hid it.  It was only recently that mistakenly by chance I stumbled upon the information, because he wanted to say that which we know.  He hid it.  And even the person who give their testimony at the end of the day became an employee of the Prosecutor, which means that the Prosecutor knew that I was not at Kicukiro.  And he appeared before the -- here to defend -- that this is contrary to what he knew.

And so even here, that's what he is doing.  I was not at Kicukiro.  I did not participate in the massacres which allegedly or supposedly occurred at Kicukiro.  I did not tell anybody.  I wasn't there.  I had gone to my home with my family.  The opportunity will come forth when I will put these things clearly before the trial -- before the Appeals Chamber.  

But unless he can contradict me on this one, if he wants proof I can find them and show you that the Prosecutor had elements to prove that I did not go to -- I was not in Kicukiro, I did not participate in those events.  And despite that he defended the contrary.  In other words, that the Prosecutor misled the Tribunal.  
Q.	Well, thank you for your responses, Mr. Rutaganda.  I think we have covered a -- a good deal of ground and you've had an opportunity to defend yourself, once again, through your testimony in this trial.  But I have no further questions for you.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
And I thank the Court for its indulgence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Mr. Robinson, do you have any redirect?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I do, Mr. President.  Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, we'll just start by talking about your situation as a person convicted by a Trial Chamber, confirmed by the Appeals Chamber, and yet you are here saying that you're innocent.  And you're not the first that this Chamber has heard.  Kajelijeli, Semanza, Niyitegeka.  And they'll hear more.  

So, what's the reality?  Is it a bunch of hardheads who won't admit what they did, or is there some problem in this Tribunal? 
A.	As a matter of fact, what I just said a few minutes ago, I believe that here at the Tribunal the greatest problem is that the burden of proof provided to the Tribunal is not so.  People sit down, concoct evidence, table it before the judges.  If they succeed in their game, the judges believe them, consider them as credible, and on that basis the accused persons are condemned to life sentences.  

If there is anything that hurts me the most, it is not the fact that I am in prison, but rather the fact that I am in prison for things that I never did.  It is easy for someone who took up a gun, burgled a bank and is arrested, who is imprisoned, who will tell his family members, "You see, I am here.  I am suffering for my crimes."  

But, grab a load of people, young people here and there, and coach them on that which they should say before the judges, and from there people are sentenced to life.  It is a very, very difficult thing.  And particularly on the basis of the knowledge of what I did, I am saying this for myself.  And even for others for whom -- even for others with whom I was, I cannot say necessarily for all the others.  

Of course there were criminals in what happened in Rwanda, people who hurt others, but innocent persons should also be identified and rewarded for what they did.  

When I was in Zambia I granted an interview to a CNN journalist known as Kaunda (phonetic).  He asked me questions on the Tribunal.  I told him that I was happy that the Tribunal had been put in place.  And that was shortly before I was arrested.  I thought that I would be called as a hero.  I believed that I was -- would be considered as someone who had taken care of human life.  I always respected each one's right to life.  I learnt from my church and my religious beliefs that no, you should never hurt anyone.  I grew up in an environment where my parents were with Tutsis in births and death ceremonies, and nobody ever taught me that I should hate a Tutsi or that I should hurt whosoever.  

I was involved in business.  I was also working within the party.  I worked with the Interahamwes.  But I never had an iota of a thought of planning or hurting anyone.  The examples are legion.  And if I had to come -- to name them all, we would not have enough time to do so right here. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask the registrar to show Exhibit D. NZ5 to everybody, including the witness.  

While he is doing that, I would like to call all of our attention to item number 13 in the Prosecutor's bundle.  This was annexes to Mr. Rutaganda's book.  And the first pages are the membership cards.  And then the first document after the membership card was a letter on the 27th of May 1992 signed by five members of the -- the five officers of the national Interahamwe committee.  

And then the next in that bundle was the letter of 1994 signed by all of the persons associated with the committee, including the conseillers.  And Mr. Webster put forth the thesis that because the letter of 27 May 1992 had been signed only by the five officers, that that meant that the conseillers had not existed until sometime after that and prior to early 1994.  
And D. NZ number 5 is also a letter signed by the national committee of the Interahamwe.  And it's dated in March of 1992.  And I would like the witness to look at it and see what signatures are present on that document.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would Counsel Robinson turn off his microphone.  There is a noise at the back which is very disturbing to the interpreters.  Thank you very much, Counsel.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, you now see Exhibit D. NZ5, which is a letter from the Interahamwe committee.  Do you have that yet?  It is a letter from the Interahamwe committee dated March of 1992.  It's true, is it not, that that's signed not only by the five officers, but by the conseillers; correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Some of the people have even dated their signature as the 25th of March 1992; correct? 
A.	Secretary Mbarushimana, Eugène, dates his letter for the 25th of March 1992.  I in fact explained that the committee was not bound.  Each time there was a meeting it send -- a letter was sent -- was not supposed to call the conseillers.  That's what I said to the Prosecutor.  
Q.	And what does this letter do to the Prosecutor's thesis that the conseillers did not exist until sometime after May of 1992? 
A.	This letter confirms my statement that the group of conseillers was only put in place -- was put in place well before May 1992.  I even said that during a second meeting with the president of the party we were all gathered together with the body of conseillers.  They were in place even before May 1992.  In fact, around December 1991.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. Rutaganda.  I have no further questions.  

And, Mr. President, I would ask that Mr. Rutaganda be allowed to greet the three Accused, now that he has completed his testimony.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Rutaganda, this has completed your testimony before the Tribunal in this case.  
THE WITNESS:  
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I beg your pardon.  You wish to say something?  You are trying to attract my attention.  I was telling you that -- that your testimony is now completed. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, I wish to say something. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Oh, you wish to say something.  Yes.  What is it? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, Your Honours, well, while we are at the end of my contribution, I -- I would be remiss were I to leave this witness box without thanking you.  I wish to thank you for the manner in which you conducted the proceedings.  

And also thank the parties here gathered, be they the Prosecution or the Defence.  And thank you for your kindness.  

I believe I have made my contribution as best possible regarding the information that I know concerning the tragic and unfortunate events that occurred in my -- in our country in 1994.  

All I wish to ask you, Mr. President, and as -- as -- to quote Aristotle, the philosopher.  He said -- I realised that that is a discipline which characterises the proceedings here, and I wish to let you know that I return happy.  

And to close I wish to ask you, in your capacity as the President of this Tribunal, to keep an eye -- to keep an eye -- a close eye on those who have been sentenced and sent to Mali and Benin by this Tribunal, particularly at this moment when it is the beginning of our stay there.  We really feel -- really need you to have an eye on the conditions in which we are living so that nothing bad happens.  

It -- I am sorry if, from time to time, sometimes I was impolite, also a bit hard in my responses, or when I was too fast for the verbatim reporters, I am sorry about that.  But may the truth prevail and may injustice be stamped out.  And may the right -- the true criminals be brought to justice, identified and penalised.  

On that note, Mr. President, I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I was -- had been about to thank you for giving testimony and assisting the Tribunal in its work.  And I do that now.  The registrar will make arrangements to allow you to visit the accused persons.  

Yes.  Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It's nothing that would involve the witness, Your Honour.  I did discuss with Mr. Robinson my suggestion of which exhibits should be admitted.  And we can address that now or after lunch at the Court's discretion.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there any controversy?  
MR. WEBSTER:
With respect to two items, but it shouldn't require much argument.  If the Court does not agree with my submission, it can simply mark them for identification.  I don't think it will be a -- a lengthy discussion. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can do that now then.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  And -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness can be excused, if he wishes.
(Witness excused)
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll mention them by the document number I gave them in my bundle.  And I'll start with those that are non-controversial, as I understand my exchange with Mr. Robinson.  

It would be excerpt number 1 in both French and English of the witness's testimony in April 1999.  Excerpt number 5, both in English and French.  Excerpt number 6, in both languages.  

Document number 12, which is one portion from the witness's pamphlet.  Document number 15, which is the article from The Observer.  I don't think I discussed this specific document with Mr. Robinson.  And I missed it when I had my conversation with him, but it's the article we discussed, which is an interview with Robert Kajuga.  Document number 19 is the controversial document.  It's the -- an excerpt of the expert report from Augustin Ndindiliyimana.  

Document number 22, which is a letter from the MDR secretariat in Kanombe, which Mr. Robinson opposes.  And then the excerpt from the Trial Chamber judgement of the 6th of December 1999, which is document number 34.  

So I think the only things we need to discuss are documents 15, 19 and 22.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  That's correct.  Documents 15, 19 and 22 were in -- not adopted by the witness.  They were simply put to him as information coming from third parties.  

Fifteen, the -- are the newspaper article about the statements of Robert Kajuga to a reporter.  Nineteen, comments by General Ndindiliyimana and a tract that he wrote.  And 22, a letter that had been written by some MDR letter -- MDR members in Butare, or in -- in some part of Rwanda.  

So, based on your past practice, statements of third parties which are not adopted by the witness are not admissible and I think you can mark them for identification and you would be acting consistently with the practice you developed in the Chamber. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'd suggest that Mr. Robinson's reasoning may be appropriate for documents 19 and 22, but not for 15, which is the newspaper article.  The Chamber in the past has questioned whether they are -- newspaper articles are reliable.  But it has never taken a firm position on whether they could not be admitted because a witness doesn't adopt its contents.  And here I'm suggesting that the -- the reason it should be admitted is precisely because the witness disagreed with its contents.  The Chamber does not have to accept the veracity of a newspaper article, but it certainly should be considered.  

With respect to document number 22, we can address that through another witness, I have no opposition.  If it is problematic for the Chamber to give it an ID number and I'll address it again through another witness, without prejudice I hope for raising it again.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Webster, we -- we have decided we should mark all three for identification.  

It is time to take our luncheon break now.  Sorry, and I -- and we admit the other -- other exhibits.  

And, Mr. Issa, could you give them exhibit numbers, please.  
MR. MJUI:  
Thank you, Your Honour.  I would like to first see the Prosecutor and arrange the documents.  Then after lunch I will mention the number, Your Honour.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We thank you very much.  That will be acceptable.  

Mr. Robinson, what's the status of your next witness? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Colonel Renzaho is our next witness.  He's here, ready to go.  It will take quite a while for his testimony to be concluded, so we will be with him for the balance of the week and some part of next week. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you are ready to start this afternoon? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I am. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
We will take our luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1232H to 1408H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everybody.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, Colonel Renzaho is present now, and before he begins his testimony I have a few things I would like to raise with the Chamber.  And can I do that now?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
One of them, the -- of which you gave us notice, the Amadou subpoena, we would prefer if you did that tomorrow morning. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine.  Okay.  

The other one I would like to -- I didn't give any notice of because it has just come to my attention and
I -- but I think it is necessary to address it now.  

Now that Mr. Rutaganda has completed his testimony he will be returned to Benin in due course, which I presume will be relatively quickly.  But it would be very useful if when he goes -- when he is delivered back to Benin, if Juvénal Rugambarara can be brought here to give his testimony.  

On the 7th of April you granted our motion to vary the witness list so that Mr. Rugambarara can be added to the list.  On the 8th of April I wrote a letter to the Mali ministry of defence to request their approval of his transfer and I filed a motion on the 9th of April, our fourth motion for a transfer of a witness from Benin.  And I would ask that you grant that motion subject to the confirmation that the Malian authorities can -- excuse me, that the Benin authorities can make that he is not needed for court proceedings in their jurisdiction so that WVSS can bring him to Arusha when it drops Rutaganda off.  

And I'm asking that because the testimony of Mr. Rutaganda went a little bit more quickly than I expected and it's possible that, at the end of next week or the beginning of the week after, we may have a one-day hiatus in witnesses, because one of my witnesses that's scheduled can't testify until her lawyer arrives.  

So, in order to avoid any delay I'm asking the Chamber to issue that written order granting my motion so the wheels can be put in motion to bring Mr. Rugambarara here and allow him to testify in the event that we -- we have this gap. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Well anything, Mr. Prosecutor?  Nothing.  

Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  We will address that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  

Now, we -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the registrar is claiming his time for the exhibits to be admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much.

Now, we are ready to hear Mr. Colonel Renzaho.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning (sic), Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you begin your testimony, we have the formality of your taking an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now assist you to do that. 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Declaration made by Tharcisse Renzaho in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Now, you'll give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by counsel designated for that purpose.  And you'll respond first of all to Mr. Robinson, as counsel for Joseph Nzirorera.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
THARCISSE RENZAHO, 
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Colonel Renzaho. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	I've asked that a personal information sheet be placed in front of you.  Can you look at it and tell us if it's correct? 
A.	Yes.  It is correct, Counsel. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that that document be admitted as D. NZ775. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ775 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness can be shown document number 2 in my bundle, which is a curriculum vitae.
THE WITNESS:  
Yes.  The document is correct.  
(Pages 31 to 42 by Deirdre O'Mahony)




























1415H
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this CV be admitted as D. NZ776.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ776 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Also for the information of Mr. Issa, possibly this afternoon we'll use Exhibits D. NZ178 and 179 and 312.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Colonel Renzaho, can you tell us, were you appointed préfet of Kigali at some point? 
A.	That's correct.  I was appointed préfet of Kigali on the 5th of October 1990. 
Q.	Thank you.  And now we have your CV which shows all the different posts that you held in the military prior to being appointed préfet.  And is it true that a number of your posts involved administration?  
A.	I can't put it that way.  I believe that in all careers there is a time for doing something, and you also need experience to do certain other things.  But when I take a look at this, what I find is that there are years I spent in the units in the capacity of an officer, small units such as platoons, because a noncommissioned officer can also -- can only command a platoon.  

But I progressed my career and, in the meantime, the administrative offices that I occupied here and there.  But I would say the administrative function was not the central issue that should be highlighted in a career such as mine. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber the circumstances under which you were appointed préfet on the 5th of October 1990.
A.	On the 10th of October.  Rather --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
On the 5th of October 1990, at the time I was an officer in the ministry of national defence, and I was involved with administration.  My office was for studies and programmes, and the war broke out at the time when I was in that office.  And the progress of combat and the operational situation was such that the officers of the ministry of national defence were sent to the army chief of staff to reinforce it.  

And I was transferred to the operations office.  And on -- that was on the 4th in the afternoon.  I was sent on mission that same evening.  And that night around 1, maybe 1:30 a.m. -- I'm talking about the night of the 4th breaking 5th -- there were clashes in Kigali.  And we spent the rest of the night on alert wondering where those shots could have come from and disturbed this quiet in the city because you heard gunshots from everywhere.

So we stayed awake till the morning.  Of course, during that time I continued to work because the work of the army command staff does not stop.  And I even carried on working the following day before midday.  And it was around 12 noon that a colleague of mine came and told me that he had just heard the national radio, Radio Rwanda, that is, and that he had had the feeling that my name had been mentioned in a communiqué by the council of ministers.

So I was curious, and I wanted to know what it was all about.  And he told me that I had just been appointed préfet in -- the préfet of the city of Kigali.  That entity did not exist before but had just been voted into law, but the entity had not yet been set up.  It had not been functional yet.  Those are the circumstances under which I was appointed préfet.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So you were the first préfet of Kigali-ville?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And do you know why a military officer was appointed as préfet?
A.	You can't know what's happening in the mind of God, but there was nothing surprising, as far as that was concerned, because officers -- officers, generally speaking, in the country used to occupy that -- used to occupy -- and for a very long time -- civilian functions.

And the stature of officers allowed them to do so as well as the fundamental law of the civil service.  So I was not surprised.  But maybe considering the peculiar circumstances we were in, I was wondering --because we were at war and what I expected was to go to the front.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, after the RPF attack on the 1st of October 1990, were a number of people arrested in Rwanda as suspected accomplices of the RPF? 
A.	The shoot out led to a reaction by the security cells.  And early in the morning, even before -- before the sun was up, some people had already been arrested.  So I confirm here that the shoot out in Kigali on the night of the 4th to the 5th led to the arrest of people who were suspected to be conniving with the RPF. 
Q.	It's been said by some people that that shoot out was a fake attack; is that true? 
A.	Counsel, the fact is that from the 1st of October, the country -- the 1st of October 1990, the country had been at war.  Had such an incident occurred during a time of peace, many people would have been surprised.  But at a time of war, as it was the case -- and maybe I'll have a chance to deal with this later on -- everything was -- including everything, including shoot outs within Kigali, were likely.  With regard -- and since we are talking about hypotheses -- and hypotheses are based on intelligence.

Now, with regard to that day in the morning before midday, we had received from reliable sources information with respect to a surprise attack on Kigali.  It wasn't an appropriate moment, but the likelihood that that would happen that night was certain.  I am telling the Chamber what I wasn't able to garner with regard to that incident.  

So you had information that was available, but how things were going to unfold -- I know nothing about that.  But what I can say is that you can see that after midnight you had that shoot out that went on until around 4 a.m.  Thank you. 
Q.	And approximately how many people were arrested in Kigali in the following days as being suspected accomplices of the RPF? 
A.	I believe that the arrests were done in the heat of the shoot out.  So it was early in the morning that these people were arrested, meaning that they had some idea, a clue, about the people involved.  Otherwise, it was an operation that was very difficult to describe.  But the arrests started almost immediately afterwards, that is to say, on the morning of the 5th at dawn.  It didn't take long.  Because I believe that on the 5th to the 6th, the 7th, those arrests had practically ended, people had come together, and it was done. 
Q.	And about how many people were arrested in Kigali? 
A.	Personally, I didn't assess the situation, but you've had this in many documents; namely, that you had about 8,000 people arrested and 8,000 all over the country, not only in Kigali.  Clearly you must have another question to that, but a figure -- such a figure is not normal, and clearly it shows that -- that people had lost their calm.  They were nervous.  

But in any event, it was not -- it was not something that indicated that the service had actually arrested the people who had been specified and identified as having connived with the RPF.  It would appear that the services exaggerated things. 
Q.	And what steps did you take as préfet, if any, to assist in releasing some of those people after they had been arrested? 
A.	I would admit to you that the matter was immediately taken into control by the government which set up a commission under the auspices of the minister of justice with assistance of some magistrates.  And in my position, of course, as having just been appointed into an entity which had just been set up, I had no civil servants and no means at my disposal, and it was difficult to run the affairs of the city.  

So my direct participation in the reaction was not significant.  However, in the days subsequent to that, we set up some workers in the body of the council, especially with regard to security.  And all we could do was to express our opinion and assist the commission in charge.  And that is the framework within which we worked in view of clarifying some situations, for example, people who had -- who were well known and whose conduct was well known.  

So these investigations were carried out within the framework of this préfectoral body.  And we submitted the information to the relevant quarters, and it was sent to -- and so the people who had been arrested for no particular reason were released.  And of course, they reduced the number of people that had been arrested.  That is how we were involved.  Thank you. 
Q.	And what was the name of the minister of justice who was in charge of that commission? 
A.	I don't know, but with time memory might have failed me.  But it was Munya -- I don't know.  Munya -- 
Q.	Was a man named Nkubito involved with that commission? 
A.	Yes.  He was a member of the commission.  Yes.  That is correct. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us how many communes were in the préfecture of Kigali-ville.
A.	There were three:  Nyarugenge, Kacyiru, and Kicukiro. 
Q.	And did they each have a bourgmestre? 
A.	Yes.  Correct.  Yes.  Correct. 
Q.	And within those communes, were there secteurs? 
A.	Yes.  It might be rather fastidious to name the secteurs, but I can mention the number.  There were 
	19 secteurs in number with a significant number in the original commune, so to speak, which is Nyarugenge commune.  That is where the city was born, and then it spread to other communes as it expanded.

Nyarugenge commune alone had ten secteurs, and the nine others were divided between Kacyiru and Kicukiro.  Kacyiru, by the way, had more secteurs than Kicukiro. 
Q.	Now, when you became préfet, were there people already in the posts of bourgmestre and conseiller, or did you have to appoint some people? 
A.	Thank you for that question.  When I was appointed, it was on the same day that three bourgmestres were appointed.  Bourgmestres were ordinarily appointed by the president of the republic.  So we took the oath of office together on the 5th in the afternoon at about 16 hours 30. 
Q.	And what about the conseiller?
A.	As for the conseiller, they were elected.  So the situation is somewhat peculiar with the creation of Kigali town which somehow affected some of the parts of Kigali-rural.  But the centre was at Nyarugenge, and the secteurs that were under the city did not raise any particular problem.

So all the secteurs of Nyarugenge, Kicukiro, and Kacyiru communes had conseillers who had already been elected, who were already in position, probably in 198 -- I don't know what.  So I found them already in office. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, we've heard testimony that in 1991 the multiparty system came into effect in Rwanda.  And can you tell us whether or not a préfet or a bourgmestre or a conseiller was allowed to be a member of a political party and also what duties or what obligations they had as part of the administration.
A.	Thank you for the question.  In July 1991, Rwanda registered a number of political parties pursuant to the law on political parties that had just been enacted.  Rwandans were free to join any political party of their choice.  Those who did not feel otherwise were free to join political parties.

Bourgmestres, conseillers, and the basic structures were handled by civilian functionaries who were free to join any political party of their choice.  Those civil servants were free to join any political party of their choice, and they did.

Now, as for the position or behaviour of the administration within the context of multiparty politics, the instructions in place were very clear, namely, that the administration was designed to serve all the people without distinction irrespective of political leaning.  It was the duty of the administration to serve the people in all neutrality.  The instructions and directives of the prime minister in that regard were issued in 1992 I believe.  This may need to be confirmed.  

It was towards the end of the year.  I don't have the exact date, but the prime minister did issue a directive to confirm that position.  I, therefore, believe that I was the one with a problem because I was a soldier, a senior soldier.  And in that capacity, I was not free to join any political party of my choice.  This is prohibited for us soldiers.  

There is even a specific provision, if I am not mistaken, in the rules of discipline to that effect and also a similar provision in the law on political parties to the extent that the armed forces were under an obligation to be neutral.  I do not know if I have clearly answered your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Yes, you have.

Did you yourself join any political party in the multiparty system?
A.	I was not authorised to join any political party except, if I chose to give up my position as a 
	senior military official, then I would be free to join any party of my choice.  That was a particular status that I occupied working with the ministry of home affairs as a civil servant.

So my career profile was such that my file was being managed jointly by the army and the ministry of home affairs.  Up until 1994, up to the end, I did not give up my special status as 
senior military officer.  So I did not belong to any political party. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the registrar could show Colonel Renzaho document number 3 in my 
	packet of materials, please.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, do you recognise this letter? 
A.	Yes, I do.  And by the way, it bears my signature.  And my signature hasn't changed since then. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  It's dated the 7th of November 1991, and it's a letter from you to the 
	secretary general to the central service.  And can you tell us, what was the gist of this letter?  
A.	The information in the letter is quite important, and it is for the attention of the 
	central intelligence service, at least to the boss of that service.  The information pertains to some tracts that had been distributed in some secteurs and communes and in some communes in Kigali-rural which shared boundaries with the Kigali préfecture.  There were such tracts that had been distributed in Kicukiro commune as well.

There was information in those documents about threats against a number of persons and some 
ethnic tension that was alleged to be brewing.  So those who issued those tracts may have intended to intimidate their Tutsi neighbours.  And since this activity covered two préfectures, we did not have the administrative capacity to effect other préfectures.  

So we felt that it was urgent to bring this matter to the attention of the intelligence service which had the necessary resources to act, to conduct investigations, and propose measures that would stem on the evil in the bud as a preventive measure.  This, in broad strokes, is the content of that letter.

However, since I have the floor, let me tell the Court that there is no worse element against peace than war.  All of this arose within the context of war.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this letter be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ777. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ777 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, we've had evidence that at end of 1981 a government was established called the Nsanzimana government and that the opposition -- the other political parties besides the MRND demonstrated against that in Kigali.  

Do you recall an incident in January 1992 which is known as ville morte?
A.	Thank you very much.  It is true we experienced a disastrous political situation.  And I say so to the extent that it was further compounded by the war that we were going through.  So for me this was a very difficult situation.  

However, the appointment of Prime Minister Nsanzimana gave rise to protests, a lot of protests, within the political parties, within opposition political parties.  Then they pulled together in a coalition known as the coordination committee which they set up at that time known as the democratic forces for change.

Within that small span of time he spent at the prime minister's office, there was a frequency of violent demonstrations that obtained.  And they conducted these demonstrations even without authorisation, some of them quite spontaneously, leading to sometimes quite significant damage and destruction.

And the whole reason behind that was to call for the change of the prime minister maybe.  But along with other persons, we monitored this situation carefully and realised that maybe there was a broader background to this.  

But the ville morte or ghost town operation you referred to is not just one day.  It was from the end of February right to the end of March and even throughout the negotiations when I still noticed that there were demonstrations within the town sometimes cutting off roads into the city.  And the supplies from various parts of the city would not be able to access the city, and that made things very difficult.

So these demonstrations were in reaction to the appointment of the Nsanzimana government, and that is how the political parties came into negotiation leading up to the protocol of the 6th of April which gave rise to the setting up of the government that took office on the 16th of April 1992.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now, we've had evidence that that government led by Prime Minister Dismas Nsengiyaremye of the MDR party was established on the 16th of April 1992.  After that time did the violence in Kigali stop?
A.	Not at all.  Absolutely not.  Maybe I disappoint you in giving this answer, but I am bound to say so.  Violence did not come to an end because of the creation of the coalition government.  In fact, it is the contrary that happened.  

Things had been clarified, the opposition was in place, and government was in place, and we knew who was in what position.  But things got even more complicated, and Kigali-ville experienced very difficult times, more so because of the rivalry between political parties as they struggled to attract the greatest number of supporters and members.

There was fighting among the youth wings of the parties pitted against each other, and that was the situation that worsened and got even worse until April 1994.  So what I'm saying is that there must have been another reason behind these things which must be further clarified.  And I believe that the only reason is that this was our way of prosecuting the war.

The war at the borders was also taking place within the country.  And we were in the capital city.  And rather than a war between soldiers and their guns, there was this kind of internal war that was going on within the city.  And of course, it did involve members or supporters of the RPF.  

Now, to answer your question directly, after the creation of the coalition government on the 
16th of April 1992, social peace did not return to the country.  Instead political parties continued to stir agitations within the country.  And this would be further compounded by the disturbulation (sic) and activities undertaken by the RPF.

In that context, therefore, it is clear that the purpose or the objective of the strategy was to spark an insurrection or to take power by -- take power by force, and that is what led to the very extraordinary situation that we experienced in our country.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the witness can now be shown documents 4, 6, and 7 in my packet.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, I've selected some examples of communications that you had during this 
	1992 period about the problem between or among political parties, and I just want to go through them briefly.

Looking at number 4, which is a letter dated the 26th of May 1992 to the commandant of the 
Kigali group, do you see your signature on that document?  
A.	Yes.  I can see my signature. 
Q.	And what's the gist of that letter that you wrote? 
A.	The letter seeks to draw the attention of the gendarmerie to a rally of the MDR party on 
the 30th of May 1992 scheduled for Kimisagara, which is a secteur of Kigali-ville in 
Nyarugenge commune.  

The secteur was having some problems, and there had been a previous incident in that secteur during which someone was killed by -- and once again, unfortunately, I have to mention this.  It is a matter of Hutu and Tutsi ethnicity issues that we did not even know about before these things began to happen.

So the person who was killed was a Hutu, and that Hutu was killed by some young Tutsis.  And word had it that the incident had already sparked some tension.  So the MDR youth in that location and at that time and given the prevailing tension that we are all aware of asked us to take all necessary precautionary measures and bring along the necessary forces of law and order to provide protection and security in order to avoid any further problems.  This is the thrust of that letter.  Thank you. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'd ask that that letter be admitted as D. NZ778.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ778 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, the next document, which is number 6 in my packet, is a letter dated the 18th of September 1992 from the préfet to Froduald Karamira, president of the MDR party in Kigali-ville préfecture.

Did you send this letter?
A.	The letter is signed by my collaborator who was in charge of political affairs, and it emanated from the préfecture, and it bears the seal of the prefecture, which I do recognise.  
(Pages 43 to 51 by Kelly Surina)

























1500H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you tell us what is the gist of this letter.  
A.	It is an answer to a political party which was notifying -- because it is a notification, not an application.  And there was a law that allowed the préfet to ensure security with respect to peaceful rallies.  And I believe that here the MDR was about to organise a meeting in Nyamirambo, and on that same day, there was a rally which had been authorised to be held in Remera.  

And this letter indeed notifies that the simultaneous holding of two rallies by rival political parties, considering the experience we had had under those circumstances, call -- was a source of risk, because often there was an outbreak of fighting when two rival groups met after the end of the rally.  

So we're telling Mr. Karemera (sic) that another organisation had been authorised to hold a rally in Remera.  And considering what had happened before, which we no longer wanted, that it was not a good thing that two events -- which were likely to set two rival groups in confrontation for no good reason.  That is what he means.  It is Karamira.  Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that document number 6 in my bundle be admitted as D. NZ779. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ779 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And turning to document number 7, a letter dated the 8th of November 1992 from the préfet to 
	Jean Habyarimana, president of the MRND for Kigali préfecture, can you tell us, is that a letter that was sent by the préfet?  And if so, what is the gist of that letter?  
A.	Yes.  I signed that letter myself.  And I did send it. 
Q.	And what is the gist of that later? 
A.	It is in connection with security issues in the Nyakabanda secteur in the Kicukiro commune in Kigali where the MRND youth wing were clashing with the MDR youth wing.  And at times you would have fightings, and we had to intervene.  From time to time, we had to arrest some people and sent them to the public prosecution -- prosecutor's office.  

And this letter is an appeal to the officials of the MRND in Kigali to ensure the implementation and to ensure that peace was restored, because action and reaction had now been commonplace, and that way we didn't have to arrest one or two people for attacking another person in order to restore peace.  Because we truly had to ensure follow-up for the restoration of peace, because anything that was done on one camp would lead to reprisals from another -- the other side, and this would lead to violence.  And so the content of this letter is in that regard. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that document number 7 be admitted as D. NZ780. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ780 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Colonel Renzaho, since you were dealing on a regular basis with clashes among political parties during this period, '92, '93, and early 1994, can you tell us, what relative responsibility existed among the various parties:  The MRND, the PL, PSD, and MRND (sic)?  
A.	I didn't quite understand your question.  You mean responsibility with regard to the clashes, the fighting, or the insecurity?  
Q.	Yes, with -- with respect to the clashes.  Who was responsible primarily for those clashes?  Was it any particular one of those youth wings, or were they all equally responsible?  Can you -- since you were the préfet, you had this perspective of trying to stop these clashes.  Tell us, what was the relative responsibility of the different parties? 
A.	Once more, Counsel, I believe that the question has to be approached with realism and considering the context which we were in.  As a matter of fact, you have -- you have set some premises -- the setting up of political parties, their activities, the first government that failed, the coalition government, which does not succeed in stabilising the situation, which, rather, provokes an internal spiralling that causes an uprising in the entire country.  

And with -- with respect to the youth wings of political parties, I have read a lot on that, and I found a lot of remarks and comments from in -- foreign observers.  But I would like to appeal to the Trial Chamber maybe to -- to grant me leave to express my experience, because I was a witness.  And if I have -- my hair has -- if I have become bald, it is partly because of that.  

I believe that we need to situate ourselves within the perspective of fighting for power.  We have to approach this from the perspective that people were not aligning themselves with this democratic process when they were seeking to topple the power -- the people in power as fast as possible and then, subsequently, to think about what was to be done.  That is what you have to have behind -- in mind.  

Now, political parties set up their youth wings.  We noticed the first youth wing movement in the MDR.  This is the -- the -- that is the youth wing which is the precursor, the earliest youth wing.  All the people don't talk about it, and you cannot see any -- anywhere that the JDR did some -- one thing or another.  

Now, after the coalition government was set up, there was a policy that was introduced known as nkohoza (sic), in which people, such as ourselves who were in administrator -- administration, came under threat and were fragilised:  Officials, préfets, sous-préfets, bourgmestres, secteur conseillers, even to the grass roots.  Everyone who had to deal with the population were the main target of the people who wanted to take over control of the people.  So -- so simply asking -- simply by asking them if they wanted to become members of the party or not -- and people were attacked, and so on and so forth.  

So within political parties, all political parties try for -- with respect to self-defence or to self-protection, I believe that there was some form of protect -- of competition within political parties to set up youth wings.  And the youth -- it is always a nice thing to have youth around you because they are dynamic, there's a lot of animation during rallies, and they do all sorts of things.  But I believe that we cannot set aset -- set aside the reflex of self-defence.  

That is how the MRND set up their MR -- their Interahamwe within the framework of self-defence -- defence, because people were being attacked.  You could see it from the start.  From the -- from the onset it was almost a one-way movement.  Then -- then people, they became liberated, and they changed and metamorphosised, and in late 1992, early 1993, things were horrible because it became a sort of talk of war.  Each youth wing were rive -- were fighting the other youth wing.  

That is why I'm telling the Trial Chamber that things could not move in one direction because those people were starting an action which provoked a reverse action.  And it was a -- a cycle.  And on 
one side you had the Imbokom -- makombozi (sic) of the -- the -- the JPR.  Then you have the 
FP (sic) youth wing.  On the other side you had the Interahamwe of the MRND.  Subsequently, they -- they metamorphosised, the Inomozamugambi (sic).

And so it was hell in the city because these were forces on the field which were fighting each other.  And there were reprisals, and it was a really deplorable situation.  

But what I noticed is that people thought that there was only one youth wing, the Interahamwe, which was -- was causing a lot of disruption.  And -- and that is not true. 
Q.	Can you tell us, during this period what were the acts of the RPF that contributed to insecurity in Kigali? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The acts of the RPF in Kigali was the urban guerrilla.  And that was from the onset of the war.  But the first serious incident was -- was in late 1991 with the explosion of the -- of a vehicle at the central station, explosions in newspaper kiosks, and other such incidents which occurred here and there in neighbourhoods in Kigali. 
Q.	How did you know it was the RPF which was behind those explosions and incidents? 
A.	At that time I had to answer such a question.  That is why you see me the way I look.  Well, let me answer you directly, Counsel.  

We were aware that those incidents were caused by the RPF, firstly, because of the nature of the weapons which were used.  The weap -- the weapons, the military weapons, were 
anti-personnel mines, anti-tank mines, which had writings indicating where the weapons had been manufactured as well as the batch which was supplied to a country, which subsequently provided the -- the weapons.  I talked about M3 anti-armoured vehicle mines.  

You also had the manner in which they were launched, from a distance.  And that was something which was new, which allowed terrorists to place the mine and then to have it explode after a while, the person who placed the bomb having fled.  And this caused lots of destruction.  

So everywhere these incidents were identified and analysed -- all presented the same characteristics in the same manner in which the anti-armoured vehicle mines -- were examined by French specialists who were working for the centre for criminal investigation and documentations, leading to a publication which -- which was -- is an extract of which is found in Professor Lugan's book, and the title of the book is Rwanda, counter-investigation on the genocide.  It's around page two hundred and something.  

So this is one of the specific indications with respect to the nature of the weapons which were used.  And I didn't talk about people because people were identified as belong -- as being fighters within the RPF.  

Let me refer you to the Mururu centre where in 1992 -- that was in February or March -- fighters who were entering Rwanda from Bukavu -- opposite Bukavu meant -- were meant to blow up the water reservoir shared by Rwanda, the DRC, and Burundi -- made a mistake and got themselves exploded.  And on them the characteristics of the mines which were found in incidents in -- in Rusombo (sic), in Nyanza, Gitare (sic), Gitarama, and Kigali -- Kigali were found.  And those people were identified.  And subsequently, we arrested some people in Kigali as well who were identified.  

So this was not conjecture.  It was a clear conclusion.  And even the itinerary that was used was 
well known.  And there is absolutely no doubt.  This is undisputable.  It is -- it was part of the war.  Because when I talked about this war, especially with respect to the revolutionary war -- that is part of the revolutionary war.  Because it is a campine -- campaign at military level, a psychological campaign, meant to browbeat and dis -- the fighters and to discredit the -- the government which was unable to protect the people.  And so a revolutionary movement could be raised, and then the country could easily get into chaos.  Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	We've had evidence -- we've had evidence that on the 8th of February 1993 the RPF launched an attack against Rwanda coming close to the capital city of Kigali.  What was the effect of that attack on the city of Kigali? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Disastrous.  The impact was disastrous because up to that time the war was taking place far away from Kigali.  And the offensive pushed back almost one million inhabitants, the first of which were settled in the Nyacyonga, Rucyinge (sic) camps, which was about -- some kilometres by bird's eye view from Kigali.  So you have a population that was more or less middle, average.  In Kigali you had about 250,000 inhabitants in the entire capital.  And then suddenly you have an influx of one million people.  

And the Rwandan people have always been characterised by a high amount of youth and children, children who could no longer go to school.  They were idle.  And there was an influx into the city.  And it increased the number of unemployed.  And then banditry increased.  This was just logical.  So we were undergoing an extremely difficult situation.  And I believe that that offensive, irrespective of the interpretations that can be made of it, was a political disaster. 
Q.	We've had testimony in this trial that in March of 1993 you allegedly informed Bourgmestre Jean Bizimana, Conseiller Amri Karekezi, and Conseiller Gabriel Mbayarehe that the Interahamwe were undergoing military training; is that true? 
A.	That is untrue. 
Q.	Prior to the death of President Habyarimana, did you receive any information that the Interahamwe was receiving military training? 
A.	Where could I have obtained such information?  I tell you it is untrue.  This is a pure fabrication.  And it never took place.  

	And this is something that has already been discussed before this Tribunal to -- to justify the semblance of this information which is a complete lie, a document published on the 14th of May 1992 was used.  This was the day after the founding -- the setting up of the coalition government.  And the document is entitled "Interahamwe za mouvement" or, in quotes, the Interaham -- the interpretation is -- is "the unmovable" -- "the diehard" -- "diehards of the Interahamwe".  And this document is written by my friend Anastase, who I knew and who was a friend of mine.  When I was in military college, he was a good friend of mine.  Because he listed a certain number of names in it and because there are a certain number of strat -- scenarios or strategies to discredit the powers -- the people in power, and in which he stipulates that the Interahamwe movement was supported by a certain number of people, and yours truly is found in it.  And that as far as I was concerned, he says I was in charge of recruiting military reserve officers as well as gendarme reserve -- gendarmes.  Of course, these are pure lies.  
The document has been discussed at length in a trial before this Tribunal.  And I was very surprised to note -- and that is the truth -- I grant you that -- that contrary to the expertise that was provided by late Madam Alison Des Forges claiming that the source -- the appeal from Gasana could only have been authentic.  The Judge felt that it was a rumour and that they could lend no credence to the reliability of the people who were mentioned in this said document.  

So as far as I am concerned, when I saw the corroboration of the statements by ARG by the said document, and after having seen what had happened, I arrived at the conclusion that there must have been a misunderstanding of things, because to talk about military training, I had no -- I was occupying no military function.  To talk about the training of Interahamwe who allegedly were undergoing 
military training, I would like to see proof to believe this.  And that proof was not adduced, including with respect to me.  

When they are saying that I cohabitate -- cohabited with the Interahamwe since 1993; whereas, I was in my own house in Kanombe -- I didn't stay anywhere else.  I lived in that house.  When people tell me that I cohabited with the Interahamwe, with a family of -- of eight people -- of eight and that I took people to the house and friends who visited the house to prove it, I could have gone further -- because in order to go and live in that house, I applied for the necessary authorisation from my superiors.  Because I had an official residence -- and to have left that official residence, I needed to have had a reason to do so.  

Now, the issue here is that the training of the Interahamwe as stipulated in Gasana's book, if he comes here to corroborate what Bizimana has stated here, is baseless.  Up to this moment nothing proved that.  And it could not have been done without attracting the attention of everyone.  We live somewhere in a neighbourhood.  We are not living in the jungle alone.  How would you expect people to visit you and neighbours wouldn't know about it?  That is impossible.  

So -- now, to answer your question more directly, I have never heard about the training of Interahamwe.  And I couldn't even have heard about it.  And to be candid, I have never invited anyone to my office to tell them that we were looking forward to training Interahamwe, true -- truly, cand -- to be candid.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, I'm going to have to ask you to try to attend to the question that has been put to you so that your answers could be more focused to the questions.  A lot of the information that you are giving is not really relevant to the case that we have here at the moment.  And it would be much better if you pay attention to the specific question that you are asked and try to answer it as precisely as possible. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Let me ask one more question before we take our afternoon recess.  And that is that:  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	On the 20th of January 1994, a UNAMIR officer named Frank Claeys reported that Jean-Pierre Turatsinze had told him that he had distributed nine weapons in a blue -- to the Interahamwe in a blue Pajero belonging to you; is that true?  
A.	That's untrue. 
Q.	Do you know Jean-Pierre Turatsinze? 
A.	I never met him in my life. 
Q.	Did you own a blue Pajero? 
A.	We never had a blue Pajero at the Kigali préfecture. 
Q.	Did you yourself personally own a blue Pajero? 
A.	Not at all. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think the witness has taken heed of your -- your instructions, Mr. President.  And I think we can take our break now. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

I thank the witness as well.  You have done exactly what I asked you to do. 

We're going to take our adjournment now for the day until tomorrow.  I -- I'm making a comment.  I'm sure you are familiar with the rules of our Tribunal.  But during this or any adjournment while you are on the witness stand, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody. 
THE WITNESS:
I will try to -- I will do that, Your Honour.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
