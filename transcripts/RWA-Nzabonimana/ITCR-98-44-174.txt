P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Prosecutor (sic), could you open the proceedings please -- sorry, Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short, and Judge Kam, absent, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday, 
the 28th of September 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR 98-44-T.

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Yes, I'm afraid I have to indicate that Judge Kam has met with unexpected complications and is not able to return this weekend, as originally planned.  The information that we have indicates that he will be returning at the end of next week.  Now, under Rule 15 bis that we are sitting under, I think we can only sit for five days without him.  And what we propose is to sit today and tomorrow, and on Monday, if it is necessary, for the completion of the testimony of the current witness.  

We don't think it's sensible to sit on Friday, firstly because Friday will only give us half day and we'd lose the advantage of the day we have.  And I think other arrangements have been made for the use of this courtroom on Friday.  

Under those circumstances, this is a -- has changed the position that -- with regard to the order denying the adjournment applied for by counsel for Nzirorera.  And I don't know if you need to say anything, but it is obvious to the Court you will not be sitting on the date that you applied for.  And in those circumstances, you are -- would be able to travel to The Hague to undertake the commitments that you had indicated that you had wanted to.  

Mr. Prosecutor, this also means that there has to be some adjustments in the scheduling of your Witness G. We anticipate from the information that we have that Judge Kam will be back by the end of next week.  So we are anticipating a trial resumption on the 10th of October, Monday, the 10th of October.  It probably would be better for us to reserve discussions of indications of Witness G's testimony until after the conclusion of the cross-examination of this witness, by which time I think everybody would have a bit more information, and we'll be able to plan in a definite -- definite manner.  

So, those are the matters which I needed to bring to your attention before we start.  

Mr. Registrar, could you call the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  While we are getting the witness this morning, housekeeping matter.  The registrar made a copy of PSD membership card of this witness at our request, but he has not been willing to distribute copies to any of the counsel, absent some direction from the Trial Chamber.  I asked him two or three times now to ask you outside of court, but I haven't -- getting any response, so I'm asking you now in court, can you please order the registrar to make available to us a copy of the PSD card that the witness provided yesterday.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the order is made accordingly.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
At the same time, I raised the issue of reciprocal disclosure yesterday, and she agreed to provide copies of -- of missing pages from the MRND manifest.  I don't know if copies of that were made as well or if an order is required in order to have those distributed, but we'd also like to get copies of those things.  Thanks.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, good morning.  Good morning, Your Honour.  I simply wanted to reassure the Prosecutor, when I make a promise I keep it.  We have the documents here, and I'm ready to hand them over.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  We are now ready to continue your testimony.  I remind you that you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you were when your testimony commenced.  Your examination will continue by counsel for Karemera. 
AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Defence. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to take up with you where we left off yesterday, and I want to do this quite quickly.  Yesterday, we left off when you were with Petrorwanda.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Right.  Mr. Witness, I would like to put to you two questions.  I'm going to give you names so that you can tell me whether these names mean anything to you.  The first name is Uwihanganye, Jean-Marie. 
A.	Uwihanganye, Jean-Marie, was my direct supervisor at the hydrocarbon depot in Gatata.  He was the head of that depot, and he was the moderate -- he belonged to the moderate MDR, Twagiramungu's wing. 
Q.	And what about Kabutura? 
A.	Kabutura, you say?  I don't recall who that person is. 
Q.	Very well.  Because -- let's go back to what we did yesterday.  I recall that you had just joined Petrorwanda on the 25th of May 1992, and then that famous demonstration took place on the 
	28th of May, three days later, in other words.  And when I refer to the calendar for the year 1992, I recall that that was a Thursday.  Your third day at work was a Thursday.  Now, how were you able to absent yourself from work in order to attend that famous demonstration, which was held on the 28th?  How did you manage? 
A.	I asked for permission.  I asked for permission, and I was granted the permission, and I left, just like many others.  There were other people who were absent from work on that day, yes, because it was a working day, but people went to that demonstration. 
Q.	Yes, it was a demonstration during a working day, and wasn't there any problems from people being absent from their offices? 
A.	Madam, if you were to put yourself in the context of that time -- please try and understand the situation that prevailed.  There were even ministers who were absent from their jobs in order to take part in the march.  So you also, you are asking this question, I understand you very well, but on that day, there were even people who, given the power that they had because they belonged to the MRND, even if I was to be asked for an explanation, I could say at that time that you were (sic) attending the demonstration and if you belonged to the MRND, they would protect you.  It was the party which was in power.  But I asked for permission from my direct supervisor. 
Q.	Who accepted and granted you the request? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You mentioned that there were ministers present at that demonstration, and you know that ministers are normally quite well known.  Could you tell me who were there? 
A.	Yes, there were ministers from the MRND party, but what I can say for now is that your client, Karemera, was there.  But even if he wasn't, if I recall -- even if he weren't minister at the time, he was there.  So there were ministers, authorities, and officials of the MRND, led by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So that's the answer I can give you.  
But now, if I'm to recall, there were ministers.  You know when there were demonstrations, there are many people who attend, and that's what I recall.  And there were officials from the MRND ranks -- 
Q.	Ministers? 
A.	Yes, ministers, authorities of other kinds.  The administrative authorities were there. 
Q.	But, as ministers, you know, when I gave you the example of my country, I can't compare myself with a minister.  I can pass by without anybody noticing me if I were to attend a demonstration, but the same doesn't apply to a minister.  So for such a demonstration I would like you to mention to me the names of the ministers who were present.
A.	Madam, I no longer recall.  I cannot lie.  I came here to speak the truth.  If I am to say such-and-such a minister was there, you know, I think that would be lying.  And I do not want to lie.  I do not want to invent anything.  All I know is that there were authorities from the MRND, from the minister right up to the consellier de secteur.  Therefore, there were all kinds of people present.  What I recall very well is that Mr. Karemera was there. 
Q.	Yes, but, Mr. Witness, please don't take me wrongly.  I know that it was in 1992 and that was a long time ago, and we are trying to recall the events.  
A.	Yes, that's what we are doing.  What I'm saying is that I cannot recall, and the reason is that I no longer recall.  Maybe you want to joggle with this question, but I can understand you.  Maybe you want me to go into an analysis and so on and so forth.  I understand your duty.  But for me, what I'm telling you is that I no longer recall.  You see, it's -- it's more than 13 years ago, so there are things that one can forget.  One cannot bring out that such-and-such a person was there. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, you remember Mr. Karemera so well, and yet he wasn't minister.  What was he at the time? 
A.	He was vice-president of the MRND.  At that time, he was vice-chairman of the MRND. 
Q.	Are we really referring to 28th of May 1992? 
A.	You recall, madam, that there was Karemera.  The president of the party was Habyarimana, Juvènal, if I'm not wrong, or if I -- the national secretary was Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  You see?  So it was in April that -- but I don't recall very well.  Maybe I'm going to be making a confusion because this was long time. 
Q.	It's good for you to apologise, Mr. Witness.  But, you see, the things that you are telling this Court are so important that even if I agree with you that it was a long time ago and that you have some confusion in your mind, I think it is also my duty and role to recall -- to remind you of certain things.  I know that you are someone who is very honest, but maybe you can admit that you are wrong, and this is why I'm insisting on this issue.  Do you understand what I'm saying? 
A.	Yes, I understand.  Unless -- I know what your duty is.  Maybe you can give me some details so that I can help refresh my memory. 
Q.	No, I cannot do that, but let me reassure you that I'm for the truth.  That's what I'm looking for.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is apologising for having failed to give the interpreters the necessary break between question and answer.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to refresh your memory because I know you were very involved in the affairs of the party.  But I do agree with you that it was 13 years ago, and that there could have been confusion of dates in your mind.  Now, regarding Mr. Édouard Karemera, he was not vice-chairman of the MRND at the time.  And I'm going to even give you details in order to help you understand that you confused the positions held by him.  Because at that time, the first vice chairman was known as Rugira Amanda.  Do you remember him? 
A.	Yes, I know very well the person you mentioned. 
Q.	Yes, he was chairman of MRND in Butare.  The second vice chairman was Ferdinand Kabagema.  Do you recall who he was?  Do you remember him?  
A.	Yes, I know Kabagema. 
Q.	He was the president or chairman of MRND in Kibungo.  Do you recall? 
A.	Yes, I do.  I do remember. 
Q.	Now, I'm also going to add that Mr. Karemera became vice chairman of the MRND following the congress of the 4th and 5th of July 1993.  You see? 
A.	Yes.  Thank you very much for reminding me.  You see, it was a long time ago.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	It was indeed a long time ago.  Yes, I agree.  And this was also to prove to you that I wasn't being confrontational.  

So let's come back to that demonstration of the 25th of May 1992.  Mr. Édouard Karemera was not there; he wasn't vice chairman, and I'm going to even tell you that at the time he had his lawyer's practice and he had matters before the courts of first instance, in particular, and he couldn't be absent in order to go to rallies because he was dealing with someone who could have been sentenced if he was not represented by his lawyer.  
A.	Madam, you have reminded me of things.  I thank you very much, and may God bless you.  But on that day, what you recall very well indeed is that Karemera was at that demonstration.  And, furthermore, Karemera -- it was afterwards -- you've also given me an idea of the rally which took place at the regional stadium, and that was chaired by Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, a meeting -- or rally which was typically extremist.  He was with Karemera, Mugenzi, Edouard, and they were together.  Even the photographs that we were shown, when the pro -- during that rally -- this is to tell you that at that time, even though Karemera came as an ordinary member of the MRND, and you say that later on he was given the title of chairman.  If he were to be absent, there were people who were afraid of 
	Juvènal Habyarimana because he was the chairman of the party, and he was also the president of the republic.  So if he -- if one didn't see the image of such people, there were people who were afraid of Habyarimana.  So he could leave his job and other responsibilities so that he could be seen by Habyarimana.  So for that date, since you agree with me that this was a long time ago, there are things which I can't remember very well, but I think that Mr. Karemera was there.  

There were authorities, and I can maybe even forget some of these personalities.  I'm a human being, but I cannot invent things or lie because that that's not why I came here. 
Q.	I'm sure about that, Mr. Witness.  It's just that I want to tell you that Mr. Karemera probably attended other demonstrations of the party, because he was a member of the party.  There is no shame in saying that.  Just because I'm giving you ideas to remind you that you may be confused with the date, I also need to tell you that on that date there was some confusion in your mind, and that it is quite possible that you saw Karemera in other rallies because he was a member of the MRND.  I'm not denying that.  
A.	Madam, you can give precision -- precise details with evidence to help us understand that Karemera wasn't at that demonstration. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the photograph that you referred to a moment ago, was it just that demonstration? 
A.	No, that was a rally which took place just when Karemera was vice chairman of MRND.  That was '93, in 1993, if I'm not wrong.  It was the extremist rally which was convened by the power leader, such as Mugenzi, and other people whose names I have forgotten, but they were there.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was there, and he was the convener of that meeting.  I didn't attend, but we lived quite close to the stadium.  Nyamirambo stadium, it's just next door. 
Q.	Yes, 1993? 
A.	Yes.  So that's when the ideologies of the genocide were intensified in order to have people unite in order to exterminate the Tutsis.  It was during that rally that Karemera -- Karemera and Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, were there.  There are even other rallies which they organised with Mr. Karemera, and everything was all in that period of 1993. 
Q.	Now, how did you determine from the photograph that it was that famous demonstration? 
A.	Yes, I did that because there was Karemera and I -- even when I was asked for the description of Karemera, I said that he was wearing dark glasses.  When I saw him -- many times I saw him with dark glasses, and when he was here, I saw that he is no longer wearing dark glasses.  He is wearing clear spectacles.  So during that rally, Karemera, on the photograph, he was there -- if I'm not wrong, he was in the row which began with Kabagema.  I do recall that.  Mr. Mathieu Ngiramatayo was discussing with his friend Mugenzi.  Before that, he was saying that that was his enemy because he was in the MRND. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm sorry, I'm going to repeat my question.  What tells you from the photograph -- what tells you from the photograph that it was the Nyamirambo rally? 
A.	You see the stadium -- there is a second photograph where you have many people -- I don't have the images here, but I do recall what I saw. 
Q.	Very well.  
A.	You see, there is a place -- when you look at the background, there is a place where it's like this and it's very clear that this is the entrance to the stadium, the regional stadium.  Even if you were to show this to a child, he will be able to identify the stadium, a child who normally goes to that stadium. 
Q.	Very well.  Do you know Mr. Jean-Baptiste Ndarihuranye? 
A.	You are asking me about a lot of names, madam.  Even at the time -- you see, that was a long time ago.  I don't know whether these are people who you are representing or whether they are people who may be arrested so that I can be made to appear to testify.  So there are questions which I cannot respond to for personal reasons, and also because I'm interested in the truth for the Tribunal.  So you'll excuse me.  There are answers which I shall refrain from giving you. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, because there is no problem.  
A.	I know you are a professional, and I think there are some secrets which you need to keep.  So please don't place me in a situation where I have to deal with many details because I may confuse the truth. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, if you do not wish to answer or if you do not know, or if you prefer to have a reservation -- 
A.	Let me have the reservation.  I'm not saying that I do not know or I know, I'm just making a reservation. 
Q.	Now, what I will do is to give you an answer.  This man was the president of the social committee of the MRND.  He was a member of the political bureau, the political bureau of the MRND, I mean.  And he was the one in the photograph, and he was the one that you are confusing with Mr. Édouard Karemera on that particular photograph.  

But, moreover, I understand you because I mentioned to the Tribunal, to the Chamber, on that day that the photograph was not sharp, was not clear.  And now, what I'm going to ask for, since we are all looking for the truth, I'm going to ask that this photograph be screened so that you and I together, we will come to the realisation that confusion was possible, especially because --- in fact, this gentleman is wearing dark glasses.  And you know that Mr. Karemera is not the only one who can wear dark glasses, and you also know that dark glasses hides one's face.  But once I've given you this information, and as I know you, once you would have looked at this photograph, together with the name that I've given you, I think that you will have no problem in confirming that you made a mistake.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Now -- I'm now speaking to the Chamber.  

Your Honours, I'm going to request, if it is possible, to have the photograph screened.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know -- do you recall the exhibit number?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
P. 3, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, to refresh your memory, you can see the gentleman, can you?  Mr. Karemera may have put on weight or he may have lost weight, but that's not very important.  But we should look at the height, that's important because that doesn't change very often.  And, please, recall the name I gave, Dr. Jean Baptist -- 
A.	But your request was not quite complied with by the registrar. 
Q.	You are talking about projection, the screening of the document? 
A.	Yes. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS: 
I have a problem with my screen; it's not sharp.  I have problems.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to the witness, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
When I came here, when I was asked to identify Karemera, I saw that he had put on a little weight.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Q.	Where, here or on the photograph? 
A.	Here.  Here he has put on weight and -- but for the height, I don't know how you can determine that on the photograph, but maybe he can help us and find other photographs, or maybe the Prosecutor can find photographs that he had taken at that time.  We can compare those photographs with this one.  And also the dark glasses that he was wearing, that can also help us.  But what I can see here, and everyone who can see this photograph, and who can remember Karemera of the time, one can realise that this is, indeed, Mr. Karemera.  But it would be better to have us find another photograph on which he was wearing similar glasses, and then we can confirm.  Because often, he -- he often wore dark glasses.  I'm not lying.  At the time he wore -- he often wore dark glasses, so it would be better that we find another photograph on which Mr. Karemera is wearing similar glasses, and then we'll make the comparison in order to have the confirmation one way or another.  I think that's what we should do.  But I'm not at all doubtful that this gentleman is, indeed, Mr. Karemera; I'm not in doubt, unless another photograph can be found to determine that this is -- is not Mr. Karemera. 
Q.	But do you confirm that this is a photograph which was from 1993? 
A.	There were many rallies that were held during that point in time with the coalition of MDR-Power and the others.  But I cannot directly confirm that statement, but with the establishment of MDR-Power, from that date when Frodouard Karamira convened an extremist rally, if I can put it in that way, it was extraordinary even because he was establishing a coalition with other political parties:  CDR and MRND, the MDR, all the power wings.  So it was an ordinary thing to see.  So from that date, other rallies were held and they were similar to the one that was held by Karamira. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if I were to ask you about the date -- I'm asking you to confirm this.  When you were sitting down, you did, indeed, confirm the date and the circumstances under which this photograph was 
	taken -- let me finish.  You said 1993 in such-and-such a place, that's what you said. 
A.	Yes, I said 1993 -- 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	-- there were extremist rallies which were held at the regional stadium of Nyamirambo, and this rally may be -- because that was long time ago, you need to see the first rally that Karamira convened.  And you will see, for instance, that even here, in the previous photograph, you wouldn't be able to see Mr. Mugenzi and Mr.  Mathieu together at rallies of the MRND, speaking and laughing, exchanging ideas in -- as they are doing here.  If you compare the letter that Mathieu Ngirumpatse wrote, saying that Mugenzi is someone who wants to creates chaos, and he wants to have all the activities of the MRND in order to attack the members of the MRND, you have the letter. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, Karamira's rally, Frodouard Karamira, was in October 1993? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know that?  I'm trying to help you because you are in the witness box without any documents.  
A.	I understand you.  
Q.	I have the documents; I'm helping you out.  And I want you to understand why I'm doing this.  I want you to confirm the story about the Nyamirambo stadium in 1993 is because I want to give you a photograph of Mr. Karemera in 1993, and the story would be over.  That's all.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
We ask authorisation from the Chamber.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, may I sit?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Granted.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, you have led me down this path all the way to the photo, whereas this morning I simply wanted to talk about Petrorwanda.  In fact, yesterday you were telling me that you spoke with the honorary president of the Interahamwe committee, you were able to speak with him, and that he thought about what you said, and he decided to resign and to leave.  Isn't that correct? 
A.	Before I respond, it is your job, of course, to put questions to me and I am leading you down the path all the way to the photo.  Let me just underscore what you've just said --  
Q.	I hope that I haven't offended you.
A.	No, there is no problem at all.  About Désiré Murenzi, I told you that he had an idea; it didn't come from me.  It was one of the reasons -- one of the reasons he also decided to resign. 
Q.	But you did speak about this, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	You said that this -- you discussed this with him in his office? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what were the other responses he gavet? 
A.	I don't know.  There were meetings in the month of February.  And starting after those meetings, he would no longer participate in the congress, the MRND congress and other meetings and the congress that Ngirumpatse presided. 
Q.	When was the date of the congress? 
A.	It was in April, April of 1992. 
Q.	The congress? 
A.	Yes, the national congress of the MRND. 
Q.	1992, you say? 
A.	Yes, if I'm not mistaken, but you must understand it's been a long time.  As you said, you have documents in front of you that help you refresh your memory.  

Now, with regard to Désiré Murenzi, I told you that he was not an extremist.  He was the honorary chairman of the Interahamwe.  I can say something about that.  I can tell you what I thought at the time.  He was there as the honorary chairman of the Interahamwe, but all of the activities were organised by Ngirumpatse.  We would even see that Ngirumpatse said that this would be the honorary chairman of the Interahamwe.  Even if you would bring an Interahamwe here, he can talk about Ngirumpatse, and they would be so loyal to him and say, "You can kill me, but Ngirumpatse must be safe."  He would come here and say, "You can kill me, but Ngirumpatse must be safe and is innocent."  

Pardon me, I want to continue.  I was going to finish with my answer.  I was talking about 
	Désiré Murenzi.  He was a moderate.  He was a moderate.  You asked about the other reasons why he left.  There was party propaganda; they were going to defend the interests of his position; he was a government advisor in the Nsengiyeremye government, if I'm not mistaken, but I don't remember clearly which one.  This was on the request -- part of the request, rather, by the MRND.  Later on, he saw the situation and how it was unfolding, and even you would have resigned if you were there at the time.  So for someone whose ideas that were -- they all have their own ideas. 
Q.	Witness, I believe you when you say that Mr. Ngirumpatse liked the Interahamwe.  And there were many Tutsis in the Interahamwe.  You said that some people preferred to save Ngirum -- they would die for Ngirumpatse; that's what you said earlier.  You said that in that organisation you had to be there at the time to understand.  
A.	I'm talking about Interahamwe. 
Q.	Yes.  We must point out that it's the Interahamwe that we're talking about.  These people told you that they would save Ngirumpatse, give their own life.  
A.	Yes, they loved him. 
Q.	I'm telling you that I believe you when you said that.  I -- when I look at the document, I can see that in that Interahamwe committee, the honorary chairman, they were all linked or were Tutsis themselves.  The Interahamwe, as you said, you said that it was created to exterminate Tutsis.  
A.	I told you that there were Agakingirizo in Kinyarwanda.  In French I can use the term to better understand.  People were there so that everyone could see that this was the party that would unite the Hutus, the Tutsis, and the Twas.  But the people who were there were there to show a typical situation that we were all together.  

You also remember I talked about Robert Kajuga -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry to interrupt.  Could we have the witness spell the Kinyarwanda word that he just mentioned, please.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Agakingirizo.  
THE WITNESS: 
Agakingirizo, A-G-A-K-I-N-G-I-R-I-Z-O. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	And what did that mean, Witness? 
A.	These were people, they put them out front as if they were trying to show us that they were Tutsis.  Pardon me for using the term -- ethnic terms.  There were consequences to that.  But I'm situating myself in the context at the time.  Please, pardon me.  Anyone who is listening to me, I will ask for 
	their -- I will beg their pardon.  I am simply trying to tell you what was going on at the time.  

Agakingirizo are Tutsis who were placed in front as a way of showing that the MRND included all Rwandans.  Robert Kajuga was the chairman of the Interahamwe on the national level.  He was a Tutsi, but look how he was affiliated during the genocide.  I can't lie.  

There were activities that continued right up to the extermination of the Tutsis.  I spoke with his older brother, and I can give you explanations.  I asked, "Why didn't your brother save your father and other people?"  He said that "I'm no longer Tutsi; I'm a Hutu."  I discussed the matter with his brother.  This is after the war when people met informally.  This is simply a way to explain to you that there were tactics and strategies that the MRND used.  

They divided the party into a different wing, the power, where they could put all the Hutus together in a different wing.  This is why people began to resign, Murenzi, Jacques Rusari, and others, even Kabageni, Venancie, the woman who I spoke about. 
Q.	Witness, we will get to that.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm objecting here.  The witness was trying to be responsive to the question that was put to him, and counsel is cutting him off.  If she asks the question, she has to accept the answer that the witness is trying to give.  He was in mid-sentence when counsel cut him off.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, excuse me.  He was no longer answering my question.  He was talking about someone else and giving me examples.  I told him that it was not necessary for the purposes of my specific question.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
My answer is that it was responsive.  I believe the line of questioning was: "How did all these Tutsis end up at the head of the -- the Interahamwe or the head of the MRND?"  And the witness was giving a very detailed response, and he was cut off as he was giving another example.  So he was actually responding in detail to the question that was put to him, and his answer should continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I'm not going to say anything more on this, but it is obviously a matter which can be developed in re-examination, if necessary.  
THE WITNESS: 
I was going to say that I was surprised.  You say that I have to tell the truth.  I was in the process of telling you the truth, and then you told the Tribunal that I didn't answer your question.  I answered your question.  I told you how people were placed, and we were talking about Tutsis and Agakingirizo.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, I didn't say you didn't answer my question.  I said that afterwards you moved on to something else, and I said that well get to that later.  
A.	But I did answer your question. 
Q.	Yes, you did.  No problem.  
A.	I can also add --

1015H 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Let me proceed, Mr. Witness.  You spoke about Mr. Kajuga, Witness.  You also talked about a conversation you had with his brother.  
A.	No.  This was after the genocide.  It wasn't during the genocide.  After.  Moreover, we met in a shop, just in passing.  It wasn't a conversation as such.  
Q.	Very well.  But since you brought up his name, the name of that person who told you some very serious things, he said that his brother, Robert Kajuga, the chairman of the Interahamwe, told you that he abandoned his Tutsi ethnicity, and that he had become a Hutu -- and that he was now a Hutu.  That is why I want to get back to another question.  You said that after the events you wanted to understand; you said everyone tried to speak with one another after the events; and after the events you spoke with Kajuga's brother.  That's what you said just now.  
A.	Yes.  He didn't know me; I didn't know him.  It was in passing, but I know that he's a businessman in Kigali.  He has a shop, a sporting goods store.  We spoke, and he wasn't, in fact, speaking to me.  He was talking with other people, and I asked him a question.  I said, "How did this happen?"  This is just to give you some context about Kajuga and his family.  He was even in the PSD party, that person, I believe.  I'm simply explaining how you can meet someone and have a conversation with them.  
Q.	And what did he say?  
A.	He said what I just said.  I don't know if we should get -- go back over it. 
Q.	But he is sorry about the genocide and what happened?  
A.	Yes, of course.  He's very saddened by that.  If I'm not mistaken, they lost other people in their family.  But these were just people talking in Kigali.  Husi and Kajuga's families were known.  Their families were well known.  
Q.	You said that they lost 15 family members; is that correct?  
A.	That's what I can say.  Even in my family many people died.  
Q.	Witness, if I was to tell you that Husi was killed the first day of the genocide, between the 6th and the 7th of April, would you continue to tell me that you spoke with him after the genocide about the genocide, Husi -- Husi, the brother of Robert Kajuga?  
A.	Which Husi are you speaking about?  There is -- there is the one who owns the sporting goods shop Parvi's (phonetic).  He's still there in Kigali today.  
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	He's called Husi.  You can say "Hu" only, but there are many of these people with this name.  You asked earlier, how can we make a distinction between family members?  There's Karemera - Karemira Froduald.  This is one person who survived and who has the sporting goods shop whose name is Parvi's.  
Q.	If I were to tell you that Robert Kajuga, in fact, had a brother who's name was Husi, Kajuga is the last name, I'll point out --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Please, Witness, don't interrupt me -- that he had a brother, you are correct.  His name was Husi.  But he was the only one, and he died on the 7th of April.  
A.	Do you know about the one called Wilcliff (phonetic)?  His name is Husi Wilcliff.  
Q.	Do you know him?  
A.	You don't have any information about that?  Let me give you information about that.  Wilcliff Husi has a shop, Parvi's, in Kigali.  I'm telling you what I know, what I've experienced.  Perhaps you, from Nigeria, or where you're coming from, have other ideas about this, but I am telling you frankly --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You do not get into a personal discussion with the lawyers in the trial.  That's not permitted.  Okay?  You should try to answer the question.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, not to interrupt or contradict the Trial Chamber, may I make the observation that counsel is testifying.  She is putting information on the record and provoking the witness to respond in this manner.  If she did not testify and contradict him, then he would not respond in the way that he does.  So my request is that the Chamber instruct counsel on the proper way of framing a question in cross-examination so that the witness will not be motivated to argue with her.  She is arguing with him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is cross-examination.  Counsel is permitted to put information to the witness.  What counsel puts to the witness is not evidence.  The evidence is the witness's answer.  So as far as we are concerned, what the witness says is the evidence that we take cognisance of.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, Wilcliff Kajuga, who is Robert Kajuga's brother, Robert Kajuga being the chairman of the Interahamwe, did Wilcliff tell you, during the discussion, how he survived the events? 
A.	Counsel, I explained this to you.  I told you that I met him in the shop.  He was speaking with someone and I took advantage of the opportunity to ask him some questions.  He answered.  He said, "We left immediately" -- and then we left immediately.  We didn't have a very lengthy conversation -- how were you saved?  Who saved you?  If we get into these details, I'm also going to be affected by this.  I told you how people were saved and in which conditions we were living.  
Q.	Witness, you told me in this courtroom that you met him.  
A.	I'm talking about Robert Kajuga.  
Q.	Please don't cut me off, Witness.  You spoke about his brother Husi.  I ask you about Husi's fate, and you mentioned Wilcliff.  So now I'm asking you questions about Wilcliff, and you said that you spoke about the genocide.  You said that, Witness.  Now, if you say that you didn't speak about the genocide, we'll move on to something else.  
A.	No.  I said that his brother was there and how his father died.  That's all I mentioned.  I did not get into the details of the genocide.  I never said that we had a lengthy conversation about the genocide, who he saved, who saved him; we didn't have that time.  I simply wanted to have a bit of information.  He gave that answer very briefly, and that was all.  It was in passing.  He was in the shop, and I was going to buy something.  He was speaking with someone.  I asked him.  That was it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Diagne?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It may help to get the cross-examination back on track if you did ask -- or were able to frame questions that the witness can answer.  It seems as though he's seeing himself as though he's in a debating competition at the moment, and that's really not desirable.  And it may assist the process if you could frame questions and he could focus on specific answers.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Very well, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, let's talk about Désiré Murenzi and Petrorwanda.  Are you aware of something that happened to him when he was the general director -- the managing director of Petrorwanda, the Rwandan petrol company?  
A.	Please repeat that.  
Q.	Yes.  I'm asking if you are aware of something extraordinary that happened to Désiré Murenzi during the time he was managing director of Petrorwanda, during which time you, yourself, also worked for Petrorwanda.  
A.	You're talking about the demonstrations that took place and when his windshield was bashed in?  
Q.	There were no demonstrations at Petrorwanda.  
A.	No, not demonstrations as such.  If I remember, there was a demonstration that took place at the time.  But it's been a long time.  Perhaps you can assist me, as you have before.  I remember there were vehicles whose windshields were bashed in.  Murenzi was one person.  Other political officials, like Gatabazi, and others were beaten.  There were demonstrations, but perhaps you can assist me and refresh my memory.  You want to lead me down a path.  Please do so to help me.  
Q.	The demonstration you are referring to, where did it occur?  
A.	It was in Kigali.  Everything I'm talking about was in Kigali.  But you want to know if something extraordinary happened to Désiré Murenzi.  I'm not sure if the answer I have given you is sufficient.  Is it sufficient?  If it's not -- if it is, rather, we can move on.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  In fact, Witness, I was talking about something that happened in the company, not a public demonstration.  I'm talking about an event that took place in the company during the time you worked for that company.  
A.	There were demonstrations that took place, and Désiré Murenzi left Petrorwanda before those demonstrations.  
Q.	No.  I'm talking about the time when he was managing director of Petrorwanda.  During that time, you were an employee of that company.  There was an event that took place.  That's the one I'm referring to.  It took place at Petrorwanda.  I'm simply giving you this information to assist you, to help you to remember.  That's why I'm giving you so many details.  
A.	Thank you for that.  
Q.	You're very welcome, Witness.  
A.	You can continue to assist me because that doesn't help me.  
Q.	So you want me to tell you?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	You should have told me yourself that you don't recall.  
A.	One cannot recall things which happened in 1992.  Can't -- can't remember everything.  You cannot remember all the incidents that took place in that time.  
Q.	Very well.  
A.	Maybe it would be acceptable if you were to help us recall the events that took place.  
Q.	Yes, I'm going to do so.  I'm going to remind you.  Mr. Witness, in Mr. Désiré Murenzi's office in Petrorwanda, there was a grenade which was thrown, and there was an explosion in his office.  The event was frightening.  It was very serious.  Naturally, when there's an explosion, especially in a company that deals with oil, everybody was aware of this.  Everybody was informed of this.  Do you recall now?  
A.	Yes, madam, I remember very well this incident.  There were demonstrations which were somewhat confusing, if I can say so.  You see, Murenzi, Désiré, ended up resigning -- 
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	No, let me continue, madam.  There was some kind of drama.  There were people who would wear the uniforms of PSD, MDR, and PL.  You know, I also had a grenade thrown at me.  A grenade was also thrown at me in Muhima at night, and God saved me.  So what I'm telling you, at the time there was a lot of confusing drama, and it was said that demonstrations took place, and things were thrown.  It was not the office of Petrorwanda.  He had been separated from the hydrocarbon tanks in Gatsata.  And I think you're also trying to help me refresh my memory.  This, indeed, happened.  The grenade was thrown, but this was just pure drama.  It was all stage-managed.  So it was being said that PL, MDR, they want to kill our people because of the ideology of Murenzi from February.  What I'm telling you confirms this because you must have tangible proof which show that there were consequences to Murenzi's resignation.  People were killed.  I told you that the grenade was thrown, but there was also a bomb, which was placed in Nyakabanda.  Because Bowbow (sic) was not for the killings.  He was on Twagiramungu's side, and his wife was in the PL party.  There, the grenade exploded and killed someone, killed Louis.  Paulin was wounded.  He went to Nairobi for treatment.  And his wife, I'm the one who saved her during the genocide.  And we were being pursued a great deal, and she was saved by God through me.  So what I'm saying is that the events of the time, you are reminding me of really bloody events which were organised by the group I mentioned to you.  
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Witness, now we know that Mr. Désiré Murenzi was attacked personally.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	All right.  Now, let's take it up again.  When you went into his office before he resigned, did you speak about this incident?  
A.	Speak about what?  The grenade?  
Q.	Of the attempt on his life.  
A.	No, we didn't speak about this, because it was something which was known.  Yes, it was known by one and all.  
Q.	So Mr. Désiré Murenzi, in fact, left the Petrorwanda company under those circumstances, Mr. Witness.  
A.	If you were aware of Murenzi's ideas at the time -- we seem to be dwelling on Mr. Murenzi, Désiré, instead of Mr. Édouard Karemera who you're representing.  
Q.	Do you know why?  I'm going to tell you.  Because you're saying this was the ideology of the Interahamwe, and this is the damage they caused in the country.  Now, I am trying to follow the traces of the leaders, and you, you are giving me information concerning them.  So I'm coming back to you, by telling you, if there's confusion, if you are wrong, and when you tell me -- you, yourself, told me yesterday that Mr. Murenzi realised because you mentioned Interahamwe ideologies to him, and he preferred to leave.  Today I'm telling you exactly why Mr. Murenzi left, not in order for us to discuss, but so that I can remind you and to show you where you may be wrong.  
A.	No, no, no.  With regard to Murenzi, I was not wrong.  He resigned from the MRND because, first of all, he wasn't even involved in the Interahamwe activities.  I did, indeed, underscore that Murenzi, Désiré, was replaced by Ngirabatware, in Byumbu (phonetic), who was the minister of education at the time.  He was known as Ngirabatware, Augustin.  N-G- -- I'm spelling-- N-G-I-R-A-B-A-N-T-W-A-R-E (sic) Ngirabatware.  Augustin was his first name.  
Q.	Is he the one who replaced Mr. Désiré Mugenzi (sic)?  
A.	Yes, as honourary chairman.  After Ngirumpatse -- Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, but he was always the supreme leader, if I can put it that way, of the Interahamwe.  As for the nickname given to the -- the minister, he was known as Mbiyombiyo, which is spelled M-B-I-Y-O, Mbiyombiyo, so you repeat it.  He was the one who replaced Murenzi immediately, and he continued with the ideology of the Interahamwe.  He was also the one who, during the rally I mentioned -- or, rather, during the second meeting, he asked that money be found there for the needs of the Interahamwe, if you look at my statement.  So he continued to perpetrate the ideologies of the Interahamwe.  There were secrets, and this is how the death squads were created to go and kill the Tutsis, you see, madam.  So for Murenzi, Désiré -- for Désiré Murenzi, if I were to come back to your question, I don't know even if he's Tutsi.  I don't even recall because I wasn't going to ask people, "Are you a Tutsi?  Are you a Hutu?"  What I saw with Murenzi is that he didn't support the ideology of the Interahamwe for the extermination of the Tutsis.  It's rather Ngirabatware and Ngirumpatse.  

And also with the involvement of the MRND office in 1992, there was a rally presided by Juvènal Habyarimana who said he was going to go down together with the Interahamwe in order to exterminate people.  What President Theodore Sindikubwabo said, he said that his ministers should descend or go down.  
Q.	Very well.  Very well, Witness.  So you were discussing with Mr. Murenzi, and where did he go? 
A.	He went to Belgium.  When he resigned, he left immediately for Belgium.  
Q.	So after Petrorwanda, he went directly to Rwanda without any stopover, as we say?  
A.	Well, I don't know.  I don't know how you want me to put this.  That question about no stopover, is that possible?  Anyway, what I want to say is that he went directly and settled in Belgium.  
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, there also I find there's a gap.  Mr. Désiré Murenzi left Petrorwanda.  He didn't flee.  He is in the MRND, and then he becomes director of BB Fina -- BP Fina, BP Fina.  
A.       Do you know that Murenzi, Désiré, was appointed director of BP Fina?  Please tell me.  
Q.	No, we're not going to exchange roles, are we?  
A.	No.  What I'm saying is that I recall very well, but when he resigned, the time when he came back --  
Q.	Came back from where?  
A.	From Belgium -- or I don't know.  But what I'm saying, it was told that -- it was said that he went to Belgium when he resigned from MRND.  You are saying that he continued to function within the MRND.  That's not true, because he resigned, and he couldn't still remain in the MRND, so that he could be pursued.  You're saying never, but you are saying that he continued to be there.  I'm telling you frankly, he resigned.  What I'm trying to explain to you is that when Murenzi, Désiré, resigned, he went directly, and then he came back to Fina, but I do not remember.  You said you were going to help me, so help me, please.  
Q.	I'm going to do that, and willingly.  I'm saying that when Mr. Désiré Murenzi left Petrorwanda, he then became director-general of BP Fina.  
A.	In what year?  
Q.	In 1992.  Don't you remember?  Because he left when you were joining Petrorwanda yourself.   I follow very well what you followed -- what you said.  
A.	Are you saying that he didn't resign from MRND?
Q.      Mr. Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, sorry.  I think that the problem has come that the Prosecutor referred to earlier.  You are, in fact, falling into that problem now.  You should really put matters to the witness so we can get his answer on these matters.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I'm asking him questions, and he wants to give me other answers.  And I talk about BP Fina, and he's talking about MRND, and I can't correct him.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I'm sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is, did you know whether he worked for BP Fina after he left Petrorwanda?  That's what you're being asked.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, he worked at BP Fina, that is true.  But there are two questions that were put to me, and they -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I ask a question?  Do you have any idea of the time frame when he worked at BP Fina?  When was it that he worked at BP Fina?  
THE WITNESS:
I have no idea about the dates.  I no longer recall.  This lady wants to confuse me.  Instead of continuing with Mr. Karemera, Édouard, whom she's representing, to see whether or not he's guilty, we are now analysing Désiré Murenzi, and we're going into all these details.  So she is taking a lot of time on someone who isn't even here and for whom we didn't come to testify.  There's so much analysis being done.  I do understand what you have told me, Mr. President, but the questions can be put to me, but I also have my concerns in that we are analysing small details about someone -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are contributing to this by talking so much.  Now, the question you're asked is a very simple one.  Do you know the time frame when he worked at BP Fina?  And look how much you have said, which raises other questions which people want to ask about.  So if you confine yourself to understanding the question you're being asked and answer it directly, a lot of this would be avoided.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you please answer my question?  
A.	I've answered your question.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, did he go to Belgium before working with BP Fina, or he worked with BP Fina before going to Belgium, to your knowledge?  

THE WITNESS:
As far as I know, Your Honour, is that he left directly and fled to Belgium.  Later on he came back.  I do not remember the dates, but he came back to work for BP Fina, not another company.  But I'm beginning to remember, and that is -- it was after the genocide, but I do not remember the exact date.  But it was after the genocide that he came back, and he worked for BP Fina.  I'm not quite sure exactly, but what I know is he, first of all, left, and then he came back and worked for BP Fina.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when Désiré Murenzi left Petrorwanda, he went and worked for BP Fina, and that was in 1992.  And, indeed, he then -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Objecting, Your Honour.  This is not a question.  The witness is -- counsel is now arguing with the witness.  He was asked a specific question.  He gave an answer.  It's not appropriate for counsel now to reinforce and to insist on her version of the facts.  This issue is so far afield of the trial that I'm surprised that we've spent at least 20 or 30 minutes on it, but now counsel has crossed the line.  She got the answer to the question that she asked.  We should move on to something else.  She cannot insist upon her version of the facts.  She's not here to testify.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I wasn't trying to impose my version of the facts.  It's the witness, himself, who asked me to help him and refresh his memory.  If he didn't do that, I wouldn't do the same.  But I'm not trying to have a discussion with the witness.  I'm trying, at his behest, to give him some information.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we also -- our interests (inaudible) -- the interests of the Chamber (inaudible) and I think that issue has been explored, and, in fact, I do think that it's becoming argumentative.  And we do not want to allow that.  It's past our morning recess time.  Is this a convenient time to take a break?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Very well, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take our short mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1050H to 1129H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  We can now resume.  

Madam Diagne?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
By your leave, I would like to conclude my sequence which I started before the break.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the then director-general of Petrorwanda applied for a position which became vacant in BP Fina, and he got the job.  Do you know why he wrote his letter of resignation at that time, when he was on his way to Belgium and, in particular, as he was going to the airport?  I'm referring to his resignation from the MRND.  
A.	Before I answer, I would like to inform the Chamber that because I have headaches, I'm going to try to speak in Kinyarwanda.  You have realised that this morning the way in which answers were given by me were not similar to what I have done earlier.  I am going to make an effort to speak in Kinyarwanda, and I would like us -- that this afternoon I be given authorisation to go and seek treatment because I do, indeed, say that I need to continue with the trial, but it has been realised that my blood pressure has gone dangerously low.  But I did not want to delay the proceedings of the Tribunal, and it is for that reason that I said I must make an effort to continue with the trial.  But because of my illness, I would really request that the Tribunal gives me authority to go and seek treatment this afternoon, and that I will continue to answer questions before the noon break in Kinyarwanda, because I think that may assist me in providing appropriate answers.  And this afternoon, may I please have the authorisation I'm seeking from you for treatment, so that I can take a little break.  Because, you see, high blood pressure is not something to play around with, because I could even fall down here right before you.  So I would like the Tribunal to help me find the treatment I require.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Witness, I have consulted with the registrar, and he will make enquiries to set an appointment for you to visit the clinic when we break at midday.  We will keep you under observation, and if your health deteriorates and you let us know, we will then take appropriate responses.  But in the meantime, we will continue with your evidence.  If necessary, you can draw our attention to any deterioration in your condition.  

Yes, Ms. Diagne.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall what my question was, or should I repeat it for you?  
A.	I remember the question.  I can answer you directly so that we save time.  We were talking about Désiré Murenzi.  You asked me why he resigned from the MRND in order to go to Belgium.  Was that not your question, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes.  But I would like to clarify that this happened at the airport, as he was leaving for Belgium.  
A.	When he drafted his resignation letter, he didn't stipulate the reason for his resignation.  He mentioned personal reasons which led him to resign from the MRND, and to withdraw from all political activities of that party.  He simply mentioned personal reasons.  I think that is basically the contents of his letter, if I'm not mistaken.  
Q.	I was telling you that he was on his way to Belgium on behalf of BP Fina, and specifically for a training course.  Did you know about that?  
A.	Thank you very much, Counsel, but that confirms that what I was saying was the truth, because I did say that he resigned; he went to Belgium directly.  I wasn't informed of the fact that he was going to go for a training course, but I was aware that he handed in his resignation from the MRND, and he immediately left for Belgium.  So you are confirming what I was saying earlier, that he left immediately after his resignation.  And yet a moment ago, you were saying that when he left the MRND, rather, he went to work to BP Fina.  I think that the break we had was useful for you in gathering your thoughts because what you're saying now, indeed, corresponds to what I had said earlier.  
Q.	Very well.  I'm going to give you a few details, and you will understand.  He resigned from Petrorwanda, and this was in August, in fact, the 17th August 1992.  So then he goes to work for BP Fina.  He was recruited as a managing director of BP Fina.  Subsequently, and only subsequently, BP Fina decided to send him for a training course, and this brings us to the month of September 1992.  And as he was leaving for Belgium, he wrote a letter of resignation whilst he was at the airport.  Did you know about that?  
A.	I think we are wasting time on these little details.  What we need to look at is the fact that he resigned from the MRND.  He wrote a resignation letter, and he left.  I think the only difference between what you say and what I said are the details.  The most important thing is that Murenzi renounced the ideology promoting the genocide and the killing of all Tutsis, the extermination of all Tutsis.  You, yourself, have realised that he resigned two months -- he said -- you said on the 17th August, and that was two months after I resigned, because I resigned in the month of June, and this confirms what I was telling you and that it was the truth.  It was during the same period of time.  

And as you are aware, he, first of all, resigned from his position as managing director of Petrorwanda, as I resigned from the position of credit manager in the ministry, and that is how he separated himself from MRND.  As I've already said, had I remained in the MRND, I could have been appointed bourgmestre of a commune or préfet of a préfecture, and today I would be involved in the trial that is happening today.  This is why Murenzi, Désiré, first of all, resigned from his post of managing director of Petrorwanda, a post or position which he obtained by being a member of the MRND.  And when he was leaving for Belgium, he drafted his resignation letter in order to distance himself from the killers.  I don't know, but this seems to be an important point.  You said that he didn't distance himself from the -- the killers.  That would have contradicted what I hold to be true.  But now this confirms that I am being honest in the information I'm providing to the Chamber.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You see, you are talking to me about details, but I think that the -- that the ideology for the genocide is not a detail.  I'm trying to prove to the Chamber that Mr. Murenzi did not resign due to the reasons that you, yourself, are mentioning.  So it's not a detail for me.  Now -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam, Counsel -- madam, please, it's not desirable to get into a debate with the witness.  If you put questions to the witness and we hear his answers, we will draw the appropriate conclusion at the right time.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Very well, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you know that BP Fina, a company which was originally British, decided that a politician could not be director within its company and required, as a condition from Mr. Murenzi, that he resign from his political activities before he could take up his managerial functions or responsibilities?  
A.	I'm of the opinion that if that were the case, he would have mentioned that in his resignation letter.  Murenzi was someone who was very honest, and I knew him very well.  I'm not inventing anything.  I knew him as well as I knew Mathieu and Édouard Karemera.  Please don't try and tell me that he resigned from the MRND because of the managing director position which was offered to him by BP Fina as a company.  Because the MRND could have even appointed him to the position of minister.  What we are dealing with here are the origins of the ideology of the killers, your clients, who were for the extermination of Rwandans.  I would discuss, one to one, with Murenzi in his office, and you're telling me that this was a condition which was put by BP Fina, so that he could obtain that position.  I think you're mentioning this reason because you want to prove that Murenzi, Désiré, did not resign from the MRND because of the ideologies of this party, which wanted to exterminate Rwandans.  But I think that if you continue in confirming that, by saying that the MRND did not prepare and implement the genocide of Rwandans, with all the activities which I have already described which took place within the MRND, I am now beginning to understand where you're going. 

	You want to say that Murenzi could have remained within the MRND in order to support the initiatives of the MRND, despite the fact that -- despite the fact that he had been offered this position.  Counsel, we are speaking of the genocide, and it's only courageous people who are able to distance themselves from these people.  I resigned in 1992.  I renounced the initiatives of your clients.  But you shouldn't mislead the Chamber in believing that Murenzi resigned because he wanted this position.  But the position offered to him, so that he could resign from MRND.  It's as if this position was being used as a cover.  But, Counsel, would he, therefore, have been employed, whereas he was still within the MRND?  Because you, yourself, said that he, first of all, remained for two months as a managing director of BP Fina, and that it was during those two months that he was sent for the training course.  Now, did the employers require that he, first of all, resign before -- from the MRND, before he was appointed managing director of BP Fina?  There's some coherence here.  I'm not inventing anything.  I didn't come here to come and tell lies to this Chamber.  

	Our country lost many people.  I know that you're in the defence, and that is your job, to defend your client, but there was a tragedy in Rwanda because of your clients.  There are some who were directly involved in this tragedy, and there were others who were involved at a level which is not as considerable as others.  I'm thinking about Nzirorera, in the preparations of the genocide, but I do know that Mathieu Ngirumpatse founded the Interahamwe organisation.  I was there, and it was then that they began singing this famous song Tubatsembesembe, "Let's extermine (sic) them."  But later on, I decided to distance myself from the MRND.  

	But now you are trying to convince me that Murenzi allegedly resigned from the MRND because of the post offered to him by BP Fina.  What you're saying is that Murenzi maintained the ideologies of the MRND to which he had belonged earlier, or that the ideology of the extermination of Tutsis did not exist in the MRND, but that's not the reality.  I know that Murenzi resigned because he was against the ideology of the MRND, and this was published in the newspapers.  Read Isibo, the newspaper.  I don't remember the issue in which this appeared, but in that newspaper, mention was made of Murenzi -- Murenzi's resignation from the MRND.  That event was mentioned.  I'm not inventing anything.  I can see that you're going about this stage step by step, but I'm wanting you to go back to the heart of the matter that is of concern to us now.  Let me repeat that Murenzi resigned from the MRND because he wanted to distance himself from these killers.  
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  Thank you.  Who replaced him?  Within Petrorwanda, who was the new director when Murenzi left?  
A.	He was replaced by someone who was a member of the CDR.  That man was known as Daniel Nyowmenmusi (phonetic), I think that he was from Ruhengeri.  Although I don't remember his native commune, but his name was Daniel Nyowmenmusi, and he replaced him in an acting capacity.  Because until the beginning of the genocide in 1994, he was still signing as Daniel Nyowmenmusi, AI director, which means ad interim manager.  At that time, a council was established, and it was composed by -- composed of Jean-Marie Vianewiangaye (phonetic), Etienne Niyitegeka, and another gentleman whose name was -- Counsel, are you following what I'm saying?  
Q.	Yes, very well.  
A.	So I was saying a committee was set up, an administrative committee, so that Nyowmenmusi can take decisions without them having to be approved by Jean-Marie Vianewiangamane (phonetic) and Etienne Niyitegeka.  There was another gentleman who was from the trade department.  I think he was named Augustin, and he was also a member of that committee, which was responsible for managing the company.  And until the beginning of the genocide, Nyowmenmusi, Daniel, was the acting managing director, and there was also this committee which was responsible for a kind of collegial management of the company.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for that information.  Now, let's come back to your own resignation from the MRND, and I want to put this against what you said in your statement.  In your statement of January 2001, you stated that you had been wounded during a women's demonstration.  Do you recall?  
A.	Yes, I remember that very well, Counsel.  
Q.	You stated here before the Chamber in your testimony that during that demonstration, you were wounded with an iron bar, and the wound was to your head.  Do you recall?  
A.	Yes, I recall.  
Q.	Was it a woman who beat you with this iron bar?  
A.	I told you that it was a women's demonstration, and there were women who were against violence committed in the home of the -- Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister.  On that occasion, the women who were not part of the opposition -- or, rather, who were in the opposition, and those who were against the violence against Agathe Uwilingiyimana, participated in the demonstration.  It was a demonstration whose objective was to denounce the violence of which Agathe Uwilingiyimana was a victim.  

But now to come back to your question, it wasn't a woman who hit me on the head.  I said that in that demonstration, there were women and other people who were supporting that women's demonstration.  So it wasn't a woman who hit me on the head.  Let me also tell you that these women were quite saddened by what had happened, and they wouldn't have had the energy to come and hit me.  I was with other members of the MRND in front of the office of the MRND, and that's where I was attacked.  
Q.	So you're saying that it was a mixed demonstration?  
A.	I don't know whether you can hear me.  I think that I've explained what I've said quite well, unless you want me to repeat what I've said.  I was explaining that during that demonstration there were men who had come to support the women's demonstration after what had been done to Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  
Q.	I'm reminding you of your statement of the 11th of January 2001, which you signed on the 20th of January.  In that statement, you stipulate that it was a women's demonstration.  Now, before the Chamber, it is true, you didn't repeat that it was a women's demonstration.  You stated that it was a demonstration against the violence done to the home of Mrs. Agathe, and you said that one of the demonstrators hit you using an iron bar.  
A.	Now, that's not what I said, Counsel.  I said that there were demonstrations which were organised by women who were against the violence against the home of the late Uwilingiyimana.  It wasn't a matter of rape as was indicated in the statement.  And the demonstration was on the 7th of May 1992.  When this demonstration took place, the demonstrators wanted to denounce the violence, and it was referred to as a women's demonstration.  I don't know whether it was authorised.  

	In fact, at the time it was being said that it was a women's demonstration which was held so that they can speak against the attack on the residence of the minister for primary and secondary education who was Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  In fact, she was the minister of education, pure and simple.  And I'm not saying that it was only women that were demonstrating, but it was referred to as a women's demonstration, though there were other people.  So that is what you need to understand from what I have said.  

Once again, let me repeat:  I decided to testify in open court in order to speak the whole truth, and I set aside my own anonymity, and I was an eyewitness to these events.  
(Pages 13 to 26 by Wendy Molnar)



































1200H 
THE WITNESS: (continuing)
If we were to go back to the events of the time, put yourself in the shoes of this lady who, as a minister, who was attacked in her home and she was dragged about, please try and put yourself in her place.  Those are horrible events.  And it is true that this is an analysis of the events that we are making now, but you need to place these events in the context of the time.  There were acts of violence that were committed within the context of the time.  

So, in brief, this demonstration was referred to as a woman's demonstration against that violence.  But amongst the demonstrators there were men.  In the statement that you referred to, if it comes out that it was only women, that wouldn't be true.  It was referred to as a woman's demonstration, although there were men amongst the demonstrators.  And their demonstration was against the violence perpetrated on the women we have referred to. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	So, a man hit you over the head with an iron bar; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, yes, in front of the building that I mentioned. 
Q.	What became of that injury; are there any consequences or side effects? 
A.	Counsel, I'm not sure if we need to go over all of the details, but let me talk to you about this, this is truth.  On the day of the demonstration, someone found me in front of the MRND Kigali office.  At the time I was wearing the MRND cap, there was no problem with that.  During the demonstration I didn't think that I was going to be attacked.  The people were protesting the attack that had occurred -- the attack against that woman.  I didn't think that I was a potential victim, but someone hit me with an iron bar, and there is a scar where I took that blow.  

	After that happened, I took the path that goes by the APACOPE school.  I was going towards the MRND national office, that is where Mathieu Ngirumpatse worked.  I told him that I had just been hit over the head and that I was injured and that I needed treatment.  But as I said before, this was when he had just left the ministry of justice.  It was at this time that we discussed the creation of this new group, the youth of the MRND, in other words, the Interahamwe.  

	At that time, our relationship was a good one.  But then I started to talk to him about how what he was doing was not good, and our relationship soured.  So, I was ill received at his office.  There was someone who had a vehicle, someone from the PL Party, who brought me to a clinic near Nybugogo.  It is a small clinic, and I received treatment there.  

	As I said, I continued to ponder the situation.  And I started to wonder where these men were leading us; this was in the month of February.  I continued to ponder the situation up until the month of April.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse submitted the Interahamwe project so that it could be approved.  I think this was Article 4 of the text.  He asked for approval of the project.  Anyone who has the appropriate documentation can confirm that.

After that event, I continued to ponder the situation.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you have more than answered the question.

Ms. Diagne, I'm getting concerned about the issue of connection to the trial.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
To respond to your concern, Mr. President, we want to look at the story behind the demonstration and how Ngirumpatse and the Interahamwe -- I believe that these issues should be established.  This is extremely important.  There is a theory being built around all of this. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, I imagine that you were bleeding after you were hit over the head? 
A.	I was, that is the case.  I was bleeding a great deal, in fact. 
Q.	And you walked towards the office of Ngirumpatse while you were bleeding; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, please, don't remind me of those unfortunate events.  You know the period that we are dealing with was a difficult one.  I was bleeding, and I took my MRND cap and covered up the wound.  Let me tell you a story.  There was a peasant who was there who helped me.  Those I considered to be my friends said, "We are so sorry," but nobody intervened to try to find a vehicle to bring me to a clinic.  Someone else, in fact, an ordinary citizen, a passer-by took me in his vehicle.  In short, we shouldn't get into the details of this subject.  We can talk about the ideology and other men and other events.  I think that we are going around the same issue.  I'm not sure if you know the complex nature of the events and the serious nature of them.

You were asking me if I were bleeding.  Yes,  I was, a great deal.  Perhaps we can stop here with that type of question.  Many things occurred at that time? 
Q.	Very well, Witness, I will follow your advice.  But I do have a last question regarding something that you brought up.  You said that you have a scar.  Can you show it to us? 
A.	Do you really want to see the scar?  You are so far away; you need to come closer to see the scar. 
Q.	Witness, going by your explanation, you said that you went to see Ngirumpatse and your head was bleeding; you asked him for help.  Can you confirm that you were much closer to the Kigali hospital centre than you were to the MRND office? 
A.	Would you agree that I have a scar?  You asked me that question earlier.  I think we have skipped over that now. 
Q.	You made a proposal, but the Chamber did not say anything about that.  I'm not allowed to move about the chamber without authorisation from the Chamber.

May I proceed, Witness?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Has the question been withdrawn; because there should be some indication on the record whether the witness has a scar or not.  He has offered to show it to the Defence counsel.  I think this line of questioning goes to the issue of credibility; I assume that is why we are staying so long with this.  And if the issue is whether he was injured or not, the witness has volunteered to show you his scar. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would not order counsel to go to look at his scar, if she requests permission, it will be granted. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I do not wish to withdraw my question, as the Prosecution suggests. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness -- I would like us now to speak about the Kibungo meeting? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, Witness, you are permitted to show the scar. 
THE WITNESS:
May I go?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, you stay where you are and point to it. 
THE WITNESS:
It is right here.  Anyone who wants to see it can come closer, it is right here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Counsel, do you wish to see it?  You don't have to go.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Frankly, Mr. President, I'm not sure what to do.  From here I cannot see, I don't know if I should go to inspect the witness. 
JUDGE SHORT:
The choice is yours. 
THE WITNESS:
Touch it, go ahead, touch it.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, Dr. Diagne-Mbaye confirms that there is no scar, no trace of a scar on the witness's head. 
THE WITNESS:
If it is necessary, I will show the presiding Judge; the scar is there, Mr. President.  I'm asking for your leave to approach the Bench to show you.  We can even shave my head for you to see the scar.  I thought we were talking about genocide. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is not necessary for me to see. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, to save some time, I would like us to talk now about the Kibungo meeting.  Can you specify the date of that meeting? 
A.	Earlier you asked me a question where -- about where the Kigali hospital centre was in relation to the MRND office.  If you knew the layout of the city, you would know the answer to that question.  Look at a map of Kigali, and you will see that the distances between the places are not equal.  I'm sorry that you do not know that. 
Q.	Now let's talk about the Cyasemakamba meeting. 
A.	That meeting took place in 1992.  At the time I was still a member of the MRND.  Frankly, I don't remember the exact date.  That meeting took place 14 years ago, so I cannot remember the specific dates.  Perhaps someone like Mathieu, who had a secretary that organised all of that, can inform you better about the matter.  

Earlier you denied that there was a scar on my head, and you will probably say that this meeting never took place.  I thought that you were looking for the truth.  I'm surprised now when you said that you didn't see a scar on my head.  
Q.	Let's talk about the meeting.  
A.	I do want to talk about the meeting, but I still must express my feelings about what you said. 
Q.	Witness, let me suggest, as I did before, that we try to be polite to one another.  We are going to move on.  I'm not here to create a controversy with you.  Let me repeat my question, and if we go by your answer, you don't remember which month the meeting took place but you do remember that it was in 1992.  Can you confirm that, Witness? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said, I don't remember the specific dates.  It seems that you are doing this on purpose.  I don't remember the month, I only remember the year. 
Q.	Very well, Witness, thank you.  Who chaired the meeting, Witness? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse, during that meeting he said that if the Tutsis continued to attach people --  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me.  Mr. President, excuse me, I have an objection.  Again, I object, to the answer to the question as being non-responsive.  It is eliciting information which you have already ruled is inadmissible.  But the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this is cross-examination.

MR. ROBINSON:
The question was perfectly proper, it asked, "Who chaired the meeting."  Now, the witness is giving a non-responsive answer that injects prejudicial material that is not in the indictment.  So, I am asking that you order the witness not to do anything -- to answer the question that has been asked of him, which he has now answered, that Mathieu chaired the meeting.  What he said should be stricken and there should be a next question. Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I have directed you on more than one occasion that you should just answer the question and refrain from making additional speeches.  Your job here is that of a witness, and you give your testimony by answering the questions which are put to you.  You should not do any more than that.  Do you understand that?  Do you understand me, that is all?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
With all due respect to the Court, the tone of the questions that are being put to the witness suggests that he does know -- that he does not know when they occurred, almost as of the meeting itself did not occur.  In fact, I believe Madam Diagne once stated that there was no meeting in Kibungo in 1992 that was her statement to the witness at an earlier point in her examination. 

If the witness answers with detail, it is to provide a basis to show that he is talking about something that is very specific in time that he remembers.  So, if his answer is expansive, I think the Court -- my submission is that the Court should accept it, and allow him to answer expansively.  This Defence counsel has alleged that the meeting did not take place, and if he responds by giving details that he has a clear recollection of a specific meeting, that is a responsive answer.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I think in general that when somebody is cross-examining, if their cross-examination elicits incriminating evidence, then they have to accept it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, first of all, where I come from there is an objection when an answer is not responsive to a question, that avoids problems like this.  And I think that just purely on that basis you should sustain an objection when the answer is not responsive to the question, just on that basis alone.  Now, if the question calls for information which is -- I don't believe should be allowed, I will object to the question before we have the answer.  But if we are going to have an orderly trial here, I think that I have a right to object when a witness is being non-responsive, and that you can sustain it on that basis.  That is how we should proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the problem is that you are not the person who asked the question.  And there has been a pattern developing between the cross-examiner and the witness which has become very argumentative.  So, basically, the person who should be objecting to non-responsiveness is the person who asked the question.  And I think that the way the cross-examination has been developing has created a problem, in my mind, because it has become almost like a debate between the cross-examiner and the witness.  And that is a matter which the cross-examiner herself should control.  But, really, she is the person who should say whether the question is -- whether the answer is not responsive to her question. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That may be, that may be, Your Honour, and I accept that.  But then when the information coming to the Chamber begins to effect the fair trial of my client, whether it is elicited by the Prosecutor or another Accused, for example, causing me to deal with matters that are not in the indictment for the first time, I think I have an obligation to make sure that that does not come in.  And if it becomes a problem, I think we may have to ask for a severance, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I'm not criticising your objection -- not criticizing you for objecting.  I don't see anything wrong with the fact that you objected.  I'm trying now to analyse how the Court should respond to it.  And, basically, as I'm thinking at the moment, it seemed to me that really the problem is with the cross-examiner.  And I'm not quite certain to what extent, in the context of how the cross-examination has been going, I don't think I can do more at this stage than to direct the witness to be more careful in limiting his response to the question that is being asked.  I have tried to do that on more than one occasion already and I have just done it again.  But at the same time, the cross-examination itself is developing this  dynamic.  

I think I have hinted it to the Prosecution -- to Ms. Diagne already.  And I have suggested to her that she should not pursue a line of questioning which becomes argumentative and evokes a debate.  But that is what has been happening between her and this witness.  And that is the problem, as far as I can see. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, you brought my name up, and I would like leave to speak on this issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have leave. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am not trying to be argumentative and create controversy with the witness.  I put very concise questions to the witness and he always goes off on to a tangent; to not interrupt the interpretation, I let him go; otherwise, I will be criticised by the interpreters for interrupting, because it is difficult for them to work in those conditions.  However, my questions have been very brief.  I don't see how my line of questioning poses any problems.  I asked a question about Kibungo.  It was a very short, two second question.  I asked, "Who chaired that meeting?"  He can tell me X or Y did or I don't know who did.  
JUDGE SHORT:
But you see, if he tells you that X chaired the meeting and that Y, A, B, C and D were present, in order to demonstrate to you that he knows what he is saying, then can you object, can Mr. Robinson or you object to the witness saying that if he is providing details to your question to demonstrate the reliability of his answer?  I mean that your question is what has invited a response.  It may turn out to be prejudicial, but it is a response which has been triggered by your question. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Your Honour --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- I want to raise a question with Mr. Robinson, if you don't mind, Ms. Diagne.  You see, we have a situation now where you have put onto the table concerns about the way in which the defence of one Accused may impact upon the defence of another.  And that raises a question as to what are the rights of cross-examination in these issues; you know, does counsel -- should a counsel be permitted to cross-examine about the activities of somebody -- of one of the other Accused?  And that seems to be an issue which, I suppose, we have to resolve here because if there is a right of general cross-examination by each Accused, then we have to accept the answers.  

So, I suppose at some stage one would have -- and this may be an appropriate time to consider, whether or not it is open to one of the Defence counsel to enter into cross-examination on matters which effect other Accused, other than the person being represented, because on this particular issue now, this particular issue seems to relate to evidence which was adduced more specifically towards the Accused, Ngirumpatse.  And here we now have Defence counsel for Karemera pursuing a line of questioning which may bring out more detailed information on that issue.  Now, you have said just now that it may have an impact on your defence for Nzirorera.  I have not myself actually seen the connection as of yet.  But do you have a position on that, on the question of how cross-examination should be conducted? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I think this is actually a very important issue and I think all I can say is, welcome to the world of joint criminal enterprise, because, truly if we didn't have joint criminal enterprise or perhaps conspiracy in this indictment, I would not have any questions for this witness.  I am going to be at least two days with him because the acts of Mr.  Ngirumpatse and the acts of Mr. Karemera and the acts of people who aren't even here, who are deceased, like Mr. Robert Kajuga, are acts upon which Mr. Nzirorera can be convicted, if other aspects of the Prosecution's proof is shown.  And so, I think that triples the length of the trial, it creates all kinds of issues that are not necessarily dealt with in a simple case of the single defendant responsible for his own acts.  But I think on the issue that you have raised, because we have joint criminal enterprise, and perhaps conspiracy, that Mr. Ngirumpatse's acts become the business of all of us and we all have to cross-examine on those acts, as well as acts of people who are not here.  

You know, I hope -- in my own opinion my colleagues are skating close to the line of danger when they ask about something that you have excluded.  So I think that maybe this problem can be something that we can try to work out among ourselves to be more careful, but I think each of us has the right to cross-examine. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) -- I think so, because I don't think -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour's microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think it would be proper for me to restrict cross-examination on an issue that the Prosecutor has been forbidden to introduce.  If it is raised in cross-examination, then it opens the matter, and I think the Accused have the right to do it, if they wish.  Of course, there may be consequences which they may not like afterwards, but if they exercise the right to open the matter I don't think that I should stop them. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I think that as a matter of principle you may have to balance their rights versus the rights of other people who are in trial here.  And if that become irreconcilable, then perhaps we will make a motion for severance and we should have individual trials.  I don't think that it is going to be because we do work very well collectively and we have very many common interests.  It is a problem that has arisen. 

I would also like to say that in the future, I think that the Trial Chamber when you ruled about that Kibungo meeting was not relevant, then you -- at least, what was said at the Kibungo meeting, you made a fine distinction there, that you allowed Mr. Webster to bring out a lot of information about that meeting without being allowed to go into what was being said.  So, what Ms. Diagne is asking is within the scope of direct examination.  I think it would be better if we have something that is not -- an event that is not relevant, that would not even open the door or step so close to the line, because that is, I think, that is also causing us problems here.  If you had ruled that the Kibungo meeting was out, there shouldn't be any questions about it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour -- if I could just respond briefly to Mr. Robinson, because as the Court pointed out this is a pivotal juncture in how the case is going to proceed.  And there are a couple of comments that            Mr. Robinson made that I find rather disturbing.  The first concern is joint criminal enterprise.  

Joint criminal enterprise is not the only basis to allege vicarious criminal responsibility.  We can allege the same facts and there would still be an issue if Robert Kajuga -- or if this Court were to find that Robert Kajuga was a subordinate of any one of the Accused.  So, it is not just an issue of joint criminal enterprise.  

My understanding with the ruling on the Kibungo meeting was that we were getting close to material fact.  It is not that the Kibungo meeting was not relevant, it was so relevant.  Mr. Robinson had made an objection that it was not been pled in the indictment; because it had not been pleaded the material facts that this witness could provide evidence on concerning the statements that were made was the basis of the Court's ruling.  So to suggest now that, you know, it is irrelevant and we should just put it aside is a declination of the argument that led to the Court's decision and to the Court's decision itself.  

So, I agree that this is probably a key issue in the trial, but if the questioning proceeds then the Court can rule, as it has done in the past, on an issue by issue basis, and see what develops from that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
On this issue -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, we do recall -- we do recall the ruling with regard to Kibungo.  It had to do with our perception that what Mr. Ngirumpatse said at the meeting was a material fact of which notice should have been given. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Exactly --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was on the basis of that, it had nothing to do with the question of relevance or probative value. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is exactly my point, Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
 -- of absence of notice. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Robinson's submission of five minute ago, was irrelevant. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know, but you don't have -- you don't have to -- I don't want to encourage too much argument.  I mean, we recall.  It is not necessary to respond to everything that Mr. Robinson says. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  To the extent that the decisions that we made now guide us through the rest of the trial, I would be remiss if I did not bring to the Court's attention significant issue from the Prosecution`s perspective. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
-- addressing this issue precisely because it is pivotal for the Defence; it is always pivotal for the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that.  The issue of the manner is something that I have been thinking about for the whole of this week, actually.  And you see Mr. Robinson has raised it on more than one occasion.  It is something that it is better, in my view, to have on the surface and to get a clear and definitive understanding of what are the rights of the Accused in this issue.  

As I said, I don't know if you have a view on it.  The problem to me, as I see it, is that it is difficult at this stage to identify a rational basis for limiting the right of an Accused to defending himself. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
On this issue, if we use this issue as an example, there is no in -- there is no -- what is the word, the Defence is consistent with regard to all three Accused.  So this is not an issue where the interests of Nzirorera run counter to the interests of Ngirumpatse  or run counter to the interests of Karemera.  

If the counsel for Ngirumpatse is conducting in cross-examination, then all of the questions that are permissible should be answered and the answer should remain on the record.  And the same with all three Accused.  Mr. Robinson hints at filing a motion for severance, but severance is when there are inconsistent defences.  There is no inconsistency in the defence in this issue.  

So we simply have to take the questions if the questions are permissible, then the answers should remain on the record.  There is no inconsistency between the defence of Nzirorera, and the defence of Karemera on this particular issue.  So I don't see why there is a controversy for this issue.  Ms. Diagne has asked the question, the witness has responded, and we should proceed on that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we had just looked at the clock and decided where we should proceed is to lunch.  So, we will now take the luncheon adjournment.  Sorry.

Two housekeeping matters, Mr. Witness, the registrar informed me that arrangements have been put in place for you to be taken from here to the clinic, so you can see the doctor now.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness's microphone. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I would first like to have lunch and then go to the clinic. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will have to work with the registrar on that issue.  I cannot get involved in those details, but in response to your request, he made appointments for you at the clinic.  And you will have to deal with him and the doctor on that basis.

Mr. Webster, I'm reminded that there was something that you were supposed to bring to our attention today with regard to Ms. Des Forges.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I was actually going to make a filing, a written filing.  I have the correspondence already put together and I was going to file it with CMS during the break.  I did not do it this morning, but I will do it during the luncheon hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 

Yes, Ms. Diagne-Mbaye, before I hear you, what we were just considering, in order to give the witness an opportunity to see the doctor, and also have lunch, we think we will resume at 2:45.  That would be a normal 90 minutes lunch break with an extra half hour to permit the medical consultation.

Yes, Ms. Diagne.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
That was my question, in fact.  We spent some time waiting in the past, I just wanted to make sure that this wasn't going to occur. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't know what is going to happen, but I make that provision and, hopefully, we will get to -- we will be better informed today.  

We'll take the luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed at 1245H)
(Pages 27 to 38 by Donna M. Lewis)

































(Court resumed at 1555H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Could you tell me what your condition is now?  
THE WITNESS: 
I feel a bit better, Mr. President.  I was given some medication that I have taken, and I feel better now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are ready to proceed now?  
THE WITNESS: 
Of course, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Madam Diagne.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, can I raise something with the Trial Chamber before we begin with Madam Diagne?  The other day, in entering the court, the Court took note of the particular headdress the witness was wearing.  I think it was three or four days ago.  But I notice some differences today, and maybe it would be appropriate for the Court to place on the record the fact that the witness appears in court this afternoon with a shaved head.  I believe that's in response to the enquiry that was made this morning, and if the Court would either inspect or take note of that, or I can do so for the record.  But maybe it would be more appropriate for the Court if the trial starts, to take note of how the witness appears in court this afternoon.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Objection, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Miss Diagne, your -- your -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I have an objection.  The transcript will show that I never made such a request to the witness.  That's my first objection.  I have a second one, Your Honour.  The video will show that the witness, when I went before him, tried to show me his forehead in front here.  That will be shown on the video.  Thirdly, Mr. President, we must prove, and I -- which side of the iron bar he was hit with.  

I go back to my first objection, I never made such a request to the Chamber that the Prosecutor should not express his comment -- frame his comment in that manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we -- from the point of view of the -- of the Chamber, what would be of interest to us in this issue is one of two things.  I mean, I know now his head is shaved you would like to look at it again and make a comment, or whether the Prosecutor should get somebody else in the courtroom, a police officer or a doctor, to look at his head, and he can lead evidence on oath at the end of his testimony about that.  And then the record will show -- I'm not certain if it's -- in an issue of this nature, we should have an informal statement, unless it is agreed by the two lawyers.  If yourself and the Prosecutor could agree, then that would be easy.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I can certainly go into it on my re-direct, but what I'm requesting at this time is for the Court to note, for the record, that when we commenced the afternoon session that the witness appeared with a shaved head.  And I want it stated in the record that it was an issue in the morning session and by the afternoon session the witness took the care -- or showed the interest of shaving his head in order to better display his -- his scar to the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we don't know why the witness did that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't know why he did.  It's a fact that his head is shaved, but I don't think that we could say anything more than that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  We don't have to go into the reasons, but if it could be stated clearly on the record that during the afternoon session the witness appeared with a bald head.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  For the purposes of the record, for my part, I would like it to be noted that this morning we were told that we would recommence at 2:45 because the witness felt ill.  We have been waiting since 2:45, and many people have been waiting for the witness who was apparently ill.  
Forty people waited one hour for this witness to get his haircut.  I think that that haircut costs a great deal, Mr. President, and I simply wanted to make this comment for the purposes of the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I don't think that's a fair comment.  At -- at around 2:45, the registrar reported to the Chamber that the doctor had seen the witness at 2 -- at 12:30, or just after 12:30, and had requested to see him again at 3 o'clock.  Apparently, there was a particular test that she wanted to run at that time.  And we asked the registrar to inform the counsel that we -- what had happened and that we would be resuming at approximately 3:30.  So I don't think it's fair to say that the -- that the delay was initiated in the way in which you -- you suspected.  We don't know anything else than that, but we do know that the doctor requested to see the witness again at 3 o'clock, and that he was taken to the witness (sic).  And we also received a report from the registrar when that appointment was concluded.  So I think I should just mention that.  
For the rest, he could be questioned about it.  And the best way to get something on record is by evidence on oath.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you don't make a statement.  If anybody wishes to get evidence, they will ask a question and you can respond to it.  

Yes, Ms. Diagne.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  As we have been invited to do so, we are going to put questions to the witness about the scar.  And we'll do this for the purposes of the record, as indicated by my learned colleague, Mr. Webster.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Where did you show me this morning where the scar was, Witness? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel for the Defence.  This morning we discussed my scar.  That is why I went to the barber's.  I told you before that I've come here to tell the truth.  At 2:45, I was here in the waiting room.  The registrar saw me.  After I left that room -- or, rather, after we adjourned at 12:45 I went straight to the barber's shop.  

Counsel Weyl said I delayed the proceedings by going to get a haircut; that's not correct.  With regard to the scar, you can come closer to take a look.  I have cut my hair to show everybody the scar.  When I wanted to show it this morning, you said that you couldn't see it.  And, yet, I think that the people that are seated in front of me can see it clearly.  My aim was to show the Chamber the truth.  That, in fact, is why I came here.  Even back home, I tell the truth whenever I discuss matters with my neighbours.  

I showed you my scar here on my head; I pointed it out with my finger, and you, on purpose, said that you didn't see a scar.  Why should we dwell on this?  There are more important matters at hand.  But regarding your question, that is my answer about the scar.  I have not come here to lie or to create confusion.  I would have preferred to keep my hair, but I cut it off to show you the scar.  That is the only reason.  I did it so that you could see the scar and know for yourself that what I said was true. 
Q.	Witness, where is your scar?  Where is it?  You had a gash on your head caused by an iron bar, you were bleeding, where is the scar now that you've shaved your head?  
A.	Counsel, I should tell you, I no longer have trust in you.  The presiding Judge made a proposal earlier.  I would ask that a security agent come to look at the scar.  You deny the existence of the scar.  Perhaps we should find a neutral party to observe the scar and point out that it exists. 
Q.	Witness, do you acknowledge making a statement to the effect, during your trial in Kigali, that you threw a grenade and that you bought it for 200 francs, 200 Rwandan francs? 
A.	Please confirm to me that we are no longer speaking about the scar, we've moved on to something else. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, counsel intervened too soon, and we could not hear her question because the channels were blocked.  If she could kindly repeat.  
THE WITNESS: 
Well, since you are moving on to something new, many events happened to me -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please wait a minute.  The interpreters have requested that counsel repeat the question because he did not get it properly.  So do not answer until you hear the question repeated.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
For the benefit of the interpreters, I was telling the witness that I have not finished with regard to the issue of the scar.  And then I moved on.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	And I will repeat my question, Witness.  Do you acknowledge making a statement in the past to the effect that you threw a grenade and that that grenade was purchased by you for 200 Rwandan francs? 
A.	Counsel, I answered by saying that many things happened to me during the war.  As you can see in the document you have in front of you, people killed other people.  Yes, I bought a grenade for 200 francs; I threw it.  And that helped me to save the lives of people who were going to be killed.  That is what happened.  I'm not here to tell any lies or to invent any stories.  

You've read that I was sentenced to one year in jail for illegal possession of a weapon.  I must point out, though, that when I threw that grenade nobody was wounded from it, but it helped me to save some people who were about to be killed.  This event did occur, and I'm not afraid to acknowledge it.  I acknowledge everything that happened to me.  That is the answer that I can give you to that question, so you can go ahead and can ask your next question. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But I haven't finished, and when I finish, I'll move on to another question.  Where did you learn how to use grenades? 
A.	It was during the war.  There were grenades everywhere; some were given to members of our families.  When I bought that grenade, the soldier who sold it to me told me how to use it.  I was almost hurt myself by that grenade when I pulled the pin out of it.  I was lucky.  When I threw it, it hit a tree and exploded.  That help me to save the people who were about to be killed.  The attackers ran away.  

But to answer your question, the person who sold the grenade to me told me how to use it.  The same goes for firearms.  All Rwandans, if they were able to get their hands on weapons, maybe less people would have died. 
Q.	So you acknowledge that you know how to handle both grenades and firearms and that you were found guilty on the basis of that? 
A.	That is correct; I acknowledge that.  But I have a feeling that we are losing time.  I acknowledge everything that happened to me.  I have no intention to tell lies here.  I'm not going to lie; I'm not going to tell lies about anyone.  I simply should point out that this reminds me of some unfortunate events, and if you continue to talk about the events of 1994, I may change the way I'm speaking to you.  At one point in time, I may have to use stronger terms with you because these are dramatic -- traumatic, rather, events.  So please be more flexible with me when you ask me questions like that.  I have noticed that you've accepted to assist me, so please continue to remember that.  Remember those Rwandans who have suffered the consequences of those events. 
Q.	Witness, so that the Chamber doesn't think that I am trying to argue with you, you should never have the idea that I am trying to insult you.  Let me proceed, Witness.  

This morning -- or, rather, right before the break when we adjourned, we were talk about the Kibungo meeting.  There was a pending question I had for you.  I asked it at -- from around 12:30.  You talked about the Kibungo meeting, Witness.  You talked about it during your examination-in-chief on Thursday, the 22nd of September.  I was asking you who chaired the meeting.  
A.	I told you that that meeting was chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  That was the meeting at Cyasemakamba.  I participated in it, and it was chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Perhaps other meetings were organised in that préfecture, meetings I did not participate in, but with regard to that meeting at Cyasemakamba, that one was chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  However, you should not think that there was only one meeting in an entire préfecture.  Other meetings could have been organised at the same time, meetings that I did not participate in. 
Q.	I'm talking about the meeting in Kibungo that you specifically referred to, the one that you said that you participated in, that specific one.  
A.	Let me repeat:  I was speaking about the meeting in Cyasemakamba in Kibungo préfecture.  If you don't have that information, you should know that that meeting took place at Cyasemakamba in Kibungo préfecture.  It was chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Why did he chair it? 
A.	Because he was national secretary -- in his capacity as national secretary of the MRND. 
Q.	Let me remind you of what you said.  You said that at the beginning of that meeting -- and for specifics, this is line 13 of the transcripts of Thursday, 22nd September, page 26.  You said that at the very beginning of that meeting the préfet of Kibungo préfecture welcomed the participants, as was the custom.  He made a welcoming speech.  He introduced the guests of honour, introduced the officials of the MRND for Kibungo préfecture -- and I won't mention the names because you asked me specifically not to.  You mentioned the representative of the MRND for Kibungo préfecture, then they introduced the officials from the other préfectures and communes, and then they introduced the administrative officials.  

Moving on, you said that a speech was made by the bourgmestre of that commune who was a member of the MRND.  You also say that the préfet spoke.  And, finally, you say that in general during MRND festivities everyone participated, there were entertainment, and that people were more or less excited.  And there was entertainment, and between the different speeches - 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
	Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That evidence is already on the record.  Why is it necessary to read it again?  Why is it necessary to read it again?  Couldn't you frame your question without you reading all of that?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
There weren't very many paragraphs, Mr. President, but I shall abide by your request.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	So, Witness, tell us, who was the préfet at the time?  And, Witness, can you confirm that he was a member of the MRND? 
A.	Counsel, if you look at how ceremonies were conducted, you would find out that your analysis is not correct.  We have to look at who the honourary guests were and what that means to be guest of honour.  And during those meetings, the guest of honour would deliver a message.  That person would deliver a message for the participants in the meeting.  It -- that message would be considered as a reference.  

But getting back to your question about the political party of the préfet, I answered that question yesterday, and I'm not sure if we have to go back over that.  We always get back to the same things.  I don't know how we are going to move forward.  I'm not used to these types of proceedings, but I am tired of having to go over and over again over the same issues.  I don't want to waste the Chamber's time.  I would have hoped we could move forward.  Your client is right next to you.  Instead of talking about things concerning him, we are talking about other issues.  Pardon me, Counsel.  I think we should understand one another and discuss relevant facts.  

Earlier we were talking about the scar, now we are talking about the préfet.  I'm sure we are going to move on to something else.
(Pages 39 to 44 by Gifty C. Harding)








1630H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it would be much better if you waited for a question and responded to the question.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  What I was saying is that Defence counsel asked me a question.  I'm going to repeat my answer.  Yesterday, as I've explained, I said that the Kibungo préfet, at the time, according to the best of my memory, did not belong to the MRND party.  What I remember -- and you know this was a long time ago.  If this is not correct, then kindly excuse me.  However, when there was a rally, the rule in force during the multiparty era, was that for a meeting or rally to begin, the préfet was to introduce the guests.  This was obviously in order to ensure security of the venue.  The préfet had the choice of remaining and following through with the meeting, or he could leave after having introduced the guests.  That's how things were.  As for the question regarding the préfet of the time, I do not remember whether he belonged to any party.  All that I know is that he wasn't a member of the MRND.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say that Mr. Ngirumpatse attended that rally in his capacity as national secretary, and that you, yourself, attended the rally, when finally we also know that you resigned on the 9th of June 1992, we can agree on the fact that the rally took place between the 28th of April 1992.  I'm telling you this because that's the time from when Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse was national secretary because -- and the 9th of June 1992, because that's the date when you stopped being involved with the MRND.  
A.	Yes, madam, that is correct.  Unless you are wrong about there having been a rally in Kibungo préfet -- préfecture.  But you need to look at what the territorial administration says about this today because you may have false documents.  Because you've also said that there was a meeting possible between the 28th of April 1992, and the 9th of June 1992.  But what I can say, the rally did, indeed, take place during that period of time, yes. 
Q.	So you are confirming what I said?  Because you said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was national secretary, and since you also confirmed that you resigned on the 9th of June 1992, therefore, we are now having a better reference point concerning this rally.  
A.	Those reference points are being brought by you, but what I have seen is that this was told to you by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, but you have ignored what I have told you.  You have refused to allow me to respond.  So that is the situation that we are experiencing right now.  In order to know about dates, to juggle with the dates, months, and all that, confirmation that you want to have me make, maybe you are the one to confirm and check on what you have as information.  All I know is that there was a rally.  But Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, you are not taking into account what he said during this rally.  You're even running away from what he said during the rally.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm trying to situate the date of the Kibungo rally together with you.  That's all I'm doing.  
A.	I'm telling you, Counsel, that there were many rallies.  To have reference to only a single rally is not proper, because you could even deny that that meeting ever took place.  What I'm saying is that there were many rallies that were held.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm not refusing the fact that there were rallies held, and I'm not ignoring the existence of those other rallies.  I'm referring to the specific meeting which took place at Cyasemakamba.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, what's your question for the witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I want to know the date of the rally which -- which took place at Cyasemakamba in Kibungo in 1992.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Ask the witness.  You've been having an exchange with the witness, but ask the specific question you want the witness to answer.  
And, Witness, also, answer the specific question you've been asked.  Don't give a commentary, and then at the end of it, you say, "Well, with regard to the question you asked, this is the answer."  Okay?  This way, we can finish your evidence, you know, quickly.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  

I'm going to answer Defence counsel in the following manner.  The rally took place in 1992, but I do not remember the exact date.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you think that it was before or after the demonstration held on the 28th of May?  
A.	I no longer remember.  
Q.	Very well.  Witness, you stated that the préfet and the bourgmestre were there, and you described the role they played during the rally.  Are you aware that at the time there was a total ban on them?  In other words, préfets and bourgmestre, they were prohibited from participating in any political party gatherings or events.  
A.	Yes, that ban did exist, but the law was not complied with.  But if you were there at the time, you would have realised what the situation in reality was.  I cannot speak to you as a lawyer.  We are trying to make your task easier, as I have said, but you need to take into account the situation as it prevailed at the time.  There were even demonstrations that were not authorised, but which, nonetheless, took place, be it by the MRND or by any of the other political parties.  Counsel, that was the situation.  This is the truth that I'm telling you.  Please accept it.  I didn't come here in order to invent anything.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, since you started testifying before this Tribunal, have you heard what the radio stations in Rwanda have said about you?  
A.	Where are you heading, Counsel?  Please be specific in your question.  What is your interest?  Maybe you heard those radio stations.  Maybe you should tell us what you heard.  All you have to do is to inform us what you heard.  Furthermore, I'm not listening to the news because I don't have a radioset here.  But if they haven't said what I have said here -- and I have said the typical truth here, and this is why I'm speaking openly.  So if you have information, it's up to you to share that -- that information with us.  But frankly speaking -- and God can see me -- I cannot lie.  I didn't follow anything on the Rwandan radio stations.  So if you have any information, maybe it's up to you to tell us what you've heard -- and tell us what they said.  
Q.	I thank you very much, Mr. Witness, and I am through with my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you -- your testimony will continue because now you have to answer questions from the counsel who is representing Mr. Nzirorera.  So you now have to answer questions from him.  You understand that?  

Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I have some applications to make, and I would ask that the witness be excused so that I can make these applications at this time out of his presence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, it's usual for legal issues concerning witness to be discussed in the absence of the witness.  So in those circumstances, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the court.  As soon as we've completed, I will invite you to return.  Yes?  Yes, you can say what -- I will hear you.  What do you want to say?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I was about to leave.  It is true this is something in the legal domain, however, I am going to leave when counsel for Karemera ask me nothing further regarding the statements that I gave to the Prosecutor.  So she admitted that I spoke the truth when I made my statement to the Prosecution.  I am going to take leave of you now, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must not confuse your role as a witness.  It is our job to determine what weight to attach to the evidence that you give.  And we are noting what is happening, and we will draw our conclusions at the right time.  It will be much better if you just listened to the questions that were asked and confine yourself to answering them.  You understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President, and I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
(Witness exited courtroom)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can the interpreters take this opportunity to request that Mr. Robinson speaks into his microphone?  It's a little bit far from him when he stands up to speak.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I take it that you heard that, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, first of all, I would like to make a motion for the Trial Chamber to order disclosure, pursuant to Rule 68, of interviews that the Prosecution has of people who are alleged to have attended the meetings in February of 1992.  It's -- the list of those people are actually contained on an exhibit that was attached -- a proposed exhibit that is attached to my letter to the Trial Chamber coordinator of 26 September.  And it's our position that the Prosecution has interviewed people who are on this list that the witness says was present at the meetings, and I believe that these witnesses have spoke about the formation of the Interahamwe and have not confirmed the existence of these meetings.  

And it's our position that this would constitute material affecting the credibility of this witness and, therefore, should be disclosed pursuant to Rule 68.  So my first application is that the Prosecutor be directed to make a search of his database, and if any of these people have been interviewed, provide those interviews to the Defence, if they touch upon the issue of formation of the Interahamwe.  And I specifically note that some people, for example, Désiré Murenzi, Charles Nyandwi, I think are people who are likely to have been interviewed by the Prosecution.  I'd also note that I cannot conduct this kind of search myself on the electronic disclosure suite because the witness interviews are redacted.  So were I to search, for example, for "Murenzi," I would not be able to come up with any interviews with him.  But the Prosecution is able to do this on their own database, and I believe that they should be required to do that and to make that disclosure.  

I have another application.  I'll make them both at the same time.  And my second application is that I not be required to commence my cross-examination at this time, and I make this application for several reasons.  First, we do not have the translations of the Rwandan material that was first disclosed to us on September 8th of 2005.  I've done everything on my end to see that -- to identify the material to be translated and provide it to your staff, but the translations have not been completed.  I don't believe I should be required to commence my cross-examination till I have a full view of the material that I can use during that cross-examination.  

Secondly, I want to renew matters I've indicated before, so that my record is clear, that because of our inability to investigate in Rwanda, I'm not in a position to adequately cross-examine this witness.  For example, we heard testimony about this textbook supposedly authored by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the meeting in Kibungo, which was not in the indictment and the witness's own dossier; or in his case, he said that his resignation letter was included in his own dossier, for example.  Ordinarily, if I was able to operate in Rwanda, I would have my investigator go out and do these things, so that by the time I'm ready to cross-examine this witness, I have that information.  But I'm not able to do that because the Rwandan government is not allowing my investigator to do his job.  And so I ask first that we defer the cross-examination till the next session of the trial so I can, myself, go to Rwanda in the meantime and do this work or hopefully resolve the situation concerning my investigator.  And that's my second request.  First, to have disclosure of Rule 68 material, and second, to defer my cross-examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we would oppose that application.  I think these are motions -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which one?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?  Both.  Of course we oppose both applications.  I've heard both of these applications before.  I think we've all heard them several times before, in fact.  Mr. Robinson has a very different idea of Rule 68 than we do.  We don't share the same conception of that rule, and I don't think the jurisprudence would support him in his request, which seems more of the nature of a fishing expeditions for his investigations than a legitimate request for Rule 68 material.  The fact that other witnesses may have been interviewed or may have made statements concerning similar incidents does not amount to exculpatory material.  

As a preliminary matter, I did receive the list of participants in the meeting that he referred to.  I don't know where that list comes from.  It bears a registry stamp number.  I would appreciate learning from Mr. Robinson where that list originates.  But beyond that, it's simply not a Rule 68 -- a proper application under Rule 68, and I would oppose it on that basis.  And I think this Trial Chamber has already addressed this issue in previous motions from Mr. Robinson.  

As for deferring cross-exam, the same motion -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Webster, it is true that we have addressed the issue of Rule 68 on more than one occasion, and you probably have accurately represented what we have said about Rule 68.  Would you address the other points that have been raised in connection with this type of disclosure request. 

MR. WEBSTER:
Would the Court mind reminding me of exactly what the other points were?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- well, we are interested, really, in the fair trial rights which may arise when questions of this nature are raised.  We don't have much information.  There's not much -- I can't ask you too specific a question at this stage.  You probably are better -- better positioned to understand what are the other implications and to give us some information which could assist our decision.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me begin by looking at the list itself.  I'm assuming that you're talking about the first request where he has a list of names.  It bears registry stamp number 23977.  Apparently, it's coming from another case.  It was filed in another case.  I don't know what case that was.  It says, "List of People Present at Interahamwe Meeting in February 1992."  The first name on the list is Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Every statement by Mathieu Ngirumpatse has been served on the Defence.  He made -- he was interviewed by OTP investigators.  He made a number of communiqués.  He spoke on the radio.  Everything that Mathieu Ngirumpatse has ever said that we have, and that we're aware of, was served on the party.  

Next on the list -- next on the list is Désiré Murenzi.  Off the top of my head, I don't know if he was interviewed by the OTP.  If he was interviewed and he did make statements in regard to this meeting, it's the type of information that I would know.  I've been working with this case for the past seven years.  I don't recall any statement from Désiré Murenzi in regard to these set of meetings.  

Charles Nyandwi, the same thing.  

Robert Kajuga, anything stated by Robert Kajuga was disclosed to the parties.  In fact, one of his statements that we wanted to introduce during this trial was excluded on motion from Mr. -- Mr. Robinson, and it goes squarely to the issue that we're addressing through this witness's testimony, which is whether the Interahamwe organisation was formed by the MRND party.  So in terms of statements by Robert Kajuga, those have been disclosed, but apparently Mr. Robinson is not interested in having those statements placed before this Court.  

Pheneas Ruhumuliza, we did a search of a number of -- of all of the -- the alleged -- or the -- the leadership of the Interahamwe who have made statements or whose letters or communiqués exist in our files.  We have looked through that material specifically for Rule 68 concerns.  That was in response to a motion filed by -- by Mr. Robinson.  That was done at least twice before.  I recall addressing this issue sometime in 2003, and I think it was addressed again.  So in regard to Pheneas Ruhumuliza and Georges Rutaganda, I think those searches have been done, and we've confirmed that to Mr. Robinson.  Georges Rutaganda was tried by this Tribunal.  He was found guilty.  He was -- he made a direct exam.  He was cross-examined.  All of the statements during the course of his trial are available to Mr. Robinson because they're in the public domain.  I would assume that he's already searched through the transcripts of the Rutaganda trial.  In fact, when he offered Georges Rutaganda's Interahamwe ID card as a Defence exhibit in the first Karemera trial, I assumed it was on the basis of making a meticulous search of the trial records of Georges Rutaganda.  

There is a name Ephreim.  There is a name Eugene Mbarushimana.  I assume that these are the two names that this witness has already mentioned in regard to the national leadership of the Interahamwe.  To the extent that we have any records in our office, from any member of the national leadership of the Interahamwe, I, myself, participated in a Rule 68 search.  We -- I don't recall finding anything that would be disclosable, personal to Rule 68 in regard to this case or in regard to this witness.  

Warrant Officer -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You've changed the language slightly with regard to Ephreim and -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Eugene Mbarushimana.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Are you saying that there's no statements made by them, or are you saying there are no statements made by them which you assess falls under Rule 68?  
MR. WEBSTER:
The latter, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are statements, but in your view, they're not Rule 68 disclosable?  
MR. WEBSTER:
With respect, well, I don't want to violate some of the protective orders that are currently in place.  So I'm trying to couch my language in a way that would allow me to be candid in my response but, at the same time, not -- not violate orders of this Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I have a request to invite you to speak a bit more slowly.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If you give me one second, Your Honour, I will look -- 
(Pages 45 to 51 by Wendy Molnar)

1700H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The next name on the list is warrant officer Urimubenshi.  I'm not aware that this person has ever been interviewed.  I believe this is a presidential guard that the witness mentioned in his testimony.  I'm not aware that he was ever interviewed by the OTP.  Aloys Ngirabatware, this was a leader of the Interahamwe in Remera.  This person, I don't believe has been interviewed by the OTP.            François  Karera is under indictment by this Tribunal.  I don't recall off of the top of my head if he has ever made any statements to OTP investigators when he was arrested, but I do not believe so.  Nyumbayire, sous-préfect in Kigali-rural, I don't know if that refers to the name of the person or the place, but I'm not familiar with that person.  Odette Nyirabagenzi, this was a conseiller in Kigali, in Nyarugenge.  I don't believe she was ever interviewed by the OTP.  Gitega secteur, conseiller,  Jacques Rusirari, I don't know who that is.   I mean, I can keep going down the list.  Off of the top of my head, I don't recall statements from a number of these persons.  

But what I can assure the Trial Chamber is in regard to the meetings of February 1992 that                Mr. Robinson is concerned with, I am aware of two witnesses who have given statements to the OTP, in addition to this witness -- three witnesses who have given statements to the OTP with regard to these meetings.  And they are all witnesses in this case; their statements have been disclosed.  

Now, I have tried to comply with the Trial Chamber's request, and I can give this issue more thought and report back to the Trial Chamber tomorrow morning; but, quite frankly, this is exactly what            Mr. Robinson is trying to do, which is to force us to do his investigations for him in the context of the trial.  And with all due respect to the Trial Chamber, I submit that this is not appropriate.  These are issues that we have gone over before in this case.  And it is not appropriate to force the Prosecution to do Defence investigations when we have witnesses on the stand, to use the presence of a witness on the stand to do additional investigation.  

Mr. Robinson had the list last week, I'm sure, before this witness was even sworn to testify, a more appropriate moment to make this request, to the extent that this request is appropriate, it should have been made before the witness took the stand.  Why are we addressing this now, as he is trying to delay the commencement of his own cross-examination of this witness?  

Moving on to the second issue that Mr. Robinson raises; inability to investigate in Rwanda.  That has been the subject of two or three different applications.  He included it in his application to delay the start of this trial, and this Trial Chamber has already addressed that issue.  The reference of the text book, well that is something that arose in the context of this witness's testimony.  As an advocate in this trial, he should be able to deal with that information spontaneously, on his feet, the way we all do in relation to witnesses who testify before this trial.  It did not place him at an unfair advantage.  It is not a material issue in this case.  Why we would expend the Court's time and resources to look into something as far a field from the material issues in this case as to whether a text book in Rwanda was authored by Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  The meeting in Kibungo, this is something that was mentioned in at least two or three witness statements that were taken as far back as 2003, why is that an issue now when the witness is in the middle of his cross-examination?  

The dossier that the witness mentioned here in court for the first time concerning his letter of appointment as a civil servant, what relevance is that really to the issues that this witness is to address for this trial, the substantive issues?  Is there any doubt that this witness was a civil servant or employed in the ministry of justice in 1992.  Is that really an issue that this Court would interrupt this cross-examination to explore in relation to this trial, as complexed as this trial is and as central as the substantive issues that this witness was brought to address are?  In the context of all of that, how appropriate is it to slow things down and take our resources to address questions so far a field of the central issues, in this case, and the central issues that this witness was brought to address.  

This witness has been under cross-examination for at least two days.  And the witness himself commented over and over again, that very little was put to him in the way of the central issues in this case that he was brought here to address.  This is simply an extension of the same strategy employed by the two other Defence attorneys.  

So, I would ask the Court to dis -- to rule against these two Defence applications.  They are inappropriate; they are repetitive.  We have dealt with these issues over and over again.  This Court has -- this newly composed Trial Chamber has dealt with these same issues, each one of them at least twice before.  And on that basis, I will conclude and ask that the Court deny the Defence's motion and that we move ahead.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I make a brief reply to that?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  With respect to Rule 68, you have discussed this in the past in your rulings and you denied our general motions for all information that contradicts Prosecution witness's testimony -- anticipated testimony or statements on the grounds that that was not specific enough. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I don't think that was the basis of our ruling.  What they are saying is that if you are going to invoke Rule 68, you cannot do it if you don't know, if it is a fishing expedition.  So, you have not made a prima facie showing that there is material that is exculpatory.  That is the basis of our rulings. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand, Mr. President.  And what I am now asking to now be done, this list of people present comes directly from the statement of the witness that was given in January of 2001.  These are the people that he has said were present.  I'm going to go over this list with him, and have him confirm or make some changes to that.  

Now, the issue is, if the Prosecution has information from any of these people that either this meeting didn't occur or that what Mr. Ngirumpatse is alleged to have said at these meetings was not said, that contradicts the testimony of a Prosecution witness, therefore, it falls with my Rule 68.  Now, if you are requiring me to know whether these people have been interviewed by the Prosecution and whether they have been asked those questions and made those statements, that is an impossible burden for me to meet.  And I don't believe Rule 68 requires that.  

This is a very specific request now.  These are people who have been placed at a meeting, or a series of meetings.  The question is now, have they been interviewed and do they confirm or deny or touch on whether such meetings took place, or whether this was part of the formation of the Interahamwe.  It is a simple thing for the Prosecution not to rely on the top of Mr. Webster's head, but to go to the database and to put in the names.  Step one, have they been interviewed?  Step two, review the interview, and see if it touches upon this subject.  And then if it does and it is inconsistent with the government -- it is inconsistent with the witness's statement, then it should be disclosed.  

So I think, I have met my burden under Rule 68 to make a specific request, and to show, at least, some likelihood that this information is in the possession of the Prosecution.  I can't be expected to do more than that without access to their files, which I don't have.  So that is the basis of my Rule 68 request.  

With respect to my inability to investigate in Rwanda, yes, I am bringing this up over and over again, but I'm going to be requested at some -- I'm going to be asked at some point on appeal, if this case is appealed, to show that I made a showing of prejudice; and so, I am now being specific and I will do this with every witness.  I am going to be specific as to how I am prejudiced.  These are things that would have been investigated had I had the ability to do it, I haven't been able to do it.  

So, now you have more information, you have a showing of prejudice, and I'm asking you to decide on that basis.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just one follow up, if I may, Your Honour; I'm still curious about where this document came from.  And if the Court could enquire of Mr. Robinson, where this -- you know, where this appears in another file before this Tribunal, and why this request wasn't made months ago, because the issue is we           have -- the witness has already started his cross-examination.  It is not even a question of finishing my direct examination; he has been cross-examined by two lawyer.  

Now, as Mr. Robinson is primed to commence his cross-examination, he is asking that we do discovery and that we conduct his Defence investigations.  If these were issues that he was able to frame with specificity, today, these issues could have been framed weeks ago, or months ago.  And if this request was appropriate, it may have been appropriate months ago; it is certainly not appropriate now.  

So I am asking the Court to deny the request.  I have already represented to the Court that we have done Rule 68 searches on this witness and on the issue of the formation of the Interahamwe.  Beyond that, despite this list of specific individuals, I would submit that this is not a showing that there exists exculpatory material in the possession of the Office of the Prosecutor that we need to disclose.   

This is just a list that Mr. Robinson is hoping to draw something that he can use in his cross-examination.  And if that is a legitimate request, it should have been made a month ago, whenever he came into possession of this list.  He has already stated that these names appear in the witness's testimony during his direct examination, many of these names I see in the witness's own statement from 2001 that he has had in his possession for at least two or three years now.  So, at this time, this request is inappropriate, and the Court should deny it on that basis alone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have come to a decision on both applications.  With regard to the motion for Rule 68 disclosure, we consider that we have already addressed this issue, quite adequately.  On this particular application, not only has there been no specific information that could be considered exculpatory.  We have had the benefit of the statement of counsel at the bar table, who has given the assurance that searches have been made, and have not revealed material for disclosure.  We do not think that we can go behind that statement without evidence being brought.

We also note that Mr. Webster has offered to search again and report back to the Chamber.  We dismiss the application for the Rule 68 disclosure.

With regard to postponement of the cross-examination, we do not think that postponement of the cross-examination is the appropriate remedy for either of the problems that have been referred to.  I'm informed that the translation, as you have said, is not completed.  So I'm aware -- we are aware of that.  We know that approximately five or six pages have already been translated, and that some pages are still in the process of translation.  I don't have information as to exactly when they will be available, but I anticipate and hope that they will be available very soon.  However, we don't think that is a reason to postpone the cross-examination, neither do we think that the problem with the investigator is a reason for postponement of cross-examination.  

As we have stated when we formally considered this matter in the past, if there is a need for further cross-examination, if matters are discovered which could impeach the witness's credibility, we've already ruled that the witness could be recalled for that purpose.  We do not think that the cross-examination should be deferred.  

There is one other comment I must make; we were not impressed with the suggestion that this application, or the same applications are going to be repeated at the commencement of every witness's testimony, whether the ostensible purpose is for keeping the record pure or not.  The record, I think, is already quite clear that you have made these applications, and the record of our ruling is also quite clear.  If that is an appealable issue, it is already on the record.  

But we are not going to permit the regurgitation of the same issue, on which we have ruled, over and over again.  We would consider it contemptuous of our court if that course of action is taken.  So we trust that we have said enough on that issue.

Now, call the witness for cross-examination.  
	(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your cross-examination will commence now.  You have to answer the questions put to you by counsel for Mr. Nzirorera.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do, I do Mr. President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	(Kinyarwanda spoken)
A.	Good day, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, first of all, I want to tell you that I appreciate your testifying in your true name, and I thank you for that.  I appreciate that you are not hiding behind a pseudonym.  That is very courageous of you, and you have my respect for that.  I want to tell you that I appreciate you bringing documents with you, and we may refer to some of those documents during the course of this examination.  So I thank you for that as well.  
Now, I want to first ask you, you completed your studies in 1991 and you were aware that Mr. Karemera had come up with a draft programme for the MRND party in 1991, correct? 
A.	Well, I can say, yes and I can say no; that could generate problems.  It is true that I finished my studies in 1991, on the 5th of July, that was.  And the draft constitution was adopted when I was still in school.  The constitution was promulgated in June when I was still in school.  So that is tantamount to saying that I was still in school when the constitution was adopted.  

When I was in school there was the commission that was to conclude on the constitution.  I don't know, there are some who say it was the 10th of June 1991, so as far as I was concerned, I finished on the           5th of July 1991.  The draft constitution, therefore, was drafted through the time I was in school.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I have the assistance of the registry to show the witness a document, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
If it can be shown to the Trial Chamber and the Prosecutor as well.

Mr. President, this was disclosed through the registry last Friday, so everybody should have a copy of this document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I place before you a document which is entitled the National Commission of Synthesis for the Reform of Politics in Rwanda.  And I will ask you if this is the report of the synthesis commission that you referred to in your testimony earlier? 
A.	May I read the document?  This is the first time I am seeing this document since at the time we were only sent fly leaves -- not brochures, we were sent fly leaves, so I would like to be given leave to peruse this document, and determine whether it was the report of the national synthesis commission.  Now, probably we should talk about what happened before this document was prepared, least -- well you --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we don't have time for you to read the document.  If you don't recognise the document, that is an answer. 
THE WITNESS:
This is the very first time I am seeing this document, Mr. President.  This is the truth, this is the first time I am seeing this document.  I am not inventing or creating anything. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us the events that led to the report of a synthesis commission being prepared on political reform in Rwanda? 
A.	I'm not very clear on that.  Are you talking about the commission or the constitution?  I'm very sorry, this is the very first time I am seeing this document.  And to tell you the truth, I see March 1991; I was still in school, I was still a student.  I see Kigali, March 1991.  I was still in school, sir.  And you want me to talk about this document; I will be mendacious if I told you that I knew the content of this document. 
Q.	I have in my notes that you testified on the 20th of September, that Mr. Karemera had come up with a draft programme for the party in 1991.  What were you referring to? 
(Pages 52 to 58 by Donna M. Lewis)






























1730H
THE WITNESS: 
Could you -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda interpreters beg that counsel repeat the question.  
THE WITNESS: 
No, what I'm saying, sir -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wait one moment, please.  Mr. Robinson, I don't know if it came through your headphone, but the interpreter has requested that you repeat the question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	You testified, according to my notes on the 20th of September, that Mr. Karemera had come up with a draft programme in 1991.  What were you referring to? 
A.	Are you referring to the 28th September?  I don't know the date today.  Probably somebody should help me with the date today.  I heard the 28th of September. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I don't think the date was very important.  What counsel was telling you is that you've been giving evidence for some time, and at one of the earlier days that you were giving evidence, his notes of your evidence show that you had made that statement.  You understand?

The date he gave is the 20th, not 28th, the 20th of September, but he is saying that his notes of your testimony reveal that statement, and he is asking you about it.  
THE WITNESS: 
Well, in that respect, I did not say that he made a synthesis concerning the party.  I was talking about the constitution, sir.  And, of course, they all had to make inputs for the preparation of the constitution -- for the drafting of the constitution.  It was within that framework that we were asked at the school to make inputs; in other words, formulate opinions.  If you note -- if you mis-noted what I said, probably you should correct it.  The document wasn't talking about the party; it was talking about the constitution.  I think you should probably correct that.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm going to move now to the constitution, but I'm noting the hour, 5:37, and I also have one matter to raise with the Trial Chamber before we adjourn, so perhaps I could do that tomorrow when we come.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay.  This is an appropriate time for the adjournment.

Mr. Witness, we've now passed 5:30, our scheduled stopping time for the day, and we are going to take the adjournment now.  I remind you, as I have on all previous occasions, that you remain a witness during the adjournment and you are not to discuss the case.  You may go now until tomorrow morning.  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you most gratefully, Mr. President.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have an interesting legal issue for you to consider overnight, or whenever you want to consider it.  It relates --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you say that with a smile?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I can say that's probably what you need at 5:40 in the afternoon.  But our -- it relates to 
Rule 15 bis of the Rules, and that rule provides that if a Judge, through illness or other urgent personal reasons or for authorised Tribunal business, is unable to continue sitting in a part-heard case in a period which is likely to be of a short duration, then you can continue for five days sitting with the -- in the absence of that Judge.

And it's my position that now that it has been discovered that Judge Kam will be absent for greater than five days, that you are not -- that Rule 15 bis no longer applies because we are not under a short duration anymore.  That now, once it's learnt that he will not be absent for a short duration, you're no longer authorised to sit under Rule 15 bis, and you have to adjourn the proceedings until either the Judge returns from the short duration, or it's necessary to consider the application of Rule 15 with respect to a substitute Judge.  So I ask that we not convene until Judge Kam has returned.  Thank you 
JUDGE SHORT: 
Now I understand why you made your submission with a smile.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we will resume tomorrow morning, if only to hear our decision.  So we do take the adjournment until tomorrow -- sorry, I forgot.  I should I have given the Prosecutor an opportunity to respond.  

I do apologise, Mr. Webster.  I should have given you an opportunity to respond.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We oppose the motion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the thought that came to mind is that, like Mr. Robinson, you are also trying to make me smile.  Your brevity was very welcomed.  
MR. WEBSTER:
