P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 1st of November 2005, for a pre-Defence conference in the matter of The Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Mr. Registrar.  Could we have appearances, please, starting with the Prosecutor?  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Madam Fall, Mr. Morley, Mr. Adama Niane and Mr. Kadi Lapika -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think she said.  Sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The Defence, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
Good morning.  David Hooper on behalf of André Rwamakuba, and today I have my new legal assistant with me, Julie Oberti, who comes from France, from the south of France.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Welcome back to the new trial session, and we trust that things will go as well and smoothly as the last sessions have gone, or perhaps even better.  

Mr. Hooper, I have noted that the Accused is not with us again today.  There was a hint that his position may have changed when it came to presenting his defence. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, you were right to detect that hint, but it hasn't been realised and his position this morning is as it was throughout the last session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, again, I would be grateful if the position of the Chamber could be conveyed to him, that his presence is desired for the presentation of his case and that he's free at any stage to attend.  

Now, I note that, from our perspective, there doesn't seem to be a very long list of matters to address.  In fact, we have just listed two issues which have to do with the status of disclosure and, secondly, with the scheduling of the Defence witnesses, and I don't know if there are any other matters which anybody would wish to raise.  So at this stage, are there any other items that need to be put on to our agenda for discussion?  
MR. HOOPER:
There's a matter which I wish to raise at some point.  It may be that this morning isn't the most appropriate time to deal with it, but it's a matter that perhaps could be mentioned at least to mark up, and that is that it's our submission that this Chamber should, in fact, view the locus in quo, that is, rather broadly, those relevant parts of Rwanda relevant to this case and that there should be a visit to Rwanda by this Chamber in order to familiarise itself with the nature and characteristics of the country and, in particular, the places that feature in the allegations that the Prosecutor have brought against André Rwamakuba.  I don't want to advance that argument, if argument it be, but perhaps at some point it's a matter that could be, I hope, considered.  In fact, in raising it, I suppose largely I do it in order to bring it to your attention, Mr. President, and that of your Brother Judges, which it may have occurred to you from time to time.  But before any decision is reached, I'd like you to hear me slightly more extensively in respect of that.  

Certainly, visits or "views," as they're known in English law or English practice, "going for a view," it's going for a view which -- of the locus in quo, which is the matter I raise, is not specifically mentioned in the rules though I think both Rule 4 and Rule 54 would cover it, and, indeed, as I understand it, whatever the practice here, and I'm not sure if there has been a view here -- I think there has been one.  Certainly, at the ICTY, as I understand it now, Chambers are positively encouraged to view, not once, but twice.  And I have had sight of a memorandum where certainly one of the Judges there has explored the potential for it and come down resoundingly in stating that it's very much in the interests of the Accused, in justice generally, both sides perhaps, that the rather inadequate descriptions and explanations of territory, which, in fact, has been very evident in this case so far, are filled out and appropriately addressed by the Judges themselves, the finders of facts themselves, seeing it for themselves.  And these days, with Rwanda being a relatively more settled country, as I understand it, the difficulties that perhaps were originally faced when this Tribunal kicked off aren't so evident today.  But, as I say, perhaps I can either repeat or perhaps go into a little bit more of the advantages in our submission to this on another occasion.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  In respect of this point, I think -- in respect of the points to be discussed this morning, I'd like to know if the list of witnesses is final, and that is a total of 67.  Does it stick?  And then with regard to Rule 90 bis, several of the witnesses are detained and we wonder whether the inter partes agreement we had come to also applies to the Defence. 

Also, a witness has died, is deceased, and we wish to know whether the Defence wishes to avail itself of 92 bis.  And a final point would be the question of admission of facts.  I think an order had been given to the Defence to make its request by the 19th, and we had a week, seven days, to respond.  Unfortunately, we received the request on the 24th.  We were not present.  We did correspond with Counsel O'Shea, informing him that it was only on our return that we could give our response, and we only returned last night.  So that is why there has been -- there was this delay, and it will only be today that we give our response.  

These are the only two points I wish to add, Mr. President.  However, excuse me, I should like to add that I support the Defence request, although premature, concerning the locus in quo view of the site, but in view of the distance between the site of the crimes and where the interim government were situated, I do think it would be very useful for the Bench, the Trial Chamber, to go for a view to see the various places where the offences were committed, the distances involved.  I do think it would be very useful. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you very much.  Well, it doesn't seem that there is -- that we are going to be occupied for a very long time today.  The note I have here is that the list of Defence witnesses and their details has already been served on the Prosecution.  Is that accurate, or is there a problem with the disclosure of the witness details?  Is that accurate?  My note is that they were served on the 10th of October.  
MR. HOOPER:
I think earlier than that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Earlier than that.  But that is -- that's not an issue of contention. 
MR. HOOPER:
No, indeed.  We not only served the witness list and details, we've served statements in respects of each witness taken from the witness, or if those weren't present, notes of interviews between witnesses and investigators.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The list of exhibits has been filed.  Is there likely to be any controversy on the admission of the exhibits?  
MR. HOOPER:
The exhibit list has been shown to the Prosecution.  I don't know if a copy has been shown to -- or available for the Chamber, but in fact most of them are still in the catch-way of "I don't know" in terms of admissibility, so that's a work in progress.  But it is underway.  

In terms of admission of facts, it's right, and I accept that most of the Prosecution team were away until very recently, and if they can provide a response to the admissions by Wednesday or Thursday of this week, then that would certainly be sufficient. 
MS. FALL:
I think that there is no quarrel regarding admissions, so we received it with some delay, and we will try to now prepare a response as soon as possible.  With regard to the list of witnesses, indeed, we did receive the list, but we have a problem.  For some witnesses, it hadn't been -- we don't have the addresses and the information that would allow us to make our investigations.  I deplore that because the time given to us is very short.  

The proof of that is that when we -- the proof of that is we got the address of an alibi witness after we left -- or just as we were leaving, and we could not, therefore, include that in what we did, and that is a serious prejudice to us.  So we should appeal to Counsel Hooper to have all the information that we should lack.  We were able to see, when we went to see alibi witnesses, having of course forewarned Counsel Hooper, for some of them we only had one statement, whereas they had made two.  That is very clear.  And we would like Counsel Hooper to disclose to us.  We have a list of people who made preliminary statements and then subsequent statements in 2005 for purposes of structuring.  That is what we were told.  And we should like to have copies of the first statements they made.  

As regards the exhibits, Mr. President, I should merely like to point out that we received them on Friday.  Perhaps Counsel Morley can add something on this, as I only returned yesterday evening.  I haven't had a chance to go over it, I don't -- as I received them only Friday.  Perhaps Counsel Morley, with your permission, Your Honour, might add something on that score.  
MR. MORLEY:
May it please Your Honour, I was helpfully shown on Friday afternoon by my learned friend, Mr. Hooper, and his co-counsel, Mr. O'Shea, a series of about 12 documents which I was able to make some tentative observations about, subject to the review by my learned leader.  It seems to me that some of the exhibits are probably not objectionable, and it seems to me that some of them are probably obviously objectionable, and the position with the exhibits will no doubt resolve itself as my learned friend advances his Defence case and therefore the context in which he offers the various documents.  The documents have been seen and they have been looked at, and we now have copies of them.  

With regard to admissions, there was a very short list, helpfully prepared by Mr. O'Shea, and it was pretty clear to me that some of the proposed admissions cannot be agreed.  With regard to the others, I think there is room for agreement 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just as a matter of interest, would you be willing to give an undertaking as to time, what day would this be done?
MR. MORLEY:
Subject to my learned leader's thoughts, if the documents which we have copies of and the admissions which we have copies of are the final documents, then we should be able to give a final decision by Thursday.  Earlier than that, if necessary.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thursday is a holiday. 
MR. MORLEY:
Wednesday.  
MR. HOOPER:
It's such a short list, and Mr. Morley has seen it and has had it in his care and attention for several days, and Ms. Fall's had it, presumably, since yesterday.  In my submission, tomorrow wouldn't be putting undue pressure.  It's a short list, it's a question of yes or no, but it is significant because some of it determines whether we get the witnesses here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not sure about the procedure here about working on holidays but you really have only tomorrow, because I gather Thursday -- both Thursday and Friday are holidays here. 
MR. HOOPER:
Tomorrow is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wednesday.
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's the problem, there's no -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I thought it was Monday until this moment, so -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, there is not much time.
MR. HOOPER:
Then, certainly, tomorrow, by Wednesday.  I wouldn't have thought there's a problem there.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I should not like to give an undertaking that I couldn't respect.  As I've said, we did receive the document.  I said I would get down to it today and do my best to answer as soon as possible, but if really we can't do so, I think that by Monday, early in the morning, we could hand back the document.  But, really, if there isn't any insurmountable problem, we'll try and hand it back as soon as possible.  But I prefer to be cautious. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Well, really, I think that's too long.  The Prosecution have had possession of this.  It could have been discussed.  It's not a long list.  I don't know if you have it there, Mr. President, but it's significant to our -- what we do.  And I would have thought that a list that's being looked at today could be -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, if there is any fault in terms of tomorrow, would you be willing to deal with it, say, on Thursday?  Or that's a public holiday.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, that doesn't pose a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would that be a problem for the Prosecutor?  
MS. FALL:
No, Mr. President.  I think that to get things moving, if we haven't done it for tomorrow, we'll do it for Thursday.  But we must be cautious, and I'm somewhat anxious, to the extent that I think Defence is taking all its time and then requires the Prosecution to be expeditious in responding.  I think that in order to ensure equality of arms and a balance, I think that if the Defence takes its time, the Prosecution should have the time to answer efficiently.  

The Defence was supposed to give it to us by the 19th.  We waited.  Had it been done by the 19th, we would have done it before leaving.  Unfortunately, it was handed in on the 24th and we'd already left.  But we will do our best to meet the commitments we have undertaken, and I repeat that, by Thursday at the latest, we will have done so.  We will have complied.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, there's one issue raised by Ms. Fall which probably requires a response and it had to do with addresses of witnesses, of some witnesses.  Is that a -- are you aware of the exact complaint?  And is this something that can be addressed?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it's something that can be addressed.  If I'm provided with those witnesses where there is a particular concern, I can provide or seek to provide the addresses.  The difficulty is that quite a number of these witnesses don't have addresses.  There's no -- it's the nature of the place.  So I can say, as is plain on the document, "Gikomero, "Gikomero secteur," and perhaps a little place within that, but they won't find "No. 15 Railway Cuttings" there.  It's not that kind of situation.  So if my friend wants to indicate which of these witnesses in particular she is concerned about, I will do my best to provide those addresses.  

On the other matter she raised on statements from witnesses, first of all, I was rather surprised to learn yesterday that this appears to be the first Defence team to actually serve statements at all in respect of witnesses.  But whether that's right or not, what I would say is this, that I'm not aware in respect of alibi witnesses, Monet, Van Balen, Mercenier and Vanwynsberghe, Nkubana, of any of them having provided previous statements, that it was in respect of those statements or those persons that Ms. Fall, as I understood it, was concerned and said that she had heard that there'd been previous statements.  

So, again, that's a matter of -- perhaps not to go into further now, but before we leave this room this morning, I hope Ms. Fall can indicate to me what her particular concern is because I'll try and help her if there are further statements.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Ms. Fall, that does not need to be done on the record.  That -- you can address Mr. Hooper when we rise.  
MS. FALL:
Quite, Mr. President.  I merely wanted to tell Mr. Hooper that I am in a position to give him the names of the people who'd said they'd made a first statement and that this second statement was made, I quote, "to structure."  And the second statements were all made in 2005.  

As regards the addresses -- and that is a difficulty we really have on the basis of the information given by Mr. Hooper for the Defence witnesses, all the information is false.  When we went to Rwanda -- it's not a problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, in view of what Mr. Hooper said, maybe you are asking for the wrong thing.  Instead of asking for an address, maybe you should ask for a road map.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, are you going to delay the trial to allow us to go on the spot and identify the witnesses?  But in view of the short time we had, that's what we did:  We went on the spot.  We questioned, and we were able to obtain addresses for the witnesses.  This is a problem, to the extent that it doesn't help us to do our investigations correctly.  We can discuss with Counsel Hooper, there's no problem with that.  But if we're going to have an equal combat, all the information that -- since the Prosecutor gave all the information he possessed on his witnesses, Mr. Hooper should do likewise with his witnesses.  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I can best answer that by inviting the Chamber to look at the witness list that's been served, and you'll see the information that's been provided.  It's less deficient than that which was served in response to the last point by the Prosecution on us.  We haven't approached it like that.  What we've put on that document is all that we know in terms of the identification of the place or address of a particular witness, and if you look at each and every witness, it's obviously complete, or as complete, I hope, as it can be.  And there are - 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I don't think that this requires our intervention, really, at this stage.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I take the word of both counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I trust that if you meet after we have rise, that any remaining problems would be resolved effectively. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, on the witness disclosure, I suppose the next issue has to do with the scheduling of Defence witnesses.  Are you in a position to identify which witnesses you are going to call and the order of appearances?  We feel that you should at least produce the appearance list for next week at this time and, as soon as possible, your appearance list in general.  
MR. HOOPER:
The latter would be difficult, but in fact, I think two weeks ago we provided both a list for the 7th and a list for the week of the 14th.  That inevitably, as the Chamber will appreciate, alters -- alters by the day, to some extent -- but at present WVSS have confirmed that five witnesses are available on the 7th, and those witnesses are known to the Prosecution.  And I can clarify the situation further. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would the Chamber also get a notification of the witnesses that are scheduled on a week-by-week basis?  
MR. HOOPER:
I think I've sent the document.  If I haven't, I'll send it.  Because, as I say, these are inevitably works in progress, as the Court -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that, but it's useful to get the information, for it assists us as well in our preparation and planning. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  And statements have been served in respect of the witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Ms. Fall raised a few issues with regard to the detained witness, the inter partes agreement, the deceased witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
There were two deceased witnesses, it turns out.  I have a death certificate in respect of one and I'm seeking one for the other, and in due course there will be an application which I'll make as a joint application for both witnesses.  
In respect of those detained in Rwanda, we were perhaps amiss in thinking that there was, in fact, an arrangement between the ICTR and the Rwandese government that would, as it were, create a corridor for the passage of witnesses.  But, in fact, the 90 bis rule, of course, applies, but I only discovered that, I regret to say, last week from WVSS. In any event, I don't know if it would have helped, having the foreknowledge that it applied, because one of the difficulties is that, about six weeks ago, there was the release of a very large number of prisoners in Rwanda and so we're unsure of the status of the five custodial witnesses.  I say "custodial."  We understand that all, or some of them, may now be released.  And if they're released, we're uncertain of their status, whether it's conditional or not.  That is something that I hope to get a response by today, and I've drafted the necessary letter in anticipation of that to the Minister of Justice in Rwanda.  But I understand the Registrar and WVSS will assist me, as they do in all cases, in obtaining the necessary certification from the Minister of Justice, which then will enable me to come and put in a brief motion of request to the Chamber for transfer.  

But at the moment, we don't feel that that will cause, we hope, any hold-up.  So I hope that answers the issue in respect of that.  Was there another point?  I can't remember.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, your microphone, please.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall used the phrase "the inter partes agreement".  Do you know to what that refers?  
MR. HOOPER:
No, but I think I've probably covered it there, I think.  I don't know.  I assume the inter partes is between the ICTR and Rwanda.  Perhaps Ms. Fall can tell us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Our understanding, it seems to me, that it was a reference to the Rule 90 bis application.  From the Chamber's perspective, from the experience that we have had, we think that it's important that it be dealt with as soon as possible because there are some inevitable time issues involved in managing the transfers. 
MR. HOOPER:
I've had no experience of it, and I soundly accept that advice. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is an urgent matter. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I'll try to deal with it this week.  Well, I will deal with it this week, and try and get the motion application before you within a week, I hope. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, obviously, we can't address the issue of the locus in quo.  We take note that both parties seem in favour of it, and I presume that at an appropriate time the matter will be formally raised and addressed as soon as we are seized with the Defence case.  

Are there any other issues that need to be addressed?  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I will simply, with your leave, like to go back very quickly on a few points.  I probably may support Mr. Hooper by telling him that it's true, there were many detainees that were released, but concerning those detainees, most of them returned or went back to prison.  So I think he can carry out the necessary investigations.  

And as far as the second point is concerned, this concerns the calling or the order of appearances of witnesses.  I think, Mr. President, that this is an important problem for the Prosecution because this will make it possible for us to prepare our case and I think, as we have had to do, it will be desirable that Counsel Hooper should come up with a final list of the order of appearance of witnesses, were it for him to vary the list while the trial is in progress.  This will make it possible for us to prepare our hearings appropriately.  And the proof is that during the first presentation, he changed the list.  So we cannot base ourselves on situations that are ad hoc, as it were, for him to tell us exactly how he is going to call his witnesses.  So, as we have had to do, I think, before commencement of the trial, I think he should give us a general list that will be presented by the Defence.  Were it for them to vary that list subsequently because they cannot rely only on presentations that would be given at the last minute, because this will not enable the Prosecution to prepare -- the Prosecutor to prepare its case in cross-examining the witnesses that will appear.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, before you respond, there's just something I would like to add.  I think that the Prosecutor has a very good point.  We also are interested in -- I suppose, in a more general sense, in managing the presentation of the case so that it is completed within the allocated time, and we are aware that that cannot be accomplished without really effective management on all aspects of the way you present it.  

Now, I have been reluctant to ask you to confirm your final witness list, because when I saw the number  65, I didn't imagine that you were actually going to call 65 witnesses.  So, I wouldn't want to put you in a position that you are actually going to have to call 65 witnesses, but at the same time, from an effective management -- we can't leave it as vague as this.  So you are going to have to make some commitments and give notice.  I'm not sure exactly what order to make, but it cannot be left as vague as it is at the moment. 
 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I appreciate that, and I appreciate that we're going to have to make, as I say, some choices.  I won't say any more at the moment.  I mean, there are -- I won't say any more at the moment, if I can be allowed not to say any more at the moment.  But, as I say, we are aiming to try and provide a list that certainly keeps the Prosecution one week ahead, a week, seven days ahead of the witnesses to be called, which, of course, will be enough for them to approach and prepare for those witnesses.  

But we're also not only subject to the vagaries of witnesses, but also to the ability of a hard-working WVSS system to get certain witnesses here, and we're not going to get very much notice of their coming.  So, for example, in respect of next week, no witnesses are here yet.  They wouldn't be here until towards the weekend.  I can give you the five names, as indeed I have already to the Prosecution.  But they won't be here until toward the end of the week.  It's only when I've met them -- and some of them I wouldn't have met -- will I be in a position to suggest an order for them.  But the Prosecution will know what those witnesses are that are going to be presented between Monday and Friday of next week.  

So I hope that that's -- puts my friend a little at ease.  She'll always be, I hope, seven days ahead of the calling of any witnesses.  And I hope, in fact, I can give a sort of general indication of a batting order, but for the reason, Mr. President, you've just touched upon, I don't want to commit myself to a list which has, in fact, got 72 names on it at the moment, or should I say 72 witness positions at the moment, of which I can say about 15 or 20 are probably being withdrawn already, and then we're re-looking at the list.  

Mr. O'Shea is presently in Rwanda, and I'm making further inquiries that haven't borne fruit so far, but inevitably things may change.  But we will try -- we will take on board what you've said, Mr. President, both for the convenience and proper administration of justice from your point of view and also for the convenience of Ms. Fall.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, we think we've gone as far as we can today.  As you know, we will be sitting in half the sessions.  We have the morning slot.  We are interested, as far as possible, in managing our time so that we would be able to use the trial time that we have effectively and efficiently.  We wouldn't want any problems to arrive to the extent that at the last minute we discover that witnesses were not available, and so we think that the issue of advanced notification is important.  And if it is necessary for the Chamber to use its compulsive powers or its administrative capacity, we would like to do that in time to prevent us not utilising witnesses when trial time is available.  We only have half days during this trial session, and we want to use the time effectively.  

I'm not certain there's anything else we can do this morning, so we take the adjournment now.
