P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, the 27th of January 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  

The appearances are the same.  

Before we start the morning session, we'd just like to deliver our decision on the oral application made yesterday for a subpoena to be directed to a Defence witness.  

I'm sorry, but as I was saying, yesterday Defence counsel for the Accused submitted an oral application, seeking an order from the Chamber to invite the Rwandan authorities to communicate a subpoena to Defence Witness 4/4 by a set date, namely, 7th February 2006.  The Prosecution left the decision with the Chambers, but expressed concerns regarding the order of appearance of the Defence witnesses.  

This is almost similar to the position of the order we made yesterday with regard to Witness 4/18.  And in this case, the Chamber had considered that good reasons had been adduced of the unwillingness of this witness to travel to Arusha and that the proposed evidence could be relevant to the Defence case.  Now, the Chamber had found the taking of video-link testimony could properly address the witness's concerns and would serve the interests of justice.  As a result of that decision, the registry enquired on the matter, and the Witness and Victim Support Section has informed the Chambers and the parties and the Defence, that Witness 4/4 was not willing to testify via video link at all.  The Chamber is, therefore, of the view that a subpoena order is now warranted and will serve the interests of justice.

The Chamber wishes, however, to ensure that the right of the Accused to be tried without undue delay is guaranteed and that the Defence case will be completed within the time allocated, decided in agreement with the parties.  Due to the particular circumstances of the case, the cooperation of the national authorities for the implementation of the subpoena orders, within a certain deadline, is necessary.  

For the above reasons, the Chamber grants the motion, and instructs the registry to prepare a subpoena, addressed to the witness designated by the pseudonym 4/4, ordering the witness's appearance before the Chamber as soon as possible and no later than 9th February 2006; and orders the registrar to communicate the subpoenas to the witness and to the national authorities of the country in which the witness resides no later than 7th February 2006; and requests, pursuant to Article 28 of the statute of the Tribunal, the national authorities that receive a subpoena to provide any assistance that may be requested by the registry to facilitate the witness's attendance.  So that is our order with regard to the application.  

Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, Mr. President.  I've one matter to raise just before I come to this witness who's waiting patiently for evidence to start.  But if I can just mention one matter -- I apologise for the delay.  We were hoping that Witness 5/16 would be in a position to provide video-linked testimony today, and she's told WVSS that she has difficulty or she cannot get leave of absence from her place of employment today, and she's told WVSS that she could do so on Thursday.  But on Thursday, we already have a video-linked witness.  To some extent, it might be a convenience to those in Kigali, and perhaps the technicians here, if they were able to give their evidence, in any event, on the same day, but we are sharing this court and perhaps some of those on this Bench have other duties, in any event, that afternoon.  But our request or -- request for assistance, really, is whether it would be possible to have a whole day's sitting on Thursday.  Now, Monday I have no witness.  So I'm afraid I have no work to provide you, the Judges with, this coming Monday because we expected the video witness today, and then this witness was going to give evidence Monday.  So we have a gap as witnesses are not coming from Rwanda now until Monday afternoon.  

So we'd give up Monday morning, and in those circumstances one wonders whether if there is another court occupying this courtroom -- another Chamber occupying the courtroom on Thursday afternoon, whether it would be possible to have that courtroom give up its sitting on Thursday, or, alternatively, and perhaps be beguiled into taking over our Monday slot.  I appreciate this is rather late on a Friday to perhaps organise such an arrangement, but it would mean that, with certainty, we could take both of these witnesses on Thursday.  And if we don't, I have a concern that this witness may have difficulty in getting leave of absence in circumstances which the Chamber is acutely aware of, in terms of her situation.  It's what concerns her most is her employer's discovering her position.  So can I mention that now and perhaps come back to it a little later in the morning?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you very much.  Obviously we need to take some time to have enquiries made before responding to your request.  Just one moment, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt, but it may be a useful piece of information.  At present, I don't think I've got a witness on Wednesday either.  In fact, I don't have a witness on Wednesday because those who are listed for that time are subpoena witnesses, and I am dubious about whether I will have them here on Wednesday, and I mention that as another possible opportunity of a vacant court on Wednesday morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How complete were your arrangements for the video link on Thursday?  
MR. HOOPER:
We've got both witnesses -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, that's the witness's point of view, but have you made complete arrangements with the registry?  
MR. HOOPER:
While on my feet, I thought we had in respect of one.  If I'm wrong about that, then we'll put that immediately in hand, but we'd certainly mentioned that the third of those witnesses had elected for the Thursday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question is very simple.  Have the arrangements been made with the registry as yet for Thursday?  
MR. HOOPER:
I think they have for one, but not for the other because this was the information we only got last night.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

Madam Prosecutor, we didn't ask your view on this matter as yet because -- and I apologise for not doing that, but I thought it fit in with the general policy which you have voiced in the past.  But I should, in fact, enquire if you have any comments to make.   
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think the Prosecution is not certain about the order of appearance of Defence witnesses.  Witness 5/16 was supposed to be on today, we are told, but it was not planned for today, and that he was planned for Monday instead, but this is not what we understood.  Two other witnesses were -- have -- who were scheduled for Monday have been changed.  I think that the Prosecution has just given up trying to understand the order of appearance of Defence witnesses.  The only problem that we have now is to determine when we can carry out our cross-examination.  

I'd like to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber to the fact that the dates we had planned, that is, the 3rd, the 6th, and the 7th, were proposed by the Defence for examinations-in-chief.  So I'd like to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber, in the interest of fairness, to the possibility, on our part, of carrying out cross-examination of new witnesses in the best possible conditions.  Apart from that, I have nothing important to add.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  What we are doing at the moment is asking our trial coordinator to carry out enquiries to find out what is possible, and once we have that information, we will try to see if we can get a more concrete arrangement in place.  
MR. HOOPER:
And can I confirm I've withdrawn 9/32 as a superfluous witness?  So the next witness is 9/31.  I hope that's not a burden on the Prosecution.  I would have thought it was erasing of the burden, but there we are.  So the next witness is the gentleman, not the lady.  So we're ready -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you ready to start now?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, we are.  And I will be going into closed session for about five minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.  Can you hear me?  

Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we thank you for coming to give testimony at our Tribunal, and the first step will be to take an oath to tell the truth.  The registrar will now administer that oath to you. 
(Declaration made by Witness 9/29 in Kinyarwanda) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  Now, the testimony you will give will be responding to questions put to you by counsel for the Accused.  You will also have, in due course, to respond to questions put by the Prosecutor, but that will not take place today, and you will be notified when to come back for that process to take place.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Hooper will commence his examination-in-chief.  

Mr. Hooper?  
WITNESS 9/29
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, good morning -- good morning again, Madam Witness.  Good, you can hear me.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	You are (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) -- I'm sorry.  Redact that.  I thought we'd gone into closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I do apologise.  
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to commence this witness's testimony in closed session.  So we go into closed session now, and I make the order for redaction. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 6 to 7] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 5 by Wendy Molnar)












BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did there come a time when you and your family, as Tutsis, were attacked by those who were out to kill you, and if so how long was that after President Habyarimana was killed?  Can you remember, please?  
A.	This attack took place two weeks after President Habyarimana died.  
Q.	Now, it may be that, as I understand it, you're not very good on dates, but can you remember the day of the week that that major attack took place?  
A.	It was a Monday.  
Q.	And were you attacked on the hill that you'd retired to for protection, Mpungwe hill, M-P-U-N-G-W-E?  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	And in that attack, did you receive severe injuries?  
A.	Yes, I was wounded (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  And (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) was wounded during that same attack.  
Q.	All right.  That's the five-year-old.  We'll redact the name (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), but don't worry about that at all, Madam Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The order is made.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, don't you worry about that.  You can refer to her by her name throughout, but -- so -- and what injuries did she receive? 
A.	She was wounded in the throat.  
Q.	Now, you referred to your specific injuries, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal); is that right?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And from that time -- I'm sure there's no dispute about this area -- did you not see your husband again because he'd gone off with the cattle and met his death in circumstances that you're not clear about, other than that he was murdered?  Is that right?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And were you, in fact, helped by the six children to the parish of Karama, where you took refuge?  
A.	The help I did receive was only from a priest who evacuated me, and when I got to Karama, I only had three children with me.  
Q.	Yes.  And those three children -- I omitted one -- included the baby who was on your back.  How old was the baby?  
A.	He was -- it was only seven months old.  
Q.	And I think that baby survived; is that right?  
A.	Yes, it is alive.  
Q.	And can I just pass you up a photograph, please -- or a photocopy of one -- or a scan of one.  It's a photograph we've seen in another context.  It's been previously exhibited.  I'll try and find the exhibit number over the coming break and we can refer to this document in that way.  Do you recognise who that is in the picture?  
A.	Yes, I recognise this person.  It's Father François Ngomirakiza.  He's the priest who helped get me into the hospital.  
Q.	So two weeks after Habyarimana's killed on a Monday, you're attacked.  When do you get to this parish, Karama?  
A.	I think it was a Tuesday.  
Q.	And when did Father Ngomirakiza take you to the hospital?  
A.	It was on Wednesday.  
Q.	Were you the only one he took, or did he take others with you?  
A.	There were quite a few of us.  He had a double-cabin pickup, and there were quite a few people on that pickup, but unfortunately, some of them were abducted on the way.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, a few minutes ago, you mentioned the question of the break.  Now, we started a bit late, today is Friday, and if your examination will finish by about 11:00, or somewhere in that vicinity, I was wondering whether we should skip the break, so we could have an early closure today.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Yes, that would be a practical --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. HOOPER:
-- matter.  If the witness isn't happy with that, too.  I ask that because I know she was waiting from early on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, I see.  But you can enquire. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, in a few minutes we'd normally take a break for a while, but we were thinking we could carry on with your evidence and perhaps complete it the sooner by not taking the break.  Would you be happy with that, or would you like a short break at any time?  
A.	No problem.  We can continue.  
Q.	You can let us know at any time if you're uncomfortable or would like a break.  So you were telling us that there were quite a few in this pickup, but that there were incidents -- can you just tell us again?  Because I'm afraid I lost the last bit of your evidence.  Were you making the -- 
A.	Would you like me to repeat the circumstances around my arrival at the hospital, how I got to the hospital?  

MR. HOOPER:
I'd ask the President to just remind me what her last answer was, from realtime.  It would be helpful.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You'd asked her when the Father had taken her to the hospital, and she said it was on Wednesday.  You asked, "Were you the only one he took, or did he take others?"  And she said, "There were quite a few of us.  He had a double-cabin pickup, and there were quite a few people on that pickup.  But, unfortunately, some of them were abducted on the way."  It was at that stage that I intervened.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And so what happened to some of them?  
A.	They were forcibly abducted by soldiers.  
Q.	Was that on the way to the hospital?  
A.	Yes, but we were, rather, nearer the communal office at Huye, and there was a roadblock.  So we hadn't gotten to the hospital yet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can continue, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So you arrive at the hospital on the Wednesday with -- would this be correct -- three children, including the baby on your back, the little girl, and the boy -- or the young man; is that right?  
A.	No.  Two of the children stayed at Karama.  I left with only two children, and the other child came to join me at the hospital.  
Q.	And who did you -- 
A.	I found the other children.  I managed to find the other children after the war.  
Q.	And the children you went with was the baby and your daughter; would that be right?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness mentioned a name, but we didn't.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And your son came to the hospital.  When did he get to the hospital after you?  How many days or so, do you recall?  
A.	I don't remember how many days passed, but when he arrived, I was in intensive care, and he, himself, had been wounded, but I don't remember the date anymore.  
Q.	Now, looking at the calendar, we can see that two weeks after Habyarimana's death, the Monday would be the 20th, the Tuesday would be the 21st, and the Wednesday would be the 22nd, if that fits in.  Now, how long did you stay at the hospital for?  When did you leave?  
A.	When I left intensive care -- intensive care, I was taken on a stretcher, and I went from sleeping on that stretcher, and I was moved to the surgical ward.  
Q.	And aside from the intensive care and the surgical ward -- just one moment, please.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
My apologies, Mr. President.  I seem to have had a delayed reaction, but can we go over the dates again?  I believe you had said Monday would be the 20th.  According to the calendar which you provided, Monday would be the 18th.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, thank you for that very helpful intervention.  I was going from memory.  So we are talking 18th, Monday, 19th, Tuesday, and 20th, which must have been the date I had in mind, was the Wednesday.  So let's correct that. Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So it's the 20th, it would appear, that you got to the hospital.  And during your stay in the hospital, you were in intensive care.  You were then taken to the surgery ward, you told us, and aside from the intensive care and the surgery ward, did you stay anywhere else, in any other wards during the time that you were at the hospital?  
A.	When I had gotten slightly better, I'd use crutches and I'd go and hide in the maternity, because often at night we were attacked by people who came to abduct people, but I didn't stay in the maternity ward during the day.  
Q.	And when did you come to leave the hospital?  
A.	I no longer remember the date on which I left the hospital, but I do remember that when I left the hospital, the Inkotanyi were already at Save.  I know it was Saturday.  I left the hospital on a Saturday, and it was at the end of June.  I remember the day, it was a Saturday, but I don't remember the date.  
Q.	All right.  So we have a period of about two-and-a-half months when you're at the hospital, and during that time, both your daughter and your son die.  Can you remember how long you'd been at the hospital before they died -- or how long they were at the hospital, let me put it like that, before they died?  
A.	My daughter died when we reached intensive care ward 7, but my son died in April.  I don't know exactly the date of his death, but he died when he followed other children.  
Q.	And your daughter, just briefly, what were the circumstances of her death?  
A.	She went into a coma and never regained consciousness.  That's how -- she went into a coma and never regained consciousness.  That's how she died.  
Q.	And, in fact, is it your belief, and what you know, that she'd been given serum but that she wasn't given more serum?  She died, you believe, through neglect, through culpable neglect?  
A.	After the first IV, she wasn't given any more.  She wasn't given a second IV.  Nobody came to replace the flask with another one.  And I, myself, had to remove the IV, the drip that had finished.  
Q.	Well, I won't ask you more about that, but in the time that you were in the hospital, the two-and-a-half months, were you in a position and capable of seeing the events that occurred at the hospital?  
A.	You're referring to events that occurred at the hospital. 
Q.	Yes.  And during the time you were there, were you able to observe them, to see them?  
A.	Yes, I was eyewitness to certain events at the hospital.  
Q.	Now, during your time there, did you ever see people killed at the hospital?  
A.	Yes.  I could see people taken outside, but then I never saw them again, those people who were taken away -- taken out.  
Q.	So people who were killed, were they removed from the hospital first before being killed?  
A.	Yes.  They were approached and taken down below the maternity ward, and those people taken away never came back.  
Q.	And who took them away?  
A.	Soldiers.  But at one point, some people were taken away in the presence of Dr. Sostène, who was in front of the surgical ward.  
Q.	Did you ever witness or hear of doctors doing the killing in the hospital, killing people in the hospital?  Did you ever hear such a thing?  
A.	No, I never saw any doctor pick up a machete to kill anyone whatsoever.  
Q.	Did you ever witness or have you ever heard of people, patients, being actually killed in their beds by doctors or others?  
A.	No.  The people who were ill, patients, were taken away either by soldiers or the Interahamwe.  The in-patients were removed either by the soldiers or the Interahamwe.  
Q.	While you were there, were you ever asked for your identification papers, your ID?  
A.	I was not asked to show my ID card.  I think the wounds I suffered were enough to show who I was.  My injuries were enough to show who I was.  
Q.	Did people at the hospital and those who saw you then know that you were a Tutsi?  
A.	Yes.  Anyone wounded, injured, having a wound, was necessarily a Tutsi.  
Q.	And how did you survive all that time?  
A.	You mean the time I spent at the hospital?  Well, I went on hiding in every corner, and that is how I survived.  
Q.	Yes.  Now, among the people taken away, we've heard that there was someone called Kazasomaho who was taken away.  Do you know anything about that?  
A.	Yes.  I directly witnessed the abduction.  
Q.	And was he alone, or was he with anybody else, i.e., was anyone else abducted, or was he abducted on his own?  
A.	There were four people abducted.  
Q.	Do you remember who they were?  
A.	There was one Kagina, one Mutabazi, and Mutabazi's sister, and Kazasomaho himself were all abducted at the same time.  
Q.	And where were you when you witnessed their abduction?  
A.	In fact, that young man named Kagina was caring for me when he was approached.  I wanted to know where they were taking him.  I was curious.  I took my crutches and I stood in the hallway to see what would happen, and that is how I saw that they were being taken away.  
Q.	Did you see where they were taken?  
A.	They turned in front of the surgery -- surgical ward and were taken down below the maternity ward.  And since that day, I have never seen them again.  
Q.	Now, I'm going to ask to put some names to you, and I'm going to ask if you know anything bad about them or whether you witnessed them doing anything wicked in the hospital.  And the first one is someone called Mukabandora, Scholastique, do you know anything or have you heard since anything bad about her?  
A.	I heard people say bad things about her, but I don't know that person.  
Q.	Dr. Martin Kageruka, did you witness or hear anything at the time when you were in the hospital, anything bad about him?  
A.	I would see Dr. Kageruka, but I never saw him harm anyone.  Moreover, he would come to visit us even if he didn't treat us, if he didn't treat our wounds, but he did come to see us.  
Q.	Dr. Emmanuel Twagirayezu, have you -- 
A.	I would also see Emmanuel Twagirayezu.  I never saw him harm anyone.  
Q.	Dr. Sosim (sic)?  
A.	Dr. Sostène was evil.  He would force us to go out, tell us to go home, whereas he knew that the Tutsi were being killed.  When we saw him, we'd hide.  
Q.	Dr. Gatera?  
A.	Gatera also was not kind.  He is the one who gave my child the drip, and that's how my child died.  And people who were wounded, if they were seriously wounded, he did not do anything for them.  That is what I saw Gatera -- as far as Gatera is concerned.  
Q.	And did you, in fact, give evidence against him in his case in Rwanda, of his neglect of your daughter?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, I've shown you this photograph before, but I just want to show you it again.  It's a photograph of the Accused in this case, Dr. André Rwamakuba.  You've seen it on a computer screen.  We know the photograph.  I just want you to look at that photograph, coming to you.  And looking at that photograph, during your time in the hospital, did you see that man?  
A.	As I have already told you, I can confirm that I never saw this person at the hospital.  
Q.	And also we know that his name is Dr. André Rwamakuba, and at the time he was the minister for primary and secondary education in the interim government of Rwanda.  Did you ever hear of that person by that name or a minister coming -- or that minister coming to participate in killing people and other atrocities at the Butare hospital?  
A.	No, I'm not aware of anything like that.  
Q.	And have you ever heard other people suggest that he did come?  
A.	I have always told you that I do not know this person.  I do not know this person at all.  I've never -- anywhere in Butare.  
Q.	Do you attend the Gacaca court at Kibingo, your secteur?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Have you ever heard André Rwamakuba's name mentioned in the context of Gacaca?  
A.	No.  The person they speak of at home and who was a member of parliament named Rwamakuba, he's the one we know of in my secteur.  
Q.	Was that Rwamakuba alive at the time of the genocide?  
A.	No, he was dead.  
Q.	Now, have you ever heard, in the context of the genocide, or heard mention the name Pauline Nyiramasuhuko?  
A.	Yes.  She was talked about quite a bit, and I'd see her, moreover.  
Q.	Shalom, who I understand is her son, have you ever heard of him mentioned in the context of the genocide?  
A.	Of course.  He would always be moving around with his mother.  
Q.	Colonel Tharcisse Muvunyi, ever heard of him or witness him at the hospital?  
A.	Yes, I saw him at the hospital.  
Q.	Kanyabashi, have you ever heard of him in the context of the hospital?  
A.	Yes.  I also saw Kanyabashi.  He came in a vehicle and wanted to take the people from his commune, the people from Pari (phonetic) and Tumba, especially, he took them to Pari and Tumba.  
Q.	Now, after the genocide -- you've been grievously injured yourself, your husband's been murdered, your children have been murdered -- did there come a time when you could talk about these things to other people and discuss them?  Was there ever an opportunity for doing that, discussing what happened at the hospital?  
A.	Yes.  A nun got us together and encouraged us to speak of what had happened.  
Q.	And were you able to speak, and were others able to speak, fully and frankly, as far as you could see, about what had happened at the hospital and who had participated in the genocide?  
A.	Yes.  Yes, quite.  
Q.	And was Rwamakuba mentioned?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, at that time, were those discussions taking place within the context of any particular organisation that the nun had helped set up or not?  
A.	No.  We were not part of any organisation.  We were only widows who had encountered problems during the genocide, and we decided to meet together from time to time to talk of what had happened during the genocide.  
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about specific people and ask you - 

MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Before counsel continues, I'm just trying to pre-empt any problems here.  If -- 
MR. HOOPER:
You may be creating -- you may be creating a problem.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
May I just finish?  If there's a likelihood that names are about to be pronounced, could we use the method that we used to use of a paper, of these names being written down on a paper?  
MR. HOOPER:
The witness has difficulty in reading, so I have to do it in this way.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Then I would ask -- I would ask that we go into closed session.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm only going to put names to her.  They're just names of people.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
With all due respect, as discussed before, due to the delicacy of this kind of issue, I think if one were to look at the context -- I mean, I'm pre-empting.  I don't know how counsel is going to put the questions, but it could be possible to deduce certain facts from this.  So perhaps I would strongly ask, Mr. President, that, to err on the side of caution, that we go into closed session.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, at the moment, I resist it, though I do see that there might be some problems, but I'm only going to put names.  For example, I'm going to ask the witness if she knows (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John, we'll not make the order yet, but will be -- now you've raised issue, we'll look at it more closely.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you.  I hope we don't end up having to redact because I think that often causes problems.  If we can look at it very closely, thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, I'm going to ask about (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), who, one understands, has frequently given evidence in Rwanda in open courts and trials.  And I'm asking about her and her allegations about what happened to her when she was at the hospital.  Do you know a (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?  
A.	I got to know her when she joined the same association as I.  Otherwise, I did not know her before that.  
Q.	What was the name of that association?  
A.	Abasa.  
Q.	Was she at the hospital while you were there?  
A.	No.  I never saw her at the hospital -- she wasn't at the hospital at all.  
Q.	Now, are you saying that you didn't see her there, or are you saying that "I didn't see her there, and I know she wasn't there"?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So you didn't see her there, and you know that she wasn't there -- or it's your belief that she wasn't there?  Is that your position in respect of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?  
A.	Yes.  We met when we became members of the same association, that Abasa.
Q.	Now, there's a man we've heard of in evidence from time to time, he's been referred to as someone working at the hospital before the genocide, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  Have you ever heard of -- do you know him?  
A.	Yes, I know him.  He was present at the hospital.  
Q.	Now, did you see him at the hospital?  
A.	Yes, I saw him.  
Q.	And what was he doing?  Was he working there or hiding or what?  
A.	He was hospital staff, but when the situation deteriorated, he didn't go home.  He stayed at the hospital until the end of the war.  He worked in the kitchen.  
Q.	And was he working during the genocide?  
A.	No, he wasn't working.  He was hiding, rather.  
Q.	Do you know where he was hiding?  
A.	No, I don't know his hiding place.  
Q.	And how often would you see him about the hospital?  
A.	When we'd go to get biscuits -- because a nun would come and distribute biscuits at 10:00 -- I would see him, but when he observed that his colleagues were dying, he never came to get biscuits, and then I didn't see him again.  
Q.	Now, someone else we've heard about from time to time was someone called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  Do you know that person, and did you see that person at the hospital?  
A.	I know that person, but she did not go to the hospital.  She wasn't at the hospital.  I knew her after the war in the -- that same association, in the context of the same association as I was in.  
Q.	And do you know -- you say she wasn't at the hospital.  Do you know or do you understand where she was, if she wasn't there?  Do you know where she went?  
A.	During your discussion, she told us herself that she had fled towards Burundi, so I do not see how she could have got to the hospital.  
Q.	Now, there's another lady we've heard about and I'm going to ask you about, and that's a lady called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  Did you see her at all?  
A.	I saw her only once, and this was one morning.  I never saw her again after that at the hospital.  
Q.	Do you remember when that was, approximately?  
A.	I do not remember the day or the date.  All I know or all I remember is that it was morning.  
Q.	And the final name I'm going to trouble you with, a name that's been mentioned from time to time in the case, someone called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), did you see her at all during the time you were at the hospital?  
A.	I saw her because when she went to the préfecture office, I saw her.  I saw her go and get on board the vehicle that took them to the préfecture office.  
Q.	So she was taken in a vehicle there, and you saw her mounting the vehicle; is that right?  
A.	Yes.  She was not in the hospital to receive medical attention.  Actually, she was in the hospital as a refugee.  There was a large group of people that had fled her area of origin and sought refuge in the hospital.  She was in that group.  
Q.	Was she alone?  Did she have any children with her or anything like that?  
A.	I did not know her family, but I observed that she was carrying a child on her back.  Actually she came from Kibeho.  So I did not know her family members, as she was the only person that I recognised.  Actually it was after the war that I got to know what her name was.  Before that, I only knew her from seeing her.  
Q.	Now, from time to time, it may have been spoken of that there was a clique, or is a clique now, within the hospital.  Do you know anything of that?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Can counsel be so kind as to not lead on this issue, as it's very contentious for us?  So if there is such a thing, can the information please emanate from the witness herself?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, what can you help us about in that?  Do you have any view of your own about it?  
A.	I do not know this clique of which you talk, but I've observed that the medical staff had come together in a way.  I do not know if that is what you refer to as a clique.  
Q.	Is it your impression that people who give evidence, perhaps in Rwanda or elsewhere, about events at the hospital are always truthful about it, in your experience?  
A.	Some witnesses tell lies.  
Q.	Do you know why?  
A.	Because they want money.  
Q.	And do you know how this has come about, that they can get money?  
A.	I do not know how it started.  But from what one sees, there is a certain dishonest interest in this.  I do not see any other motive.  
Q.	Do you know where this money comes from?  
A.	No.  I -- all I know is that the money was provided to us by people who came from Arusha when they visited our association, but I do not know how they obtain any of the funds -- or the other funds.

1106H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, a little while ago, I went through a list of names of people who had been talked about in this case, mainly, women.  Do any of those names fall into the category of witnesses you've just described, dishonest witnesses, or not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, from what you say, you do not know the Accused in this case.  You do not know Dr. André Rwamakuba from Adam, is that right? 
A.	I don't know him at all. 
Q.	Yes, I have no other questions except, just before I sit down, to say that, Madam Witness, as you have heard, but I remind you, we're going to have a break in your evidence now of a week, or perhaps more than a week.  And I explained that to you as well yesterday, and in that time I cannot come to meet you or speak to you, nor can Maître Buhuru, who I know you know, come to speak to you at all.  It's not out a discourtesy, it's because we are rule-bound not to be in contact with you while you are giving evidence, for reasons I am sure you can understand.  Thank you.  
A.	Thank you, too, Counsel.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I would like to request a brief closed session after the witness has been dismissed to discuss an issue, very briefly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Madam Witness, as I mentioned to you at the commencement of your testimony, and as Counsel Hooper just told you, there will be a break in your testimony now and you'll be notified by the relevant officials of the registry when you have to return to complete your evidence.  It will be approximately one week from today.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, I should advise you that during this break in your testimony or during any other break in your testimony, you remain a witness of the Tribunal and you are not to discuss your evidence or the case with anybody at all.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, now I will excuse you.  You are now excused and you may leave the court until you are required to return for the completion of your testimony.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, two questions, we raise two questions:  One, the documents shown to the witness, should they be marked for identification and kept by the registry?  
MR. HOOPER:
It's not necessary.  The first photograph was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I just raised it so -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Just as a tailing end of the position, the first photograph was -- if it wasn't mentioned and made clear, was a photograph of Father -- or Abbé Ngomirakiza, and the second photograph shown to him was one of the Accused André Rwamakuba.  I think that was both clear in the context in which they were shown.  Both photographs sort of featured already in this case and are exhibited in other parts of the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I will ask you the question a bit later.  For the benefit of the public, we have come to the end of testimony for today.  We are going to enter into closed session for counsel to raise matters which may reveal the identity of witnesses in the trial, and the public are not permitted to be part of that discussion.  So we go into a closed session now for that purpose.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 20 to 24] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
