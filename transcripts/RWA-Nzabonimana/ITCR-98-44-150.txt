P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, would you open the proceedings?  
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg and Judge Gberdao G. Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 25th of August 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. André Rwamakuba, case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  The appearances are the same? 
MR. MORLEY: 
Of the Prosecution, yes, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, yes, they are.  I had a word this morning with Mr. Morley for -- as it were, he is not to oppose my seeking consent from you, Mr. President, to put one further matter to this witness, which is to show her a photograph in the hope of identifying or hoping to identify the resuscitation ward that she referred to in her evidence.  Mr. Morley has no objection to my pursuing that further line of inquiry even if I had closed my examination-in-chief -- my cross-examination, I am sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, can you hear me?  Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I beg your pardon, are you ready and able to -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We hope this is the last session in which you have to testify.  I have given Mr. Hooper leave to put one further matter to you.  It won't be very long and that should probably -- to just put a question to you. 
Mr. Hooper. 



WITNESS GIO,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  I am sorry to come back to bother you again with these questions, but it's a matter of trying to identify where it was that your brother was hospitalised, which ward or part of the buildings that he was in.  I am going to show you -- invite you to look at this photograph which I will pass out, which is a view looking down from the -- behind the administration buildings, down towards the maternity, along that central corridor that exists there. 
A.	I didn't quite understand what you said, Counsel. 
Q.	Let's wait for the photograph to catch you up, and then it will be easier for me to assist you. 
A.	Now, looking at that photograph, do you recognise the parts of the hospital that it shows? 
A.	I realise that these are buildings of the hospital and I already pointed out to the Trial Chamber that it is difficult for me to interpret photographs.  Yes, indeed, I realise that these are hospital buildings and I realise that I am being asked questions to the effect that I give descriptions drawing from these photographs. 
Q.	Well, looking at that photograph again, I am sure it's not that difficulty. 
A.	I have told you that I am not good at interpreting pictures, but I can still assist the Chamber as much as I can. 
Q.	Well, just look at the picture, just look at the photograph.  Can you see the maternity building there? 
A.	I have the photograph before me, but since the beginning of my testimony, I have always said that when I am given a photograph I am not in a position to indicate the various locations in the photograph.  I think that is what I had stated to the Chamber.  Probably I am going to go all over and describe to you the spot at which my brother was, but I will not be relying on the pictures.  I will talk to you about the area because I know how the buildings were configured. 
Q.	Well, I might have to fall back again on that.  Now, maybe -- maybe you have a difficulty with photographs or maybe it's a way of stopping me, preventing me from having you identify something, you see.  If you look at that photograph, can you see - looking at it, do you recognise it is the corridor that runs down to the maternity.  You can see the maternity building clearly in the distance, can't you?  I remind you, this is where -- ************************************. 
A.	Thank you.  I know the buildings that make up the hospital.  I know the various doors, but I have never taken photographs.  **********************, it is further down.  It is not at this spot.  It is situated towards the University of Butare.  It is not near the hospital.  It is true that I went to the hospital on several occasions when I had to take my children there for medical treatment, ******************. 
Q.	***************************************************.  Let me show you a second photograph and see if this helps you, for a general question as to when you recognise which part of this, not very big hospital.  I suggest this is, this photograph is coming to you? 
A.	Really I have told you that I am not comfortable with photographs.  I have always stated that I can request that you allow me to describe, *************************************************************.  And I can give you a description and probably you will be able to understand.  But, sincerely speaking, I cannot make my way with photographs.  I can give you a description of the trajectory going ************************* to the hospital.  I believe that even when I appeared before the Tribunal, the first time I came to give evidence in this matter, I stated to the Chamber that I have difficulties with photographs because I cannot identify locations or areas that I know when they are shown to me on a photograph. 
Q.	Well, let me ask you this.  You don't recognise those buildings as being wards, hospitalisation wards at the hospital.  The last photograph you have just seen, don't you recognise that as the wards? 
A.	I was at that location when I was in hiding, and I think I sought refuge at a specific place, but if you want, subsequent pictures of the location can be taken, and I do have knowledge that I went to that place on different occasions when I went there to have my children treated.  So, I describe the various parts that I can remember.  I am referring to various parts of the hospital.  I cannot do this relying on the photographs. 
Q.	All I am concerned with this morning is for you to identify to the Judges, the room or ward where your brother was, and that you have described as a resuscitation room.  Now, if you can't do, with those photographs, can you do it by taking us -- by describing, walking us, as it were, through the hospital from the front parking area where the administration building is?  Can you do that?  All right, so, you take us slowly in your own words.  Now, we have plans and we have photographs.  So, you take it slowly, perhaps we will get to the room where your brother was in? 
A.	Okay.
Q.	All right?
A.	That would be easy for me.  You enter via the reception.  You continue towards the ENT services and you continue along that corridor. 
Q.	Having passed the ENT -- we have - we have  passed the ENT services which are, for those with plans, No. 6 on the sketch plan at page 47 of the Prosecution bundle, Exhibit P.  2.  Do you pass the ENT? 
A.	You see the corridor, Counsel Hooper that goes from the reception.  Are we together here, Counsel Hooper?  Are you following me?  
Q.	Yes, I am following you? 
A.	Once you get to the end of the corridor, there are two offices for doctors that work with the ENT unit.  There's, first of all, Dr. Ntakububa's (phonetic) office.  May I proceed? 
Q.	Yes, please, in your own words. 
A.	And then you continue.  And there's a corridor that goes towards residents, but we leave that corridor and then there's Dr. Nyakahilu's (phonetic) office, you go down the corridor and then you deviate a little bit or you make a small detour before reaching the ophthalmology service.  Do you follow me?  
Q.	Let's see -- I know, you have lost me.  Now, let's go back.  
A.	Counsel, you don't know the area. 
Q.	Of course, if that's what you are saying, obviously.  
	But let's go back, if we can to ************************ the administration, all right.  Now, we don't know these good doctors who work there.  So, we are not much helped by that, but if that helps you, you carry on.  Now, there's a corridor that runs from the administration, all the way down to maternity.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Now, to get to this ward where your brother was, walking down that corridor, do you go as far as the pediatrics building, yes or no? 
A.	Actually, I think you understand me very well.  It is the spot at which the corridor coming from the pediatric service meets the other corridor coming from the other side.  I think it is at that level , that place. 
Q.	Well, let's put it like this:  We have a plan in front of us, and we can see that corridor that runs from the entrance, past the reception and then it goes down towards maternity.  And as you walk along on your left side, it's a nice open space with the avocado trees.  You carry on and you walk past the surgery where they perform the operations, and you then come to a little crossroads really, and on one side, you have the beginning of the pediatrics block.  And if you turn right, you walk towards the chapel.  Is that right?  Okay.  So, you are standing now at this crossroads here.  So, where do you go now to get to the ward?  Okay, did you turn right?  Did you go straight on?  Did you turn left?  What did you do at the crossroads? 
A.	You move towards the chapel.  So, you move towards the chapel from the crossroad. 
Q.	And do you reach as far as the chapel or not? 
A.	No.  You don't reach the location where the chapel is.  From the crossroads of the pediatrics and -- services, you don't go right up to where the chapel is.  Please, make do without, and don't try to complicate things for me any further. 
Q.	Okay, now, let's go back a bit and let me take you down that path you talked about.  So, you come into the hospital, you go past the reception, you walk down the path, the corridor that goes towards maternity.  You get to the pediatrics building, you turn right, towards the direction of where the chapel is, but you don't go that far.  Now, as you walk towards where the chapel is, is the ward where your brother was, on your right or on your left, as you face the chapel? 
A.	I have told you that I was at that place during the war.  I don't know exactly what you are asking of me.  I have told you that he was on bed No. 2.  There was a row of beds on the two sides, but if I had known -- 
Q.	Just pause there.  We have almost got there, you see, you have been very helpful.  And there's just very last bit that I am interested in, all right?  

Now, let's go back to the entrance of the hospital.  You walk down the corridor towards maternity, right?  You get to the crossroads.  Please listen, Madam Witness. 
A.	Yes, I am following you, Counsel.  
Q.	Just look at me because it might just help you.  So, you walk down the corridor towards maternity.  If you would look at me, I think it might help you, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, I am trying to help you.  If you look at me.  You walk down the corridor --  
A.	I know the area, Counsel. 
Q.	You get to the crossroads, and you turn right.  And now you are looking at the chapel, and you walk along this corridor.  Now, is your brother's surgery on this side looking at the chapel or on the other side of the grass area?  Where is the room that your brother is in? 
A.	When you are facing the chapel you move towards the operations room, and when you get to the level of the operations room, nearby there's a building where there were rows of beds.  Please, if you go to the field?  You go to the spot you will see that that's how things are now.  If you are facing each other and you turn to your right, there's an operations room, and near it is a room where there are beds.  And if you go down to the spot you will see that that's how things are. 
Q.	I think -- thank you very much.  I think we -- for my part, I think -- I think I know.  So, as you walk towards the chapel, the room is on your right, you told us, and it's -- in a way it's part of the surgical block, is that right because that's -- and you called it the resuscitation room because it's an area that's given over to patients who have come out after having an operation and people are trying to wake them up, and that's the room your brother was in, yes?  All right.  
A.	Yes, indeed, what you are saying is true.  It is near the emergency unit and sometimes people who are seriously wounded are also taken there.  Well, for any other information you can refer to my previous statements and if you find information therein that contradict me, please tell me. 
Q.	So, it's this room -- this room with beds in it, it's attached to the surgery, to the operating theatres where the operation theatres are; is that right? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MR. HOOPER: 
And thank you, Mr. Morley.  
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you for your understanding, Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, I have exhibits to tender which I didn't do yesterday.  I was going to wait until the conclusion of this witness's testimony because it won't be necessary for her to remain.  And I don't propose to exhibit at this stage in any event, the two photographs which she has been shown this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.
Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under the Rules which govern our trials, you are now going to have to answer some further questions from the Prosecutor, Mr. Morley.  So you will now have an opportunity to ask yourself further questions (sic).  You understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
That's fine with me, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You will remember that while Mr. Hooper was asking you questions, he drew your attention to seven statements that you have made, and to the court transcript from December 2003, and the things that arose from your meeting me on the 18th and 20th of August.  You remember he dealt with all of those things.  Do you remember? 
A.	I didn't quite understand you.  Are you talking about our first meeting?  
Q.	I am going to take you through many of the statements that you have made, you understand me? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the reason I am going to do that is because Mr. Hooper has taken you through those statements.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You first made a statement on the 17th of September 1997 to investigators for the Tribunal here in which you mentioned André Rwamakuba.  Do you remember making that statement? 
A.	Yes, I remember it. 
Q.	Mr. Hooper read out what was in the statement.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I remember it. 
Q.	In the statement Mr. Hooper read out, that you had said that Dr. André Rwamakuba checked identity cards and separated the Tutsis from the Hutus.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I remember that. 
Q.	Was that true? 
A.	Yes, he asked people to show their identity cards and once he saw them, he handed them over to Athanase.  He gave them over to Athanase who then gave them over - handed them over to Gatera. 
Q.	In your statement about André Rwamakuba of the 17th of September 1997, you did not mention 
	Dr. Gatera nor did you mention Dr. Gatera killing your brother with an axe.  Do you understand what I said? 
A.	I remember that. 
Q.	Can you help us, why was it that when you made a statement about Dr. André Rwamakuba on that occasion you did not mention Dr. Gatera killing your brother with an axe? 
A.	I did not feel it necessary to mention that because we were discussing someone else's file, someone else's dossier.  So, I did not see the need to speak of two separate dossiers.  At the time we were speaking with someone, I was giving information concerning that person.  I could not therefore confound matters. 
Q.	In your statement of the 17th of September  of 1997, you say that your brother was put into the red pick-up truck, do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I follow. 
Q.	What was the manner in which he was put into the red pick-up truck? 
A.	They carried him in their arms.  They had struck him with a hatchet. 
Q.	In your statement of the 17th of September 1997, it appears to record that you may have suggested that your father was with you at the hospital.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Each time I gave testimony I never said that I was with my father.  I don't even know who killed my father. 
Q.	It's right, is it not, and Mr. Hooper made this clear that you corrected your statement of 1997 on the 22nd of October in 2003, in which you made it clear.  You were then saying your father was not at the hospital.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes, I follow. 
Q.	After the 17th of September of 1997, the next statement in time is a statement that you made to the Rwandan authorities about Dr. Gatera, on the 23rd of January 1998.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	In that statement you say that Dr. Gatera killed your brother with an axe by hitting him on the head.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	Was that true? 
A.	That was the truth.  I never saw my brother again. 
Q.	In your statement to the Rwandan authorities on the 23rd of January 1998, you have also mentioned 
Dr. André Rwamakuba being present at the hospital that night.  Do you understand what I have just said? 
A.	I understand it all. 
Q.	Was that true? 
A.	It was the truth. 
Q.	The next statement in time that you made was on the 5th of May of 1998 to the Rwandan authorities about the case of Dr. Gatera.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	In that statement you say that Dr. Gatera killed your brother with an axe by striking him on the head.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I follow. 
Q.	Was that true? 
A.	It was true, I never saw my brother again? 
Q.	You have also said in that statement to the Rwandan authorities on the 5th of May 1997 about the Gatera case, that Gatera was with a former minister.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I fully follow. 
Q.	Who was the former minister? 
A.	It was André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Was that true? 
A.	Entirely true, because he had been a minister indeed. 
Q.	The next statement in time is a statement you made to the Rwandan authorities on the 7th of May of 1999, in respect of the case of Dr. Twagirayesu.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	In that statement you describe the presence of a man called Athanase with Dr.  Gatera.  Do you understand what I have said?
A.	I understand. 
Q.	In that statement you describe Dr. Gatera ordering Athanase to hit your brother on the head with an axe.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	Is that what happened? 
A.	You mean Dr. Twagirayesu or Dr. Gatera?  Please explain. 
Q.	In that statement you describe Dr. Gatera ordering Athanase to strike your brother on the head with an axe.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand what you are saying, but I think I was not understood.  The people who were taking -- noting my testimony didn't understand.  It was Dr. Gatera who struck my brother and not Athanase. 
Q.	Was Athanase present when Dr. Gatera struck your brother on the head with an axe? 
A.	Yes,  Athanase was present.  He just received the ID card from Dr. Rwamakuba and which he in turn handed to Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	In your statement on the 7th of May of 1999 to the Rwandan authorities about the case of 
	Dr. Twagirayesu, you did not mention André Rwamakuba.  You understand what I have said? I understand.  It depended on the questions put to us, they were asking me what I knew about Dr. Twagirayesu.  I was not being put questions on Dr. Rwamakuba, which is why I did not mention his name. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry, Mr. Morley.  I know Mr. Morley has stepped over a response as being recorded by this witness which I think in fairness should be put to her if he is going to perform his exercise in this way.  He has put to the witness that she told -- or was recorded as saying that Gatera had directed Athanase to kill her brother, but what is being admitted is the conclusion of that paragraph, the next sentence which in fairness should be put. 
MR. MORLEY:
I am always grateful for my learned friend's assistance, but I am not quite sure what it is that he wants me to put.  Perhaps if the witness takes her headphones off and he can tell me what it is. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, just read the complete sentence.  He is ordered to do it, what does he, in fact, do? 
MR. MORLEY:
Okay.  All right.  I understand the point, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Hooper.  Oh, can you put on your earphones.  Are they on?  I can't see.  Are they on?  They are.  All right.  In your statement of the 7th of May of 1999, you say that Dr. Gatera ordered Athanase to kill your brother with an axe and Athanase did so.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand what you are saying, but that was not the case.  It's the people who were writing down my statement that wrote it down incorrectly.  Athanase did not kill my brother.  He merely handed the ID card to Gatera.  That point must be corrected.  It was Gatera who killed my brother. 
Q.	The next statement in time is on the 7th of February of the year 2000 to the Rwandan authorities in respect of a woman, whose name is Scholastic, that you made a statement in which you describe the presence of Dr. Gatera and André Rwamakuba at the hospital.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand.  
Q.	In that statement you did not describe what Dr. Gatera did nor what Dr. Rwamakuba did.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand fully, Prosecutor.  I didn't explain what they had done because Gatera had already pleaded his case.  I couldn't therefore accuse people of things I had not personally witnessed. 
Q.	In that statement you did describe what Scholastic did.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Why did you not tell the Rwandan authorities in detail what Dr. Rwamakuba did when you made the statement about what Scholastic did? 
A.	I did not do so because when someone was arrested, they ask you what you knew about that specific person, the person in question.  At the time I was put questions as to what Scholastic had done. 
Q.	The next question -- statement in time is a form dated the 7th of July 2003 prepared for the investigators for this Tribunal which is called a reconfirmation form in which it is recorded that at a hotel in Butare there appeared to be no corrections that you wish to make to your statement of the 17th of September 1997.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	However, the next statement in time is the statement dated the 22nd of October 2003.  It is the same form.  A reconfirmation form made for the investigators assisting this Tribunal in which you do make corrections to your statement of 1997.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	Can you help us with why it was that on the 7th of July, it appeared that no corrections might be necessary, but on the 22nd of October, three months later you felt that corrections were necessary? 
A.	You have the documents in hand; but, as far as I am concerned, I am not sure about the dates.  I can't even tell you what hotel we were at when I gave those statements.  Thank you.  Unless you want to read me the statements so that I can understand why I asked for that correction. 
Q.	The document dated the 7th of July of 2003, as I asked my question a moment ago, can be described as a form.  It's not a statement.  It's simply a form.  Do you understand that? 
A.	I understand.  Each time I asked for a correction to be made, where they mentioned my father because I never went anywhere with him. 
Q.	Do you remember now meeting investigators in a hotel, in Butare on the 7th of July of 2003? 
A.	I don't remember which hotel but, in any case, there were meetings.  They can't -- those statements they didn't make unless they erred, unless they were mistaken. 
Q.	Do you remember signing a form in a hotel in Butare with investigators for this Tribunal in July of 2003.  Do you remember it? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	Do you remember whether before you signed that form your statement of the 17th of September 1997 was read over to you?  Do you remember whether it was or it was not? 
A.	I don't remember very well whether it was read, but I must assert that it is possible that they read it because one cannot sign to approve what one has not read or not understood. 
Q.	Can you remember how long you were with the investigators for, on the 7th of July of 2003, in the hotel in Butare?  I am asking for a period in minutes, please.  
MR. HOOPER: 
With due respect, this is getting over to a cross-examination with his own witness.  The witness has told us that she had the statement -- that maybe she believes that the statement was read over to her.  My learned friend has to proceed with caution, particularly given the evidence of this witness. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
I would be surprised if I am engaged in cross-examination at this point.  I understand my learned friend's sensitivity.  The witness seems to remember meeting investigators.  The witness opines that although she doesn't remember whether the statement was read over to her or not, it seems it was otherwise, she wouldn't have signed the document.  I am simply now asking her how long it was that she was with the investigators, if she can remember.  My respectful submission, it's not an inappropriate question 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is allowed. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can you give us some idea in minutes, please, as to how long if you remember, investigators were with you on the 7th of July of 2003, in that hotel in Butare? 
A.	Were I to make an estimate, we scarcely spent an hour together, but we were working. 
Q.	Turning to the 22nd of October of 2003, the same form was signed at the Prosecutor's office in Butare when the investigators saw you again and you made corrections.  Do you remember that? 
A.	I do remember. 
Q.	How long in minutes can you remember, if you remember, were the investigators with you on the 22nd of October --  
MR. HOOPER: 
I object to the form of the question that talks of minutes in the circumstances. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I explain why I ask in terms of minutes?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, that is leading.  You could ask, for how long.  
MR. MORLEY:
The answer -- I could, Your Honour is right.  My experience has shown that many witnesses from Rwanda when they were asked how long, they come up with an answer a long time or a short time and it doesn't necessarily mean very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Inaudible)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Microphone, Mr. President, sorry.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, I see the point. --  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Suppose she wants to say, it's more than an hour.
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour is right.  I see the problem now.  Excuse me.  I see the problem, my apologies.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	How long were you with the investigators in the prosecutor's office in Butare on the 22nd of October?  Can you help us? 
A.	I don't remember how long we spent together, but it was quite sometime on that occasion. 
Q.	But when you say quite sometime, can you give us some idea in terms of hours or minutes? 
A.	I am not in a position to estimate the time spent together because we were interrupted from time to time by phone calls they would make.  They would go out and come back.  That's why I would say it was quite sometime, more than I spent with them on that occasion. 
Q.	Dealing with times, at one point you were asked about how long had you seen me on the 18th and 20th of August of this year, you understand what I have said? 
A.	I remember very well. 
Q.	Your response was, "Quite sometime", you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, that was my response -- my answer. 
MR. MORLEY:
	Perhaps if the witness might take her headphones off for a moment.  If my learned friend, Mr. Hooper, for the sake of clarity would like to know how long quite sometime is, in minutes or hours, I can lead the witness as to how long we spent together, so that Mr. Hooper knows what that time period is.  I invite Your Honour's consideration as to whether I can lead the witness on the times because I have them here.  But they would be a leading question.  And I don't imagine it will be disagreed with by the witness, but it maybe Mr. Hooper's takes it as a technical question?
(Pages 1 to 12 by Judith Kapatamoyo)























1000H
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, well, it is not a technical question, in fairness, you shouldn't ask a leading question.  You can ask questions in the normal way of the witness, at this time.  If you want to come and tell me afterwards how long it was, then he can do that.  Thank you very much.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, I did offer.  I am not going to ask a leading question, and I will move on to the next matter. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You gave evidence on the 10th of December 2003 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Her microphone. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	I'm sorry, yes. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you remember coming to the Tribunal in December 2003, to give evidence? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	In 2003, on page 10, line 26, you explained to the Tribunal who gave you the name of 
	André Rwamakuba.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	On line 26 of page 10, you said, "Among those who gave his name to me was Paul."  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, I understand, but I would like to say that it is those who took down my statement, who were mistaken.  Rather, what I said was that the person who gave me the name of that person was the person whose name is on the list of names that was presented to me. 
Q.	When you used the expression "Amongst those who gave his name to me", did you receive the name of André Rwamakuba from only one person or from more than one person? 
A.	People talked quite a bit about him, but generally speaking, most of the refugees were students, and they talked of André, and referred to that person by his first name; André.  That is what was being said at the time. 
Q.	You have mentioned someone called Boniface, do you remember mentioning him? 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Just before my friend moves from there, in fairness to the Defence position, this has also referred to her answer at page 33, in relation to the source of information.  And, I think, if you are going to put selected areas of cross-examination, and re-examination, then it's only fair to put them fairly fully.  Where there is a further reference such as this, page 33, the last two answers. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	Always happy to assist. 
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q. 	Page 33, line 28, you said, "I heard the refugees saying that it was André Rwamakuba."  Do you understand what I've said?  
A.	Yes, I am following you, Mr. Prosecutor.  And that's how things happened.  Furthermore, those people who informed me of the name of the doctor were also refugees, because they were natives of the Gikongoro area. 
Q.	Line 34, you said, "Those refugees announced names of all those who came in.  Then I heard Paul say that it was his name, because he knew him."  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, I am following you, absolutely, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Was Paul, or one person -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
	I'm sorry, can you just read, please, the two answers she gave, without comment, and then return in fairness to make your comments to the questions.  So, that's a question -- an ultimate answer and final answer on page 33. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	I hope I am not being unnecessary difficult.  I don't see the point of this.  I can read the entire answer and if it assists my learned friend, and I will do so.  
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, in fairness to the points that's being made, can you read and oblige me by reading those two answers fully without comment and then you can come back and make comment.  That would be quite reasonable, if you feel you must. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	I sincerely hope I haven't been commenting in my questions.  And if it assists my learned friend, I will read the two answers. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Line 28, under cross-examination.  "It was then that I learned that man's name.  When I heard the refugees saying that it was André Rwamakuba, I recognised the name when I heard that Rwamakuba had been arrested.  Those were the only two occasions on which I heard the name before appearing before this Tribunal."  First answer.  Second answer, line 34, "Those refugees announced names of all those who came in.  Then I heard Paul say that it was his name because he knew him.  I did not know that Rwamakuba had studied at university, but a young man knew him.  By the way, he was taken away immediately afterwards, and the other refugees knew him as well."  
MR. MORLEY:
Now, I hope that reads out everything that my learned friend sought.  Is there anything else he wants?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So, coming back to the question I wanted to ask.  Was the name of André Rwamakuba uttered by only one person that night? 
A.	I heard many people utter the first name, André.  As to the surname, Rwamakuba, it's only one person who told me about it.  Otherwise, many refugees -- most refugees refer to that person by his first name, André. 
Q.	And who was the one person who told you the surname, Rwamakuba? 
A.	It was the person whose name appears on the list that was given to me by the Defence 
	Counsel Hooper.  I don't recall the number against which name is written, but if I were to be shown the list again, I can show you the name of the person I am referring to. 
Q.	In your evidence on the 10th of December of 2003, on page 11, at line 32, you were asked a question.  "Now, were the men and boys loaded on to the vehicle?"  And you replied, "Yes, they were compelled to get into the vehicle into the pick-up."  And you were asked a question:  "Was your brother among these people?"  And you replied:  "Yes, he was among them."  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	I understand you, Mr. Prosecutor, and that is what happened. 
Q.	When you say that your brother was among the people compelled into the pick-up truck, in what manner was he placed on the pick-up truck? 
A.	He was carried by hand, and that is why I said that he was already dead. 
Q.	In your transcript of evidence from the 10th of December 2003, at page 24, line number 11, 
	Mr. Hooper is recorded as asking you a question concerning a piece of paper that was in front of you on that occasion with a list of names on it, do you understand what I've said? 
A.	I'm following you.
MR. MORLEY:
With my learned friend's assistance, can we have the piece of paper back, please, P. 14, from the original trial?  
MR. HOOPER: 
	It's D. 70. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	Perhaps if that might be shown back to Their Honours, so that they can remind themselves of what's on it.  Can it be shown to the witness too? 
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	The document you have in front of you -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Counsel. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	Thank you.  My apologies.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
You are welcome any time. 

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The document you have in front of you is a document you were shown on the 10th of 
	December 2003.  Do you understand?  You described knowing the -- 
A.	Yes, I understand you. 
Q.	You described knowing the person listed at No. 2.  Do you see the name at No. 2?
A.	Yes, I see, but I realised that there is a spelling error concerning his family name or his surname, if that is the person we are referring to. 
Q.	Don't worry about the spelling error.  
A.	Unless it is a different person.  I really don't know. 
Q.	The person at No. 2, it appears is the person without the spelling error at No. 7 on the list of names we've been working from in this trial.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Quite sure, but I do not know if that person knows me.  I, on my part, can say that I know the person, but I can't say if the person knows me or not. 
Q.	In respect of the document which is in front of you at the moment, on page 24, at line 11, Mr. Hooper asked this question:  "Apart from number 2, would it be right to say that you know the other two witnesses on the list, yes or no?"  I'm just pausing there.  There are three other names on the list; is that right. 
A.	I believe that you didn't quite understand what I said.  I stated that I knew the person, but I did not know the other person.  So I think I was misunderstood. 
Q.	Listen to the question.  The list of names contains three other names; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The question you were asked, I will remind you at line 11, page 24.  "Apart from No. 2, would it be right to say that you know the other two witnesses on the list, yes or no?"  And your reply was:  "I know them as ***********************.  That is all."  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	One of the persons bears the same name as someone *********************************************, but I'm not sure if it is that person.  But if I were to be shown the photographs of the two persons, I would be in a position to tell you exactly the person I'm referring to. 
Q.	Thank you.  Listen to the question.  You went on to say, at line 24, Question:  "You see these people about, don't you?"  Answer:  "I met them early recently, very recently."  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	I don't know if this is the content of the transcript, as I understand it.  But I don't think that's how -- but I think that is how I gave my answer. 
Q.	And then at line 28, "We do not meet very often."  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	I understand, but what I'm telling you is that amongst those persons, I know only one of them, of all the people whose name appear on the list. 
Q.	Can you help Their Honours, with when you say you know someone as an employee of the hospital that you've only met recently and you do not meet very often, how well do you know that person? 
A.	The person that I was able to recognise was a doctor who works in pediatric unit.  I usually ******************************************.  Such are the circumstances under which I knew him.  I recognised the name of that doctor.  And that is someone who treats my children.  By the way, I think that if you were to ask him, he would say that he doesn't know me or that she doesn't know me, because we could know him or her because we have gone to seek medical attention from the person, but I don't think that the person would recog -- would know us. 
Q.	When you said under cross-examination on Tuesday that you didn't know two of the people that appear on the list in front of you, what did you mean by saying, "I don't know them"? 
A.	Are you referring to the list that I have before me, 
Mr. Prosecutor?  I really I'm not following you. 
Q.	Yes, the list that you have in front of you.  On Tuesday, you were saying that you didn't know two of the names that appear on that list, other than at No. 2.  But in December of 2003, you were saying that you knew them ***************** you've met very recently and you do not meet very often.  So --  
MR. HOOPER: 
	Excuse me.  There is a danger of straws here, and you are tearing the witness up.  It's not an ambiguous answer, and this is re-examination, and you are just -- in my submission, Mr. Morley is just going a step too -- too far.  He had his answers.  There is an ambiguity, I can understand that, but it's not an ambiguity, it's a contradiction. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	Well, the point of this is to establish whether it is an ambiguity or a contradiction.  And my learned friend asserts there is a contradiction, but what we are enquiring about is whether it is an ambiguity.  And I respectfully submit that it is entirely a proper question on an important matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can ask the question. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Witness, listen to the question.  When you said in December of 2003 that you knew two people as ************************* you met very recently and did not meet often, but on Tuesday you were saying you did not know them.  What did you mean when you said on Tuesday you did not know them? 
A.	Before I stated that I knew the person on that list.  I said so because this is someone who works with **********************.  I used to work with the person -- or, I worked with the person who bears a Christian name.  I don't know if I need to give you the family name of the person I'm talking about.  There is some confusion here.  I know a person who bears the first name that I see here, but apparently, the surname is not the same.  So, they are not the same persons.  I think that's where the confusion lies. 
Q.	How well do you know the other two names in the list? 
A.	I know the person whose name is against No. 2, because I saw him in the war.  Furthermore, he used to come and visit his junior sister who lived nearby my house.  Those are the circumstances under which I know the person. 
Q.	How well do you know the person? 
A.	You know it is because she ************************* and I don't live near the hospital.  It is because I have seen the person at the hospital, but I cannot say whether she knows me, but I know her well.  This is the sister of a friend and this is a person I know in the way in which I have described to you.  But I would like to specify that the junior sister of that person was the friend of mine, and I came to know the person we are talking about here when the person came to visit that junior sister of his or hers.  This is somebody I know, but he or she is not a friend. 
Q.	Turning then, please, to page 51 of the transcript, at line 23, it is recorded on the transcript that you said on the 10th of December 2003, "I never said Gatera used an axe to kill my brother."  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes, quite sure. 
Q.	And a few lines later, it is recorded on page 52, at line 6, "I never saw my brother being killed by an axe."  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I have understood.  I believe that is one of the points that retained our attention when we met last time.  I do not know how the interpreters came to say such a thing.  I don't know what happened.  I think we discussed this at length.  I didn't quite understand from where that statement came.
Q.	What is your explanation that you offer to Their Honours, for what appears on the transcript, please? 
A.	What I would tell the Trial Chamber is that they shouldn't rely on those two documents, because at the time I had requested that the original of the Gatera case file be given me.  At the time I did not come -- I had no interest in defending Gatera in that case, whereas I know what he did.  Furthermore, I would like to request that when a person comes to testify before the Trial Chamber, he or she be made to sign the transcripts of his or her evidence.  This would be used subsequently. 
Q.	Who killed your brother? 
A.	Gatera is the one. 
Q.	Where was Rwamakuba when that happened? 
A.	Rwamakuba was at the location, and he was asking people to produce their identity cards and Rwamakuba handed over those identity cards to Athanase who then passed them on to Gatera.  But as far as I'm concerned, those two persons are one and the same.  They committed very grievous offences.  
MR. MORLEY: 
	Your Honour, that is all I asked.  I hope it is a convenient moment.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

Madam Witness, you wish to say something to me?  
THE WITNESS:
I would like to add one thing.  This point concerns the treatment that we were subjected to, we, as women, following the statements made by Dr. Rwamakuba.  He is the one who said that women should be raped.  As far as I'm concerned I was -- I was subject to that prejudice 
as well as my daughter, but I realised that you didn't address this issue during the proceedings, and 
	I am pained by this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your statement is noted.  The procedure in this Court as I have explained to you from time to time, have been governed by rules of practice and procedure.  And during, and in accordance with those rules, your testimony has now come to an end.  You have been examined by the Prosecutor and the Defence.  The members of the Court don't have any questions to ask you.  And we would like to thank you for coming and for the time you spent during testimony.  But now your evidence is over, and you are free to leave now.  Thank you for being here. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you too, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court will take a short recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1035H)
(Pages 13 to 19 by Haruna Farage) 















(Court resumed at 1105H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can resume now.  I gather you are all ready to tender the exhibits pertaining to this witness?  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, where is Mr. Morley?  He should be present for this exercise.
MR. HOOPER:
Is it possible to have a very quick photocopy made of a document, because it's a list Ms. Poupard's created of all these exhibits and it will assist Court management as we go through it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, who is the -- are you ready with your next witness?  Is the Prosecution ready with the next witness?  I'm wondering whether, in the absence of Mr. Morley, we should take your next witness and then either do this with the afternoon session, and we could do this and the exhibits for 
Ms. Des Forges at the same time at the commencement of the afternoon session.  Would that be in order?
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  We don't have any problem with calling the next witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you can inform Mr. Morley and Mr. Webster that they can enter the exhibits at the commencement of the afternoon session at 2 o'clock.
MS. FALL:
I'll do that, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registrar, please bring the next witness.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apparently the witness is not receiving the Kinyarwanda interpreters.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.  Can you hear me?
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now we welcome you to our courtroom.  You are here to give evidence and the registrar will now ask you to take an oath to tell the truth.  Can you hear and understand?
THE WITNESS:
I understand you, Mr. President.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Your witness, Mr. Registrar.
(Declaration made by Witness ALW in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you will now be examined by the Prosecutor and you'll have to answer her questions in accordance with your oath.  

Ms. Fall.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS ALW
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, as the president has just told you, I am going to lead you in examination-in-chief, and I will request that you ask -- that in answering your questions, since you are a protected witness, you shouldn't divulge information that may reveal your identity.  For starters, I will try to establish your identification.  And in order to do so, and since you are a protected witness, as I said earlier on, I'll give you a document that contains your personal particulars that are confidential, and with the assistance of the registry, you are going to ascertain whether the information that you have on that document is correct.  

Madam Witness, do you have the document in front of you?  
A.	Yes, I have the document before me. 
Q.	Does the document bear your name? 
A.	Yes, I see my name on the document. 
Q.	How about your first name?

Q.	And your nationality? 
A.	Yes, the nationality is mentioned on the document as well. 
Q.	How about your ethnicity? 
A.	That is also true of my ethnicity. 
Q.	Does the document make any reference to your current occupation? 
A.	Yes, the document -- in the document mention is made of the place at which I work today. 
Q.	Does the document also mention what you were doing or what was your occupation in 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us if all information concerning your place of birth, your current address, and your address in 1994, is correct? 
A.	The information is correct. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.

I would like to request, with the assistance of the registry, you write down the date of today and sign the document.  

Today is the 25th.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to enter that document as an exhibit of the Prosecution and that it should be Prosecution Exhibit 61 and that should be placed under seal as one of the confidential documents that portend (sic) to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence under seal.  

Mr. Registrar, confirm it's P. 61, please.
MR. KIYEYEU:
That's correct, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Yes. 
(Exhibit No. P. 61 admitted, under seal)
  MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, have you had to come and give testimony in this Arusha International Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	No, I have never appeared before this Arusha Tribunal before the date of today. 
Q.	Have you already given a statement to -- or given testimony to Rwandan national courts? 
A.	Yes, I have already given a statement. 
Q.	Can you tell us in which case you gave a statement? 
A.	That was in the Jeffery Gatera case. 
Q.	Do you recall at what time you gave the statement or you had to give evidence? 
A.	I can only recall the year that was in, 1998.  
Q.	Besides that testimony, have you had to give statements to other persons in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I have testified against another person but that person was released subsequently, and today he is a free person. 
Q.	Was that also before a court in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I gave a statement, but I never appeared before the court in order to give evidence. 
Q.	Can you tell us a name of the person against whom you made a statement? 
A.	I can only remember his family name and the name is Sekiromba. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Madam Witness, have you had the opportunity of meeting the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I have met them. 
Q.	Can you recall the number of times during which you met them? 
A.	No, I can no longer remember the number of times that I've had to meet the investigators of the Tribunal. 
Q.	Do you remember --
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt.  Before we pass on too far, would it be possible to have a spelling, please, for Sekiromba, if I've got it right?  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you spell the name of the person against whom you gave a statement, for Mr. Hooper? 
A.	Sekiromba is spelled S-E-K-I-R-O-M-B-A, Sekiromba.
MS. FALL:
Are you satisfied, Counsel Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much, Miss Fall.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, I was wondering whether you gave a statement when you met the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I gave a statement on that occasion. 
Q.	Do you remember the year, the year in which you gave the statement? 
A.	My memory is not very clear, but I think it was in 2003. 
Q.	Do you recall whether you signed the statement? 
A.	Yes, I signed the statement. 
Q.	Madam Witness, before signing the statement, was it re-read to you? 
A.	I can no longer remember. 
Q.	Did you have the opportunity of making corrections on that statement? 
A.	Yes, I had the opportunity of doing so. 
Q.	Now, I'm going to put a question to you concerning certain events that -- prior to that, I'd like to ask you, where did you reside in April 1994, with the understanding that you should not give any information that may reveal your identity? 
A.	I was living in my parents' home. 
Q.	Is it possible for you to give us the name of the commune? 
A.	It was the Huye commune. 
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, what happened in Rwanda on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us? 
A.	It was on that day that they announced that the person who had been president of the republic had died in an aeroplane crash. 
Q.	How did you hear of that? 
A.	The news was given out over the radio.  It was announced over the radio. 
Q.	And where were you when that was announced, witness? 
A.	I was on our hill at my parents' home. 
Q.	Can you tell us what happened after you heard that news?  What did you do? 
A.	Over the radio they had announced that everybody had to stay home and no one could go out, and when someone tried to go out they would find soldiers outside who would force them -- compel them to go home again.  So, I stayed home. 
Q.	Did you stay home the whole time? 
A.	We stayed home for a week, and the following week, on the 19th of April, we left the house. 
Q.	Why did you leave the house when the instructions were not to leave the house? 
A.	We had observed that people were beginning to set fire to houses, without knowing what was happening, and we heard that houses were to be burned down and all Tutsi were to be killed, however old they were, and no Tutsi was to be spared. 
Q.	Can you remind us of the date that you mentioned?  What date was that? 
A.	It was the 19th. 
Q.	To be quite clear, are we talking of the 19th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You say that houses were set alight and you say the Tutsis were to be killed.  Was your house set on fire? 
A.	Yes, our house was also set on fire and our goods were looted, as well as our cattle. 
Q.	Do you know who committed those misdeeds? 
A.	At the outset of the genocide in Butare préfecture the interim government had organised a meeting at the Butare multipurpose hall where the coursey (sic) and other grass roots societies were called to attend that meeting.  They did so, and it was at that meeting that it was announced that all the Tutsi were to be killed and none must survive.  And when they came back from the meeting they boosted about that decision and immediately began to implement it. 
Q.	When you took flight on that day, were you alone? 
A.	No, I did not stay alone.  We all fled together, and the person most closely related to me was my aunt and it was then that we were wounded and we went straight to the hospital. 
Q.	I will come back to that, Madam Witness.  You say you left with your aunt.  What happened to the other members of your family, do you know? 
A.	The other members of my family also fled but subsequently they died. 
Q.	You say that when you left with your aunt you were wounded and your aunt was also wounded? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us at which place your aunt was wounded -- sorry, where she was wounded? 
A.	She received a head wound. 
Q.	Can you tell us where you, yourself, were wounded? 
A.	I received a leg wound and my left arm was also wounded. 
Q.	You've told us that you and your aunt were wounded and you went directly to Butare hospital? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us which hospital? 
A.	The university hospital. 
Q.	At what time did you arrive at that hospital? 
A.	We arrived there in the morning. 
Q.	Can you give us the date on which you arrived at that hospital? 
A.	I only remember that it had been two days since we had fled from our house. 
Q.	If I follow correctly, you left your house on the 19th of April and two days later you arrived at the hospital, which would therefore be April 21st? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	When you arrived at the hospital, where were you? 
A.	When we arrived at the hospital my aunt was immediately admitted, because she was seriously wounded, and she received a transfusion. 
Q.	Can you tell us where she was admitted? 
A.	In the surgical ward. 
Q.	And where were you, yourself, at that time? 
A.	I was with her in the surgical ward.  I was helping her as her carer (sic). 
Q.	Were there other patients in that ward? 
A.	Yes, there were. 
Q.	Are you in a position to tell us how many patients there were? 
A.	Approximately 30. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us what occurred when you were in the surgical ward? 
A.	While we were in the surgical ward there were doctors who would come and take away the Tutsi patients to kill them. 
Q.	Do you know the identity of those doctors? 
A.	I knew some of them. 
Q.	Are you in a position to inform us as to their identity? 
A.	Among them there was Dr. Gatera, also there were nurses who accompanied the doctors; in fact, there were several doctors and I didn't know the names of some of them, but I know that he came with another doctor named André Rwamakuba.  And they came to take away the patients after having removed their transfusions, and they handed them over to Interahamwe to be killed, but also patients that they struck with hatchets that the doctors were carrying at their belts. 
Q.	Madam Witness, how long after your arrival at the hospital did you see the doctors in the surgical wards? 
A.	It was about three days after our arrival. 
Q.	When the doctors arrived, were they alone? 
A.	No, they were accompanied by nurses, as well as Interahamwe.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is using the word soigner which is masculine for nurse in French.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Did you know the doctor that you have named as Dr. Gatera? 
A.	Yes, I knew Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances you came to know him? 
A.	I knew him in his capacity as a doctor in the surgical department of that hospital. 
Q.	Had you had the opportunity to meet him before that? 
A.	No, we had never met before that. 
Q.	As regards the doctor you have named as André Rwamakuba, had you ever heard of him before that? 
A.	I heard that name for the first time over the radio, and when I arrived at the hospital -- it was after those three days that the refugees who were at the hospital said to me, "There, there is 
André Rwamakuba" and they said that he had organised a meeting at the university to prepare the massacre of the Tutsis.  And the refugees added, "Now that Dr. Rwamakuba has come here, we are finished.  We shall be exterminated." 
Q.	Did you know any of the refugees who gave you that information pertaining to 
Dr. André Rwamakuba's identity? 
A.	There was a student by the name of Eric Gashongwe who gave -- who taught at the school known as the Groupe Scolaire. 
Q.	Can you tell us where Eric Gashongwe is today? 
A.	He is dead. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us whether the people who came into the surgical ward were armed? 
A.	They were armed with little hatchets. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether Dr. Gatera had a little hatchet? 
A.	Yes, he always was armed with a little hatchet. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether Dr. André Rwamakuba also had a little hatchet? 
A.	Yes, he also had a little hatchet.  Yes, he also had one. 
Q.	Can you tell us where, exactly, he carried that hatchet? 
A.	He wore it at his belt. 
Q.	Madam Witness, when those people entered the ward, can you tell us exactly where you were? 
A.	They came in through the door opposite, where I was on the door leading to the outside, because my aunt's bed was near the door leading outside.  And when they came into the ward they had a list of Tutsis and could see that all the patients there were Tutsi at that time.  And Dr. Rwamakuba would remove the transfusions and hit out with his little hatchet. 
Q.	Madam, we will proceed by stages.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  If you can just slow up.  I'm trying to keep a note and I got as far as there as they had a list and they could see, I think, all the patients were Tutsis, is as far as I was able to get.  Thank you.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know what the ethnicity was of the patients at the hospital? 
A.	No, I do not know the ethnicity of the patients at the hospital. 
Q.	So you were in the ward by the door facing or nearly facing the door through which you say André Rwamakuba and the others entered.  And then can you tell us what you saw, but stage by stage, so that we can make the necessary notes.  
A.	Where were we?  
Q.	When you saw one André Rwamakuba near the doctors enter the ward, that is with the people accompanying him, that ward where there were Tutsi patients, who you cannot (sic) tell us were all Tutsi, did you, at that time, see what that group of people was doing? 
A.	They had a list of names, and they called out the names on the list.  And as they had that list of names, they also knew that the patients were Tutsi, and they had removed the drips from everyone who had a drip, and after having removed the drip they struck the patient with the little hatchet.  I, personally, saw the doctor strike five people with his hatchet, and I realised the situation was critical and we ran the risk of being ourselves killed.  And so I took my aunt over my shoulder and I grabbed the drip and we went out, as though we were going to the toilet, and when we got into the corridor --
MR. O'SHEA:
(Microphones overlapping)

BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, I did tell you we must proceed stage by stage so that we can take notes.  So we would ask you not to answer at great length in your explanations.  So let us come back a bit.  They entered.  They had a list where there were names of Tutsi patients and at that time what did you see?  What did you do?  Please proceed stage by stage, so that we can follow and, to make things easier, perhaps you could answer my questions.  

So, after the list with the names, what did they do? 
A.	They removed the drips from the patients, and then they struck them with their hatchets. 
Q.	When you say, Madam, they did this or they did that, can you be more specific?  Who removed the drips?  Who struck with the hatchet?  
A.	Dr. Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Did you see him, yourself, personally, strike the patients and remove their drips? 
A.	Yes, I saw them. 
Q.	You say you saw them, but you just said it was Dr. Rwamakuba.  Was someone else also striking patients and removing drips? 
A.	It is because of the way you put the question to me.  My answer was in accordance with the way you put the question to me. 
Q.	I fully understand, Madam Witness.  But apart from Dr. Rwamakuba, was someone else striking patients and removing their drips? 
A.	Dr. Gatera and the others present did as much, but the person who attracted the most attention was Dr. André Rwamakuba.
(Pages 20 to 28 by R. Lear)















1200H 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, why do you say it was Dr. André Rwamakuba who attracted the most attention?  
A.	It is because it was he that I saw committing those misdeeds in that ward.  
Q.	Madam, you have said that you saw him, Dr. Rwamakuba, strike five patients with his hatchet.  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And at that moment, Madam Witness, where were you?  
A.	I was next to the patient I was caring for.  
Q.	Are you in a position to give us an estimate of the distance that was between where you were and where the events were taking place?  
A.	I'm going to give you an estimate.  I cannot be very precise as to the distance in metres, but I will tell you that there were about 15 metres that separated us.  
Q.	From the spot at which you were, were you in a position to see clearly what was going on?  
A.	Yes.  I could clearly see what was happening, and even to hear the statements that were being made.  
Q.	Were there utterances?  
A.	They were hitting the people with a small axe, saying that no Tutsi should survive.
Q.	Madam Witness, please be specific.  There were many persons you said.  So when you said they were -- or he was hitting or striking people, saying at the same time that no Tutsi should survive, who is it you mean?  
A.	I am talking about Dr. Rwamakuba.  He was saying that no Tutsi should survive and that all Tutsis were -- or had to die.  
Q.	Madam Witness, we are going to go back to what you have told us concerning the five patients you said were struck by André Rwamakuba.  Do you know what happened to those patients?  
A.	Those patients were immediately removed and loaded up in a vehicle, and they were thrown away.  They were taken away and thrown away.  
Q.	Madam Witness, can you specify if it was -- at what specific location or at which specific spot Rwamakuba struck the patients with his axe?  
A.	He struck them on the head.  
Q.	Did you personally see those persons being transported away in a vehicle?  
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness to that.  
Q.	Can you tell us or describe to us the vehicle that was used?  
A.	It was a red pickup.  
Q.	Would you be in a position to specify to us where exactly was positioned this red pickup?  
A.	That pickup was parked opposite the maternity.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you tell us that you were in the in-patient room of the surgery unit.  Now, can you tell us where the maternity is located vis-a-vis the surgery?  
A.	The maternity is near the surgery, but the surgery -- or, rather, the maternity is located a bit lower.  
Q.	Can you tell us exactly at what specific moment you saw those patients being taken away in a vehicle?  
A.	It was in the morning.  
Q.	Madam Witness -- well, we'll go back again because you talked about this already.  You stated that when you saw these patients being killed, you went away.  Where did you go, and how did you leave?  
A.	I went out of that room.  I was holding my aunt, and I had to carry along with me the drip.  And we moved further outwards where other refugees were.  
Q.	Can you be more specific as to where the other refugees were?  
A.	Those refugees were between the operating theatre and the ENT and maternity.  
Q.	Were they inside or outside the hospital?  
A.	The refugees were in a field inside the hospital between the units that I've just mentioned to you.  
Q.	But can you tell us at what specific spot they were at that location?  
A.	That was in the courtyard between the ENT, the paediatrics, and the surgery.  It was in the courtyard that was between those services -- or units.  
Q.	After having left, you went to that spot.  Did you see André Rwamakuba again?  
A.	Yes, I saw him again.  
Q.	When did you see him again?  
A.	I saw him again two days after that incident.  
Q.	If I have understood your answer well, you saw him again not on the day on which you left that in-patient ward, but two days later?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	So at this second time that you saw André Rwamakuba, was he alone?  
A.	He was still in the company of soldiers and Interahamwe.  
Q.	Can you tell us if the persons accompanying him were armed or not?  
A.	Those who were with him were armed, and he, himself, was equipped with an axe.  
Q.	Madam Witness, when you saw him the second time around, where were you?  
A.	I was at the spot at which the other refugees were.  
Q.	Can you, once again, if possible, estimate the distance between you, the refugees, and André Rwamakuba and those who were with him?  
A.	If I were to make an estimate, the distance covered about between 18 -- eight to ten metres.  
Q.	What happened at that point in time, and what were you able to notice?  
A.	I saw two men who were standing at that place, and I met them in the corridor.  And one of the men was called Mutabazi, and the other is called Kazasumaho.  He hit them with the same axe, saying at the same time that the snake didn't have anywhere to hide.  
MR. HOOPER:
May we have a spelling, please?  
MS. FALL:
I think "Kazasumaho" is spelled as follows:  K-A-Z-A-S-U- -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Can we have the witness spell the name, please? 
MS. FALL:
Counsel, didn't you receive the list of names?  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Well, Madam Witness, can you spell the name out for Counsel Hooper?  
A.	M-U-T-A-B-A-Z-I.  K-A-Z-A-S-H- -- well, where are you at?  
Q.	Well, we are on letter H, but I think you spelled Kaza- "H." 
A.	I think I made a mistake.  K-A-Z-A-S-O-M-A-H-O (sic).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, I suggest it might be easier if we gave her a pen and paper, so she could write the name and then spell it from the writing.  She seems to be having difficulty remembering.  Mr. Registrar, perhaps you can do that.  
MS. FALL:
I think we can proceed in that manner, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, we're going to provide you with a piece of paper on which you will write the two names that you mentioned, and I think if this were allowed, you can also include the name of the student who died and who identified André Rwamakuba.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is very intelligent as a tool to help her to spell, because it will be on the record once she has spelled it.  But she was having difficulty remembering where she was in the spelling, and this is just to assist her.  
MS. FALL:
That's correct, yes.  No problem with that, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
I'm done.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Registrar.  
MR. KIYEYEU:
She has completed to write the names.  Maybe now you could ask her to spell out so that the record has take the names as such, but it's not for purposes of producing it as an exhibit as the Honourable Judge has directed.  
MS. FALL:
But I never said that I was going to request that it be entered as an exhibit.  In my mind, what I meant is that the document should be given to the President, as well as to the Defence, so that they can see how the names have been spelled.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would also assist the reporters if she spelt the name into the record.  If she read what she had on the list now, then the spelling would be part of the record.  It would also assist the court reporter. 
MS. FALL:
I don't have any problem with that, Mr. President, and that is what she was doing the first time around.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, can you spell out what you wrote down on a piece of paper?  
A.	Beginning with Kazasumaho, K-A-Z-A-S-U- -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth interpreter stands corrected.  He says "U."
THE WITNESS:
-- -M-A-H-O.  M-U-T-A-P- --- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, I don't know if it's interpreter in the Kinyarwanda booth or the witness, but somebody says they're mistaken.  There's only one "T" -- rather, it is a "B."
THE WITNESS:
-- -A-Z-I. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  We're going to proceed with your examination-in-chief.  And for more clarity and for the record, since while you were answering my question as to when you saw André Rwamakuba again, I heard from the translation that you said you met two men.  That is what I heard.  Now, can you tell us who met those two persons -- those two men?  
A.	I said that he met them.  
Q.	Thank you.  So you are stating that when he met those two men whose names you gave, what did he do?  Can you remind us of what he did?  
A.	He struck them with the axe he had with him by -- and telling them at the same time that there was no hiding place for snakes.  
Q.	Madam Witness, did you personally hear Rwamakuba make those utterances?  
A.	I heard him.  
Q.	From where you were -- and you were telling us that the distance was between eight and ten metres, approximately of course -- was it possible for you to hear him clearly say what he was saying?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us what happened after he had struck those two men with his axe?  
A.	He looked at us and said, "Remove the rubbish from there."  
Q.	And regarding the two persons that he struck, do you know what became of them?  
A.	Those persons were immediately taken to where the vehicle we mentioned was parked.  
Q.	Can you tell us -- if you were referring to two days after the event, can you tell us exactly at what specific spot the vehicle was stationed?  
A.	The vehicle was parked opposite the maternity.  
Q.	You were outside.  Could you, if possible, and more precisely, tell us the precise spot on which the vehicle was parked vis-a-vis the maternity?  
A.	From where we were to where the vehicle was parked, there was a relative distance -- well, the distance wasn't that long, but I'm not in a position to tell you exactly what distance it covered.  
Q.	In any case, can you specify to us at what side of the maternity the car was parked?  Was it behind or in front?  
A.	It was parked behind the maternity.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you talked about two persons who were struck and who were then taken away in a pickup.  Do you know those two persons in person?  But, Madam Witness, if you have any personal relationship with those persons, please don't mention it.  
A.	I knew those two persons.  
Q.	How did you know them?  
A.	I had blood relations with one of those two persons.  
Q.	And how about the other person?  
A.	The second person had been brought up within the family of the first person, and that person who was brought up in that family had received, from that family that served as his ward, land and property.  
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us, what was the ethnicity of the two persons who were struck?  
A.	I know the ethnicity --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, the witness mentioned the name of one of the two persons.  She says that she knew the ethnicity of that person.  The Kinyarwanda doesn't deem it fit to mention the name of the said person.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Can you tell us, what was his ethnicity?  
A.	The person was Tutsi.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, we are trying to work the schedule back to our normal schedule, 12:30 to 2:00.  So if you would come to a convenient time to pause in your examination -- 
MS. FALL:
I do not have any problem with that, Mr. President.  I think we can stop here and resume in the afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, sorry, before we rise, very quickly, if possible, are we sitting tomorrow afternoon, being Friday?  I don't mind.  It's just so that we can better arrange what we may have to do.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we had not planned to do so.  We thought at having gone through Professor Des Forges, we could resume our normal scheduling, which would require stopping at around noon tomorrow.  You think if we don't sit tomorrow afternoon, we will not complete?  
MR. HOOPER:
We're sitting half a day Monday, I think.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And we have Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  
MR. HOOPER:
No, we'll finish.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You think so?  Well, if you have reservations, you can let our court managing -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Half a day onward.  I'm just -- I think we'll finish.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I don't think I'll be very long this afternoon in the examination-in-chief, and I think Counsel Hooper can use the rest of this afternoon and tomorrow morning.  I suppose this should be enough for him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what we had thought also.  So we're still hopeful that we can complete, unless there's a problem that you know and you alert us to it, and then we'll make necessary adjustments.  
MR. HOOPER:
No.  I mean, on the expectation of two more witnesses --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah. 
MR. HOOPER:
-- we're fine.  Absolutely fine.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I notice Mr. Morley is here, and I would just like to remind that we have programmed to the exhibits, both for the GIO and Alison Des Forges, at the resumption at 2:00.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  May I apologise if I caused any convenience.  I wasn't aware that my attendance was required again at  11:00.  My apologies.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Madam Witness -- Madam Witness, can you hear me?  We are going to adjourn for lunch.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to adjourn for lunch, and we will resume the court sitting at around 2:00.  When we return, you will not come into court immediately, as we have some other things to do, but you'll be called into court shortly after -- after two.  I must let you know that during this or any other adjournment, while you are in the witness box, you continue to be a witness, and you should not discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand you, but then I have a small problem.  When I was coming here, I left behind a small child.  I don't know if during the break I can go and see the child.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you are permitted to see your child.  It's just that you can't speak about the case, but you can speak to your child and take care of him in the normal way.  You understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take the recess now and resume at 2:00. 
(Court recessed at 1237H) 
(Pages 29 to 35 by Wendy Molnar)

















(Court resumed at 1415H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody. 

We can now resume our session.  I think we just have to deal with the question of the exhibits before we start and perhaps you can start with Alison Des Forges. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can we respectfully suggest that we start with GIO because we've worked out a list of exhibit numbers so we'd be thrown out of sync, if -- thank you very much. 

The registry have a list that Mrs. Poupard has drafted and it starts with, in fact, a CD of photos of Butare university hospital.  Oh, it doesn't start with that, okay.  Okay, right, yeah.  No, those haven't gone in yet, sorry, it's my mistake. 

It starts with, it would be Exhibit D. 70 -- I've got that wrong too, that's already gone in.  Right.  Okay.  So the first exhibit -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said there was a written list. 
MR. HOOPER:
There is and I'm reading from it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You just had one copy. 
MR. HOOPER:
I was just going to get you a photocopy and I'm afraid I didn't. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, very well.  Proceed. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, there is one.  Just pass it up, Svetlana, just take it up. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley has a copy as well? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Thank you.  

All right.  So the position is that the PVs, the procès-verbal statements, are with the registry at the moment and all we need to do is nominate them.  And the first PV is that of the last witness, GIO, dated the 5th of May '98 in the Gatera case and it is in Kinyarwanda, in French and English.  And it is, as an exhibit, we suggest, D. 71 and then each language is nominated A, B and C.  So we exhibit the PV of the 5th of May as D. 71A, B and C under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. 

Mr. Registrar.
MR. KIYEYEU:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just for the sake of the record, it would be useful, I thought, if you would state the exhibit numbers so we have an official record of the exhibit numbers. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
It is true, My Lord, the next exhibit will be Exhibit No. D. 71. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Just to confirm, that is D. 71A, B and C.  Can you confirm that, please, Mr. Registrar?  
MR. KIYEYEU:
Yes, My Lord. 
(Exhibit No. D. 71A, D. 71B, and D. 71C admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you. 

The next exhibit is described as a PV of Witness GIO, that should be corrected to read, "An extract from the public hearing in the case of Gatera, dated May the 19th 1998." 

Now, that is an evidential correction as well because it had been and is nominated on it as dated January the 23rd 1998, but it is, in fact, on the face of the Kinyarwanda document, dated the 19th of May 1998, in the top-right corner and that would make sense given the PV precedes it. 
MR. MORLEY:
I've risen to my feet at this stage, Your Honour.  I take no point in what my learned friend says and accept what he says, but I just observe for Your Honour's assistance that whatever page it is upon, which the Kinyarwandan document reads the correct date as May the 19th, that has not been disclosed to us.  So I'm relying on my learned friend saying that it's May the 19th.  It doesn't really matter whether it's the 23rd of January or May the 19th, so there's no point being taken on it.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm -

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley, we note that for the record. 
MR. HOOPER:
Right, thank you very much, and that would be exhibit -- again, in three languages in the order of Kinyarwanda, French and English, as D. 72B and C. 

And can the registry confirm that, please?  
MR. KIYEYEU:
Yes, indeed, My Lord.  
(Exhibit No. D. 72A, D. 72B and D. 72C admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you. 

The next PV is the procès-verbal of Witness GIO dated the 7th of May 1999 in the Twagirayezu case.  I should add the previous exhibit to be under seal, as should this one be under seal, and it is 
witness (sic) D. 73A, B and C in the order of Kinyarwanda, French and English.  And can you confirm that, please?  Thank you very much.
MR. KIYEYEU:
I confirm, My Lord.  
(Exhibit No. D. 73A, D. 73B and D. 73C admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
The next exhibit is the PV of Witness GIO dated the 7th February 2000 in the Mukabandora case to be kept under seal, in English, French -- sorry, in Kinyarwanda, French and English and the sequence D. 74, A, B and C and can you please confirm that?  
MR. KIYEYEU:
I confirm, My Lord.  
(Exhibit No. D. 74A, D. 74B and D. 74C admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
The next exhibit is the statement of Witness GIO of September the 17th, 1997 in English as D. 75A and in French as D. 75B, both to be kept under seal, and I produce them here.  Can you please confirm the exhibit numbers?  Thank you. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
Only A and B, is that correct, Counsel?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, yes, just A and B, English and French only, not Kinyarwanda. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
I confirm, My Lord.  
(Exhibit No. D. 75A and D. 75B admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you. 

The next exhibit is a CD produced as five copies each containing the French and English transcripts of Witness GIO and Witness HF's testimony in December 2003, both to be kept -- all to be kept under seal. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I rise at this stage?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm not sure whether it needs to be kept under seal.  The in closed session transcripts to be kept under seal and it would be D. 76. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour will know I wasn't party to the examination of the Witness HF in these proceedings.  In respect of exhibiting the testimony of HF from whatever HF said in December of 2003, arising out of the cross-examination of GIO, it's my respectful submission that my learned friend is not in a position to exhibit the testimony of HF.  It may be that his application is, in fact, in respect of HF's December 2003 testimony under the fact that she has given evidence and has been cross-examined by him previously.  But if the application is to put in the testimony of HF, which none of us have looked at during the course of the cross-examination or the examination generally of GIO, under the examination of GIO, it's my respectful submission it's an inappropriate application.  

I would invite my learned friend's clarification of the reasoning behind the submission of the testimony of HF into evidence. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, D -- D. 63 has been -- is already in and that's the -- all the transcripts of HF.  So HF has already been exhibited.  The only reason they're on this CD and referred to at all has nothing to do with GIO.  It's to do with the fact that they testified on the same day and the transcripts for that day have gone in, so that the complete document is in.  So it's not -- it doesn't go one way or the other, frankly.  Anyway, I don't think my friend appreciates HF had been exhibited.  It's not a -- an evidential matter as such. 
MR. MORLEY:
That's very helpful.  I hadn't appreciated that HF's testimony had been exhibited.  It begs the question why it needs to be exhibited again.  But if it has been exhibited, then I take no point in it. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  Part of the reason is that when you start extracting bits of the transcripts, we found that the page numbers can change and get completely thrown out.  So it's only there for completeness and not relied on -- or in this document as HF.  Well, that -- that we ask the D -- D. 76 to be kept under seal in as much as any closed session testimony on the document.  Thank you. 

Now, the next item at the bottom of the page is the tick list for Witness GIO.  Now, in fact, she didn't mark it unlike previous witnesses; it was all done orally.  But we exhibit it anyway, because otherwise her testimony won't make any sense without reference to the seven names that appear on that document. 

So can I formally admit the tick list, the list of names one to seven -- one to eight, I'm sorry, that appeared on this document, under seal.  Now, there was also a handwritten document which I produced to her.  That's already in.  I don't need to trouble the Court with that. 

Very well.  The next item I produce is a photocopy of a photograph of the back of the maternity unit at the university hospital, which was shown to Witness GIO and remains unmarked, but again as a point of reference for the transcript.  I invite that to be Exhibit D. 78, please. 

Right.  There, in fact, I have noticed, I'm sorry.
MR. KIYEYEU:
My Lord, I confirm Exhibits D. 76 and D. 77. 
(Exhibit No. D. 76 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 77 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 
MR. HOOPER:
And D. 78, which was the maternity photograph. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
I again confirm Exhibit Number D. 78. 
(Exhibit No. D. 78 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:  
We've got two further exhibits, but I'm afraid I'm amiss in not having them to hand.  I haven't produced them.  They will be -- maybe, I have one.  If you just give me one moment.  I have copies.  The first one is the will-say of Witness GIO, as referred to, to be kept under seal as Exhibit D. 79. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
My Lord, I confirm Exhibit D. 79. 
(Exhibit No. D. 79 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
The next exhibit will be D. 80.  The first one is a confirmation statement by Witness GIO dated the 7th of July 2003, at which appears at the bundles, GIO 24 and 25.  I produce that.  And that will be D. 80A.  
And we produce -- the only other thing to produce is the next confirmation statement, but mine is very, very slightly marked.  I don't know if there will be any objection. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
My Lord I confirm Exhibit D. 80A. 
(Exhibit No. D. 80A admitted)
MR. HOOPER:
I'm afraid I don't have a clean copy of the exhibit that will be D. 80B and can I have leave to submit that when I do, please?  It will be the second confirmation statement dated the 23rd of October 2003.  I don't have it, it's not --

If the Prosecution could produce a clean one?  
MR. MORLEY:
Everybody's copies are severely marked at this end, thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  I will undertake to produce that as soon as I can, thank you. 

And with the exception of that, what -- what will become D. 80B, which hasn't yet been produced those are all the GIO exhibits.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm again on my feet, Your Honour.  

Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues may have noticed that my learned friend is not applying to put into evidence as an exhibit the two photographs which were presented to GIO on Tuesday of a man called Rukero (phonetic) and misidentified by her as, she thought, Rwamakuba.  And it may be that my learned friend can explain that.  On the face of it, Your Honour will recall the observations that I offered to the Court about that method of inviting a witness, looking at one photograph 11 years later, to make comment upon it.  And it may be, I know not, that my learned friend, Mr. Hooper, will not be suggesting anything more in due course than that it's very difficult for a witness to identify somebody 11 years later. 

If he's making a positive case that the person in the photograph was actually the person at the hospital and that who is being identified as Rwamakuba was, in fact, that person then those photographs ought to be on the record so that we can have copies of them.  It may be that my learned friend doesn't want us to have copies of them; I know not.  

It's a matter for Your Honour as to whether or not my learned friend might be invited to explain why he doesn't seek to put those photographs in evidence. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, I think that -- that calls for an explanation. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm not producing it as an exhibit at this stage.  I anticipate there may come a time when it will be exhibited. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the future, how would we know whether it was the same photograph which was shown to the witness? 
MR. HOOPER:
I anticipate there will be a way to do that without any difficulty, particularly as we've all seen it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I -- I wouldn't want to be put in the position of being a witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
No, no. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think I can make an order that you must exhibit it.  

Mr. Morley, I don't think I can order the exhibition of the document. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour can't, but Your Honour might order my learned friend to offer the explanation, which 
Your Honour invited a moment ago.  He hasn't actually offered an explanation.  He simply said, "It may go in later."  But he hasn't explained to Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues why he doesn't want it to go in now.  It is a matter for the Court whether or not Mr. Hooper might be, as it were, put on the spot as to explain what his legal reasoning is. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, my principal concern is the Prosecution's meth -- methodology in their treatment of witnesses.  It's my concern.  Despite that reservation, I'll exhibit this particular exhibit as D. 81.  

I'd -- I'd like the assistance of the Chamber when I exhibit this, and I infer no criticism of the Prosecution at all in saying this, that -- that it remains with the registry and not be copied and not shown to any subsequent witness by the Prosecution, until and unless that witness gives evidence. 
MR. MORLEY:
Before the document goes formally into evidence, it may be that Your Honour agrees that once it's in evidence the Prosecution is entitled to a copy of it, and the Court's powers don't extend to refusing the Prosecution access to seeing what this document is.  And my learned friend's hope or invitation to the Court is one which is misfounded within what the Court can properly order.  Once the document is in evidence it's at large and within the rules of what is proper and what is not, it is a document that the Prosecution can have sight of and consider.  So once it's in, it's out, if you follow the logic, Your Honour. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I withdraw that document as an exhibit at this stage and ask that it not be exhibited and can I have it back, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, are you saying that the Court does not have the power to file matters of evidence under confidential cover?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour has that power, but it's confidential within the parties.  It's not confidential from the Prosecution, that is to say, confidential and the Prosecution can't see it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me put it another way:  Does the Prosecution have the right to file matters which the Defence can't see?  
MR. MORLEY:
Not exhibits, no.  During the course of the trial process which is open and inter partes, exhibits filed in the course of the hearing, are exhibits which are available to all the parties.  They may not be available to the public, but they are available to the parties.  

What my learned friend is not in a position to do is to file an ex parte exhibit, which the Prosecution can't see and consider.  So once it goes in -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I -- I won't put it in.  But could I have it filed for identification purposes and treated at this stage as a discreet document.  And would the Prosecution have any motive for opposing that? 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I'm not quite sure what it means to say, "File it for identification purposes as a discreet document."  Once it's filed, we have access to it under whatever heading my learned friend chooses to offer.  Once it's on the record, we have access to it. 
MR. HOOPER:
I take the document back, if there's no other way.  Thank you very much.  

Yes, thank you very much.  

So those are all the GIO exhibits -- sorry, those are all the GIO exhibits at this stage, thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we find it a little bit strange in the context in which this matter developed, that the only interest that the Defence counsel was trying to preserve was that the Prosecution do not show the exhibit to brief its witnesses before they came into the witness box.  And it seemed that you were saying that you were not willing to give that undertaking, that if the document was in evidence, the Prosecutor had the right to use it as it pleased in the preparation.  Because that is -- the only issue being raised -- is this document going to be kept from being shown to Prosecution witnesses in order to brief them before they got into the witness box.  That was what the issue is -- being protected (sic).  And I don't understand why the Prosecutor is not willing to give that undertaking to the Court, because that is the issue that seems to be raised at the moment. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour is right, that is the issue which is being raised.  In terms of the use to which the document might be put once it goes into evidence and is at large, I would defer to my seniors and those who know the procedures here better.  But I've taken the precaution of alerting my learned friend that there may be, I'm not saying there will be, but there may be certain developments arising out of it going into evidence.  I'm not responsible for all the witnesses or for prepping them or briefing them, as 
Your Honour puts it, but it's only right that my learned friend has an opportunity to reflect on the providence of the exhibit, the document, once it becomes an exhibit. 

And as for undertakings by the Prosecution insofar as one might be made, I hope Your Honour understands if I offered the Court the thought that such an undertaking would have to come from a more senior member of the team.  It's not in my hands to make such an undertaking as I do not have responsibility over all of the witnesses.  But as a matter of propriety and courtesy to my learned friend, the providence of the document is unclear once it goes into evidence, and once it goes into evidence, we end up with copies of it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, I thank you for your frank comments, which I appreciate. 
MR. HOOPER:
The -- the only other possibility is to admit it at the present moment as an exhibit, under seal.  The Prosecution can have copies, of course, but they wouldn't be able to show the witnesses, which is our concern, and I'm sure they wouldn't.  

It could remain under seal until such time as the particular concern that we have is -- is passed and I am sure there would be no objection to that. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, the only -- the only difficulty about entering a document under seal is that it is to be not inspected by the public.  It's still a document in the hands of the Prosecution and entering a document under seal, unless I am to be corrected, and would appreciate being corrected, entering a document under seal doesn't mean that it is not a document which cannot be used in the furtherance of the investigations by the Prosecution in the ongoing process of the trial.  It means the public can't see it, but it doesn't mean that the Prosecution can't use it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the order that we have decided to make in this matter is that the registrar is directed to mark the document, to put his mark on the document and to return it to Mr. Hooper. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
We have taken note, My Lord, that is Exhibit 81 D (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not an exhibit.  It's not an exhibit.  It's not being admitted into evidence as an exhibit.  We're inviting you to mark -- to put your mark on the document as an identification feature and to return it to the party. 
MR. HOOPER:
I am sorry to trouble you, can I hand this back because this is how it came back to me and it may, in fact, fulfill the Chamber's idea.  It may need another squiggle or two but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's already 3 o'clock.  Have we completed Witness GIO?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, do you have anything else to add?
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour will be pleased to hear no. 
MR. PRESIDENT.
Thank you. 

Can we come to Alison Des Forges now, please.  Is there a list as well in this, a written list? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, what I propose to do is to -- the registry has a copy of the Defence bundle with the index at the front, which is numbered, and I propose to indicate the documents which are to be exhibited and then they will be then removed from the registry's copy bundle. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have already discussed this with Mr. Webster? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Not -- not that specific technical procedure, but I have discussed the exhibit with Mr. Webster, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any -- any controversy? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, no. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, do you have anything to put into evidence? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I do, three transcripts. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have already discussed that with the -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And there is no controversy? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't believe so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
In addition, I need to just (inaudible) registry to inform me if the Médicins sans Frontières -- there was some newspaper articles that we had discussed during the last session and we -- I'm not sure whether we gave them numbers -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In relation to whose testimony?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
In relation to whose testimony?
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, Dr. Des Forges touched on them, and they were supposed to have been exhibited months ago when Mr. Upendra testified, and I think we neglected to give them numbers at that time.  So it -- we'd just have to go back and double-check to see if three items were actually exhibited from the beginning of the trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if you need to check, perhaps you could do that on another day. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If -- if we have a package that can go in, unless there's agreement on this -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping) I believe the Defence and I are agreed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we have a new registrar. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have a new registrar.  I don't know if he has -- does he have the documents?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not sure, Your Honour.  There are -- I see P numbers for two of them, P. 57 and P. 58.  There's a third, the compilation of witness reports from Médicins sans Frontières -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But do you know where the documents are, physically, at the moment?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I do not. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's why I think we better wait until we have them.  

Yes, Mr. O'Shea, you may proceed. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, thank you.  

So I trust the registry has that bundle in front of them.  So I believe the next number is 81.  

So the first Defence exhibit for Allison Des Forges will be pages 38 to 39 of Alison Des Forges' book, Aucun témoin ne doit survivre, the French version, which is tab 1, so if that could be removed, please. 
If that could be exhibited as Exhibit 81 -- D. 81, sorry.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why is it necessary to add "public"?   
MR. O'SHEA:  
That's what I was told that it's a direction from Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I do not recall the direction.  
MR. O'SHEA:  
I was told by the Registry, just now.  I think we can assume it's public unless otherwise.  

Next is:  Communiqué final publié à l'issue de la rencontre de Bujumbura tenu le... du 25 février au 25 mars 1983 contre les partis politiques MDR, PSD, PDC, PL et FPR du 2 mars 1993,which is found at Tab 8.  If that could please be marked as Defence Exhibit   D. 86.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. O'Shea, this is taking much too long.  I don't think this is all we should use our trial time.  The issues are non-contentious.  Why can't this be done by way of preparation of a document to which both parties have signed and the Registrar can do the management of this.  It is now 3:30 and we have done nothing all this afternoon.  This is purely administrative.  
MR. O'SHEA:   
I apologise, Your Honour.  There are only four items left, but I do apologise.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I had no idea it was going to take this long.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Well, I thought there may be a practical difficulty with Your Honour's suggestion in terms of 
Your Honour's dealing with the exhibits later, but maybe I was --  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
No, no, it is important for the exhibits to be formally exhibited, but it is not contentious?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
This has already been dealt with on the evidence?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, but I do apologise.  
So that was excerpts from Human Rights Watch Africa publication, "Rwanda Talking Peace and Waging War, human rights since October 1990 invasion of 27th February 1992."  If that could be marked as Defence D. 99.  

Next is Dementi.  The last one is Tab 26.  If that could be marked as Exhibit D99.  
MR. KIYEYEU: 
My Lord, I confirm Exhibit No. D. 99.  
(Exhibit No. D. 99 admitted)  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Next is "Dementi" signed by Dr. Jotham Nshimyumukika of the 25th of April 1994 in French, found at Tab 31.  If that could be marked as Defence Exhibit D. 100 please.  Just three more.  Tab 27 is D. 98 and Tab 26 is D. 99.  Does that make things clear?  They were swop round on the index, that's why it sounded like they were three.  So after the human rights report "Dementi" signed by 
Dr. Jotham Nshimyumukika of 25th of April 1994, found at Tab 31.  That's Tab 32.  It's the one before that.  You showed it to me a minute ago.  Yes, that would be 100.  Have you said you marked it?  

Next is expert report by Alison Des Forges prepared for the Butare case of the Ist of June 2001 at 
Tab 32.  That's Tab 31; Tab 31 Dementi signed by Dr. Jotham 25th April 1994 D. 100.  Has that been marked already? 
MR. KIYEYEU:  
My Lord, I confirm Exhibit No. D. 100.
(Exhibit No. D. 100 admitted)

MR. KIYEYEU: 
My Lord, I confirm Exhibit No. D. 101. 
(Exhibit No. D. 101 admitted)  
MR. OSHEA: 
Transcript of Radio Rwanda broadcast of the 11th of April 1994, tab 34.  If that could please be marked as Defence Exhibit D102.  
MR. KIYEYEU:
My Lord, I confirm Exhibit No. D. 102.  
(Exhibit No. D. 102 admitted)  
MR. OSHEA:  
Lastly, MDR section, Benelux, letter to the Belgian minister of national defence of the 14th April 1994, in French, Tab 35.  If that could please be marked as Defence Exhibit D. 103. 
Your Honour, these are all the Defence exhibits for Alison Des Forges, and again, I do apologise for the time it took. 
MR. KIYEYEU:   
My Lord, I confirm Exhibit No. D. 103.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Mr. Webster?
(Exhibit No. D. 103 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:   
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  There are basically three transcripts that I would like to have exhibited.  I would like to begin with the transcript of Sindikubwabo's speech in Gikongoro.  This is a 
Radio Rwanda broadcast of the 19th of April 1994.  Alison Des Forges discussed this at length.  There was some mix up in identifying -- coordinating a transcript to the audio testimony, mislabelling -- in our evidence in it.  Dr. Des Forges clarified that, so I would like to re-exhibit these transcripts.  They may have already came in, but I think, it would be cleaner for the record and easier to locate if we simply give it a new number.  So this would be KO275068 to K0275080.  This is the English text.  I am going to read -- read the K numbers again.  It is necessary to put the K-numbers again because otherwise we will be confused with all the transcripts that are in.  K 0273536 to K 0273553, and that is the same Radio Rwanda broadcast.  Actually, what I've just given is the French.  The other one is the English, but both of these concern a broadcast of the 19th of April for events which took place on the 18th.  I don't know what number we've got to on the Prosecution exhibits?  
MR. KIYEYEU:  
The next number would be P. 262.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
The next set is President Sindukubwabo's speech in Butare of the 19th of April.  This is K-number K0133693 to K0133700, that is the text in English; and K0133683 to
K0133692, and that is the text in French.  And I assume that would be P. 263. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
I'm sorry, My Lord, not P. 263.  The first was P. 62.  This one is P. 63.  Sorry for any inconvenience. (Exhibit No. P. 62 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 63 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:  
And the last set is the transcripts of Jean Kambanda's speech in Butare, which is K0273554 to K00273590, this is the French text.  The English text is K0273592 to K0273623, and I assume this would be P. 64.  

MR. KIYEYEU:
Yes, that would be correct, My Lord.  
(Exhibit No. P. 64 admitted)  
MR. WEBSTER:  
Thank you.  I believe everything else referred to, have already been exhibited.  The only exception are the Medecin Sans Frontiere transcripts or compilation, and we can address that at a later time.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Webster.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Fall, are you ready to resume with your witness?  
MS. FALL:  
Mr. President, I am always ready.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Could you please bring the witness?  
MR. KIYEYEU:  
Yes, My Lord.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  Welcome back to our courtroom.  We are sorry that you had to wait for such a long time to re-commence your testimony.  But we are now ready and the Prosecutor will continue asking you questions.  
THE WITNESS: 
I am ready, Mr. President. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
 BY MS. FALL: 
 Q.      Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.  	This morning when we broke, I was asking you a question regarding the two men about whom you said were hit by the person named as André Rwamakuba and taken afterwards in a red pickup.  I asked you to tell me the ethnic origin of these people and you said that one of them was a Tutsi.  Is that correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So we are going to resume -- we are going to go on from there.  You told us that these people were taken away in a pickup.  Do you know where they were taken to, exactly?  
A.	No, I do not know where they were taken to. 
Q.	You told us that you saw these people when they were being taken away.  Can you describe the state in which they were when they were being taken away? 
A.	These people were in a critical state.  It was obvious that these people were weakened. 
Q.	You told us that when you saw André Rwamakuba, he was in the company of soldiers and Interahamwe.  Could you tell us who these Interahamwe were if you knew them? 
A.	I did not know them. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the word "Interahamwe" meant? 
A.	Normally, Interahamwe was a sort of Hutu organisation which had been created with the objective of killing the Tutsis. 
Q.	Madam Witness, after seeing what happened, what did you do? 
A.	I left the place afterwards.  I did not stay there. 
Q.	Before I try to find out where you went to, I would like to ask you whether there were many victims at the university hospital? 
A.	Many people had gathered there to seek refuge.  Some of them had come from Gikongoro and others from elsewhere.  In short, many people had sought refuge there. 
Q.	If you were asked, will you be able to give us an approximate number of victims? 
A.	No, it is not possible for me to give you an approximate figure in reference to these victims. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether they were refugees from the university hospital? 
A.	They were not people who came only from that area, the people who had sought refuge there had come from different regions.  Some of these people had been wounded -- were wounded by the time they arrived at the hospital.  
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us what their ethnic origin was of the people who were victims of the massacre? 
A.	They were Tutsis. 
Q.	Witness, you have told us on several occasions that Dr. André Rwamakuba had a hatchet with him.  Can you describe this hatchet to us? 
A.	This was a hatchet with a wooden handle at the head, that is the metallic part of the hatchet, looked like a hammer.  That is what I saw. 
Q.	Prior to that day -- prior to this day, have you ever described the shape or the look of this hatchet to other persons? 
A.	Yes, I have described this hatchet to other people.  
MS.  FALL: 
	Mr. President, at this stage, I would like the witness to be shown document Gov 1ALW500873.  This is part of the witness statement.  
MR. KIYEYEU:  
	Is it an exhibit, My Lord?  
MR. HOOPER:  
	I think it is now six actually, Madam Fall, on the top, in the red -- on the bundle number.  My copy is now 8LW6.
MS. FALL: 
	That is possible, quite true.  Thank you, Counsel, for your information.  
MR. KIYEYEU:   
	Do I understand that this is Exhibit P. 6, the document exhibited?  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Ms. Fall, is this the witness's own statement? 
MS. FALL: 
	It is a statement.  That is what I said, Mr. President.  This is the statement of Witness ALW, statement given on the 13th of November 2003.  
MR. KIYEYEU:  
	We are simply asking whether it is an exhibit already, and if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	It has not been exhibited yet, Mr. Registrar.  It is a disclosure made by the Prosecutor.  It is part of the witness bundle.  The Registrar will not have it.  
MS. FALL:  
	I can provide a copy for the Registry.  
BY MS. FALL:   
Q.  	Witness, you have this document before you now, do you?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Can you tell us whether this is indeed the drawing that you made, that is the drawing that accompanied the statement that you made to the investigators? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I shall move on.  
	
	Witness, you have told us that after these events you left the hospital.  When you left the hospital, where did you go? 
A.	I went to ****************. 
Q.	When you were going to this place, were you alone? 
A.	Yes, I was alone. 
Q.	You told us that you were at the hospital looking after a sick aunt.  What happened to your aunt? 
A.	At one point in time, various bourgmestre were asked to collect people who had come from their communes.  That is how the bourgmestre came to get people who had come from our commune and so, my aunt was taken to our commune of origin and I did learn afterwards that she had been killed at the commune office. 
Q.	So you are telling us that your aunt was able to leave the hospital and that she was killed at the commune office, is that correct?  
A.	It is the Huye commune office.  That is where she was killed. 
Q.	When you went to ************ to seek refuge, how long did you stay there? 
A.	I stayed there for a long time. 
Q.	Can you give us an approximate length of time? 
A.	About two months. 
Q.	All right.  About two months.  So if we go by the dates that you gave us, can you tell us at what precise time you left the hospital, either the period or the exact date, if you are able? 
A.	I left the hospital in May.  However, I am unable to remember the date on which I left the hospital. 
Q.	Witness, apart from the event that you have just narrated to us, did you have to see the person named André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I never saw him again.  
Q.	Witness, apart from the fact that you were told that this person was called André Rwamakuba, did you have any knowledge of the position that he occupied? 
A.	I heard this name when the government was formed.  I heard it on the radio.  It was said that he was Minister of Education. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you said at the outset that when you were told it was André Rwamakuba, you were also told that it was all over because he used to come regularly to hold meetings with the view of -- with the aim of exterminating Tutsis.  I would like to ask, did you personally see André Rwamakuba attending such meetings? 
A.	Yes, I was informed of them. 
Q.	Were you nearly informed or did you see André Rwamakuba attend or organise these meetings? 
A.	These meetings were often held at the faculty of medicine which was below the hospital.  And when he left the venue of the meeting, he would find us where we had taken up abode or where we were.  That is how I saw this man. 
Q.	Madam Witness, when I put a question to you regarding your testimony in Rwanda, your prior testimony in Rwanda, you said that you had given testimony against Dr. Gatera.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us why you gave testimony against Dr. Gatera?  
A.	I gave testimony against Gatera because on several occasions I saw him involved in the massacres targeting the Tutsis that took place at the hospital. 
Q.	Madam Witness, so when you gave testimony against Dr. Gatera regarding the events that occurred at the university hospital, did you or did you not mention the name of André Rwamakuba?  
A.  	I did not mention André Rwamakuba's name when I gave testimony in that trial. 
Q.	Madam Witness, when you gave testimony here earlier, you described some events and you referred both to Dr. André Rwamakuba and Dr. Gatera.  Why then at the time you were giving testimony before, did you not mention Dr. André Rwamakuba?  
A.	I named Dr. Gatera because questions were put to me about him.  But when I was giving testimony about Gatera in Rwanda, nobody asked me any questions regarding the person named 
	André Rwamakuba.  
Q.	Sometime ago, I put a question to you regarding the number of victims.  You were unable to give me a figure, but are you able to tell us whether there were people you knew among the victims in the hospital.  I am going to ask you to write down the names of the victims on a piece of paper with the assistance of the Registrar, if they would be so kind to give the Witness a piece of paper on which she can write the names. 
(Pages 48 to 58 by Sheriffo Jammeh)






























1600H 
THE WITNESS:
I have finished.  
MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, does the list you have just given us contain the names of people who were victims of the massacres at the Butare University Hospital? 
A.	Yes.  The names I have put are people, some of whom were killed at the hospital.  
Q.	Are there any of your relatives on that list? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what was the ethnic origin of the people whose names appear on the list?
A.	These people were Tutsi. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Witness.  

	Mr. President, for the time being, I have no further questions for this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Counsel.  

	Mr. Hooper -- 

	Madam Witness, under the rules of procedure, which control the way trials are conducted here, the lawyer representing the accused person now has an opportunity to ask you questions.  So you will have to answer the questions that he puts to you.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:  
	Yes, I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

	Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we'll probably take a short recess at about 4:30. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Very well.  May I indicate that I do have some questions that should be asked in closed session, but perhaps I can postpone those until immediately after the adjournment at 4:30.

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  My name's David Hooper -- 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Good afternoon.  

	My name's David Hooper, and I'm an English barrister, which is why I'm dressed in this particularly odd way.  And I'm asking you questions this afternoon on behalf of a man called Dr. André Rwamakuba, whose name you've mentioned -- or, a name that you've mentioned in the course of your evidence.  

	Now, I want to start, if I may, not at the beginning of your story -- of your history but at the end of it, about the time when you came to leave the hospital.  And as I understand it, approximately -- excuse me -- on the 27th of April, you witnessed the attack on those two men, one of whom was a blood relation of yours.  And adding the dates together, it's about the 27th of April that occurs.  And I'll come back to that incident in due course.  

	But at the moment, I want you to help me as to this:  At that stage, where were you staying in the hospital?  Was it in the tents?  
A.	No, I was not within the tents; rather, I was outside the tents. 
Q.	Can you help me as to which area of the hospital -- well, let me put it like this:  Between the 27th, I'll use that date as an approximate date, after the incident with the two men until the time that you came to leave the hospital, which is an uncertain date in your mind, I quite accept that, in May, were you staying in one place or were you staying in more than one place at the hospital?  
A.	First of all, there was the surgery department where I was -- where that person was being kept, and then there was another place where we were -- where the refugees were staying.  
Q.	All right.  Well, as I understand it from your evidence, you'd left the surgery department after the incident when the doctors came and attacked the patients.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Are you asking me when we left the surgery department?  I did not quite understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	I'm sorry.  It was my fault.  I've heard your evidence, so at the moment you needn't repeat it.  But you and your aunt left the ward where she had been in bed and you went to an area where other refugees were; is that right? 
A.	Yes, it happened like that.  
Q.	And you know this place well, don't you, this hospital? You know it well; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	So where you went at that point with your aunt where the other refugees were, was that at the -- the place where the avocado trees are? 
A.	That is indeed the place where we went.  
Q.	And is that the vast area that lies between the paediatrics building, the surgery building, and the administration or archives building, that square of grass and trees that lies there in front of surgery and paediatrics?  Is that -- is that where you went?  
A.	It is in the area between the operation rooms and the RES and where the internal medicine offices were.  
Q.	All right.  Well, let me deal with it like this -- 

	Let me show you a plan.  It's a plan we all have of Butare University Hospital at page 47 of the bundle, and this is exactly the same as we've all got except it's got three or four or five of the units or places named in -- written in Kinyarwanda rather than the English that appears on the map.  

	All right.  Now, looking at that map -- don't be embarrassed if you find it difficult to follow.  You say so.  Some people are good at plans and some people are not.  
	
	But can you see, looking at it the top of the page, it says "maternity"?  Can you see that? 
A.	Yes, I see the place. 
Q.	And that's the -- if I can call it, the back of the hospital going towards where the IRST building is.  Now, if you go down the page from maternity right towards the bottom, you'll see the figure "1" in a small box.  And just below that there's parking; when in Kinyarwanda, "parikingi," I think.  It isn't too difficult for us.  Do you see that at the bottom of the page?  Right.  

	And that's the front of the hospital, so I don't know if you can help -- if you can follow the plan now, but imagine you've arrived at the front of the hospital, you're in the parking area, and you walk towards the hospital entrance.  And there's reception and the administration, and then you enter the corridor which takes you past archives, and then you come out into sort of daylight again, having gone through an enclosed corridor.  Your -- you've then got the nice green area, the big square area on the left with the big avocado trees.  

	And that first area -- and they've drawn little pictures of trees on the plan.  You can see rather more trees drawn than perhaps are there, but never mind.  There's the -- there's the avocado tree area, which is really an open space of grass, as it is now.  We can see, in fact, "surgery" halfway down that area, the word "surgery."  
	
	Now, am I right, Madam Witness, in saying that when you left the ward that you had been with your aunt, on or about the 24th or 25th of April that would be, you -- you went to this area, which I'm going to call the avocado tree area?  Am I right in saying that? 
A.	That is where we headed. 
Q.	And is that where you and your aunt stayed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you manage to get inside a tent or did you and your aunt have to stay outside and not in a tent? 
A.	There was not enough space inside the tents.  Some people were inside the tents, and others stayed outside in the open air. 
Q.	And you stayed out there in the open air by day and by night; is that right? 
A.	Correct.  However, since my aunt was seriously ill and had sustained head injuries, from time to time she would enter a tent to rest for a while.  
Q.	Yes, I see.  And you'd been out there for a couple of days or so when you saw the incident with the two men, one of whom is your blood relative, you tell us were struck by Dr. Rwamakuba and taken away; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And can I just ask you this, while we're on -- on the subject and you've got the plan in front of you and you're obviously following it:  On the plan where was it that the men -- where were they when they were attacked by Dr. Rwamakuba, on the plan?  Would you like to mark it perhaps with an -- with a cross first so that we can all see, because it's difficult otherwise to understand.  

	If you've got a pen or pencil there, could you put a cross where those two men were when they were attacked by Rwamakuba.  
A.	I will first mark the place where I was.  And then I was in this area -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness marks the place on the sketch.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  Now, just before we get the paper back, have you marked where the men were?  

	Well, let me -- let me see it perhaps at the moment, and then we can -- oh, you've done both marks, have you?  I'm sorry.  

	So you've drawn yourself as a little -- little blob there.  All right.  Do you want to just mark now with an X or two Xs, if you like, so that -- where -- where the two men were when they were attacked by Rwamakuba, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
Okay.  Thanks.  Does that screen work?  Can we put it on the screen down there so that we can all see it?  

	Because I may be using that -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
We may be using that screen a little more this afternoon, so we'll see if it works.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Does it make it -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
(Inaudible)
I'm sorry.  Does it not come onto our screens?  

	Booth?  Answer none.  I think that's the general idea, isn't it, Mr. Issa?  It can be fed into the monitors?

	Yes.  Perhaps we can work that out during the break.  I'm sorry.  I thought it was going to be simpler than that.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would you put a blob by the bigger tree, as it were, and two crosses toward the surgery so we'll see that clearer.  

	While we're dealing with this, Madam Witness, let me just move on.  We'll have the opportunity of looking at that in a moment.  But when you -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, here we are.  It's come up.  And, Mr. Issa, if you can just point out down there, first of all, the mark that she's made on here as to where she was and then where the two men who attacked were.  Thank you.
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	So, first of all there's the blob -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	First of all, there's the blob, and then to its right, the two crosses representing where the two men -- where the two men were.  All right.  
MR. HOOPER:  
	Thank you very much.  I don't know if that needs to be passed around further.  If you can have the plan back. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What did you do after you saw that attack on those two men, Madam Witness?  What did you do after that? 
A.	I was afraid following the various events I had witnessed and which were taking place in that place.  
Q.	I think we can understand that.  So what did you do?  Did you go anywhere?  Did you stay in the tented area?  What did you -- what do you remember doing?  
A.	I stayed put. 
Q.	Was your -- was your auntie still there? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Had she seen this too?  
A.	I believe she did witness this because it happened in broad daylight. 
Q.	And having happened in broad daylight, the rest of the day you spent there, you spent the night there, and then you spent, as I understand it -- we're dealing with the 27th of April or thereabouts, of 1994.  How many weeks did you stay, days or weeks or whatever?  How long did you stay at the hospital after that?  

	Well, let me break it down.  How long were you there before the bourgmestre came to effectively take your auntie away?  How long had you been there after that incident with the two men?  How long after that was it?  
A.	I do not remember.  
Q.	Well, approximately.  Was it one day or two days, one week or two weeks, a month?  How long was it before they took your auntie away? 
A.	I cannot give the number of days that had gone by.  All I know is that I left the hospital in the month of May.  However, I'm not in a position to tell you how many days passed after the incident with the two men.  
Q.	Well, I'm not asking you when you left just at the moment, I'm asking you when you were separated from your -- your auntie.  How many days was that after this incident with the two men?  
A.	My aunt at the time she was taken away, by that time I was no longer at the hospital.  
Q.	So by the time your auntie was taken away from the hospital, you had already left the hospital; is that right? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I had already left the hospital.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 4:30, Mr. Hooper.  I don't know if it is a convenient time.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short recess now and resume in 10 or 15 minutes' time. 
	(Court recessed at 1635H) 
	(Pages 59 to 65 by Ann Burum)


































(Court resumed at 1652H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can now resume our session.  

Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, I understand what had happened was you left your aunt in the hospital and left the hospital; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So when you told us that at one point in time various bourgmestre were asked to come from your commune and your aunt was taken to your commune, that's not something that you witnessed yourself; is that right? 
A.	I was not an eyewitness to this event. 
Q.	And when you left your aunt, was there anyone to look after her? 
A.	As there were no alternatives and we risked being killed, I thought it wise to leave the hospital to seek safety elsewhere. 
Q.	And you had to leave your aunt there, obviously, to do that.  It's not a criticism.  That must have been very difficult for you; is that right? 
A.	That is how it happened, but she stayed back with other people. 
Q.	How old was your aunt?  Can you tell us that? 
A.	I do not remember her age, but I think she was about 30. 
Q.	So, I'll come back to this particular document later, but I am looking at the statement you made on the 5th of May that you have referred to already in the Gatera case.  Now I will just read you at this point one of your answers.  The question you were put here was, "How were you an eyewitness to these events?"  And you say, "I was an eyewitness while I was at the hospital by the side of my aunt on my mother's side." Just pausing there.  Was she your aunt on your mother's side?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to know what document Mr. Hooper is referring to in putting the question to the witness.  Is this a document that is officially recognised?  Is it a Prosecution document?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, it's come to my hand from the Prosecution.  It's the AL (sic) translation in English of ALW 19 - 19, 20 and 21.  I am reading from that.  I am reading from an English translation of that.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Counsel.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So let me start again.  How were you an eyewitness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just as an aid for easy proceeding, it may be useful if you identify the documents as a matter of course.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I am sorry, I omitted to do that.  I am not going to refer to the whole document at this stage.  I'll come back to it and deal with it more fully, but it's the document -- the document I have is ALW -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's already been identified, but I am just saying that in future to avoid time wasting. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Certainly. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And, "How were you an eyewitness to these events?"  And your answer was, "I was an eyewitness while I was at the hospital by the side of my aunt on my mother's side." And I think my question was, was this aunty, indeed, an aunt from your mother's side?  
A.	Yes, it is an aunt on my mother's side. 
Q.	Then it continues with her name, which I won't mention in public.  So, "By the side of my aunt on my mother's side who had been wounded in the head with a machete."  Is that how she received her injury? 
A.	Yes, that is when I saw André. 
Q.	I don't think that was my question, or wasn't an answer that quite -- let me put the question again.  I am reading an answer you gave on a previous occasion in the Gatera case where you said that your aunt had been wounded in the head with a machete.  Is that how she received the injury to her head that you told us about, before she got to the hospital?  Was it because she was hit with a machete? 
A.	We went to the hospital after she had been wounded, just as I had been.  That is how we went to the hospital. 
Q.	My question is, is it correct that she had been wounded with a machete? 
A.	No, I didn't mention a machete. 
Q.	Well, I am reading -- well, whether you mentioned it or not, did you say, as I am reading here from one of your answers, "She had been wounded in the head with a machete?" 
A.	I said that she had been wounded on various parts of her body with sharp objects.  I did not refer to a machete. 
Q.	Well, we will come back to the -- did she have an injury to her head, a serious injury to her head? 
A.	She had more than one wound.  All over her head she had wounds.  She had been wounded with sharp objects. 
Q.	Well, what sort of sharp objects? 
A.	Several objects were used.  I do not know with what she was wounded.  I was wounded myself.  The assailants were aimed -- armed, sorry, with clubs, spears and machete, several sharp objects. 
Q.	Well, all right.  Well, it's really the next sentence that I want to ask you about. This is your -- the records of the -- signed by you, I understand, on the 5th of May 1998 when you made your statement in the Gatera case, and you say, "I left the hospital after she was killed at the end of the month of May."   Now, first of all, did you leave the hospital after she was killed? 
A.	I left the hospital before she was killed. 
Q.	And, secondly, is it right, as you appear to have stated here, that you left the hospital at the end of the month of May? 
A.	All I know is that it was in May, but I do not remember the exact time of that month. 
Q.	Well, did you spend, after those two men were killed -- and you had been pretty good on dates and intervals up until that point -- did you remain at the hospital for two or three days or for three weeks?  Can you help us?  
A.	I do not remember how many days I spent there, but I stayed there for quite a while. 
Q.	Well, can you perhaps just help me a bit better than that?  Would it perhaps have been as long as towards the end of May?  That would be for perhaps three or four weeks.  
A.	I think it was several weeks. 
Q.	Right.  Several weeks still at the hospital.  And, presumably, in those several weeks, you were looking after your aunty.  Would that be right? 
A.	I was with her every day.  All the days that I spent in the hospital I was with her.  I was looking after her. 
Q.	Right.  And after you had been, effectively, I suppose, chased out of surgery or left through fear out of the ward, you were staying in that area that you marked "the avocado trees." Is that right? 
A.	Yes, the pear trees, the avocado trees. 
Q.	And there were tents there, not sufficient numbers of tents for all the people who were there; is that right? 
A.	You are right. 
Q.	And were these plastic tents -- the plastic, the sheeting we've been -- we've heard about, was this plastic sheeting, these tents, what were the tents made of?  Can you remember? 
A.	They were plastic tents. 
Q.	It's a long time ago and you were very young or quite young then, can you remember what colour they were, what colour the sheeting was? 
A.	It's a long time ago.  I no longer remember what colour these tents were. 
Q.	Do you know if those tents were destroyed or taken down at all, or were they still there when you left? 
A.	I left the place when the tents were still standing at that place. 
Q.	I know it's a long time ago, but I am looking again at your statement. You say, you see of the 5th of May which I will come back to later, which you gave and signed as correct before the Gatera court.  And you were asked this question, "Were you an eyewitness to the dismantlement of the plastic tents?" And you said, "On my arrival coming from" -- and you named the place where you came from -- "They had already been dismantled."  
So you're saying there that the tents had been taken down by the time you arrived with your aunty.  Why did you say that? 
A.	I did not make any such statement. 
Q.	Are you sure you were at the hospital? 
A.	Are you talking about the time when the tents were dismantled or the time before they were dismantled?  
Q.	Were you ever, in fact, at the hospital?  Did you really go there? 
A.	I said that I got there when I was wounded in the company of my maternal aunt; we were going to seek treatment. 
Q.	Now, I want to go back all that time.  It's a long time, and I am quite sure that you had terrible experiences at that time, whatever; quite sure.  In fact, you lost your family, didn't you?  I think your family was killed in the genocide; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And we can see -- I don't need to refer to your age, we can see how old you were.  You were not quite 20 then.  You were post-primary school, is that right?  Your education at that time, that you had completed primary school; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you -- were you still at school or were you -- were you, in fact, at a training school?  You don't have to name what it was.  We have reference to it in our papers.  Is that right?  Is that right, were you at a training school? 
A.	At the time I was in a vocational school. 
Q.	And what were you training to do there? 
A.	I was learning embroidery, sewing, cooking and typewriting. 
Q.	Now, where you work at present -- I don't want you to say out loud where you work, all right, because that is private and secret -- but how long have you been -- when did you start working,  working there? 
A.	I began to work there on the 1st of December 1996. 
Q.	All right.  Now, you told us you gave evidence in the case of Gatera, you provided a statement there, and you appeared before the Court and gave evidence; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that was back in 1998.  I think it was in May of 1998.  Does that sound right to you? 
A.	I don't quite remember. 
Q.	Well, I don't think anyone will hold that against you.  You also said you appeared in another case called -- sorry, you appeared in another cased called Sekeromba, I think the name was, which you kindly spelt out for us.  What had Sekeromba done that caused -- led to you giving evidence?  Can you help us as to that? 
A.	He was charged with stealing cows. 
Q.	And have you appeared in any Gacaca hearings at all? 
A.	I have taken part in Gacaca hearings, but no one has asked me to make a statement, any statement whatsoever.  But during the Gacaca sessions, I could put questions to people who had been called to appear. 
Q.	Thank you.   Now, I am going to pass you a list, and it's got the names of nine people on it.  And what I am going to ask you to do is look at the list and tell me what you know about it.  Now, before I come to that, can I just ask you this:  You met, obviously, Ms. Fall before giving your evidence and discussed your evidence with her.  Is that correct, is it? 
A.	Yes, we discussed my testimony. 
Q.	And were you shown a list of names and asked about them? 
A.	She did not show me the list. 
Q.	And how many times did you meet Madam Fall? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	Did you meet anybody else from the Prosecution to discuss your case with them?  To discuss, I am sorry, your evidence with them? 
A.	No one. 
Q.	So with Madam Fall, you can't remember how many times you've met her.  You've discussed your case with her.  Would I be right in saying that that was over several hours that you discussed your evidence with her? 
A.	It would be wrong to say that. 
Q.	Can I ask you how long you spent with Madam Fall discussing your evidence? 
A.	I am not in a position to estimate the number of minutes that we spent together. 
Q.	I suggest it was longer than a couple of minutes.  Longer than just minutes, wasn't it? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Well, here's a list anyway.  So I want you to look at that and I am going to ask you to help me, in terms of each person, whether you know them, how long for, and things like that.  And by the way, don't feel there is anything wrong in talking about your case with the Prosecution, because that's how things happen here.  You are allowed to do that, so don't feel you have done something wrong in saying that.  

And this is a list that we are all familiar with, and in respect to which I hope there is a more informed list, as it were, available.  Now, against the names, you can see that there are numbers, and by referring to numbers we can keep this session in open session as far as we can, I hope.  But I am going to ask you going down the list what you know about each person, if anything.  So let's start with number 1 and we will bear in mind you were in the hospital there from the 21st of April to well into May, from your evidence.  Now, number 1, do you know that person? 
A.	I do not.  I do not know this person. 
Q.	She's a Tutsi.  She was about your age almost, bit younger in 1994.  She's a survivor **********************.  Do you know her? 
A.	I do not know this person. 
Q.	Number 3 on the list; do you know that person? 
A.	Yes, I know this person.

1730H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you know that person during the genocide? 
A.	No. 
Q.	She was at the hospital on 20th of April through into May.  You didn't see her there; is that right? 
A.	I did not see this person during the genocide. 
Q.	But you've come to know her since; would that be the position?  Just say yes or no, please.  
A.	I got to know her afterwards.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Number -- number 5, do you know that person? 
A.	I do not know that person.
Q.	Allegedly there between the 23rd and the 26th of April while you were there, but you don't know that person, a person **************************************************************************************************, you tell us, almost as long.  I'll ask you again, this other lady, Tutsi survivor, do you know her?  
A.	Are you referring to the person whose name appears next to number 5?  
Q.	Yes, that's where I'm -- where we're talking.  
A.	I do not know that person. 
Q.	Let's move down, then, to number 6.  Do you know that person? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you know her or see her, should I say, at the hospital during the genocide? 
A.	I haven't known that person for a long time. 
Q.	And so it would follow that you met that person since the genocide, and as you've said, you haven't known her for a long time.  

So let me move, then, to number 7.  Do you know that person? 
A.	I don't know that person. 
Q.	She's almost -- almost your age, just a year or two older, and allegedly at the hospital from the 21st, the same day that you say you arrived at the hospital, until mid -- mid-May or early May, Tutsi, a survivor, ***************************.  Do you know her? 
A.	No, I don't know that person. 
Q.	Number 8, do you -- 
A.	I don't know number 8 either. 
Q.	Didn't see that person at the hospital during the several weeks that you were there; is that right? 
A.	I've never seen this person. 
Q.	Number 9, the last name, which is handwritten and which was the name that was written on a piece of paper yesterday and is otherwise known, I think, as RO, do you know that person? 
A.	I also only just got to know this person. 
Q.	How long have you known that person? 
A.	About a month. 
Q.	So you've only known her -- where are we now?  I've forgotten.  We're in August, aren't we?  So you met her in what, June or July; is that right?  Don't tell us where you met her or anything like that, but you met her -- 
A.	I knew this person in July. 
Q.	So what, you met -- you met her in July.  If you've known her a month, well, that would be right.  If you've known her a month, you met her in July.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness has just called a name in giving her answer. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, thank you for your caution, Madam Interpreter.  We are not mentioning the name out loud.  We have it written at number 9.  I hope there's no doubt in anyone's minds who that -- what that name is there.  It's otherwise coded as RO for the transcript.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now -- now, Madam Witness, you're here, as you know, to help not me, but to help the Judges in this very serious matter.  And you've just given an answer that you've known that person for a month, and you've given answers about not knowing other ************************************************************** for many years; you don't know them.  

Now, I'm looking now at a document ALW3.  And I'm not going to ask you to look at it, but we all have it.  And it's the second page of your statement document to the ICTR, this body here.  And you are asked at paragraph 15 the name and address of a friend or relative who might help to locate you if you change your address, and the name you give is the name that appears at number 9 on the list in front of you, the person you claim to have known for a month.  And she's described as *********************************************, and then it has the word "relation", relationship to you.  And what it says is "**********  and friend."  And that statement was made in November 2003.  Now, do you want to tell the Judges the truth, or are you going to maintain you only know her -- have known her for a month, since July?  What's it going to be?  
A.	I do not understand.  I believe I gave my telephone number, my home telephone number.  I do not understand at all.  
Q.	Well, I can go into closed session and ask you about details on here which are obviously specific details to you.  I'm looking, for example, at your nickname which is given here.  Like nicknames are, it's often -- it's a bit of the opposite of what one is, perhaps.  Date of birth.  It's got your occupation in '94, your current occupation, your address and everything else, the name of your late mother and father, your marital status.  You're married and have children and nice to see that; you've got quite a few.  And then it has this detail.  And then I'll pass up just the page so you can just see what we're looking at so it's not so much of a mystery to you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
If it can be passed.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	It's a bit marked, but you'll see what I'm looking at.  And you can tell where I've marked things because it's in a blue ink and not in a black ink.  
MR. HOOPER:
So I think everyone knows what's going up there.  It's just the first two pages of the statement.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you see what I'm saying.  There you are.  It's not in your language.  I'm sorry it's not in your language, but it's all written there and it's plain from the front of it, and you've discussed it with     Madam Fall already that you can't quite remember, but you assume it was read to you, you told us, because you wouldn't have agreed things and signed things, and you even see your signature there immediately below the name of that person who you say you've only known a month.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I did not quite follow Mr. Hooper's statement.  When he said that there was a discussion with Madam Fall, I did not quite understand.  Could he clarify?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I was referring to your questions or to the Prosecution's questions earlier that she gave a statement on the occasion to the ICTR, "My memory is not very clear.  I think it was 2003 I signed the statement.  I can't remember if it was read to me before signing.  Did you have the opportunity to correct it?  Yes, I did." 

There may have been other things said, but that's my note.  My recollection was that I thought she'd said she thought she had, that it had probably been read to her, but I may be mistaken on that I can see, but opportunity to correct it.  

If I can please have those two pages back 'cause they're the only ones I've got.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	A couple of weeks ago, did you go to Kigali? 
A.	Yes, I went to Kigali. 
Q.	Did you attend a press conference that was being held on behalf of the United Nations in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, I attended the conference. 
Q.	Have you and I ever met before or seen one another before today? 
A.	I saw you at the university hospital. 
Q.	And can you remember what I was doing? 
A.	You were taking photographs. 
Q.	What of, do you know? 
A.	You had a camera and you were filming or taking photographs of places about which you have asked me questions today. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President.  Mr. President, I would just like to draw the Chamber's attention to the fact that we are in cross-examination.  Mr. Hooper is asking a number of questions, and it is certain that in my re-examination I shall have to delve into these questions.  I would just like to draw attention to that.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When you saw me going round Butare hospital taking photographs, can you remember what time of day that was? 
A.	It was in the morning, in the morning. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And can you remember, was I alone or was I with anybody? 
A.	You were with another white woman. 
Q.	Was I with anybody from the hospital? 
A.	Yes, you were with someone from the hospital. 
Q.	And who was that? 
A.	You were with one Nyirimihigo. 
Q.	And who is he? 
A.	He was deputy director of the hospital, but I do not know if he is still in that position to date. 
Q.	Has he changed his job? 
A.	As a matter of fact, there was a director, his deputy, and -- for the nursing section.  But presently -- or currently there is a change in the structure, and other departments were added on in the meantime. 
Q.	Let's not dwell on that, but let me ask you this:  Would it be right to say that that was a Monday towards the end of July that you saw -- that you saw me? 
A.	All I remember is that it was a Monday, the 25th -- around the 25th.  
Q.	Let me just -- yeah, bang on, it was a Monday and it was the 25th of July.  Did you go to Kigali the next day? 
A.	No.  I went to Kigali on a Wednesday.  I'm not certain, but I went to Kigali just a few days after your arrival in Butare. 
Q.	And who did you travel with?  Who went with you? 
A.	I was with number 6 and number 9. 
Q.	Now, at the meeting you went to, did you say anything? 
A.	Yes, I took the floor during the meeting. 
Q.	And what did you say? 
A.	I mentioned issues relating to my safety and problems I had faced prior to that date. 
Q.	And what did you say? 
A.	I spoke about my situation and the problems I had faced after leaving Arusha and that I did not intend to come back here. 
Q.	I take it that was a reference to having been here on a previous occasion, perhaps a month ago, to give evidence, but, in fact, you weren't reached and you then returned to Rwanda.  Would that be correct? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, I encountered these problems because I came here to Arusha to testify.  Following my arrival in Arusha, I encountered those problems, and that is what I said. 
Q.	I understand there is an inquiry in respect of that, so I'm not going to go into it further.  

What I want to ask you is this:  You've told us who you went down with, but who took you there?  
A.	We went of our own initiative -- on our own initiative. 
Q.	And how did you go down there?  Did you go in a car or on the bus? 
A.	We took a taxi. 
Q.	A taxi?  Two and a half hours or three hours and then two and a half or three hours back?  Did you stay in Kigali the night, or did you come back the same day? 
A.	We went and came back the same day. 
Q.	And aside from you and the other two people and the taxi driver, was there anybody else who went with you? 
A.	No, no one else was with us.  Are you referring to our arrival at the ICTR or on the way back to our home?  
Q.	No.  You went there and did you know about this meeting?  Did you know it was going to take place? 
A.	We wanted to go to the ICTR to tell them about our safety, and when we found a meeting in progress, we then had an opportunity to gain access to and take part in the meeting. 
Q.	Now, where you work, what is the nature of the -- the job that you do?  Don't tell us where you work, but what's the nature of the job you do? 
A.	**************, rather. 
Q.	And what do your duties involve? 
A.	I am attached to the department, and I'm at the service of the (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal), so if they need anything, they can send me to fetch it. 
Q.	So how long do you say you've known number 9 on the list? 
A.	I told you I have known that person for a month.  In fact, I was afraid many questions would be put to me on number 9.  However, I must say ****************** number 9. 
Q.	And doing the same job, is that right? 
A.	No, ************. 
Q.	Doing the same job, though, the same kind of work? 
A.	*************. 
Q.	And number 6, same job.  Number 7, same job.  
A.	I do not know number 7.  As for 6, she does not do the same job as mine. 
Q.	*************? 
A.	I told you that we do not do the same job.  But as to number 7, I do not know this person.  
Q.	All right.  Let's get back on to what matters really.  You -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, it's 6:00.  I don't know if this is a convenient time. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's nothing very mysterious, but it was drawn to my attention that at 1755 the mention of (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) may lead to identification of the workplace, so I order its redaction.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar. 

Have you reached a convenient time, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take the adjournment now.  

Madam Witness, we are going to take the adjournment and resume your testimony tomorrow morning.  As I had told you at lunchtime, during this or any adjournment, you still remain a witness in the Tribunal and you are not to discuss the case with anybody.  You understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Well, we adjourn now and resume at -- tomorrow morning at 8:45.  
(Court adjourned at 1802H)
