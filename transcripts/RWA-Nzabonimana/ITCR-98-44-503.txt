MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in an open session today, Wednesday, the 22nd of September 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of 
the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Madam Witness.   
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We had previously made an order for your protection to permit you to testify under circumstances where your identity would not be revealed to the public, but we have since seen an affidavit that you have filed in which you have indicated that such an order is no longer necessary and that you are willing to testify as an unprotected witness.  Is that the position?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In those circumstances then we rescind the protective order which we had made in your favour to allow you to testify openly.  

The registrar will now draw the curtains to facilitate that. 

Now that that has been done, the registrar will now assist you to take the oath to tell the truth that must precede your testimony.
(Declaration made by Bénédicte van Cutsem in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, good morning.  Good morning to all parties and to all those who are in the courtroom. 
BÉNÉDICTE VAN CUTSEM, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Now, Witness, before we proceed with your examination, I would like to remind you of a few rules pertaining to our proceedings.  

Both of us are French speaking.  This might be a privilege or a handicap.  My questions and your answers will be interpreted into English by the interpreters and recorded by the court reporters in the courtroom.  Now, we need to facilitate things for the interpreters and the court reporters so that they can do their work properly.  So please speak slowly, observe a pause after my questions so that I may complete the questions properly before you start answering.  

I also urge you to kindly spell out any proper nouns that may be used in your testimony.  Some of the nouns are well known; others are not well known; and for these reasons I will request that you spell out the proper names that you will be using so that the record may reflect the correct names. 

To begin with, Witness, would you tell the Court your name and your first name.  
A.	My name is Bénédicte van Cutsem.  That name appears on the personal identification sheet, and Kayibanda also appears on that sheet. 
Q.	So your full names would be -- or would include the name on the fourth line, that is, the name of your father; is that correct?  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Well, I have been reminded by the interpreters that I must apply my own rules and observe a pause.  

MR. WEYL:
I am sorry for not having done so.  
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.      Now, madam, would you please tell us your date of birth.  
A.	28 June 1963. 
Q.	Please give us your address without providing all the details.  Where do you live today? 
A.	I live in Belgium. 
Q.	Witness, please take a look at the personal identification sheet before you bearing your particulars, and make sure that there are no mistakes thereon.  Date that document 22 September 2010 -- that is the date of today -- and please kindly sign it.  
A.	The witness personal identification sheet has a mistake on my name.  My name is van Cutsem and not Kayibanda. 
Q.	Would you kindly make that correction and mention against Kayibanda that Kayibanda is your spouse's name.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would apply for this document to be admitted into evidence D. NG122.  

If that is correct, Mr. Issa. 
MR. MJUI:
Yes.  Counsel is correct.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.
(Exhibit No. D. NG122 admitted) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, would you kindly tell the Court, as briefly as possible but as meaningfully as possible also, what your professional and educational backgrounds are, just some highlights that will enable the Court to understand the witness sitting before them.  So please tell the Court what your professional and academic backgrounds are.  
A.	I trained in several areas, but primarily, I am a nurse.  I hold a master's in public health, in medical, social and hospital sciences.  I also hold a licence in economic and social policies.  And as a professional I worked, first of all, as a nurse in Belgium.  

Then in '92 to '94 I went to Rwanda to train at the École supérieure des techniques modernes.  Then in '94 I returned to Belgium where I worked as a nurse and then as a civil servant at the federal level.  And today I work in the accidents prevention and statistics unit.  

I could also add that from 1992 -- or, rather, from '82 to '92 I went to Rwanda frequently to work in rural health centres in the north of Kibuye préfecture. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you confirm to the Court that your relations with Rwanda are long-standing and going back as 1982.  Can you tell the Court also how it happened that you settled more or less permanently in Rwanda.  
A.	I went to Rwanda for the first time in 1982 under the Scouts movement, and I went there frequently until 1990 to work at a health centre.  From December 1990 to February 1991, I went to Rwanda to gather data for my thesis at -- on the medical, social services dissertation that I was preparing at the time. 

Then I went back to settle in Rwanda on the 26th of March 1992.  Then I left Rwanda on the 9th of April 1994.  Then I went back again to Rwanda at the end of 1993, and then I went back also in 1995 to lecture at the University of Rwanda. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can we focus on the period running from the 26th of March 1992, Witness.  On that date you arrived in Rwanda.  Where did you settle on that date, and how did you engage in your professional activities?  Could you tell us in broad strokes how you settled in Rwanda from the 26th of March 1992.  
A.	I arrived in Rwanda on the 26th of March 1992 to be a lecturer at the National University of Rwanda.  I settled in Buye secteur in Butare, and it is in that secteur that most of the lecturers and senior staff of the university were resident.  I worked at that time as a lecturer and on behalf of the co-operation unit for Rwanda and the Belgian technical assistance unit. 

I had been assigned by two communes from Brussels which had been twinned with two communes in Rwanda, and I became the liaison or the interface between those communes to facilitate communications.  So these were two communes -- Ganshoren and Rusatira -- that were twins --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
And another commune which the witness is going to mention because the interpreters missed it.  Could you please slow down?  
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	But it would seem that the interpreters are asking that you slow down.  
A.	Let me spell out the names of the communes.  Musambira, M-U-S-A-M-B-I-R-A.  Should I spell the Belgian communes as well?  
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	W-O-L-U-W-L-I-S-A -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, witness would need to slow down even further for the benefit of the interpreters.  We can't keep up with her. 
THE WITNESS:
W-O-L-U-W (sic) that's one word.  S-A-I-N-T P-I-E-R-R-E.  So Woluwe Saint Pierre and Musambira, that is the first commune.  Then Ganshoren, G-A-N-S-H-O-R-E-N, was twinned with 
	Rusatira commune, R-U-S-A-T-I-R-A, in Butare préfecture. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Please proceed, Witness, and continue your narration about your activities beginning from the 26th of March 1992, diverse as they were.  
A.	In addition to being the interface or liaison between those four twinned communes, which gave me an opportunity to visit the collines or the hills frequently -- in addition to that I began working with a 
	Rwandan association created by Major Cyiza, Augustin.  Cyiza is spelt C-Y-I-Z-A, Augustin.  That association was known as ARDES.  A-R-D-E-S for ARDES.  We were in the process of setting up a group of consultants for financing health services under that association. 
Q.	Witness, in general terms and in addition to your professional activities -- or within the context of your professional activities, did you also get involved in humanitarian work in Rwanda? 
A.	From October '93 up until the time of the coup d'état in Burundi with the assassination of President Ndadaye -- N-D-A-D-A-Y-E for Ndadaye -- there was an influx of refugees into Butare préfecture, and I worked for Médecins sans frontières, Doctors Without Borders, in Holland as a medical link.  And that position I held until I left Rwanda on the 9th of April 1994. 
Q.	Yes.  Madam, remembering our previous discussions, I notice that this information is something that could not be taken for granted, and it is well that although you omitted it you have now put it on the record. 

Now, madam, when we were looking at your personal identification sheet, you mentioned that there was some incorrect information on the sheet relating to your name, and you said that Kayibanda was not your personal name but rather the name of your husband.  Can you please clarify that point.  
A.	I got married under civil law on the 14th of July 1993 to Hildebrand Kayibanda.  Hildebrand, H-I-L-D-E-B-R-O-N-D (sic) for Hildebrand, and Kayibanda, K-A-Y-I-B-A-N-D-A.  He is known in Rwanda to be the second son of President Grégoire Kayibanda.  I met him in 1993 in Belgium.  We got married in church on the 11th of September 1993, and the civil and religious ceremony took place in Rwanda in Nyamabuye -- Nyamabuye commune, N-Y-A-M-A-B-U-E (sic), in Gitarama. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  It has been your testimony that you met Hildebrand Kayibanda in 1993 and that you got married in 1993.  I take it that prior to your wedding you had opportunity to meet Mr. Kayibanda on several occasions.  And could you please tell the Court from what time maybe -- 
MS. WILSON:
Excuse me.  Mr. President, I will ask my learned friend not to lead the witness.  Thank you.  She has given evidence of the actual date she met her husband. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, you can move forward. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I may need to rephrase my question.  Can you tell us how you got to meet Hildebrand Kayibanda, at least to the extent of your public relationship.  I don't want to pry in your private life.  So at that level can you tell the Court what joint activities you were involved in with Mr. Hildebrand Kayibanda from the time you arrived in Rwanda.  
A.	From March 1992, and even when I arrived in Rwanda in 1991, there was a project known as 
	vie commune which was in place, and so we were involved in a number of public activities with Hildebrand Kayibanda. 

From March '92 he used to work in Kigali and I lived in Butare.  And at that time I went to Kigali almost on every weekend.  Then in October '92 he changed jobs and moved to Gitarama as the head of the garage of the Kabgayi diocese.  Kabgayi is spelt K-A-B-G-A-Y-I. 

Our relationship was quite public and open to the extent that a number of anecdotes were told at the time we were putting together our civil marriage.  The bourgmestre of the commune did not believe that we had not yet been married.  So from the time of our wedding, my husband moved to Butare to join me and opened a garage next to the Karubanda prison.  K-A-R-U-B-A-N-D-A for Karubanda.  The garage was next to the Karubanda prison.  
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	From March 1992 I had regular contact with my husband, who was involved in serious and time-consuming political activities within the MDR, the democratic republican movement, particularly in respect of organising rallies and other meetings with ****************************************************who also became********************.  **************is spelt********************************. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Would it be an overstatement if one said that from March 1992 you were involved in politics or the political life of Rwanda?  And if such were the case, could you please tell the Court what actually happened, what type of political activities you were involved in and whatever else you may want to say.  
A.	Well, as an expatriate I decided to avoid any public demonstrations.  I -- or public events.  In fact, I only attended the meeting of 28 January '93 at the Gitarama stadium.  That is the only public event I attended. 

However, because of my husband's relationships, which ultimately became my own family relationships as well, I met several political personalities, not only of the MDR but of all the political parties as well, including the PSD and the MRND.  

Furthermore, because of my activities within the twinned communes, I was also able to have contact with several political figures.  You know that in 1992 one of those communes had a bourgmestre of the MRND while the other had a PSD bourgmestre from 1993. 
Q.	Witness, a short while ago you referred to Mr. **********************.  Now, from March 1992 to April 1994 when you left Rwanda, did you frequently meet him?  And if that were the case, did you exchange views on the political situation in Rwanda? 
A.	I met ***************************very frequently within the family circles.  Because of the political situation and the building tensions, most of our discussions would eventually centre on politics and the political situation.  He used to ask me what the perception of foreigners was, particularly people from my native country, what their perception was of our situation in Rwanda.  He also asked me from time to time what the opinion was on the hills and in Butare.  Because you may want to know that Butare, which was some 145 kilometres from Kigali, was different because the situation there was not as heated as in Kigali.  But we talked about politics and the political situation in those areas.  And we had several of such discussions. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And once again, mindful of the Prosecutor's remarks, I do not intend to lead in any way whatsoever.  But let me put to you the following:  Do you think that you were an attentive observer of the political situation in Rwanda from March 1992 to April 1994? 
A.	I believe that my position was rather special when compared to that of other foreign observers.  You see, unlike the others, I was more or less an insider among the Rwandan politicians.  I was in contact with the main leaders of some political parties without meddling with their decisions or party strategies.  In any event, from that position I was able to assess and to get to know some of the personalities on a, should I say, more personal basis. 

So my situation was rather special because I was at the same time a white expatriate and also one who could speak Kinyarwanda, who lived with a Rwandan, who was married to a Rwandan and who, therefore, had become a member of the family.  And in that capacity I was able to be part of some conversations that other foreigners would not have had the opportunity to be part of. 
Q.	You have just told us that you speak Kinyarwanda.  Do you read Kinyarwanda as well? 
A.	Well, we need to distinguish what my current levels of Kinyarwanda knowledge are as compared to what happened 17 years ago.  From 1994 I no longer speak Kinyarwanda.  So I have lost a lot of that knowledge.  But I can say that by 1994 I was able to speak clearly what I -- and express my ideas clearly, maybe missing a word or two here, and I had a clear understanding of most of what was being said. 

By the way, I must state that Kinyarwanda is one of the most difficult languages in the world. 
Q.	Yes.  We are aware of that, and we want to acknowledge the difficult work that the 
	Kinyarwanda interpreters must do, because sometimes things get very complicated when we have witnesses speaking here in Kinyarwanda. 

Now, Witness, maybe one further detail relating to the context we are talking about.  You have described the MDR.  Did it remain one and indivisible during that period, '92 to '94, or were there any splits within the party, or could you as briefly as possible say a thing or two about the MDR? 
A.	The first political discussion I had with Mr. ***************** was in February 1991.  At that time we talked about the idea of relaunching the MDR.  People who were likely to join that movement were also considered. 

Now, from March '92 I was able to follow developments within the MDR, various campaigns to elect representatives at the cellule, secteur, commune and préfectoral committee levels and then the president of the party elected in August '92, namely, Mr. ***********************.  

I was also able to follow the conclusions of the negotiations for the formation of the multiparty government with Dismas Nsengiyaremye being the prime minister.  Nsengiyaremye is spelt N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E for Nsengiyaremye. 

I was also in a position to follow or monitor the development in relations between members of the party throughout the peace accords negotiations.  To some extent I was also able to follow the process by which Mr. ************************ became the prime minister designate under those accords and Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana as prime minister in mid-July 1993.  

Should I spell Uwilingiyimana?  
Q.	No.  I think it is a well-known name.  Please, you don't need to spell it.  
A.	From September 1993 I was also able to follow tensions that developed within the MDR.  And from early 1994, given that I went to Kigali from time to time, I was also able to become aware of the steps taken towards setting up the transitional national assembly and the transitional broad-based government. 
Q.	Witness, if I asked you all these questions, it is because, in the manner in which we operate, the Chamber and the Rules of Procedure make a distinction between expert witnesses and witnesses of fact.  Perhaps what I wanted you to point out or underscore is that you give us an account of what you will explain subsequently in your testimony.  We need an analytical testimony, or is it an analysis of what you saw, what you saw, what you noticed on the ground?  
A.	It is clear that my testimony will systematically be based on what I witnessed and went through on the ground.  Nevertheless, it is also obvious that when you see, when you notice what is happening on the ground, as time goes on, you draw some conclusions.  You make some analyses and draw some conclusions. 
Q.	But those conclusions and analyses are always with reference to what you saw and noticed? 
A.	Entirely so. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Witness, a while ago you told this Court that you married in July, the 14th of July.  You had married in church on the 11th of September 1993.  Can you tell us as far as you can remember what this date, the date of 11th September 1993, corresponds to over and above the religious ceremony?  What did it represent, that year or date? 
A.	The date of 11th September had been set before we knew the date when the Arusha Accords will be signed.  In fact, that date corresponded to the 37th day after the signing of the peace agreement.  If we reread the accords, it happens that the 37th day had to be a key day.  I believe, if my memory serves me right, that was the date of the arrival of the UNAMIR forces, and it was also an important date in the evolution of the peace process. 

Now, on Saturday, 11th of September, UNAMIR forces were not ready.  They were not there on the ground.  And the representatives of all the political parties came to attend our wedding.  Therefore, there were no negotiations on that day. 

I can also say that, on the said 11th of September, I had the luck of observing that the peace accords, which had been signed while we were on holiday in Europe, because we went to -- on holiday in Europe from the 7th of July to about the 1st of September -- we noticed that those accords had given a fresh impetus to the Rwandan society and that people seemed to be relieved.  In any case, people were hopeful -- were hopeful in the future. 
Q.	Witness -- and you know that I have the answer to the question that I am going to give, but it's important that the answer should come directly from you -- your marriage on the 11th of September 1993, was it a private wedding involving only close friends? 
A.	No.  The first part of the reception, which is the exchange of the dowry, it is done with very few friends, very close friends.  But as soon as we arrived into church and once there was a reception, the public -- or there were many more people.  It happens that on that day there was an addition -- a major misunderstanding with the parish priest who was not the celebrant, and because of this misunderstanding we had to wait for more than two hours outside the church while another wedding was being celebrated.  And during those two hours all the invitees had the freedom and the time to discuss among themselves.  And those of us who were sitting a little bit in the background, we had all the time to notice that people did not hesitate to talk to one another, whatever be their political affiliations, their original origins or ethnic origins.  There was a mix-up of people, and that was clear.  We were happy regarding what could happen in the future because of what we noticed. 
Q.	Witness, you did me a favour on your arrival in Arusha.  The favour you did me was to give me a collection of photographs.  You also subsequently gave me a key explaining those photographs.  Am I correct? 
A.	Yes.  You are correct. 
Q.	Can you now clearly indicate to the Court a number of photographs and the circumstances in which these photographs were obtained or taken.  
A.	I think there are 26 photographs which are numbered A to Z.  The first among the photographs are photographs that were taken during the civil wedding on the 14th of July 1993.  The other photographs were taken on the 11th of September 1993 during the religious ceremony, the church wedding. 
Q.	Are they photographs which have been extracted from another photo album? 
A.	Yes, from another personal wedding album, photographs which we took when we fled Rwanda. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Mr. Issa, who has these documents with him, can he show to the witness or give to the witness the bundle of photographs, which, moreover, I have disclosed to the various parties in the form of a document which I could not send on the Internet because it was too heavy.  So can Mr. Issa give to the witness this bundle of photographs.
THE WITNESS:
We have just the photographs here. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, can you confirm to me that the photographs you have before you are indeed photographs taken from your personal album and that they indeed are the photographs that you had given me and also that they are the photographs of your wedding, both as concerns the civil wedding as well as the church wedding? 
A.	I confirm all of that. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Ms. van Cutsem had also given me the key to the photographs.  I do not know whether Mr. Issa has given you the key or legend. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, can you confirm to me -- after taking cognisance of these few pages, can you confirm to me that this document is indeed the key to the photographs that you had given me, that is, the key A to Z, photographs that you took from your personal album? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I confirm that. 
Q.	Witness, I think -- well, if I ask the Court leave for -- to allow to you make comment on each photograph one by one, perhaps I will be interrupted.  But, nevertheless, Witness, you indicated that many people, many important people from all origins, from all parties, from all political affiliations and ethnic groups, were present at your wedding.  Can you mention some names, some of the most significant names amongst those who were present by, of course, making reference to the photographs concerned so that I should be able to refer the parties and the Bench to the photograph referred to or ask the technician to put on the screen the photographs concerned so that we should be able to see them at the same time as you will be commenting on them.  I am in a position to show those photographs on the screen or the TV monitor.  
A.	I think I am going to skip the first photograph, which has many people of various origins.  But the second photograph in itself is an indication, an important indication -- 
MS. WILSON:
Excuse me.  Mr. President, Defence counsel needs to show the relevance of these wedding photos to the proceedings before the Court.  Thank you. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I think in view of what the witness said regarding the state of the society, the 
	Rwandan society during the period referred to regarding the contacts she had with all important people and regarding the manner in which she can give evidence regarding her contacts, what was said, the discussions and so on, I believe these throw light on what we have said about the Rwandan society as of 11th of September, its diversity, the manner in which all of this comes into the context of the period that preceded the 6th of April 1994.  I do not think that this presentation of the Rwandan society, this microscopic presentation of the Rwandan society as the witness saw it in 1993, you know, could raise any issue of relevance.  I do not think the Prosecution should doubt the relevance of this line of questioning or the photographs. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Perhaps you could concentrate on any key players that might be included in these photographs that might assist our trial.  One can't go through an entire wedding album or photographs of this type in detail.  So if she can concentrate on the key players that might be relevant to the trial.  Let's proceed on that basis. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that indeed was my intention, but -- and moreover, I had stated that I thought it was not necessary to impose on the Chamber a presentation of all the people in the photographs.  But because I have always been reproached for asking leading questions, I thought this should come -- any information should come from the witness.  If the Court would like me to ask questions on the various personalities -- well, I think the witness was referring to photograph number 2.  Can the witness now tell us who is the person on photograph number 2 in view of the relevance of that photograph to our proceedings.  In fact, I do not mean photograph number 2.  I mean photo B, so as to avoid any misunderstanding.  Photograph B. 
THE WITNESS:
This photograph was taken on 14th July 1993 during the reception that followed the civil wedding.  The person in the grey -- light grey suit was a close friend of our family whom I considered as my adoptive or stepfather in Rwanda.  His name was Pierre Canisius Nkulikiyinka.  I will spell Nkulikiyinka:  N-K-U-L-I-K-I-Y-I-N-K-A.  Nkulikiyinka.  He was Tutsi.  He hailed from Ruhengeri in the north of Rwanda.  He had been displaced following the revolution of 1959, and then he was resettled in Bugesera in the south of Kigali préfecture. 
In 1990 he was a national leader of the main youth movement, the Xaveri movement.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could the witness spell that, Mr. President?  
THE WITNESS: 
In 1993 he became director of staff in a factory -- a paper factory close to Kigali.  He was a member of the Parti libéral, the PL party.  In that capacity he was a candidate, bourgmestre, for elections in Kanzenze commune.  K-A-N-Z-E-N-Z-I (sic).  He had not been elected during those elections.  He is the uncle of Deus Kagiraneza, who before 1990 was inspector of the ministry of finance and was imprisoned from October 1990 to March 1991 as an accomplice of the RPF.  He joined the RPF when he was released from prison and became sergeant in the Rwandan Patriotic Army.  

From July to September 1994, Deus Kagiraneza was préfet of Ruhengeri.  Later on he became member of parliament of -- representing the RPF until the time he fled in the year 2000, May 2000, if my memory serves me right. 

My stepfather or adoptive father, Mr. Nkulikiyinka, was assassinated in his house in Nyamirambo on the 13th of April 1994 together with his wife and two of his children and several nephews.  He was assassinated by soldiers.  

Next to him, opposite, you can see Fulgence Nyonteze.  I spell Nyonteze N-Y-O-N-T-E-Z-E.  He was a bourgmestre of the neighbouring commune bordering on Gitarama town, the Mushubati commune.  He was a member of the MDR party.  Absent on the 6th of April from Rwanda, he wanted to return to his country in order to save his family, his Tutsi wife.  Subsequently, they immigrated to Switzerland.  He was convicted in Switzerland and sentenced to prison for 14 years as a result of genocide.  

The third person in the white shirt is the brother to my husband, Eugène Kayibanda, who was a 
senior staff at BRALIRWA.  That is the breweries factory in Rwanda.  He too was a member of the 
MDR party.  He belonged to the faction close to********************************. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Perhaps you could also talk about another photograph which would appear to you to represent what you said a while ago.  
A.	Very briefly, photograph E.  The person who is sharing the sorghum beer with my adoptive father or stepfather is called Augustin Karama.  He was the spokesperson of my husband's family during my wedding.  He is a Tutsi.  

During the genocide he lost his wife and four of his daughters.  After the genocide he was imprisoned for seven years and subsequently released.  He too was a member of the MDR.  And during the 
first republic he was bourgmestre of his commune, that is, at Tambwe commune.  T-A-M-B-W-E, Tambwe.  

Another photograph which represents a delegation that came from the National University of Rwanda is photograph G.  And in that photograph you see, amongst others, in the second row, is -- between 
two young girls with a small mustache, you see Ezéchiel Bisalinkumi, B-I-S-A-L-I-N-K-U-M-I.  Ezéchiel Bisalinkumi was the dean of the faculty of science. 
Q.	Can you slow down a little bit, please.  
A.	Ezéchiel Bisalinkumi was dean of the faculty of science at UNR, the National University of Rwanda.  He was the brother of Sendashonga, one of the main senior staff of the MDR.  

On this photograph further to the right, behind somebody wearing dark spectacles, you can see 
Dr. Abel Dushimimana, member of the PSD party.  Abel Dushimimana was appointed ambassador of Rwanda to Tanzania after the genocide, but he was never able to take up his post. 

The next photo, photo H, was taken in the Kabgayi basilica, the beginning of the Mass.  It represents what we called the row of ministers.  There you can see, from left to right, minister -- the 
minister of primary and secondary education, Jean-Marie Vianney Mbonimpa, M-B-O-N-I-M-P-A; the minister of justice, Jean -- sorry -- Jean-Marie Mbonimpa was a member of MDR; the minister of justice, Agnès Ntamabyariro, member of the PL party; the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, member of the MDR party; Mr. Mugenzi, Justin, member of the PL party.  He was minister of trade, I believe.  Mr. Anastase Gasana, member of the MDR and minister of foreign affairs; and Mr. Rucogoza, 
minister of information.  He was from the MDR party.  

These various important people had different fits, because Mr. Mbonimpa, after the genocide, was appointed ambassador to Switzerland.  Then he sought asylum.  Mrs. Ntamabyariro is currently detained in Rwanda.  Mrs. Uwilingiyimana was assassinated on the 7th of April 1994 in spite of the protection she was given by UNAMIR.  Mr. Mugenzi is detained here in Arusha.  Mr. Gasana was minister of foreign affairs after the genocide, then ambassador to the United Nations and subsequently had to flee.  And Mr. Rucogoza was assassinated on the 7th of April. 

The next photograph, photograph I, I have numbered a number of people.  The person numbered 1 on that photograph is Barnabé Twagiramungu.  He came from Kibuye.  At the time referred to, he was coordinator of a development association and vice-president of an important association or group of associations dealing with development, the CCIOB (sic).  He had been a member of the MRND and then moved over to the PL party, which had designated him as an MP.  He belonged to the Mugenzi faction of the PL party.  He sought refuge in Denmark after the genocide.  He wanted to return to Rwanda freely.  At present he is in prison.  

His wife, next to him, was former minister of health during the first republic.  She comes from Gitarama.  
The person numbered 3 is Charles.  I no longer remember his family name, but he was brother to my brother-in-law Gapyisi.  Emmanuel Gapyisi was the leader -- was one of the leaders of the MDR.  He was also the driving force behind the movement peace and democracy.  He was assassinated on the 18th of May 1993 in his house by an RPF commando.  Charles, as for him, was assassinated in April 1994 in Kigali in Kicukiro by the patriotic front once more. 

The person numbered number 4, the person's face has cut off, but we can easily recognise his hairstyle, and that was Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	On that note, Witness, let me say that the challenge is that anybody who knows Ngirumpatse would at least recognise three quarters of his face.  Could you be specific and formal as to how you put things together to state without any equivocation that this is the photograph of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
A.	I can confirm that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present at our wedding.  I have video footage of that ceremony where you can clearly see him talking to a French Sister who was in charge of the radio unit in Gitarama.  Her name was Sister Odette.  And on that footage it is clearly Ngirumpatse who appears. 
Q.	So is it your unequivocal testimony that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present at your wedding? 
A.	Yes.  Absolutely, yes. 

Then you go to photograph P.  Number 2 is the then president of the national assembly who became, in April 1994, the interim president, that is, Théodore Sindikubwabo, a member of the MRND. 

On that very photograph -- or, rather, photograph Q, number 1 is Pierre-Célestin Rwigema from Gitarama.  Then he was heading a printing press, member of the MDR, ********************faction.  Then he became minister of higher education and became prime minister in '95 before going into exile to the United States.  

Photograph S, to the left in a blue suit, Alype Nkundiyaremye.  Nkundiyaremye is spelt N-K-U-N-D-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  He was at that time a lawyer.  And after July '94 he became director of the Rwandan office or tourism and national parks.  He was a member of the PDC.  Then subsequently he became the president of the council of the state, except I am mistaken.  So he was the president or vice-president of one of the highest bodies in Rwanda. 
Q.	Witness, maybe at this juncture we can suspend this exercise.   
MR. WEYL:
And should any other names appear to be necessary -- and I am now reverting to the Bench -- we would do so at that time.  But, Mr. President, for now I would like to produce this bundle of photographs and the annex, which is a key to those photographs, and that would be D. NG125, I believe -- 123, and for the key D. NG124, I believe. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, it would be easier perhaps if you just apply for admission, and when I admit them, Mr. Issa will deal with the names.  So we admit them, and Mr. Issa can confirm the exhibit numbers. 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document will be D. NG -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe there should be just one number, one exhibit. 
MR. MJUI:
Yes.  I suggest maybe to put it A and B. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG123A and D. NG123B admitted) 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, on 11 September '93, at your wedding and in that multiparty context at which persons from the opposition parties were mingling with persons from the MRND, was this presence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse something that had any special significance, or could it be taken for granted? 
A.	Well, if that day had only been the date for our wedding ceremony, the presence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse would not have been something that could have been taken for granted, because it would have been a testimony of his friendship and relationship to my in-laws. 

However, we must note that the 11th of September 1993 was a day of mourning in a family that was close to the Habyarimana family.  I think the death of Noël Mudabariki had occurred and the burial was taking place on that day.  So Mr. Ngirumpatse came to our wedding as a sign of friendship, as a political choice, and as a decision to work towards reconciliation and improvement of relations between people over, above, and beyond any cleavages of factions that may have been in place at the time. 
Q.	As far as you know, Mathieu Ngirumpatse's choice to attend your wedding rather than the funeral of a close relation to the family of the president, could that choice have been interpreted otherwise?  And are you aware of any such other possible interpretations thereto? 
A.	Clearly, we were not the only ones to notice that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had chosen to attend our wedding.  You see, the day after the day of our wedding, Pio Kayibanda, who was a member of the CND, member of parliament, called my husband to inform him that, upon returning to his house, Mr. Ngirumpatse apparently ran into some clashes with persons whom my brother-in-law referred to as the Interahamwe who blamed him for having chosen to come to our wedding rather than attend the funeral of a close relative of President Habyarimana.

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, would you interpret that as a sign of authority that Mathieu Ngirumpatse may have had over those whom, according to your brother-in-law, had come to quarrel with him?  
A.	I know the Rwandan culture, and I know that one obeys when one is in the presence of a superior.  So I don't think it could have happened that they would have blamed somebody who had any authority over them.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

At this juncture -- and maybe we will revisit this point later on.  Was that the first time or the first occasion on which you met Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Yes, that was the first and only time that I met him.  
Q.	Witness, as an active observer of -- or, should I say, spectator of Rwandan life, can you, in your own words, tell the Court who Mathieu Ngirumpatse was or is, and although you may not have met him, what do you know and think of him?  
A.	I knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse's name, like most other people in Rwanda.  I was aware of the role he played in the committee that worked on the introduction of multiparty politics.  From outside, I was also able to follow developments at the various MRND congresses, and also I was aware of his accession to the helm of this party, which appeared to be an opportunity for dialogue and opening up of the political arena.  This, at least, is what we knew when we discussed with*********************.  

I knew that he was also the director of SONARWA, he recruited my youngest brother-in-law, Irénée Kayibanda.  He employed him as director of litigations.  To hire Irénée Kayibanda into such a parastatal organisation was not a choice that could have been taken for granted, mindful of the coup d'état by General Habyarimana in 1973.  

I do recall that Irénée told us how Mathieu Ngirumpatse received him and tried to spare him of any problems that may have arisen because of his political choices.  I do recall that Irénée told us that Mathieu Ngirumpatse told him that he was free to make any political choices, and that he knew him but that he didn't want him to make those choices very public.  So he was someone who was mindful of the fact that Irénée might have expected -- might have been expected to encounter some problems arising from his political choices.  So whenever there was an opportunity when such could have happened, he would send him on mission and spare him that kind of trouble and save his job as well.  

On the 12th of April 1994, Irénée died in his neighbourhood near the Méridien.  He was shot point blank by an RPF patrol.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I -- I do share your -- your feelings -- I share your -- the feelings that overwhelm you even at this point.  

Now, Witness, maybe we will revisit this aspect of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's personality later on.  But, for now, as we proceed, let me say that on the photographs you referred to Emmanuel Gapyisi.  Once again, I am sorry to take you back to these painful memories, but I would like you to make an effort to tell us what you know about Emmanuel Gapyisi.  
A.	I knew Emmanuel Gapyisi in 1990.  He was the husband (sic) of my husband's sister, Bernadette Mukamana.  And when I knew him he was travelling through Brussels.  And on 1 September 1990 he signed what was referred to as the charter of the 33, including my husband, ******************************, Seth Sendashonga, and other personalities who subsequently became involved in politics in Rwanda.  

When I met him in Brussels at the end of 1990, he was about to return to Rwanda to become part of the political new beginnings in Rwanda, and he was very, very quickly identified as one of the MDR leaders.  He had been an active politician previously, as secretary general of -- at the ministry of public works.  So he quickly became the chair of one of the MDR commissions and, at some point, was expected to run for the presidency of the party.  But he finally withdrew and ****************************became the chair of the MDR.  

In April or May 1993, he joined hands with other political personalities from different backgrounds to form the peace and democracy forum, which was a body that cut across party lines and sought consensus and broad-based participation in order to seek and move towards pacification in Rwanda and put an end to the armed conflict with the RPF.  This forum brought together people from the MRND, the MDR, the PS (sic), and the PL.  And the future looked rather significant for this forum.  

On the 18th of May 1993, as he went home in the evening at around 8 p.m., sitting in the passenger seat at the front of his car while his wife was seated in the back of that car, he was killed by an RPF commando unit on his way back home in the evening.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, one of the photographs we did not mention a short while ago is photograph T.  And the key has the name of Phoébie Gatabazi.  Who is Phoébie Gatabazi?  And maybe from your answer I would have a follow-up question or two.  
A.	Phoébie Gatabazi was the spouse of the minister of public works and energy, namely, Félicien Gatabazi, who was also the executive secretary of the PSD.  Félicien Gatabazi was murdered also, using the same modus operandi as was used for Emmanuel Gapyisi.  He was murdered, as far as I can recall, on the 20th or 21st of February 1994 on his way home from a political rally, or meeting.  

As for Félicien Gatabazi's murder, people quickly suspected the RPF of having a hand in it because some persons, including a woman who was a taxi driver and clearly -- was clearly identified as a member of the RPF, were present in the neighbourhood.  

I was able to obtain information as to the authors of the murder during a discussion at the burial of Félicien Gatabazi.  I had that discussion with Captain Pascal Kayihura, who was a gendarme officer.  K-A-Y-I-H-U-R-A for Kayihura.  He was a gendarmerie captain whom I had known from the time he was in training in the mid-'80s in Belgium at Liège.  And then he was receiving training in criminal investigations in Belgium, and he had conducted investigations into the murder of Gapyisi, and that of Gatabazi as well.  He confirmed the information to us shortly after the ceremony, which had taken place at the Huye stadium in Butare.  

We had met at a hotel, a well-known hotel in Butare, on the terrace of that hotel.  And it is there that he explained to us how he had conducted investigations into the assassination of Emmanuel Gapyisi, and he told us that initially the -- he had thought that it was MRND officials who had ordered that murder, but that he was able to dismiss all those options and end up exclusively with the lead to the RPF.  He also talked to us about the assassination of Félicien Gatabazi and said that it was the same hand that was at work.  

Captain Kayihura remained in Rwanda after 1994.  And as other officers, other ex-FAR officers, he was held at the Gako camp -- G-A-K-O for Gako -- in the south of Rwanda, that is in Bugesera area.  And he never left the Gako camp, where he died, ultimately.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So, according to the specific information you are providing, and within the context of the political discussions that took place in 1993 and 1994, it would appear that some people wanted to blame the death of Gapyisi and Gatabazi on the young Interahamwe, and attempts to do so were baseless.  Is that the case?  
A.	As for the death of Emmanuel Gapyisi, there was never any reference made to the Interahamwe.  When we talked about the presidential side, reference was made, rather, to the soldiers, mindful of the manner in which he was killed.  

Now, as for Félicien Gatabazi's case, I do not even remember that anybody mentioned any involvement of the MRND.  
Q.	But, relying on the information available to you, the RPF was clearly involved in those murders; is that the case?  
A.	If I were to rely on what Captain Pascal Kayihura told us, then such would have been the case because clearly he did not have any doubt on his mind as to that line of thinking. 
Q.	Witness, are you aware of a communiqué signed by ******************************on 18 February 1994 on the prospects of setting up the transitional institutions?  
A.	Around the 18th of February 1994, that period corresponds to the time when negotiations intensified towards the designation of ministers and members of parliament.  But there were also divisions between the MDR and the PL, but I'm not aware of any communiqué that was issued at that time.  But it was a very active period.  And at that time I lived in Butare, and if any communiqué were issued at that time, maybe it got to Butare late, or it was overtaken by other events that became more preeminent.  
Q.	But, madam, we have that communiqué before us, disclosed to us by the Prosecutor from among his files.  And I would like to read an excerpt from that communiqué:  

"Political parties meeting as planned to agree on the date of the setting up of the transitional institutions in closed session, in a very congenial atmosphere, and came to the following conclusions:  

"1.  The date for setting up the institutions will be Tuesday, 22 February 1994.  

"2.  Parties must publish the names or lists of their members of parliament to be finalised on Monday, 21 February 1994.  To ensure transparency, the meeting decided that the list of PL members of parliament be signed and countersigned by the president and the first provisional vice-president of the PL."  

Witness, mindful of that communiqué, and also of the -- your testimony as to the date and the perpetrators of the murder of Félicien Gatabazi, would you think that Félicien Gatabazi's murder had only one personal purpose?  
A.	Félicien Gatabazi was killed between the date on which the communiqué was signed and the date on which the institutions were to be set up.  Clearly this was not by chance.  Félicien Gatabazi was one of the most solid figures in the PS (sic), which was not experiencing any divisions.  

By the way, after Félicien Gatabazi was murdered, then factions developed within the PSD:  On the one hand, those known to have belonged to his political faction; and others belonging to other leaders of the party.  

At the same time, Emmanuel Gatabazi -- Gapyisi, rather, was setting up a peace forum in order to seek to put an end to the war.  And at that time Félicien Gatabazi appeared to be a -- an important figure, and a pillar in the setting up of the transitional institutions.  

Therefore, to my mind, those two murders were timed to disrupt the procedure for pacifying Rwanda.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I think it is time for the break, and I would like to stop here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take the mid-morning recess now.  
MR. WEYL:
Je vous remercie, Monsieur le Président.
(Court recessed from 1034H to 1104H) 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, we shall proceed at the same rhythm, mindful that we need to allow the interpreters to do their job to the best of their ability, as well as the court reporters, to record your testimony properly.  

A short while ago, Witness, you mentioned Sendashonga, S-H-O-N-D-A-O-N-G-A (sic).  Could you please provide more details as to that name.  
A.	Sendashonga, Seth Sendashonga was, above anything else, Emmanuel Gapyisi's personal friend.  He had to leave Rwanda in the mid-'70s, I believe, following differences with the Habyarimana regime, or President Habyarimana's regime.  

During his studies he was one of the leaders of the students' association at the national university of Rwanda.  He used to live in Nairobi.  He joined the patriotic front in 1991, I believe.  He arrived on Rwandan territory in early 1994, and he was in the CND building on the evening of the 6th of April 1994.  

In July 1994 he became minister of the interior of the first government following the genocide.  He had to leave that government in August '95, along with *****************************and some other ministers who clearly disagreed with the regime, whose identity was becoming increasingly known.  As he served as minister of interior, Seth Sendashonga wrote over 700 letters to Mr. Kagame to denounce acts of violence and arbitrary imprisonment, and according to him he did not receive a single reply to any of those letters.  

After he left Rwanda, and after **************************left in September '95, we were in regular contact with him because it quickly became necessary to put together a forum of people from various backgrounds, and this forum was known as the force for resistance and democracy.  I had personal contact, on a regular basis, with him because we exchanged a number of diskettes bearing information as to the constituent document of this forum, or movement.  

And within the context or activities of that movement, he came to Brussels from time to time, and I met him regularly -- I saw him regularly at ********************************place.  I do recall clearly that on one occasion he told us that President Habyarimana's plane had been brought down by "us", the RPF.  

Seth Sendashonga was murdered in 1997, in May, I believe, in Nairobi.  Investigations by the Kenyan police at the time appeared to have quickly pointed to the surroundings of the Rwandan embassy.  He, too, was killed in his vehicle.  And you want to remember how Emmanuel Gapyisi and Félicien Gatabazi were both murdered, the modus operandi that was used in those two cases appears to have been repeated in this case.  And that points to a similarity with another murder of former General Kayumba, Nyanwasa, who fled Rwanda, and who was attacked in Johannesburg.  
Q.	Witness, even after the break, please kindly spell the name that you have just mentioned.  
A.	K-A-Y-U-M-B-A for Kayumba.  Nyanwasa, N-Y-A-N-W-A-S-A.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you were telling the Court about those who were present at your wedding, you also mentioned the name of Deus Kagiraneza, K-A-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A.  Could you give us some more details about this person.  
A.	Deus Kagiraneza -- K-A-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A -- K-A-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A -- was the direct nephew Pierre Canisius Nkulikiyinka, whose name I spelt a short time ago, and whom I consider to be my adopted father.  Deus Kagiraneza, as I said, before October 1990 was an inspector at the ministry of finance in Kigali.  He was imprisoned in October 1990 following a number of arrests of the alleged accomplices of the RPF.  He was released among the wave of those who were released by Prime Minister Nsanzimana -- N-S-A-Z-I-M-A-N-A for Nsanzimana -- in March 1991.  

At that time Deus Kagiraneza joined the RPF, but he told me later that he had been a member of that organisation since 1988.  He became a sergeant in the RPF, and his main duty was to provide guidance for visitors to the RPF.  So he played the role of a protocol officer, somewhat.  

In July 1994 he was appointed préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture, until September 1994.  Thereafter he became a member of parliament of the RPF at the national assembly.  I met him in December 1994 privately.  He had taken into his home the five surviving children of my adopted father, as well as eight of his cousins.  So there were 13 surviving children at his home.  We worked with a number of friends to make contributions towards the school fees of these children, and it is in that context that I met him and had a discussion with him.  

During those discussions we were extremely free in the areas we touched on.  At the time my brother-in-law, **************************, was the prime minister, and we had private ties which made us to be perceived to be political allies.  Deus Kagiraneza told me that on the 6th of April 1994 he thought that there were some 4,000 patriotic front soldiers in civilian attire, but well armed, within Kigali city, that there were some 4,000 armed patriotic front soldiers in Kigali.  
In my discussions with Deus Kagiraneza we also talked about the acts of violence which had taken place and which continued to take place in and around December 1994.  And I do recall that I told him that the RPF was like a poker player with some aces up their sleeves and playing a game that made it impossible for the country to go down the road of reconciliation.  

Deus Kagiraneza ran into some conflict with the leadership of the RPF, and had to flee Rwanda in May 2000.  I helped him to obtain asylum in Belgium from that time.  
Q.	Witness, mindful of his position in the RPF, did Deus Kagiraneza have opportunity to participate at other important events, and did he share with you any other important information relating to events before 1994?  
A.	One of my adopted father's sisters used to live in Bujumbura, and I visited her from time to time, particularly during the Easter of 1993.  At that time I noticed that her second son, who was 16 years old, was no longer at home.  I asked her where the child was, and she told me that the child had been taken away to the patriotic front.  And I asked her whether she had any news of him.  She told me that the child was not under any immediate danger because Deus was taking care of him and could protect him.  

Deus Kagiraneza was also present at the CND, that is in the parliament building, on the evening of the 6th of April 1994.  
Q.	Witness, did he tell you where he was on the date or the day on which the Arusha Accords were signed?  
A.	Yes, he told me that on the day of the signing of the Arusha Accords he had been summoned by General Kagame, along with Gérard Butare (sic), another soldier who subsequently was appointed to the embassy in Brussels.  And according to Deus Kagiraneza, General Kagame had ordered them to bury and to hide the heavy weapons of the RPF along the border and the Kagitumba river.  K-A-G-I-T-U-M-B-A for Kagitumba.  
Q.	Did he make any comments to you about this paradox of burying the heavy weaponry on the same day on which the peace accords was being -- were being signed?  Was the idea to abstain from using those weapons?  
A.	Well, he told me that the idea was simply to hide weapons that were supposed to have been surrendered under the Arusha Accords.  So I told him, "Were you -- so you were ready to use those weapons again later on, right?"  And he said, "Yes".  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did he give you any other information or provide you with any other information on the activities of the RPF, whether it be in terms of infiltrations or presence as -- at various roadblocks after the 6th of April?  
A.	I became aware of information from other sources, other persons other than Deus Kagiraneza about the infiltrations.  Deus had talked to me about infiltrations into Kigali city.  But other persons, many other persons on the hills, particularly in the communes which I visited frequently which had a high Tutsi civilian population, people talked to us about youth who had left and who went for -- went away for a few months and then returned.  A rumour had it that those youth were going for training with the patriotic front.  

I'm sorry, I missed -- I forgot the second part of your question, Counsel.  
Q.	Did Mr. Kagiraneza, or anyone else, provide you with information on what happened subsequently at the roadblocks after the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	Several times information came to us that the roadblocks were manned, or that among those manning the roadblocks there were people who appeared to be under the control of the RPF in order to facilitate infiltration of persons who either needed to come in or who otherwise may have needed to be killed.  

Now, as for the infiltrations, someone else also told us that there were infiltrations into parties and into the youth wings of various parties.  Cyriaque Habyarabatuma, the commander of the Tumba gendarmerie camp -- Tumba, T-U-M-B-A -- in Butare is the one who provided us with that information.  I had had contact with him prior to the 6th of April.  Major Cyriaque Habyarabatuma -- I will spell that name:  H-A-B-Y-A-B-A-T-U-M-A (sic), I am missing something, I think.  Well, he told us that as far as he knew, the parties and the youth movements of various parties that were most infiltrated were -- by the RPF were the CDR and its youth wing, and the Interahamwe. 
Q.	You have mentioned Major Habyarabatuma.  You know, I have been working at this for more than ten years and I am still struggling with Rwandan names.  I am sorry for that.  

But, please, can you tell us the context in which you got to know the major, and what other issues did you discuss with him.  
A.	I have said that Major Cyriaque Habyarabatuma was the commander of the gendarmerie camp in Tumba in Butare.  I got to know him specifically when the February 1994 riots took place after the murder of Félicien Gatabazi and Martin Bucyana.  There was unrest in Butare town, and I got to meet him in person at that time.  I met him by happenstance; I walked towards him and I introduced myself, and I told him of a concern that I had in relation to my niece, who was the eldest sister -- or, the eldest daughter of****************************, who was attending school in Save, some 6 kilometres away from Butare.  She was a 13-year-old girl, or child, at that time.  I believe she was in the first year of her humanities.  

I asked Cyriaque Habyarabatuma whether he would be willing, in case of a major unrest, to go along with some gendarmes to fetch that child and bring her back to our home so that she may be evacuated with us, should the need arise.  Cyriaque Habyarabatuma promptly agreed to do so.  

On the 7th of April he called our house in Butare and asked whether he should go fetch**********, that child, from the school.  And I told him, no, it was holiday time and ********was in Kigali with her parents.  But he kept his promise.  

I want to add that Major Cyriaque Habyarabatuma was well known in Butare as a man of duty, and his duty entailed the protection of the people.  And he said himself that, "No one messes with the people under my responsibility, irrespective of their ethnicity and political leaning."  
Q.	Witness, one more name that I would like to raise with you.  Bamboneyeho -- B-A-M-B-O-Y -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We missed the rest of the spelling.  Counsel for the Defence went too fast.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	In any event, does that name mean anything to you?  
A.	I will spell that name again.  The name is Juvénal Bamboneyeho, B-A-M-B-O-N-E-Y-E-H-O.  He was a Burundian refugee.  He had survived the massacres of 1992 in Burundi -- 1972, rather, and came to Rwanda where he attended the major seminary in Kivu before being ordained as a priest in the Kabgayi diocese.  In 1993/94 he was the dean of the Gitarama institution.  He was our friend, and he was the celebrant at our wedding.  

After the signing of the Arusha Accords he organised meetings between youth of the patriotic front 
and youth of other political parties in Kabgayi.  He went himself to fetch those youth from Mulindi 
and accompanied them throughout the meetings; the idea of the meetings being to allow youth 
from opposing political leanings to get to know each other and to operate over and above their cleavages.  

Juvénal Bamboneyeho, working with other priests, organised to evacuate some refugees from Kabgayi, as well as the spouse and children of *****************************from Gitarama to Rutobwe commune -- R-U-T-O-B-W-E -- and then later on to Gisenyi and Goma.  

When he arrived in the camps in Goma he became diabetic and died two years after, from diabetes, in Belgium.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, I would like us to proceed chronologically by looking at the security situation in your secteur in the autumn of 1993, that is from October 1993.  What was the security situation in your secteur?  
A.	I suppose that you are referring to Butare, and in particular to Buye secteur, where I lived.  We were more and more regularly confronted, or facing -- faced by attacks, attacks perpetrated by small groups of bandits.  To fight against those attacks we decided in the neighbourhood to set up a committee.  In general, the Europeans who lived in the neighbourhood were not invited to attend the meetings of the committee; I do not know the reasons for that.  My hybrid status enabled me to participate.  And the idea was to recruit what we referred to as zamu, Z-A-M-U, that is watchmen, to make them stand at junctions of -- into the neighbourhood at night, to equip them with machetes and whistles.  

These zamus, or watchmen, or night watchmen had to sound an alert when there were bandits coming to attack the neighbourhood.  And, if need be, they had to intervene.  The whistles enabled them to alert the others and to make other zamus or night watchmen to come to the scene of the attack.  To pay the watchmen, the neighbourhood committee organised a system of collecting funds.  

And in our neighbourhood the person who was in charge of collecting the funds was Emmanuel Bugingo.  He was a teacher at the higher institute of public administration.  He remained in Rwanda after the genocide.  He remained in Butare until his death a few years ago, but I do not know exactly when he died.  
Q.	Did that organisation have any link whatsoever -- and in this regard I request that you answer me as freely as possible.  Was this part of a mechanism for enabling the population to protect themselves?  Was this part of a programme of civil defence?  What was it -- how would you describe that committee that was set up, or the arrangements that you made?  How would you describe them?  
A.	I think this was just a response, specific response to a problem of security -- problem of security, or attacks launched against property.  It was not a political response, neither was it a response -- a precautionary measure regarding some political problem.  We were in Butare, in the south of the country.  But, in fact, we just thought that it was necessary to take measures against attacks perpetrated by bandits.  
Q.	Was this a way of supplementing the efforts of the police, which were inadequate?  
A.	I think that in the urban commune of Ngoma, which included Butare town, there wasn't a considerable number of communal police officers; I do not think there were more than 10 or 15.  But, in any case, the number of police officers had nothing in common with what you would find in other countries with regard to the strength of the police force.  It was clear that we could not depend on the police to ensure our security, to ensure the security of the neighbourhoods.  
Q.	Would it be correct -- on the basis of the examples seen in other neighbourhoods, and perhaps in Butare as a whole, would it be correct to say that in Rwanda the population had to carry out their own police activities?  
A.	It is clear that insecurity against property, attacks -- with the evolution of the war -- increased.  Attacks became more frequent, so much so that people felt unsafe.  Perhaps this was the case more in areas where there was property to be protected.  But the idea that people should come together to ensure their own security and safety, I think I have seen such an initiative -- I saw such an initiative in some communes where attacks by bandits occurred.  

I clearly remember the case of an attack one night in Rutsiro commune where bandits attacked.  They attacked a small centre of an association to take away what was in the coffers.  They killed the two watchmen:  One of the watchmen was killed right there and then, on the spot; the other died on the way to hospital, as I was transporting him to hospital.  Such attacks made tension to increase, even in communes -- in rural communes, remote communes, communes that were far away from major highways.  
Q.	In the same line of thinking, Witness, were -- was violence something to be considered to be reckoned with in the Rwandan context?  Was violence something to be reckoned with in the Rwandan situation?  
A.	For those people I was able to contact in the Rwandan society, and also for those I was able to meet more closely when I did my last research in social and political economics, violence is inherent in the Rwandan societies.  Rwandan society, which is also a very closed society, which has a culture of secrecy, and acts of violence were not new.  Violence dates back to a very long period.  

In fact, in this regard you should read the first writings of the first Europeans who came to Rwanda, be it von Götzen in 1894, who described the houses that were torched when people did not pay taxes; or Richard Kandt, one of the first Germans who scoured the country.  He describes the attitude of what he referred to as the Bahutu who tried to protect themselves against the acts of violence perpetrated by dominant families.  Or you could also read the paper called diaire (sic), published by a parish in Butare, a parish that was founded in 1900.  In that parish the priests -- or, rather, in that publication the priests noted that the Hutus came to seek protection in the parish.  

This, therefore, the concept of violence, is intrinsic, is inherent in the Rwandan society.  Since 1900, violence was present everywhere.  At least on the basis of news about fighting, displacement of population, acts of violence, reprisals that took place in some communes, one can say that violence is part and parcel of the Rwandan society.  Certainly violence is exacerbated by uncertainty; uncertainty created by the culture of secrecy and suspicion, or mistrust.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  You also told this Court a while ago that in autumn -- or, rather, in autumn 1993 there was an influx of refugees from Burundi.  Did that situation have any impact whatsoever; an impact on the security situation and also an impact on the perception, the view that the population may have had of its own environment?  
A.	Just right after the coup d'état against President Ndadaye and the assassination of that president, the Butare préfecture, who had about 8,000 inhabitants, witnessed an influx of 300,000 Burundian refugees who were settled in camps along the border.  The development of the political situation in Burundi was followed up on a daily basis by the people of Rwanda through the radio, and also in particular through speeches by one of the Burundian ministers who remained in Kigali, Mr. Minani.  

That situation generated among the Rwandan population a sense of fear.  A fear of the army and the intervention of the armed forces, Burundian forces, an intervention by Burundian forces for Burundians.  And I should recall that most Burundians were, in the main, Tutsi.  

I believe also -- well, this is what the peasants said.  They clearly made a comparison with the Rwandan Patriotic Army, which was based in the north of the country.  To my knowledge, there was no major tension between the Rwandan population, irrespective of ethnic origin, and the refugees from Burundi.  From the moment that NGOs, Médecins sans frontières, the Red Cross, the Belgian Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, from the moment that they open -- gave access to the refugees, they gave them access to the health centres and food.  

At some point in time there were rumours -- rumours circulating to the effect that refugee camps provided military training.  These rumours justified the coming of the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who herself hailed from Butare.  

In some of the camps sports activities by young people were limited, but this was not the case everywhere.  I remember, for example, a discussion with the bourgmestre of Ntyazo commune -- N-T-Y-A-Z-O -- who a Tutsi and a member of the PL party, the Parti libéral.  He himself had encouraged the construction of a football field in the camp.

1145H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	In refugee camps, Burundi refugee camps, the people who came from Burundi, were they -- did they show some kind of fear and did that fear -- was that fear transmitted to the pop -- local population, or were the refugee camps kind of hemmed in?  What was the testimony -- what did the people from Burundi, Burundi refugees -- what did they say? 
A.	On the one hand, the people knew one another.  There was only the Akanyaru river and a small marshland between the two groups.  For a small farmer to leave his land, that would mean that he was afraid.  

Furthermore, having moved along the border with Rwandan Red Cross teams during the early days of the arrival of those refugees, I personally noticed that many of them arrived wounded.  And we had to -- to provide emergency aid, emergency -- or first aid on the hills, using the material that we had brought with us in the pickup.  

Refu -- Burundi refugee camps were not at all closed.  There was contact between Burundian refugees and the local population of Rwanda.  These contacts were on a daily basis, all the more so as the health centre which was inside the camp was open to Burundians as well as to Rwandans.  Therefore, information and fear could spread around easily. 
Q.	In your capacity as a nurse, did you ever have to provide health care to displaced Burundians?  And if yes, could you tell the Court what the situation of the victims was.  Were they Burundian soldiers who came to seek medical care?  Can you give us a few examples of what you did.  
A.	In the days of the arrival of Burundian refugees, two major associations were present in Butare:  The Belgian Doctors Without Borders and the Rwandan Red Cross Society.  The two society -- or groups had different policies.  

Doctors Without Borders started by identifying areas where camps had to be set up.  Whereas, the 
Red Cross Society of Rwanda sent a few vehicles along the border to see where people were and if there was need for emergency health care.  

I went with a team, a Belgian and Rwandan team, in one of those pickups.  We quickly located refugees.  There were civilians.  Most of them were people who said they were Hutu.  Some of them indeed were wounded.  

Sometimes there were children.  As a matter of fact, I had to provide health care to wounded children, children who had been wounded with blades or bladed weapons, sometimes in conditions that were often very painful. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  You answered a line of questions which borders on another issue.  Did you -- or were you aware of the setting up of a civil defence programme for the population during the period of 1992 to 1994?  Does that -- do you remember such a programme having been set up? 
A.	The idea of civil defence came up quite regularly.  Personally, I was a witness thereof.  Within the MDR -- members of the MDR party, including my husband, had discussed the idea.  They had discussed it in particular with Mrs. Uwilingiyimana and the management organs of the party.  And it was decided -- and this was done particularly by my husband.  What was done was to identify former soldiers who were called reservists who, in fact, were, rather, retired soldiers.  These people had to be identified so that they should be able to recruit some young people and organise a civil defence programme.  

The attacks of June 1992 against Byumba, the attacks of February 1993, had shown the limits of the -- what the Rwandan army could do, how far they could resist.  Most of the displaced people also showed and told the local population of their fears.  And this strengthened the idea that the civil defence programme was necessary.  

In that context it is -- it was clear that what had to be done was to train young people to defend the population against the Rwandan Patriotic Army and not to defend them against the civilian population. 
Q.	The idea of putting in place a civil defence programme was not the idea of the MRND alone.  
A.	To my knowledge, the idea was, first of all, launched by the MDR.  In any case, as far as I personally know, this was the -- this started in Gitarama préfecture.  In Gitarama préfecture it is clear that the MDR was the person who put in place that idea. 
Q.	To your knowledge, did the MDR limit itself to expressing the idea, or were there any attempts to translate into concrete actions the idea? 
A.	In any case, there was an identification of reservist soldiers, and some contacts were made.  I do not know whether they went beyond that. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Perhaps another point of clarification regarding the general context and relating to the documents.  The idea of roadblocks, was it something limited to what happened after the 6th of April 1994?  Or the idea of setting up roadblocks, is it a current -- a common practice, rather, in Rwanda? 
A.	When I went to Rwanda in 1990 to write my dissertation on medical and health sciences, I noticed that there were roadblocks on the hills.  The roadblocks were manned by civilians.  The civilians checked identification cards.  

Sometimes this was nasty because quite often these people could not read.  And often they checked the identification of -- the identity papers of people they knew very well.  Other roadblocks were set up on major roads, and they were manned by gendarmes.  Therefore, roadblocks is an idea that spread very quickly during the attack perpetrated by the Rwandan Patriotic Front in October 1990.  I noticed that in December 1990, January and February 1991 and even thereafter. 
Q.	Were there roadblocks manned in some cases by gendarmes and in other cases by the civilian population?  So would one say that roadblocks are part of the Rwandan culture? 
A.	No.  In times of peace there were no roadblocks in Rwanda.  In fact, roadblocks emerged during the attack perpetrated by the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
Q.	And according to you was the purpose -- what was the purpose of the roadblocks? 
A.	Their purpose was to identify or check the movement of the population and to know who was going where. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  In the period which preceded the 6th of April 1994, did you hear about the Interahamwe?  And if yes, what does that mean?  What did that mean to you? 
A.	I do not know of anyone who was in Rwanda and did not hear of the Interahamwe.  I would identify the Interahamwe of the period preceding the 6th of April as a small group of young people who presented them -- or said they were the youth wing of political parties.  But I am not aware of any formal links with the political parties they claimed to represent.  

Having said that, the Interahamwe youth movement emerged after the emergence of the MDR, GDR, of -- G -- MDR, GDR youth movements and the youth movements of other parties.  I would also like to say that the main leaders of the GDR, who were called Inkuba, meaning "thunder", are still present in Rwanda.  They are free.  And one of them was even -- became a vice ombudsman of the RPF regime quite recently.  

From April 1994 "Interahamwe", in my opinion, became a -- a term generally applicable to other people.  And under -- if I -- became an umbrella term, meant to designate anyone who had violent conduct and without any authority. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Witness, in your view and on the basis of what you saw in 1992, '93, and '94, what does the word Akazu mean? 
A.	Akazu is a term that was introduced by ***************************during a rally.  In fact, it is typical of the kind of word that he would use -- that he would introduce to heat up, so to speak, the crowd.  By the use of that term, he wanted to -- well, Akazu, a loose translation of it in French means "a small house".  

According to -- he wanted to designate by that term a small group of people of profiteers who surrounded the Habyarimana family.  But it should be noted that this small circle of people, this microcosm, so to speak, was not limited -- or hardly limited, and, in fact, it certainly depended on the relations -- the relations people had at the time the policy-makers made their decisions.  

I will link the term Akazu to a term which had been used by Christophe Mfizi, a réseau -- zero --  Zero Network, which meant a small group of profiteers or who were around the Habyarimana family and whose objectives and intention was to have economic benefits, financial benefits. 
Q.	Witness, on the basis of the discussions you may have had with ****************************or other important persons, can you say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse could have been a member of the Akazu or the Zero Network? 
A.	Certainly no.  In fact, he didn't have the profile.  He was not such a person.  To my knowledge, he did not carry out any business activity which may have encouraged him to belong to that group of self-seeking individuals, profiteers.  I never heard *******************************saying he integrated Ngirumpatse within the Akazu group or Zero Network. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Can you now tell us when you left Rwanda and the circumstances in which you left that country.  
A.	We were informed of the attack against the plane following the outage, which was common in Rwanda.  In fact, electricity returned only at midnight.  

At that time one of my colleagues and neighbours was working on her computer and tuned -- or turned on the radio and heard from an international radio station that the president's plane had been shot down.  That colleague phoned us.  My first reaction -- or, rather, my first question -- not knowing who exactly was in the plane, my first reaction was, what will Élie Sagatwa do?  Élie Sagatwa was the closest collaborator or aid to Habyarimana.  And it happens that that person was in the plane and he also died.

In -- that night my husband contacted****************************.  He also contacted early in the morning Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who told him that she was waiting for the arrival of the UNAMIR escort in order to go and make an address over the radio and that she hoped the UNAMIR escort would arrive soon.  

In the morning we started receiving telephone calls.  Some of -- some were distress calls telling us what was happening.  Other calls were calls of threats, so much so that on the evening of the 7th -- or, rather, at the end of the afternoon, we decided to go and spend the night somewhere else in the house of an expatriate, a teacher in the Belgian school in Butare.  We stayed the night there because in the telephone calls that we had received we had very precise threats to the effect that we will be attacked on the morning of the 8th of April.  There was no attack on the morning of the 8th of April.  An attack -- there was no attack against our house.  

In the day of the -- or during the day of the 8th, our calls from Kigali were endless, constant calls.  People who were being threatened asked for assistance.  Yet we could not do anything.  But in Butare everything was calm.  

At the end of the afternoon of the 8th, soldiers were assigned to the main junctions leading to the neighbourhood to provide security.  There was no incident, no problem with those soldiers.  

On the morning of the 9th at 6 o'clock, we received a telephone call from the manager of the Ibis hotel asking us whether the radio (sic) of Radio France International, Jean Hélène, could come home to interview us because or -- because of our links with ******************We accepted to give the interview, and at 6:30 Jean Hélène came home.  In fact, she interviewed us directly on the RFE (sic) channel.  The interview was aired live from her house.  

At about 9 o'clock, whilst we were convinced that we were going to stay in Butare as a result of the calm that prevailed there, we received a phone call from one of our neighbours saying that a convoy was being prepared.  And there was -- that neighbour was encour -- strongly encouraging us to join the convoy.  

We went to the place of appointment 20 minutes thereafter.  The place of appointment was opposite the Belgian school -- or, rather, the French school in Butare.  And the situation at that point in time was calm -- was calm in Butare.  

In fact, the Belgian person in charge of security sent us a message, a message from the Belgian embassy, telling us that, if with hindsight it emerged that we left Rwanda without reason, we would be subject to being answerable for having abandoned our post.  

At that time the convoy showed up, and we stopped for a long time in the main road in Butare.  The convoy comprised about 70 vehicles.  And that convoy comprised people of practically every nationality.  We were waiting for convoy vehicles coming from Gitarama and another convoy from Gikongoro.  

During that stop -- that rather lengthy stop of the convoy, we learnt that a security meeting was ongoing in -- in the préfecture conference room which is located along that road.  Those participating in the meeting included the main authorities of the préfecture.  My husband was able to meet at that time two of those authorities:  The préfet, Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana, who was a Tutsi, a member of the PL party; and Major Cyriaque Habaratu (sic).  Among the participants you also had Joseph Kanyabashi, bourgmestre of the urban commune of Ngoma.  Both Cyriaque Habara -- Habaribaratuma (sic) and Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana urged my husband to leave Rwanda.  

Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana even added:  "You will leave with white people because, if the situation explodes in Butare, I will not be able to do anything for you."
That is what we did.  And when we got to the border with Burundi, we met a convoy of Burundian dignitaries that had come to fetch the body of their president and minister who had died in the crash.  We arrived Bujumbura in the evening, and the Belgian ambassador -- or embassy had decided to send us to various homes.  

Because of the security situation in Bujumbura, we asked the ambassador for my husband and I to be placed in a hotel rather than expose a family, a host family, to unnecessary risks.  The ambassador did not fully understand what was happening in Rwanda clearly and the relation between the Burundi and Rwanda problems.  

Mr. Ghiste, who was the representative of the Belgian community, my superior, may I say, is the one who hosted us at his home.  We stayed at his home, and the next day in the morning he assigned me to receive phone calls so that we could get the most information from Rwanda.  

In the afternoon we were able to link up with the Kamenge airport in Bujumbura and travelled on a 
737 Boeing that the SABENA airlines company had set aside upon hearing about the unrest.  

Let me underscore that at the Bujumbura airport I was able to see American soldiers at the airport. 
Q.	Witness, after you left Rwanda, did you continue to be interested in the situation obtaining in the country that you had left behind under those circumstances? 
A.	It was impossible for things to have developed otherwise.  You see, Belgian -- Belgium even opened a low-cost telephone line to enable people to keep in touch with others in Rwanda.  So through those phone lines we were able to receive phone calls regularly from people who felt threatened, who were in hiding.  

But at the same time we were afraid to call ourselves because we felt that calling would cause the phones to ring and alert the killers who were in the neighbourhood of various homes.  

At that time we had very little news about******************************.  We only knew that he had fled his home and that he had been taken to the UNAMIR headquarters.  We also knew that his son -- or his daughter and his children were not with him.  We did not know where they were at that time.  

Then, gradually, we received information that **********************************had been evacuated from Rwanda on one of the last UNAMIR flights to Nairobi.  Then he contacted us from Nairobi.  At that time my husband asked him and insisted that he abstain from going to Mulindi to join the RPF but that he should come to Europe, because my husband feared that if he joined the RPF *********************** would end up being muscled and subjugated to the decisions of the patriotic front.  
On 1 May or thereabouts, ****************************arrived in Belgian.  We lived together in my parents' home for a few weeks before taking up an apartment which a friend of *******************************had loaned to us, a friend who was living in Bujumbura. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Maybe I will revisit some aspects of this matter subsequently.  But for now I would like you to tell me -- or tell the Court the circumstances in which you returned to Rwanda.  A short while ago you mentioned that you went to Rwanda on two occasions.  Could you tell the Court what you did and what you saw on the first occasion, and then maybe later on I will ask you what you did on your second visit.  
A.	My husband and I returned to Rwanda in December 1994 for about three weeks.  In the main we stayed with************************************************, in his official residence.  We had the opportunity to drive around to meet a number of people, to have a number of discussions.  And we were even able to return to our family home.  

And it did not take 20 minutes for our neighbours to come around and to tell us what had happened during the killings, during the massacres, during the genocide.  They told us that on the Kavumu colline, that is, at my father in law's hill, no family member was killed during the genocide of those families on that hill and that from September 1994 there was not a single house with all its occupants together because the reprisals had been so severe.  It is at that time that I met Deus Kaginare -- Kagina -- Kagirageza (sic), whom I mentioned a short while ago.  

Personally, I went back to Rwanda again one year after, in November '95, to lecture at the National University of Rwanda and provide courses which were no longer being provided for lack of teachers.  I travelled with a delegation of Belgian doctors and Congolese-Belgian doctors to provide lectures in nutrition, biochemistry, nephrology, and what have you, and personally, courses on organisation and management of health services.  

That mission lasted three weeks.  And I spent those three weeks mainly in Butare with a weekend in Gitarama and another in Kigali so as to meet and reconnect with friends and family members.  
Q.	Witness, is there any particular event that stands out in your mind during your 1995 visit to Rwanda? 
A.	Let me say that I was tailed by a soldier throughout my stay in -- in -- in Rwanda.  I was able to quickly identify that soldier.  And I think that he was -- he had not been informed that I was able to take care of myself and move about in Rwanda using taxies and other means of transportation.  

But from time to time, I lost him, and yet I would find him again, particularly at the Ibis hotel where we were staying.  And thanks to the involuntary complicity of Colonel Matanganza (sic), who was the area commander, I was able to lose that man over a weekend and meet those whom I wanted to meet in his absence.  
This memory brought me to a clear understanding that, if ever I planned to go to Rwanda, it might not just be a matter of being tailed.  
Q.	During that trip did you attend any ceremony when bodies were exhumed? 
A.	Yes.  During that time I went to a place in -- near Butare where a mass grave was going to be exhumed and -- in relation to people who had been killed during the genocide.  I went to see what was happening.  I was 33 (sic) years old at that time.  

And it was relatively rare that one would find relatively young people in Rwanda who spoke Kinyarwanda.  So for that reason people who were standing close to me did not think that I would understand what they were talking about.  

So during that exercise I quickly realised that the state of decay of the various corpses that were being exhumed or -- well, was not the same.  Those who were there talked about and identified the bodies that were exhumed.  Those who were first removed, they said had been killed well after the genocide and that their bodies had also been buried in those mass graves.  

Now, as for the other bodies that were at the bottom of the mass grave, people who were there said that those were the bodies of people who had been killed during the genocide, and they identified them very clearly.  I did not reveal to them that I had understood all what they were talking about.  So I went back to Butare with the conviction that what I had been told was indeed true. 
Q.	Well, again, I'm really very sorry to take you back to these very painful and difficult memories.  But, Witness, am I to understand from your testimony about that mass grave at Simbi that there were victims of the genocide in the mass grave but that there were also victims of something else in that mass grave?  Can you be a little more specific as to that aspect and tell us who was said to have been responsible for what category of death.  
A.	People were talking about the dead bodies, and they were ident -- able to identifying them by their clothing and their names.  And they were able to identify people who had been killed long after July 1994.  

So in that area after the 3rd of July 1994 the only armed forces that were operating were the APR forces of the patriotic front.  I don't think I need to say any more.  

I was convinced that those people were not exaggerating and not lying because they were able to clearly identify people who were killed during the genocide, that is, before the 3rd of July 1994, as being the victims of the genocide-related killings. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Now, let us briefly revisit issues relating to Mathieu Ngirumpatse and what you may know of him.  Did you ever hear any speeches delivered by Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No.  I have no recollection of any such speeches. 
Q.	As far as you know, Witness, was Mathieu Ngirumpatse such a public figure that he could have been said to belong to any category of political figures in Rwanda from 1992 to around 1994? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse was clearly identified, first of all, as secretary general and subsequently as the president of the MRND.  But in political spheres and among intellectuals, he was not known to be a radical, not at all.  He was actually known to be a man of dialogue, someone with whom you could have a rational discussion and who had considerations about the future of the country. 
Q.	Was he reputed to be one who had ethnic-based inclinations? 
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	Was he known to have sectarian views and to have extremist views? 
A.	That would be -- the -- the answer for his ethnic inclinations would -- would apply to this question.  Because, otherwise, he would have been known to -- somebody who took advantage of fractions and discrimination.  No.  

Politicians and intellectuals knew him to be a man who rallied people together, a man of reconciliation.  And he was a member of the national synthesis commission, which introduced multiparty politics into Rwanda.  

So people knew him to be a person of such a character who was involved in the reform of the MRND, and he was active in the development of the party towards a democratic institution whose objective was to engage in democracy and to separate itself from the state as such and in which case president -- General Habyarimana handed over the position of president of the chairman to him and also handed over the position of chief of general staff.  

So I think that people generally knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse to be a moderate, a proponent of democracy, and who played an important role in the development of the MRND. 
Q.	Witness, did you ever learn that at any point in time whatsoever Mathieu Ngirumpatse had any behaviour or any actions that may have pointed towards a discriminatory attitude against anybody whosoever based on ethnic or regional considerations? 
A.	I have already answered that question.  My answer is no.  Even in relation to the political divisions that may have existed, let me avail myself of this opportunity to say that when**************, *************** and the spouse of *********************************and their four children found themselves in a -- in an extremely difficult situation near Gisenyi in June 1994, my brother-in-law, Pio, was trying to find a way to put them in a safe place.  He talked to Mathieu Ngirumpatse and asked for assistance.  

Knowing my brother-in-law, he would never have talked to Mathieu Ngirumpatse if he had not trusted him, if he had suspected even an -- for an iota that such a request would jeopardise Assumpta and the children's lives.  

So Mathieu Ngirumpatse at that time contacted one of his contacts, who at the time was a lieutenant, I believe, and that lieutenant made it possible for **************and the four children to find a safe place in one of the rooms at the Hôtel Méridien in Gisenyi.  

And in order not to have them bothered, there was a notice on the door of that room that it was a room reserved for the general staff.  You may want to know that the Méridien hotel was the head office of the interim government.  

And so Mathieu Ngirumpatse was aware of the location where Assumpta and the children had been taken.  They spent about one week in that room before they were again taken away by Cléophas Kanyarwanda, who was a friend from Goma and who was the leader of the bank of the economic community of the Great Lakes region, before that friend was able to move Assumpta and the children and evacuate them on a two-lap trip to Goma.  

During that trip they were confronted by the French forces who had just arrived.  They were taken to Bangui and then taken to Paris where Jean-Marie Ndagijimana, ambassador of Rwanda in Paris and member of the MDR and native of the same area as ******************************hosted them.  

It is my father, my papa, who went to fetch them in Paris and bring them to Brussels and reunite the family in that manner.  So Mathieu Ngirumpatse was fully aware of the location to which Assumpta and the children had been kept over several days.  If he had had any intention or idea whatsoever to take it out on them, they would have been an easy target. 
Q.	Witness, *************, whom you have referred to, ******************, ****************(sic), who has been identified as one of those who attended your wedding under photograph A, is that the person you are talking about? 
A.	Yes.  She is the one, and she is also my ***************************
Q.	Witness, we have a statement from Madam *********************in which she stated that she owed her survival to the assistance provided to her and her children during that darkest and most tragic phase of the history of Rwanda.  Are you confirming this testimony, Witness?
A.	Well, I was not aware that she had written something.  But I am able to recognise her handwriting, if I were able to see it. 
Q.	Well, I'm not able to place that document before you.  But in any event, the statement I'm referring to has been transcribed and typed.  But are you in a position to confirm that, if she is even able to communicate with you, it is thanks to Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes.  She told me herself the story.  And Kayibanda himself also confirmed the -- the story because he is the one who contacted Ngirumpatse for that purpose. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have about 20 minutes more to go in my examination-in-chief of this witness.  I don't know whether it would not be appropriate to continue with those questions after the break.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we -- we take the luncheon adjournment now.
(Court recessed at 1232H) 
(Pages 29 to 39 by Tanya West)





























(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon. 

Mr. Weyl, you may continue. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I'm going to try to be very -- as brief as possible. 
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 

Witness, this morning you talked about how much Ngirumpatse helped to save the life of children of -- Mathieu -- to save the lives of the children of Ngirumpatse (sic).  
A.	I recall that on several occasions people said that Mathieu had said -- saved several lives, but I cannot give any identities. 
Q.	Witness, the issue is this:  One of the charges brought against Mathieu Ngirumpatse is to have supported the -- the interim government.  And, in other words, that he did not leave when he encountered difficulties.  Do you think that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, if he had jumped ship, if he had left, would have been able to save the lives of********* -- the lives of the children of************************? 
A.	Materially, I don't see how he would have been able to save the lives of my sister-in-law and her children if he had left Rwanda in April.

I believe that to leave the government at a time that things were going bad, and in fact very bad, would have been the easy way out.  Probably understandable.  To stay was a difficult choice.  And the fact that by staying back he contributed -- he assisted in saving human lives.  I will say that that choice was not a useless one. 
Q.	Witness, among the charges that the Prosecutor brought against Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- and a reference is made to the fact -- fact that he had a certain authority -- the Prosecutor charges that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, through his speeches -- as a result of his speeches the refugees of Hôtel des Mille Collines, and refugees of a parish -- refugees of the Sainte Famille were in 
	Amahoro stadium. 
A.	I'm sorry, Your Honour, I don't understand.  It's difficult to follow the -- counsel.  I don't understand his question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, the interpreters didn't quite get you.  So could you repeat the question, please. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't hear. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
I was addressing Mr. Weyl, because the interpreters did not get his question and could not translate it into English, so I was asking him to repeat it. 
MR. WEYL:
Regrettably, Mr. President, I cannot reformulate the question exactly the way I did.  Further, there was one thing I forgot to do when we resumed.  As a result, I'm unable to repeat what I said. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well then, let's move on.  It may come back. 
MR. WEYL:
My difficulty is not to re -- is not to put the question, but to put it in exactly the same terms that I did earlier. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  But you're not obliged to do that.  The main thing is to elicit information that's essential -- essential to your case.  So you put a question that can do that.  The last question was not translated, so there's no record of it.  So let's move on.  
MR. WEYL:  
That's what I'm doing, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Witness, when Mathieu Ngirumpatse managed to save -- to contribute to saving the lives of the refugees of Hôtel des Mille Collines, refugees at the Amahoro stadium, refugees of the 
	Holy Family parish, do you think he could have done so if he had opted -- if he had opted -- taken the easy way out, that is, opted out of the country?  
A.	In the prevailing situation in Rwanda at the time, I don't know how he would have been able to influence events within the country if he were outside the country. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  To your knowledge, did the RPF respect civilian population in Rwanda prior to the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I will answer in two ways.  The first one relates to information that I gathered personally.  I was in regular contact with some members of a -- human rights associations, particularly the ADL, and 
	André Sibomana, Monique Mujawamariya.  It is obvious that hearing them -- reading their reports, one observes that civilian populations were very often the targets of shots from zones under the control of the RPF.  And the fact that on the 5th of April 1990 -- 1994 there was one out of five Rwandans who fled the areas under the RPF control.  

And the other aspect is that -- and that is again -- that is information collected by human rights associations and collated in a report.  It also talks about the flight of civilians who were in areas controlled by the RPF. 
Q.	Witness, to your knowledge, the RPF -- did the RPF respect civilian populations -- civilian populations after the 6th of April and all the way up to 14th July 1994? 
A.	One of my friends was working in the Mutara area for a development association, and he was a witness of what happened in that area.  He left where he was working in Gituza, towards Giti, and was taken to Uganda.  He was a witness to a number of things that happened against civilian populations.  

Another -- information was brought to my attention by the wife of Matata, who was a human rights activist.  She is a Tutsi.  She and her children were wounded during the genocide.  They had gathered with other persons in a camp in Rwamagana.  When she got to Belgium she told me how RPF troops would separate the populations of the camp, and systematically they would take the Hutus away in trucks and they never came back.  

She also told me how the Tutsis try to explain that these people had protected them, and on such occasions the RPF troops would threaten them and ask them to get on to the trucks with the others. 
Q.	Witness, the civilian population that the RPF threatened, killed in the course of its triumphant march into Rwanda, did the civilian population have the right to any kind of protection? 
A.	I'm not a lawyer, but I think war should not concern civilian populations. 
Q.	Witness, do you think it was legitimate, after the 6th of April 1994, up to 13th July, 14th July 1994 -- and why not after that date -- to do everything in an attempt to save human lives, and all human lives? 
A.	To put the question at all is in fact to answer the question.  And I think that is obvious. 
Q.	Witness, after the 6th of April, in your opinion, who could have stopped the tragedy? 
A.	In the very early days when the killings had not spread across the entire ter -- national territory it was obvious that an efficient intervention by UN troops accompanied by the Belgian-French troops who had come for repatriation operation could have changed the situation. 

Another factor is the American troops that I saw at the Bujumbura airport, and it appears they had been there for some days. 

Subsequently, I think the very fact that officers remain in Rwanda and were subsequently reintegrated is an indication that most of the Rwandan -- troops of the Rwandan armed forces did not participate in the killing.  They were -- if they were deployed to maintain peace rather than deployed to the war front, things could have been different. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

Do you think that Mathieu Ngirumpatse could have prevented what UNAMIR was not able to prevent? 
A.	I don't see how. 
Q.	Witness, do you think that deploying diplomatic efforts to obtain a ceasefire, to obtain an intervention force, is that a contribution to -- to maintain the massacres, or is that an effort to save human lives? 
A.	There again, to ask the question at all is to answer it.  It is obvious that if both parties had accepted the ceasefire unconditionally -- unconditionally -- without prior conditions, would have made it possible for the Rwandan armed forces and the gendarmerie to focus their efforts on public order. 
Q.	Witness, do you think that Opération turquoise helped in saving human lives? 
A.	Certainly so, starting with the head of the family, Vincent Mubiligi, who was a lecturer at the medical school, plus several other doctors who fled towards the zone -- the turquoise operational area.  The turquoise zone is where they -- they settled.  And in that area the killings had stopped and the refugees of Nyarushishi camp where Dr. Mubiligi was, who were many thousands, owe their survival to the presence of the zone turquoise.  Zone turquoise is in the south-eastern region of Rwanda, and that also assisted the flight of Rwandans towards Zaire.  And there weren't as many epidemics, as much as in the Bukavu area. 
Q.	Witness, do you think that having contributed, through his own efforts, to the establishment to anything that could have saved human lives, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, in his own way, has discharged his duty?  
A.	All efforts that were deployed to limit the killings, indeed as far as I am concerned, is in response to the very first duty call. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, gentlemen, I have no further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 

Mr. Sow, do you have any questions of this witness?  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  I will take a maximum of ten minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, my name is Moussa Félix Sow and I represent the interest of Mr. Édouard Karemera.  A while ago when Mr. Weyl examined you, you were saying that there were infiltrators in communes that had high concentration of Tutsi civilian population.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	I said that I myself, speaking to persons in communes that I visited regularly, which were communes that had high proportion of Tutsi, I said that I did hear people talking about infiltration. 

In any event, young persons who left their houses for several months and came back, and who were considered by the local population as young persons who were -- who left to be trained by the RPF and who came back. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to give us the names -- to name these communes? 
A.	Yes.  Mainly the two communes in which I was doing the interfacing -- the training, that is, 
	Musambira commune in Gitarama, and Rusatira commune in Butare commune -- in Butare préfecture. 
Q.	Did you hear about such infiltrators in other communes? 
A.	Not directly to me.  I heard people say -- I was not told directly in respect of the places, but just like everybody else I heard people saying it. 
Q.	And which other communes were they mentioning, apart from the two you've mentioned? 
A.	It was fairly general across the whole of Rwanda.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President, I am done.  

And thank you, Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, you will now have to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor and you will have to respond to the questions. 
MS. WILSON:
Good afternoon, everyone.  My name is Maria Wilson.  I am one of the attorneys representing the Prosecutor in this case. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. WILSON:  
Q.	Madam Witness, thank you for being here today.  You were born and raised in Belgium; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You described yourself as someone in a special position, an insider in contact with political leaders, an active observer; did you not? 
A.	I said that my status as a European living and married to a Rwandan accorded me a particular position in relation to other expatriates.  

Living with my -- life with my husband and contact with a number of politicians, enabled me to have a certain peculiar approach to political life which was more of an internal approach than what most expatriates would normally have. 
Q.	Yes.  That is what I was saying:  You -- you described yourself as an insider, so that was correct.  

So it's true that you are not an expert? 
A.	Certainly not. 
Q.	You have been asked some questions by the Defence attorney about your opinions on several different issues.  For example, Opération turquoise, where they could have helped save lives, and your answer is from your own personal thoughts on the matter.  You don't have any particular expertise to explain why they would or -- why they could or could not have saved lives?  
A.	And I answered in respect to the turquoise operation on the basis of accounts produced by heads of the family doctor, François (sic) Mubiligi, and some of my colleagues from the National University of Rwanda who survived because they had sought refuge on the -- in the area under the 
turquoise operation. 
Q.	So you -- you agree that most of the information and testimony that you have provided here to the Court today is information that you have re -- received second-hand and third-hand, because you were not in Rwanda after the 9th of April.  Is that not so? 
A.	I said so from the beginning. 
Q.	Yeah.  And you also agree that your perception of the Rwandan society could never be the same as that of a Rwandan? 
A.	Each person has a perception that is different and that is inherent in that person's personality and knowledge.  I do not think that there is a -- a unanimous perception of the Rwandan society by all Rwandans, nor a unanimous perception of the Rwandan society by all expatriates who lived in Rwanda, or a common view of all experts who studied the Rwandan problem. 
Q.	I agree with you.  But you accept that, as a Belgian, you could never understand the Rwandan society as well as a Rwandan? 
A.	Certainly.  But not every national will understand it in the same way.  Each national will understand the situation in Rwanda in the light of his own background. 
Q.	And your background was that of a nurse, do you agree? 
A.	When I arrived in Rwanda in 1992 I had the training of a nurse.  I was also trained in 
	socio-medical science, hospital science.  I spent four years undergoing this training. 
Q.	Excuse me, Madam Witness.  I just want to know if primarily you consider yourself as a nurse? 
A.	No.  I arrived in Rwanda to teach at the National University of Rwanda, not to provide health care.  That was in March 1992.  
Q.	So you were -- are you saying that you are a nurse, as well as a teacher in the health area? 
A.	I was teaching at the National University of Rwanda, particularly in the organisation of health services and health economics on the basis of my university training in medical, social sciences.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...what I'm asking you.  So you're teaching a subject in the area that you specialised, which is in the health area.  Do you agree?  

You -- you shook your head, but you need to say yes, for the record. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you were not a political analyst, a historian, a psychologist or forensic pathologist; correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You agree that you lived continuously in Rwanda for only two years?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And that -- and that was from March 1992 until April 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And during those two years you lived in Kigali for approximately seven months continuously? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you spend most of the two years in Butare then? 
A.	Certainly. 
Q.	And being married to a Rwandan, can it truly assist in your -- in the impressions which form of the Rwandan society, can it?  Your own personal perceptions. 
A.	Being married to a Rwandan opened some doors to me.  That is undeniable.  But I had known Rwanda before I got married. 

Being married to a Rwandan, and particularly to Hildebrand Kayibanda, with all that this entailed, as political commitment opened a number of doors to me and enabled me to meet many people that a lot of other people may not have had the opportunity of meeting.  All these meetings also helped me to have my perception of the Rwandan society. 
Q.	And you said you knew Rwanda before meeting your husband.  Would you agree that coming to Rwanda for several short visits can you -- cannot give you a proper impression of the country, can it? 
A.	I think that it all depends on how you carry out visits, even short-term visits.  If you live on the hills and share people's lives, you could at least have a perception of the life they live where they are.  I do not claim that during the years that preceded my settling in Rwanda that I had an overall view of the whole Rwandan society. 
Q.	And you said that by 1994 you could understand Kinyarwanda; is that not so? 
A.	I learnt Kinyarwanda gradually with the rural population from 1992.  In 1994, I can say that I was -- had a reasonable mastery of it. 
Q.	So therefore prior to 1994 your knowledge of Kinyarwanda was what you would describe as rudimentary, or basic, or very, very limited? 
A.	Kinyarwanda is not learnt in six months.  If -- if in 1994 I was able to find my way in Kinyarwanda, in fact this means I learnt gradually and that means that in 1992, 1993 that progress was already underway, the progress I made in the mastery of Rwanda -- or Kinyarwanda, rather, was already underway in 1992, 1993. 
Q.	Underway, but you had not mastered the language in '92 or '93, agreed? 
A.	Even in 1994 I did not write an exam to indicate that I had mastered the language. 
Q.	But it's only by 1994 that you felt comfortable enough to clearly understand the language.  I'm just repeating what you said in your evidence in chief.  By 1994 you were able to clearly understand Kinyarwanda.  That's so, isn't it? 
A.	No.  That is not what I said.  I don't think that is what I said.  I said that in 1994 I was capable of understanding.  I did not say that it was only from 1994 that I was able to understand.  I was treating people on the hills in health centres well before.  In order to be able to treat them, in order to be able to carry out diagnosis and prescribe training and explain to them how to take the treatment, it was necessary for me to be able to understand them and to express myself to them. 
Q.	Do you agree that you need to master the language of -- of the Rwandese before you could have a proper and true appreciation of its society and its politics? 
A.	If I say so, then almost every expert who worked on Rwanda should be recused.  That is, those experts who do not speak Kinyarwanda should all be excluded, their testimony should be excluded. 
Q.	But you -- you claim that you're not an expert, so I'm just asking you if you agree with that concept that you should in fact understand a language fully in order to understand the culture and the politics of a country? 
A.	I do not know what you mean by fully understanding a language. 
Q.	Madam Witness, we have your answer on record, that by -- by 1994 you had a clear understanding of the language. 

Were you ever a member of the MDR? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Were you ever a member of the MRND? 
A.	No.  Neither was I a member of any party in Rwanda. 
Q.	So you wouldn't have any in-depth understanding and knowledge of the structure of the MRND, would you? 
A.	I never said that I had in-depth knowledge of the structure of the MRND, nor of the MDR.  I'm saying that I knew people and I had talked a great deal with people.  I also believe I based my evidence on what I had heard, lived through, and what I had seen. 
Q.	So your political views were formed by the views of the other members of the -- in -- of politics -- the other politicians you met whilst you were in Rwanda for those two years? 
A.	To the extent that I met people from practically all the political parties, yes. 
Q.	Whilst you were in Rwanda for those years, two years, were you a full-time nurse or lecturer in 
	medical sciences? 
A.	I was a teacher, full-time teacher at the National University of Rwanda in the area of public health, and particularly in the area of the organisation of health services.  From October 1993 I was also on a part-time basis working for Doctors Without Borders in the Burundi refugee camp in Butare préfecture. 
Q.	So you were very active and busy in your professional life, weren't you? 
A.	In fact, I had long working hours. 
Q.	And your keen interest in Rwandan politics then was something of a pastime outside of your working hours? 
A.	I did not have a clear obvious interest in politics, but the people I met, in fact in conversations with them I heard their views and various positions.  But I did not show interest in political life.  I met people from various political parties.  The environment in which I worked, and on the basis of the relations with my husband, made it -- well, the people I met -- most of the people -- met -- for that reason -- were involved in political activities. 

Furthermore, I also met many people who were involved in associations. 
Q.	Okay.  This morning we spent quite a long time looking at your personal wedding photos, didn't we?  From what you said in relation to the persons you identified in those photos, it seems that members of the Rwandan political elite attended your wedding; is that not so? 
A.	Some of them were there.  The entire government was not there.  You saw the row on which ministers were sitting, there were some ministers there.  Not every minister was there.  Far be that -- well, that was certainly not the case, not all of them were there. 
Q.	And you invited Hutu and Tutsis to your wedding, did you not? 
A.	The spokesperson of my father was Tutsi.  The -- my husband's spokesperson -- or, rather, the spokesperson of my husband's family was Tutsi.  In my family, on my husband's side, at that time and even today there are always Hutus, Tutsis, people from the north, people from the south, people from all origins. 
Q.	Yes.  So the guests that you invited, it was a reflection of the type of friends that you and your husband had, was it not?  You mixed freely with many different peoples of different ethnic groups, yes? 
A.	We met people from all ethnic groups, that's true.  But you should remember that in a wedding in Rwanda there are people that you would invite and there are others who come out of sympathy.  It is not like a European or American marriage where you come with your invitation ticket.  No, that is not the way it operates in Rwanda. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you -- you don't have to be defensive in your responses, I just want to ascertain certain facts from what you've indicated in your direct.  Yeah.  

And you indicated when you were going through some of photos that some of the Tutsis you identified, they had in fact become victims -- they were killed in the events of 1994, is that not true? 
A.	Some of them.  If you look at the photos closely -- 
Q.	(Microphone not activated) 
A.	-- the -- my husband's best man --  
Q.	Oh, you don't -- you don't need to repeat the evidence, Madam Witness.  I'm just simply asking you if some of them became victims. 
A.	There were many victims among the Hutus and also the Tutsis who had attended our wedding, beginning with my husband's****************.  My -- the family of*********************************, which was completely killed, and they were Hutus. 
Q.	And you identified some Hutu who were in fact convicted for genocide who attended your wedding, yes? 
A.	Indeed, among those who attended our wedding, some were convicted for genocide. 
Q.	Now, you said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse attended your wedding.  Yes?  Which -- which aspect of the celebrations did he attend, the morning or the reception, which aspect of it? 
A.	He attended the Mass, and I think he was also present at the reception.  But I don't remember having seen him, but during the period -- the waiting period before the Mass he was there and he was also there during the Mass. 
Q.	And it was upon -- and that was the -- the one and only time you said you met Mathieu, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Was he your husband's friend?  Is that why he was invited? 
A.	No.  He was not a personal friend of my husband's, in fact there is a generation gap between them.  But certainly he was a friend to my father-in-law who died in 1976.  And I think it is in that capacity that he came. 
Q.	And so from that one meeting alone you would say that you -- you don't have -- you don't know Mathieu Ngirumpatse personally, do you? 
A.	Certainly. 
Q.	The knowledge you have of him is of his public image, is that not right? 
A.	Partially.  The other part being what the people I spoke with told me and who were -- and those people were involved in political activities. 
Q.	Again, this is information you obtained from others second-hand, or third-hand perhaps, yes? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness nods.  We don't know -- 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Can you please state an answer so that it can be recorded.  Sorry, the reporters don't have an answer from you. 
A.	Yes.  Yes.  Since I did not personally know him. 
Q.	You said after the wedding ceremony you received a call from your **********************in relation to an incident involving Mathieu Ngirumpatse; correct? 
A.	He phoned my husband. 
Q.	So you received from your husband, who received from********************, information about an incident involving Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you said that he was involved in an incident with the Interahamwe.  There was a clash between him and the Interahamwe, yes?  That's what you said.  
A.	I said that my brother-in-law Pio Kayibanda had told us that on his return to his house Mathieu Ngirumpatse had clashed with people who were defined or presented as Interahamwe. 
Q.	But you don't have any information about the circumstances under which that clash occurred, do you? 
A.	The only information which I had in addition is that, according to what my brother-in-law said, the clash was related to the presence of Mr. Ngirumpatse at our wedding rather than at the burial of the son of Noël Mudabariki. 
Q.	And you are not able to say for certain who were the persons who got into this clash with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, are you?  
A.	I was in Butare.  The clash occurred in Kigali.

1500H 
BY MS. WILSON:  
Q.	Now, during the events you were in Butare for some four days; is that not correct? 
A.	Three days. 
Q.	And during those three -- that's from the 6th to the 8th, you would say, of April? 
A.	I said we had been warned -- or, rather, informed of the shooting of the plane rather late, around midnight.  So we could say it was the 7th.  

So the three days therefore relate to the 6th and 7th and 8th, in the full moon, because on the 8th we were at the border with Burundi. 
Q.	And during the time that you were in Butare between the 6th and the 8th, you were in hiding at the friend -- at the house of a friend; is that not true? 
A.	I said that we stayed the night of the 6th to the 7th in the house of a friend, that on the 8th we returned to our house.  We returned there in the morning.  We only stayed one night out of our own house. 
Q.	And then you left the country on the morning of the 9th? 
A.	Yes, in the morning. 
Q.	So any testimony you gave in relation to the events in Kigali was information which you acquired from other persons, second-hand or third-hand, or after you left the country; is that not true? 
A.	Save for information which was given to us directly by telephone, information given to us by people who called us from Kigali, yes. 
Q.	Yes.  You had no direct knowledge of the events that occurred in Kigali because, of course, you were not there? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Is Mathieu Ngirumpatse the only member of the MRND for whom you have testified?  Yeah? 

I'll repeat the question:  You're now testifying on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Have you testified for any other members of the MRND? 
A.	I don't think so. 
Q.	You don't think so? 
A.	In any event, I have no recollection of that. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...it's something you would remember.  Don't you say?  If you testified before these courts, you would have remembered; would you not? 
A.	This is the first time I'm testifying before the Tribunal.  I gave another testimony in a cour d'assises in Belgium and for the court in Vincent Ntezimana, who was not a member of the MRND. 
Q.	And was it your idea to testify on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, or were you contacted by the Defence team? 
A.	This testimony came just by chance, as a result of the meeting between my mother and Mathieu Ngirumpatse's wife.  My mother did not know the person she was meeting.  When she came back from where they met, she came -- she passed by our house and then we started discussing.  And I told her that the only thing I know about Mathieu Ngirumpatse, in terms of specific fact, is this clash that occurred in the evening -- the evening after our wedding. 
Q.	Thank you.  So the only fact you know about him was that clash.  And even that clash, you said you do not know the circumstances under which it occurred.  
A.	In terms of specific facts concerning me, yes. 
Q.	So you agree that most of your testimony that you've given here today is very general knowledge which you've acquired from your friends, either second-hand or third-hand, or after you left Rwanda.  
A.	Not after my departure from Rwanda. 
Q.	You departed from Rwanda on the 9th of April 1994.  So after you departed you would've acquired more information about the events; is that not so? 
A.	The facts that occurred prior to the 9th -- the 6th April 1994 I got to know before.  And the facts that occurred -- or the acts that occurred after the 6th of April, and after the genocide, I got to know subsequently. 
Q.	And, in particular, you gave evidence about RPF killings.  This is information again which you do not have of your own personal knowledge.  This information was given to you by different individuals; is that not so? 
A.	Regarding the killings that I got to know and which occurred prior to 6 April 1994, I got to know them from persons who were working as human rights -- in the human rights organisations and that I know and that I referred to.  

Those that occurred after the 6th of April 1994, I got to know from people working in human rights organisations and from witnesses.  I made reference to this witness who lived and worked in 
Gituza and the wife of Joseph Matata. 
Q.	And all this information you acquired from persons, second-hand or third-hand, you never had the opportunity of verifying this information; did you? 
A.	How was I to verify them?  If not by asking people who were on the spot, who observed the same thing, but to verify myself on the field is something that is not possible. 
Q.	You just simply gathered information from several -- from one or two persons; yes? 
A.	Well, I'm not an investigator. 
Q.	That's my next question.  You never engaged any investigations into this matter.  It's just your own personal views that you have acquired from several people; is that not true? 
A.	Indeed, I'm not an investigator. 
Q.	Thank you.  That would be all.  
MS. WILSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, do you have any redirect with this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have very few. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, Vincent Mubiligi, you saw him again after his departure from Rwanda? 
A.	Vincent Mubiligi really did not leave Rwanda except when he came to Belgium in 2001 to testify.  So he remained in Rwanda.  
Q.	You saw Vincent Mubiligi again? 
A.	I saw him in December 1994.  I saw him in November 1995.  I saw him 2001.  
Q.	He's the living proof of his existence?  
A.	Up until his death, yes.  Until when he died, because he died of a lung oedema -- he died, I think, in 2005. 
Q.	But then, Witness, when the Prosecutor wanted you to say, to admit that you were recounting evidence that you got second or third-hand, I would think that the existence of Vincent is the very evidence of his survival and the circumstances that allowed him to survive.  I think so.  This is not second or third-hand.
 MS. WILSON: 
Excuse me.  It seems as if the Defence counsel is now giving evidence. 
MR. WEYL: 
I believe we have the witness's answer. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, the Prosecutor told you that you're recounting evidence from second and third-hand sources.  I have an arithmetic problem.  Did you recount something told you by somebody who was testifying?  That would be a second-hand -- or are you recounting something first-hand? 
A.	To the extent -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is too argumentative.  This is re-examination.  And these are matters which you should address the Court when you are trying to persuade us to accept the witness's testimony. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm not trying to be argumentative.  I just wanted things to be very clear to avoid any doubt.  When the witness answered the Prosecutor's question that she was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is no arguing with the Bench about a ruling we've just made.  

Please ask the witness another question in redirect. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Madam Witness, there was Kagiraneza's testimony.  Was it a direct testimony or 
	second-hand testimony? 
A.	It was direct testimony. 
Q.	Witness, is it the same with that of Sendashonga? 
A.	It was direct. 
Q.	Madam Witness, is it the same with Dashunta (sic)? 
A.	It was direct. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I have a last question.  Among those -- among those who were present at your wedding, there were some who had been found guilty of genocide.  Were some -- are there some that are acquitted as a result of false charges of genocide being brought against them? 
A.	The spokesperson of my family's -- of my family -- my husband's family, Augustin Karama, was in prison and subsequently released in Rwanda.  He was in prison for genocide and was released.  I don't know the exact nature of the decision, but in any event there was no trial against him. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I have no further question and I really want to tell you how happy we are that you came to illuminate the Chamber on a number of issues.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for the witness, but I have the usual request that I make to the Bench.  If the Bench would allow -- or order the registry to facilitate a meeting between the witness and Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.

Madam Witness, your testimony is now completed and we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  

The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate the request that Mr. Weyl has just made, but you're now excused.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The -- Ms. Hounkpatin, you're taking the next witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President.  

I don't have my headset, but I think I heard your question. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
You did answer the question I asked.

Who is the witness, and do we have an issue with protective measures or has that been resolved?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
In principle, there should be no problem, because he had requested his protection to be waived.  I don't know if he completed the procedure with WVSS.  

I do not know, Mr. President, if you have received a document which the previous witness has signed and whether he has gone through with this procedure.  But otherwise I think he'll be ready to sign it to regularise the procedure. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.

Was his pseudonym A2?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
That is so, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The document is there.  We have an affidavit with that. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
That reassures me, because I thought it had been done. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just a point of clarification, the Chamber had previously made an order for your protection for 
security reasons, one element of which would have been that your testimony -- or your identity would have been concealed from the public.  

Counsel has indicated that you wish to waive those protections and we have seen an affidavit which you have signed.  And we just ask for confirmation that that is your position. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is my decision. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  In those circumstances we rescind the order and he now testifies in public.

Mr. Registrar, you may draw the screens.

Mr. Witness, before you testify, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by Léonidas Murembya in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good afternoon, everyone. 
LÉONIDAS MUREMBYA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  You have before you a document containing your personal data.  I want you to go through that very quickly, your name, your date -- your place of birth.  If there's any typographical error, please point that out to the Court.  Then you correct it, initial it, and then you date and sign the document, that is, if there are no errors.

Have you found any errors? 
A.	Yes, there are a few.  So I'm correcting -- I'm writing the correct thing next to -- should I write in next to it?  
Q.	Which line?  Which line are you referring to? 
A.	The commune is Bugembazi.
Q.	So write that next to it because there's a bit of space there. 
A.	And then there is the current occupation; I'm a lecturer. 
Q.	Can't you say it in French?  Put it in English then.  
A.	Civil servant. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
	Thank you, Mr. Charles Faye.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Have you dated and signed the document? 
A.	Yes, it's done. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. Issa, please retrieve the document.

And, Mr. President, we wish to move for the acceptance of this document onto the records. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted -- admitted in evidence.
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
According to the tally that I have, and I stand corrected by Issa, the registry clerk, the document should be marked D. NG124.  I stand corrected by Mr. Issa. 
MR. MJUI:
The number is correct.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. NG124 admitted) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. Issa. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Murembya, I'm going to advise you on some preliminary issues so that we can proceed smoothly.  You and I are going to try and speak -- speak in French.  And for that reason you have to be careful and pause briefly before you answer my questions.  This will enable the interpreters to interpret my question into English and avoid a situation where your answer and mine overlap.  If you want an indicator, you can keep watching the lights on the microphone of the English interpreter so that you and I do not overlap.

Secondly, you have to speak slowly, because you observe there are two stenographers taking your testimony.  They're working very fast to record your testimony, but give them a bit of breathing space to be able to record you accurately.  You understand me?  
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I'm going to examine one issue with you today, and I see that we have a time constraint, we'll nonetheless deal with that issue.

Please tell the Chamber what is your academic background? 
A.	Let me start with primary school.  I was born on the Burega hill, B-U-R-E-G-A.  And I did my primary school in Muyanza parish, M-U-Y-A-N-Z-A.  

After my primary 6 education I took the state entrance examination and was admitted into secondary school, Saint André college in Kigali where I spent six years studying humanities, Latin and 
science -- and the sciences.  

After that I was admitted into the Rwanda national university into the social sciences and economics faculty for five years, and I came out with the equivalent of a Bachelor's degree.

After that I got a job in Kigali and I worked as a research assistant in a project financed by the 
US international development agency.  And I was assisting Professor Donald Mead who was also a lecturer at the Michigan University.  It was from 1988 to around the end of 1990. 
Q.	Witness, you mention some names.  Can you spell them? 
A.	Donald Mead, M-E-A-D.  May I continue?  
Q.	Yes.  Let me just point this out.  This afternoon is just a training session and I realise that you have not been respecting the pause between my question and your answer, so think about that.  
JUDGE KAM: 
Counsel, I don't know if, just aside, you observed the fact that your witness has some difficulty in French.  I don't know if he'll be more comfortable speaking English.  It's his -- it's his choice to testify in the language that he feels more comfortable. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Judge Kam.  

You do know, I think -- took the prior -- I took care initially to ask the witness in which language he wanted to testify.  I realise that he's more at ease in -- in English, but yesterday he told me he wanted to testify in French.  You can count on me to stop him if there is too much English intrusion into his testimony.  

But in any event I think we've come to the end of the day.  It's past 15 -- 1530 hours.

Mr. President, I'm not usurping your rule.  I'm just pointing out the fact that we're beyond time, but I'll also make sure that I advise my witness in which language to testify. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You know the rule.  Now he has started to testify, during this or any adjournment, he's not allowed to discuss his testimony or the case with anybody.  So it would be improper for you to discuss the situation with him at this stage.  

But the witness -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
You misunderstood me, Mr. President.  You really thought that I would breach the professional rules to speak to a witness who has testified and who is testifying before you.  Never, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I didn't mean to upset you, but I was just responding to what I thought you said.
Anyway, the witness has heard the issue and he'll be able to let us know tomorrow morning how he wishes to proceed.

I should remind you, as I just said, that during this or any adjournment while you're a witness you're not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  

I'm going to take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.
(Court adjourned at 1535H)
