CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Good morning, Professor Des Forges. 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	I hope you slept well. 

If you turn to tab number 3 in the Defence bundle, this is another excerpt from your book, this time the English version. There is a section here which, I -- I think, purports to describe in some way your research methodology.  The last paragraphs -- of the first half of the page, "This study" -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	"This study, summarised in the introduction, describes in detail how the killing campaign was executed linking oral testimony with extensive written documentation. 

"It draws upon interviews with those who were marked for extinction but managed to survive, those who killed or directed killings, those who saved or sought to save others, and those who watched and tried not to see it.  

"It presents minutes of local meetings where operations against local Tutsi were planned, and correspondence in which administrators congratulated their subordinates for successfully destroying the enemy.  

"It analyses the layers of language and the silences that made up the deceptive discourse of genocide, broadcast on radio and delivered at public meetings.  It places genocide in the immediate political context showing how local and national political rivalries among Hutu influenced the course of the campaign to eliminate Tutsis. 

"It traces changes and tactics and organisation of the campaign as well as its collapse as the RPF defeated the genocidal government.  Drawing on many sources, including previously unpublished testimony and documents from diplomats and United Nations staff, the study shows how international actors failed to avert or stop the genocide. 

"It ties the expansion of the killing campaign to early international inertia and it shows the international protest against the slaughter when they finally came were discussed even at local meetings on the distant hills of Rwanda. 

"Thus the study establishes that the international community so anxious to absent itself from the scene was, in fact, present at the genocide."

Can I ask you this:  When you began this research what was your hypothesis? 
A.	The hypothesis formulated in advance of research is a part of the methodology of many social scientist, but not always part of the methodology of historians. 

Historians, of course, begin with the general interpretation of events -- that is to say, a sense of who did what, when and where.  But a hypothesis in the sense of a verifiable explanation of the phenomena is not frequently a part of historical methodology.  Nor was it, in a strict sense, part of my methodology -- that is to say, I did not have a hypothesis postulated, which I set out to prove.  Rather, I had a sense that there were multiple sources of information available and I preferred to consult those sources and to let the interpretation evolve from the facts themselves.  

I am not, in short, a highly theoretical historian.  There are highly theoretical historians who construct abstract notions of their interpretation of events and then set out, in a sense, to prove that.  I'm not one of those; I do not have that kind of abstract theoretical turn of mind. 
Q.	Well, wouldn't it be correct to say that a hypothesis is not a theory that one sets out to prove, but rather a theory which enables one to set the parameters of what one is looking for?  When one sets a hypothesis one is not setting out to prove that hypothesis, one is simply setting out the parameters of the direction one is going to go into, but one stays open minded as to whether that hypothesis will be correct or wrong.
A.	As I say, I'm not a person who takes a great interest in theoretical discussions of such definitions.  If you wish to use that as the definition of hypothesis, let us take that and say, "All right, I had a hypothesis in that sense, a hypothesis that there had been a considerable involvement of state actors in carrying through the violence against Tutsi.  That this was not spontaneous violence but, rather, state directed, as was often the case in genocides elsewhere." 
Q.	You, of course, having been involved in one way or another with Rwanda for some -- well, now some 40 years, at that time presumably some 30 years, had experience of other massacres in Rwanda and in Burundi, which perhaps you feel now or -- or felt then, presented some consistency or pattern.  Would that be right? 
A.	In the most narrow sense, yes, that would be correct.  But in a broader sense, my study of Rwanda and of Burundi, to a lesser extent, had also convinced me of the overarching importance of the state in mobilising and controlling the population.  So, in other words, the killing of Tutsi was, if you wish, a subset of that kind of state control, which I had seen manifested in other aspects of life in the region. 
Q.	In your book you have a chapter which is entitled, "Warnings" where you set out a number of events, incidents or circumstances which, I believe, and -- and correct me if I'm wrong here, have led you to the conclusion that the genocide was not spontaneous and that there was a lead up to it and perhaps some element of planning prior to the 6th of April. 
A.	My conclusions about the extent of planning for the massive killing of Tutsi include those elements set out in the chapter that you have cited and then additional information as well, which has become available as increasing numbers of documents and testimonies have become available - relevant -- excuse me, relevant to that issue. 
Q.	Yes.  You said a moment ago that when you were describing having -- well, I accept that you -- you don't like the notion of hypothesis, but when you described the form of hypothesis as I had defined it, you indicated that your -- your hypothesis in that sense involved the idea or the theory that there was involvement of the state actors in the genocide.  

Your -- your knowledge of what you described as the warnings, did that provide you with a level of established knowledge by the time you began your research on the genocide about planning?  In other words, when you began your research on the 1994 genocide you were already aware of the warnings, I think.  What was your perception of the warnings at that time? 
A.	In fact, when I began the research there was a great deal -- a great many of those indicators, which are now included in that chapter as warnings, that I was not in fact aware of because some of those -- a substantial amount of that information came from diplomatic correspondence and other confidential sources, which I learned of only in the course of research.  So that was not something I knew at the time I began the research. 
Q.	Did you know about the speech of Leon Mugesera at the time you began the research? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Would it be fair to say that in your analysis of the events in 1994 you have placed some degree of emphasis on the significance of that speech? 
A.	My interpretation of the significance of that speech has developed over time.  When I first learned of the speech, which was in January 1993, a number of weeks after it was given, I learned of it by the report of Rwandans who were horrified by it, and by having the opportunity to obtain a copy of a partial transcript of it.  And it seemed, on the face of it, to be clearly a call for violence. 

Subsequently, I had the opportunity to learn more about actual killings carried out in the region where that speech was given in the immediate weeks after it was given, which indeed lent substance to my conclusion that this had been a call for violence, had been perceived as a call to violence by people in the region, and had then been acted upon.  But this was not information that was available to me at any one moment but has been the result of a number of accretions to my knowledge, shall we say, over time. 
Q.	Now, in those paragraphs, which I cited to you at tab 3, you describe some of your methods of information gathering.  If I could turn to that, what strategy did you adopt for locating documents?  
A.	I put on my oldest clothes and took a shovel and went into the préfecture office and started moving stuff aside and sitting in the middle of the piles and going through piece of paper by piece of paper till I found those that had some relevance to the issue at hand.  It was a grubby, dirty, slow, process, and in the sense that we attempted systemically to sift through the piles in front of us, it was a systematic attempt at exploiting the resources available in one préfecture, but in the sense that the material was totally disorganised and some of it had obviously disappeared, it had been used, for example, by people who had inhabited the space.  

Some of the papers had been used to make fire to cook their food.  Others, I'm sure, disappeared in other uses, so that it was not systematic in the sense that one can speak of consulting an organised archive of government documents.  

So having obtained the permission of the authorities to go into the building, we went in.  It was in a state of total disorder.  No-one was there and we just started going through the stuff. 
Q.	Which building are you referring to? 
A.	This was initially the préfecture office of Butare préfecture.  Subsequently, the commune office in Butare préfecture and various other commune offices in Butare. Then the préfecture office in Gikomero, and some work in the préfecture office of Kibuye and in the commune office Bwakira, B-W-A-K-I-R-A, in Kibuye.  Also Musebeya, M-U-S-E-B-E-Y-A commune in Gikomero.  So generally in the southern and western part of the country. 
Q.	How many préfectures would that be? 
A.	Three préfectures where we worked ourselves directly and then in addition to that, we consulted some other information from two other préfectures, which had not been gathered by us directly but which were original documentary sources.  

In addition to that, there was a certain amount of material available from other préfectures in the country that had been microfilmed by the US Department of Justice, which I also consulted. 
Q.	You indicated that you went through documents to try and identify those which were relevant.  How did you determine relevance? 
A.	Fortunately, the -- the Rwandan administration continued to operate during the genocide as it had operated in previous years and decades -- that is to say, many documents, not all, but many documents were appropriately recorded in categories which were defined by classification numbers.  And there were certain classifications numbers, for example, that identified documents pertaining to civilian self-defence, others that pertained to the civilian self-defence fund, and so on and so forth.   So that once we had established the appropriate file numbers, it was a relatively easy task for us, even for those -- those of my colleagues who did not speak Kinyarwanda, to make a quick evaluation of a document simply by looking at its date and classification number. 

In addition, there were a number of handwritten documents, scraps of notebooks, letters and so on that had not been entered in the formal classification system and those required more careful attention and evaluation of the content in order to determine whether or not it was, in fact, pertinent to our purposes. 
Q.	So there were documents which were left behind? 
A.	Yes.  There were -- in a few cases there was evidence that documents had been removed. 
	For example, in Gikomero préfecture where people had not actually moved in and lived in the préfecture and so things were in much better order the classers -- the binders like these, were on the shelves and were complete up through April and then after that were missing.  So clearly someone had just gathered up the binders for April on and taken them away -- either destroyed them or simply transported them elsewhere. 

So there were cases where you could see there was a clear gap in the record.  But in most of these regions, the -- well, in the regions of Butare people had departed so quickly that most things were left behind -- even if in an unorganised state. 

In Gikomero, as I say, it was different because the French presence made it possible for people to do this in a more orderly fashion and not be so rushed.  In Kibuye, things were quite a mess also and I'm not sure why that was. 
Q.	Of the total number of documents that you recovered and took with you, what proportion came from Butare?  
A.	Under no circumstances did we take any documents with us. 
Q.	Did you -- what did you do?  Did you copy them? 
A.	We copied them and those that we had copied, because we found them of some relevance, were left in an orderly fashion and transmitted to both judicial and administrative authorities in the immediate area.  It is not our practice to take original documents. 
Q.	So what proportion of the documents that you discovered, I'm not talking about those that you found relevant, but what proportion of the documents that you discovered did you copy from Butare as opposed to anywhere else? 
A.	If you're speaking of the préfecture as a whole -- that is, not just Butare town, the commune, but all of the communes of the préfecture of Butare taken together, certainly the great majority of documents were from Butare. 
Q.	Would you be able to place a percentage on that? 
A.	Perhaps 75 percent. 
Q.	And of the total number of documents that you discovered in Butare, what proportion would you say you copied and took away -- or rather, took the copies away? 
A.	Very small.  I believe we copied documents probably fewer than a thousand is my guess -- probably fewer than a thousand, perhaps slightly over a thousand, I didn't count them.  But certainly they were not in the tens of thousands.  And the number of documents we handled, between our hands and our shovels, were certainly in the tens of thousands.  I mean, there were two large rooms full of paper -- large, in the sense of the size of this room, so that's a lot of paper. 
Q.	I suppose it stands to reason that you didn't do all that yourself? 
A.	That is correct.  I was assisted in the documentary work over a period of several years by three or four colleagues. 
Q.	Was it only five people who went through these 10,000 documents? 
A.	Six people, I would say, six people in addition to myself. 
Q.	How many préfectures are there in Butare -- in Rwanda, sorry? 
A.	At the present time there are 12.  In 1994, there were 11. 
Q.	The research which culminated in the production of your book in terms of documentary evidence, was that research based on the documents that you've described in the last 15 minutes? 
A.	Certainly that was part of the documentary evidence.  There were also documents that came from other sources, dealing with other aspects of the political context of the time, documents that had to do with developments in the capital, for example, or documents that had to do with the international context at that time.  But in terms of the local developments in -- on the ground in Butare, they, of course, were the fundamental part of the work. 
Q.	To what extent did you resource the United Nations or United Nations agencies? 
A.	In official terms, I have no access to any United Nations archives.  Only in the context of serving as an expert witness have I had permission to consult UN archives. 

However, there were people involved at the time in the UN who gave me documents on an unofficial basis.  But this was not an organised research of UN archives in any sense. 
Q.	So that the documents which were sourced from the United Nations or United Nations agencies came from individuals working within the United Nations rather than a personal perusal of what the United Nations had? 
A.	For the time at which the book was written, yes.  Subsequently, I have had access to several UN archives. 
Q.	Would you be able to indicate which UN archives exist that contained documents relevant to the Rwandan conflict? 
A.	There is a central archive in New York, which is the one that I have consulted, which I believe constitutes the largest of the UN depositaries of archival information.  

I've also consulted the archives of the UNHCR in Geneva and also have read the information gathered by the UN human rights field operation relevant to the genocide, what they call their special investigations unit. 
Q.	Coming to the archive in New York, which you've described as a central UN archive, would you be able to estimate -- estimate, obviously, I realise that this is difficult, but estimate the number of documents pertaining to the Rwandan conflict that exist in that archive? 
A.	No, I really could not.  I have no idea how -- what the UN's procedure is for maintaining its archive, whether it decides to archive everything, whether it makes a selection of documents, I am not familiar with their archival procedures. 
Q.	Well, you say that you've consulted that archive, did that involve seeing shelves and boxes of documents or did that involve going to some kind of reception and identifying documents that you wanted? 
A.	In my experience, it is not possible for outsiders to have access to the area in which documents are stored.  Rather, there are very strict controls for the use of such material and it is done in a reading room after one has indicated the scope of one's interest and then the relevant binders are brought out. 
Q.	So when you indicate the scope of your interest, do you say to somebody working in the UN,
	"I'm interested in documents on X subject" and then that person goes and searches.  Is that the way it works? 
A.	No, I think it needs to be rather more carefully defined than that.  I think one has to make reference to the specific UN agency involved and then ask for the kind of documents, for example, correspondence between -- let's say, the UNAMIR office in Kigali and the Department of Peacekeeping in New York, or something of that order of specificity. 
Q.	So how many documents would you say you have retrieved from the UN's central archive in New York post your book? 
A.	Not many. 
Q.	Could you place a number on it? 
A.	I've consulted perhaps 10 binders each of which has perhaps 200 to 300 documents.  So a few thousand, I would say. 
Q.	And you have no idea or no conception of what the total stock of documents might be at that location? 
A.	It's not a question that would have occurred to me to ask; I assume they have a lot of paper. 
Q.	To what extent have you consulted documents from the intelligence sources of states? 
A.	Again, I'm sure you realise that a researcher who is affiliated -- who is not affiliated with any kind of official agency does not ordinarily have access to such information short of a period of 50 years having elapsed.  I'm sure you're familiar with that general restriction on archival materials.  And, in that sense, I have not had any systematic access to such intelligence information.  There is, however, in the 
	United States an opportunity under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain limited access to a number of previously classified documents and this is particularly facilitated by a small non-governmental organisation that helps scholars and journalists.  And through the assistance of that organisation, I have had access to some US documents from the period.  

In addition, in connection with the official inquiries in France and in Belgium, the Belgium senate and the French National Assembly published a very considerable and interesting collection of their documentation -- their official archives, including intelligence information.  And I have consulted those very carefully and, in addition, have also received from time to time, additional documents from unofficial channels. 
Q.	The documents which were unclassified in the United States, does that go beyond what one can find on the Internet? 
A.	Through a direct inquiry via this small non-governmental organisation, which has the confusing name of National Security Archive -- National Security Archives because, in fact, it's not either national or a security archive - but, anyway, that's what they've been called, I have had access with their assistance to some material, which has not subsequently appeared on the Internet.  But they have, indeed, published a substantial amount of what they have been able to locate on Rwanda. 
Q.	How would you rate the quality of the intelligence of the United States with regard to the Rwandan conflict? 
A.	Not great, not great.  There are some analysts -- because there were various intelligence agencies, it turns out, working on Rwanda.  Some were obviously more qualified or perhaps simply more energetic and more concerned than others, so that the quality of intelligence can vary according to the individual analyst. 
Q.	What -- what leads you to this criticism? 
A.	Having read documents that clearly do not give an adequate -- either inadequate in the sense of erroneous or inadequate in the sense of incomplete depiction of the situation at the time. 
Q.	Would that not be prejudging those documents? 
A.	Not at all.  I had no opinion of the document before I read it.  It was in reading it and comparing it to what I knew about the situation at the time that I found it inadequate. 
Q.	If you found a document of that nature, would you then discard it? 
A.	Oh, no, it could be very useful, even if it's inadequate and incomplete, it can tell you a whole lot.  It can tell you a lot by its omission and by its errors.  It can tell you a lot about on what basis policy makers were making determinations and that perhaps those determinations -- it can help you to understand why determinations could, in themselves, be erroneous because the data upon which they were based was erroneous. 
Q.	So if you found a document from US intelligence which, on the basis of your knowledge thus far, appeared to be inconsistent with what you know, you would discard the quality of the information, if I could put it that way? 
A.	I would test it against what I knew and if it were something that appeared to be reasonable, but not in accord with my previous understanding of the events, I would attempt to follow it up to see whether, in fact, it was my misun- -- my understanding which was incorrect.  But you asked me for a general assessment of what I had read thus far and my general assessment is that in a substantial number of cases the US intelligence was not completely adequate. 
Q.	Yes.  So in a substantial number of cases, you would judge the documents -- the information coming out of the documents as not being reasonable in terms of your -- your knowledge of the situation? 
A.	In a number of cases, US intelligence sources made mistakes or were incomplete. 
Q.	What strategy did you adopt for locating witnesses? 
A.	Various strategies.  We believed that the widest possible net was obviously going to bring in the most useful variety of points of view and also the widest coverage of factual information.  And so we began with people in authority who were detained.  We interviewed them; we asked them for suggestions of other people.  We began simultaneously with victims -- some of whom I knew personally, some of whom were referred to us by hospitals, or humanitarian organisations.   

We took references out of documents and attempted to locate the persons names in those documents and in every case we would finish an interview by asking for recommendations of other names of other people to whom we could speak.  And, in that way, attempted to build a network of information that would allow us to understand any given event from a variety of points of view. 
Q.	How many government ministers of the interim government did you interview? 
A.	Persons who were -- you mean before -- people who became ministers in the interim government who were interviewed after the 6th of April or before the 6th of April? 
Q.	People who were in the interim government after the 6th of April?  
A.	But my question is spoken to before the 6th of April or after the 6th of April?  
Q.	Well, all right, after the 6th of April? 
A.	Because there were a number of ministers in the interim government whom I spoke to before the 6th of April.  After the 6th of April -- I do not believe I interviewed any of them after the 6th of April.  I have corresponded with various people, not including ministers, but others who were close to the operation of the government at ministerial level. 
Q.	Yes, my -- my -- my question was in relation to the ministers.  Did you -- did you interview 
	Paul Kagame? 
A.	Not about the genocide, no. 
Q.	Did you interview other individuals in the post-1994 -- or I should say post-July 1994 RPF regime, if I could put it like that? 
A.	I interviewed the minister of justice, Alphonse, Nkubito, N-K-U-B-I-T-O, who was a former 
	Human Rights colleague from the period before the genocide who became minister of justice. 
	I interviewed Seth Sendashonga, S-E-N-D-A-S-H-O-N-G-A, who was minister of interior --
Q.	Can I just ask this question:  Was he later murdered by the RPF, are you aware of that? 
A.	Seth Sendashonga was assassinated in Nairobi on May the 16th, 1998 and all indications are that he was assassinated by a Rwandan soldier who was then a member of the RPF. 
Q.	Yes, sorry that was just a sub-question.  Who else in the RPF regime did you interview? 
A.	Faustin Twagiramungu, Mr. Nkuliyingoma who had been the minister of information.  There aren't any other that come to mind at the moment, but I wouldn't exclude that -- that I did interview others.  I would have to consult my notes to be absolutely sure.  But, in any case, certainly those people I spoke with. 
Q.	What about your colleagues, did they speak to others perhaps? 
A.	Not that I recall. 
Q.	When you interviewed Faustin Twagiramungu, was that when he was prime minister? 
A.	I had been in touch with him on a number of occasions during the time he was prime minister and after. 
Q.	Just -- just to be certain that we're on same wavelength, I'm talking about prime minister under the RPF government.  
A.	That is the same person, yes. 
Q.	Yes, and - and, that is, the same time that you interviewed him, when he was prime minister in the RPF government? 
A.	I believe -- I know I was in touch with him during the period before he joined the government -- that is to say, after he fled from Rwanda during the genocide, as well as during the period he was prime minister and then after the period he was prime minister.  So on a number of occasions I've been in touch with him. 
Q.	How many people -- persons have you interviewed in total with regard to the Rwandan genocide? 
A.	In the thousands, but I couldn't give you much more of a sense than that.  Fewer than 10,000 I would say, but in the thousands. 
Q.	And are you talking personally? 
A.	I'm talking personally. 
Q.	And of those thousands that you have interviewed, what proportion would you put into the category of what you describe in your book as "survivors"?
A.	Perhaps 40 to 50 percent. 
Q.	And how would you describe the other 50 to 60 percent? 
A.	There were people who had participated in the genocide and people who had not.  People who had been completely aware, of course, of what was going on but who -- for one -- in one way or another, managed to avoid a significant level of personal involvement. 
Q.	Have you met -- have you interviewed people who were members of the MDR during the course of 1993?  
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	How many? 
A.	I don't know.  I did not attempt to systematically identify the political party membership of the persons whom I interviewed.  I would assume that a great many of those whom I spoke to in the area of Gitarama were MDR members simply because the MDR was the predominant party in that area.  Similarly, in certain parts of Kigali-rural, I would assume that many, if not most of the people whom I interviewed were MDR.  But I did not attempt to systematically note party membership or to inquire about party membership 
Q.	Would that be in all cases? 
A.	It was not a question that I ordinarily asked. 
Q.	So would it be right that during 1993, that you did not speak to members of the MDR about the MDR? 
A.	During 1993, I spoke to some MDR members about the MDR.  I spoke to other persons about the MDR who probably were not MDR members.  But as I say, I did not attempt to systematically sort people according to party membership. 
Q.	So would it follow that you would not be able to give an estimate of the proportion of those people you spoke to about the MDR who were not MDR? 
A.	It follows, doesn't it, if I didn't ask people?  I can make no estimate about what their membership was.

1000H
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Are you able to say what the total number of available radio transcripts are? 
A.	Which radio, and available where, and for what dates?  There are a lot of radios in the world. 
Q.	Fair enough, I wasn't specific enough in my question.  I didn't think you would think it was relating to the whole world, but in terms of radio transcripts which exist of radio interviews during 1994 in Rwanda, do you have any idea what the total available number would be? 
A.	If you are speaking of radio transcripts of interviews of Rwandans, broadcast on Rwandan radio stations, or are you referring also to interviews broadcast on international radios?  
Q.	That's fair enough; Rwandan.  
A.	On Rwandan radios, as I understand it, the estimation of the Prosecutor's office is that they may have something in the vicinity of 10 percent of the broadcasts that were made by either Radio Rwanda or Radio RTLM during 1994.  So that would mean you would have to start from that basis because the collection here is, I believe, the most comprehensive although there are a few private collections as well that are not included here.  But I would suppose that there are certainly hundreds of transcripts of such interviews. 
Q.	Which are available? 
A.	Which are available. 
Q.	And what proportion of those interviews, if you could estimate, have you studied? 
A.	It's difficult to say because the -- unfortunately, the characterisation of material at the -- in the Prosecutor's archives is not as complete or as adequate as one would hope.  But to the best of my knowledge, I have consulted certainly the vast majority of what is available among interviews at that period. 
Q.	Now, you've already indicated to the Tribunal that you did have assistance from, I think, at least four other colleagues -- I think you list more than that in your book -- with regard to the research that you did for the purposes of that publication of that book.  I understand that when you were talking about four, you were referring to the looking for documents.  How many people assisted you in terms of the production of the book, None to Tell the Story -- Leave None to Tell the Story? 
A.	Two of the people listed were essentially logistical people not involved in any substantive way with the content of the work.  Two other people listed were essentially helpful with the question of production of the French text and with review of certain judicial aspects having to do with -- particularly with European law, and also with access to European diplomatic information.  The remainder were people who were more actively involved in the field research in Rwanda itself.  I think there were -- or maybe there were three in terms of the French -- the French connection. 
Q.	What do you mean by the French connection, sorry? 
A.	Assistance with the -- the production of the French aspect of the manuscript and the research involving European diplomatic sources. 
Q.	So how many people, other than yourself, were involved in the field research?  
A.	In any intensive and sustained way, four, in an intensive and sustained way. 
Q.	So, were there a team of five who interviewed witnesses? 
A.	Oh, no.  This was work carried on over a period of years and we never had more than two researchers resident in the country with me coming in and out.  So at no time did we have more than three people in the country.  And, ordinarily, interviews were done by one researcher. 
Q.	Did the person who was doing the interviews change during the course of those years? 
A.	Yes, with the exception that I provided the element of continuity throughout.  And from the French side, Eric Gillet provided the continuity in terms of the presence of FIDH, but he was in the country ordinarily only for a few weeks at a time. 
Q.	When you say from the French side, are you saying that you would focus on interviews in English? 
A.	No, no.  I did no interviews in English that I recall in terms of this book, I mean, except for the diplomatic community. 
Q.	So you simply mean -- from the French side, you simply mean the French side of the project? 
A.	Right. 
Q.	So in terms of the total number of witnesses who were interviewed, what proportion would you say you interviewed personally? 
A.	I would say 60 to 65 percent, perhaps 70 percent. 
Q.	Would you describe your research as qualitative or quantitative in nature? 
A.	Definitely not quantitative.  Quantitative research involves command of statistics, which I did not have. 
Q.	Could you just help the Court as to the distinction between those two terms? 
A.	Quantitative research ordinarily involves, as I say, a command of statistics and a construction of a sample based upon certain laws of statistics.  And then analysis also depended upon the analysis of large amounts of data treated, in part, according to certain laws of probability and so on. 
Q.	Would it not be right to say that there are historians who do use quantitative analysis? 
A.	There was, indeed a brief fury of interest in that which continued for perhaps a decade.  I think less so now in the sort of post-modern approach to history, but certainly, perhaps a decade ago, there was a considerable enthusiasm for the idea of using statistics and quantitative research in treating historical questions. 
Q.	Just so that the Trial Chamber can understand, could you try to define qualitative research? 
A.	That's much more difficult to do.  I think in general you could say qualitative research is any research that does not pretend to be quantitative research. 
Q.	Yes.  Quantitative research would, by the use of variables, attempt to come to a more or less exact answer to the question through the -- some kind of cause and effect.  Would that be a fair statement? 
A.	Yes, and I think that's exactly why it has somewhat fallen out of favour because - just as with the early notion that history could be scientific, we have come to perhaps a great realisation of the limits of our own capacities, even with the use of statistical data and computer analysis, and so on and so forth.  The human line tends to be a fairly effective tool for analysis.  And all of the panoply of statistics in the end may or may not help; garbage in garbage out, basically. 
Q.	The area of qualitative research could be said to distinguish itself from quantitative research in the sense that it -- it is not capable of and it does not purport to lead to a situation of one plus one, equals two.  
A.	I think any historian who attempts to make one plus one equal two, is probably a historian who lacks an understanding of the complexity of history. 
Q.	One of the descriptions that's given by social scientists to distinguish quantitative research other than the statistical side, is the use of structured interview questionnaires.  To what extent did you employ structured interview questionnaires during your research? 
A.	We did not employ such questionnaires and I have virtually no faith in such a his -- such a methodology.  I believe that it has been fairly well established that the use of questionnaire imposes a dialogue upon the respondent which unduly influences the outcome of the interview.  

From my point of view, the most productive form of interchange with an informant is simply to sit and listen and think and reflect, and then ask questions.  In other words, if one goes and imposes a series of questions, one has already eliminated certain possible areas of enquiry, certain possible events that may come spontaneously from the person who is recalling the past.  So I do not find that a particularly useful research methodology apart, of course, from the basic facts, you know, "Who are you?  Where were you at that time?"  And so on.  That kind of thing of course, but that is not really, I think, what you mean by questionnaire.  
Q.	Would you accept that whether one is dealing with quantitative or qualitative research, in both, one way or another, one has to make certain assumptions? 
A.	I think we all acknowledge that the world is full of facts and that we cannot make sense of it except by drawing certain conclusions and making certain assumptions.  We cannot operate in a situation of infinite bits of information; we have to make some order of that in our minds. 
Q.	In quantitative research the assumptions would be defined, but perhaps in qualitative research, the assumptions would not be defined but would be subconscious.  Would that be a fair statement?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me.  I hate to interrupt and I hope I'm not being impolite, but we've been going at this now for over an hour and we've been focusing on philosophies of history and research methodology and very little has gone to cross-examining Dr. Des Forges or the opinions that she offered yesterday.  And at this rate, we are going to be here for another three weeks, I think.  

I don't mean to interrupt Mr. O'Shea, but can we get to the essentials?  She spent a great deal of time going over documents.  Very little of her expert evidence had to do with interviews that she did with witnesses.  Now, I'm not suggesting that the questions are improper, but is this really relevant for -- is this line of questioning deserving of this level of scrutiny?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Well, I'm not being repetitive, I am moving systematically through different aspects of my objective.  And my objective is to establish the weight which can be attached to the conclusions of this witness by this Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I didn't interpret Mr. Webster's comment as an objection, but I myself was wondering about the extent -- duration, the amount of time you are spending on this line.  So I think that's the question it is related to.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  I appreciate that, Your Honour.  I'm acutely aware of it myself, but having gone down the avenue, in order to make a point, I have to be thorough, I think.  But I'm -- I'm conscious of the point which is being made; thank you.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, do you remember my question?  
A.	I do, and I would say that I would not agree with your formulation because your formulation suggests that by imposing a statistical, a quantitative analysis of the information, one avoids assumptions.  And, in fact, that's not true.  Assumptions underlie all scholarly exercise.  In some cases, they are more evident than others; in some cases there is an attempt to translate them into numbers.  I, personally, I'm not that kind of historian.  I do not believe that human events, in all their complexity, are easily translated into one plus one equals two.  But certainly that form of history does exist, I have no doubt about it.  
Q.	So in your form of research, some assumptions would be subconscious and others would be conscious.  
A.	I'm a human being like any other.  I operate at levels of consciousness and subconsciousness as does anyone.  I don't think that I can claim to be exempt from that.  
Q.	If I could ask you about how you evaluate evidence.  How would you describe the procedures and precautions that you have taken in terms of evaluating available evidence?  
A.	First of all, it requires great patience.  That's the first thing, because understanding particularly when one operates in a culture other than ones own, even a culture in which one has been emersed for 
	40 years, understanding it comes slowly and requires a great deal of thought.  In addition, obviously, one attempts to cross-check information in order to evaluate its veracity, and one needs to also approach with a level of due modesty and humility because we never know everything and we have to accept that knowledge changes as new information becomes available, as new documents become available.  So I would say that my research approach is one which begins with the facts as I can best establish them, and then proceeds to draw conclusions based upon the exercise of an intelligence formed by training, by experience and by long emersion in the culture. 
Q.	The history of any event is -- or the establishment of the history of any event is a developing process? 
A.	Of course, all knowledge is a developing process.  I mean, we are no longer at the place where Galileo was. 
Q.	And a good historian, as you do in your book, would recognise that there may be errors in their conclusions because there may be other available evidence that they have not yet seen which would shed a different light on their interpretation.  
A.	Absolutely.  None of all is infallible, and thank goodness that increasing information becomes available to allow us to correct our errors. 
Q.	In terms of your research team, who -- who did the evaluation? 
A.	It was I who did the final evaluation.  Of course, colleagues also contributed their expertise and their knowledge, but in the end, I was responsible for the judgments made. 
Q.	It would be right to say that no means was employed for testing the credibility of those you spoke to; would that be right?  
A.	Of course not.  Of course we tested the credibility.  That's fundamental to what I have been saying all morning that we made every attempt to cross-check information by consulting a variety of sources of information and then testing the information provided by any one given source against that provided by others. 
Q.	So your means of testing credibility would be employed not during the interview, but after the interview in terms of cross-checking information? 
A.	No, of course, not, it's a continuing process.  You don't go into the interview with a blank head, I hope.  You go in already with a certain amount of information.  And using that information if the person speaking to you presents information that you know to be incorrect or exaggerated or incomplete, then it is your job, as researcher, to attempt to find out why that is, and to attempt to push forward.  You don't simply note something that you believe not to be so and then go away and check it later.  No, you attempt to resolve the differences to the extent you can. 
Q.	How do you deal with conflicting evidence? 
A.	By using a judgment based upon long experience and careful cross-checking, by making an analysis based upon a knowledge of the events and the culture and the time. 
Q.	If I can come to the sensitising process of how you reached your conclusions.  Did you develop concepts, strategies for how you would come to explanations for the events or how you would reach conclusions? 
A.	As I said, I am not a highly theoretical or abstract kind of historian.  I immerse myself in the data; I read it over and over and over, and then I see something the third time through that I didn't see the first time and then I go and read something else over and over and over, and then I think about it, and then I wait overnight and I go back and I read it again, and I think about it again.  It's a very organic fact-based, seat-of-the-pants kind of approach to information.  It is not an abstract floating over the top, let's-see-how-we-can-fit-this-into-the-pigeonhole sort of approach to information, but it is a highly organic analysis which emerges from the information itself. 
Q.	So rather than having a structured predetermined method to how you go through your research and arrive at a conclusion, it is largely a matter of analysis in your head and personal interpretation.  Would that be right? 
A.	It is a method.  It's clearly a method.  It's a method that involves emersion in the factual information, reflection upon it, cross-checking of the formation available, and then reaching conclusions.  It's difficult to be any more precise than that.  It's involves thinking.  It involves the human intelligence confronting the -- the minutia of the historical information and concluding on the basis of what one knows, and what one has studied, and what one has been trained to do; and it results then in a conclusion out of that data. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say that there are times when you have reached conclusions based on the evidence of one single witness? 
A.	That is almost impossible because I do not, as I say, enter an interview with a mind that's a blank slate.  Even if I am speaking to one person about a series of events, I bring to that interview all of the knowledge and experience of my work for decades in the region.  So even if the one person is cited as the source for a piece of information, that person's information has been evaluated on the basis of what I know from many other sources.  So there is no way that any one source of information is treated discretely.  I have a brain and the brain is full of information.  And it does not go into an interview to speak to someone having wiped out everything it knew from the past. 
Q.	Well, I accept that.  I'm not suggesting that you don't look at things in context, that you have a large context within which to look at things.  But there are instances, are there not, where you have made statements about things which have happened based upon what one person has said.  Obviously, you -- you cross-checked to see if that contextually fits in with the rest of the story, but there are instances where you would make a statement based upon what one person has said? 
A.	Based upon context and the specific information from one person, yes.  But that is not a usual pattern.  In most cases, information is based upon a variety of sources, but I would not exclude that in some few cases it -- I have made statements based upon one person's information taken in the larger context of what I know. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honours, if -- if it's Your Honours' wish, this would be a convenient moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you completed this line of your examination?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Well, I've completed -- what I've basically done is gone through how this witness conducts her research; going through locating evidence, evaluating evidence and synchronising that evidence.  I will go on to dealing with the weaknesses in her process.  So it's -- when you say "this line of questioning" it falls within a broad parameters of it, the -- my enquiry as to how this witness has reached her conclusions, has come to a conclusion.  Does that make sense?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I was wondering whether it would be reasonable to ask you what percentage of your cross-examination is completed.
MR. O'SHEA: 
It would be very fair considering the questions I have put of that nature.  What percentage of my cross-examination?  Mr. Hooper says my brain is not quantitative, which is probably right.  But can I hazard a guess at 10 to 15 percent?  To be fair, Your Honour, I've only been going for two and a half hours in total since yesterday.  So if it is 10 to 15 percent, it's not bad.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but that suggests something like 25 hours.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Does it?  You see how bad I am at mathematics.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As a total.
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm hearing noises.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- would that be a fair estimate about your examination?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Well, Your Honour, it would -- it would also depend -- I think that this part of the cross-examination is far systematic and stepped, if I can put it that way.  And then once I get into areas like MDR-Power, it's going to be a lot more see-where-we-go.  And in that sense, you know, the areas that I'm going to cover could shorten significantly depending on the answers I get.  But I do have a substantial amount left, yes.  I'm not going -- I'm certainly not going to finish by two o'clock or anything like that; four is not -- is still a possibility, a strong possibility.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We'll take a break now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1100H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We may now resume.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, may I exhibit the extract from Professor Des Forges's book contained at tab 1 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, couldn't you -- is it important -- couldn't you complete you examination and exhibit everything together, or is there a special reason for doing it this way?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Well, given the time constraints that we're trying to work within, I thought -- it's just that I'm not going to be referring to everything in the bundle, but if Your Honour would prefer to do that, I'll also -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, I was wondering (overlapping microphones) I just thought a better way to do it, to compress everything at the end that you intend to refer to.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, that's one way to do it.  We can do it like that if that's a sensible way, yes.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, Professor Des Forges, would you accept that for the purpose of reaching definitive conclusions on facts, there are limitations and weaknesses in your approach to your research? 
A.	No research methodology is perfect. 
Q.	In terms of coming to definitive conclusions, what would you say are the limitations which arise out of the way in which your research is conducted? 
A.	Certain persons were unavailable for interviews at the time the book was written, or information about them was limited.  Fortunately, subsequent information has only confirmed the conclusions in the book.  But had that information been different, it might have called into question some of the conclusions, but, fortunately, that has not been the case.  And there are always more documents.  I, myself, I'm a great enthusiast about documents and I'm always happy when I can be -- have the opportunity to see new documents that I have not had the chance to consult.  But, I can say, the impossibility of knowing everything in the world about any given subject is a limitation which exists for me as for anyone else, and so necessarily one draws conclusions based upon one's best training and experience and knowledge.  But there are limits for all of us; the human intelligence is limited. 
Q.	Yes.  I'm not, of course, in anyway suggesting that -- that you don't conduct your discipline properly and that you do your best at what you do.  But for any -- any academic -- any good academic would recognise that there are limitations in their approach to matters, and I think you accept that.  Would you, for example, accept that given that you have analysed a small proportion of the possible available evidence in terms of the number of people that one could conceivably speak to on the subject, in terms of the number of documents that one can conceivably look at, that there may be gaps on your understanding of the situation.  And I -- I accept that you are very knowledgeable on the situation, and more knowledgeable than most.  But would you accept that there may be gaps in your understanding of the situation? 
A.	It would be --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you expecting evidence on this subject to persuade the Court as to the weight to attach to the evidence?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Or is this sort of -- I'm just wondering whether these questions usurp our judicial function.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Well, by analysing the weaknesses in Professor Des Forges' processes, it's relevant to the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not actually stopping you, I'm just raising the question -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- but think about the fact that this actually goes to the type of task that we would exercise in due course.
MR. O'SHEA:  
Well, I understand that, Your Honour, but in terms of what this witness achieves in this Court, there are, as it were, two stages:  her brain and then Your Honour's brain.  And the extent to which Your Honours' brain can rely on the point at which she has reached with her brain, is an important issue as to the weight of her conclusions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suspect that we'll just have to acquiesce --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Mr. President.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll have to acquiesce in being educated, both in terms of history and -- et cetera.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, do you remember the question, Professor Des Forges? 
A.	No, would you restate it, please?  
Q.	Yes.  I am focusing on the -- on a reaching of conclusions, and particularly on the reaching of definitive conclusions on facts.  You've reached conclusions, I'm not sure how definitive you believe them to be, but would you accept that having analysed a small proportion of the possible evidence, that there may be, you know, bearing in mind your vast knowledge, that there may, nonetheless, be gaps in your understanding of the causes and effects of the genocide? 
A.	I believe I have already indicated an acceptance of the possibility of error in the work of any scholar, including myself.  I would state also that a conscientious effort to examine criticisms made of my work by persons, including persons accused before this Tribunal, has thus far resulted in no significant alteration in my conclusions.  So that if there is indeed a vast source of information out there somewhere that has not yet been brought to my attention, perhaps that indeed may result in some significant change, but the book has been published since 1999.  I have received commentaries from several people and have attempted to take them seriously and sincerely, and to examine them in the light of what I know, and I have not yet found any body of information that significantly changes the conclusions that are published in this book.
Q.	Well, I --
A.	I would also like to point out that in evaluating information, it is perhaps misleading to believe that the more information necessarily is the better and produces necessarily the better understanding.  It's not just the quantity of the information, in fact, as we have said, it's the quality.  And it is, for example, important to assess whether the information is available relatively soon after the fact or a long time after the fact.  It's important to assess what is the quality of the testimony given.  And speaking to ten people who really know what they talked about -- what they are talking about, can be in fact more valuable than talking to a hundred people who do not. 
Q.	Yes.  But if you've spoken to ten people but not spoken to the other hundred, you wouldn't know, would you? 
A.	There are bases for making assessments of whether certain persons are in a position to have access to the kinds of information one is seeking. 
Q.	Yes.  I mean, I understand, of course, that you have reached certain conclusions and you still hold those conclusions today, and there has not been other evidence which has convinced you that you are wrong.  That I understand.  But you recognise, I think, that it's possible that such situation might still exist, that there are gaps in your understanding.  
A.	Anything is possible in this world.  But in the ten years I've been working on this topic, I have not yet seen such information be presented.  And one would suppose that it would be in the interest of those persons who feel that these conclusions are incorrect, to bring out information forward rather than to keep it hidden.  And all I can say is I've not yet seen it brought forward. 
Q.	Would you accept that the way in which you have conducted your research necessarily involves an element of subjective interpretation? 
A.	Any scholar who would pretend that his work, in whatever field, does not involve subjective interpretation, is either not honest or not very intelligent.  All scholarship involves an element of subjective interpretation.  It's a question of whether the subjective interpretation is based upon serious thought and experience, which allows for that subjective interpretation to be relatively close to the facts at hand. 
Q.	Would you accept that your analysis is necessarily affected by your own location, time, and world view? 
A.	Isn't that obvious?  I don't really see that we can assert that I am exceptional to what characterises every other human in the world.  I am like other people, a creature of my time and place. 
Q.	Would you also accept that if one analyses a body of evidence after an extensive research project and then reaches certain fundamental conclusions, that there is a natural tendency for a human being in those circumstances, to -- when looking at subsequent evidence, to make it fit into the picture that has already been created? 
A.	Certainly that phenomenon has been observed on the part of scholars of human knowledge.  But I believe that given the gravity of the situation of presenting expert evidence, I am particularly conscious of that risk and work very hard to correct it.  I am not a scholar who takes such pride in her work that I would maintain a conclusion if it were to put at risk another person's life or well-being.  And I believe that that has been demonstrated before this Tribunal in the very recent past where I acknowledged to the Court that I had the night before, discovered information which caused me to correct my conclusions in a matter which was of substantial importance.  And I hope that I would have the humility to continue and adopt that policy in the future.

1115H
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	That's quite an illuminating idea, isn't it, that having researched something for so many years -- and there's no criticism in here-- but it is illuminating, in terms of what we have been saying, in terms of having studied something for so many years one can get in such a situation that the night before having to speak about something one realises there is a need to correct something on the basis of other evidence.  
A.	It is the perfect example of what I have said repeatedly before this Chamber, that I acknowledge that new scholars grasp of information is limited by certain conditions and that, with time, other information may become available.  In a case I mentioned, that was what happened, and I did not hesitate to bring that information forward, although it would have been quite feasible for me to leave it hidden. 
Q.	Do you accept that, in analysing different incidents or events occurring at different times and different places, often it happens that there is a natural and understandable temptation to provide a neat understandable explanations to those past events, which may, in fact, be a little bit more complex in nature? 
A.	Indeed, as I have commented, with greater information one often develops a more nuanced and layered understanding of past events. 
Q.	I think you have intimated, on various occasions which -- I have the impression that you have intimated on various occasions, that the situation in Rwanda and, indeed, the way Rwandans think and act, presents quite a complex picture.  
A.	One of great complexity, yes, and great dynamics as well.  
Q.	And that must render extremely difficult the task of providing a plausible, neat, and coherent explanation or conclusion on events in 1994.  
A.	I think that most seriously researched conclusions about 1994 do, in fact, present the image of a highly complex and dynamic situation, rather than one that is neat and easily compressed into a short formula.  It did take 900 pages, after all, to write about it. 
Q.	Yes, but general conclusions about, for example, the simple question, "Was there a plan?" or the simple question, "Was there Hutu Power and what did it mean?"  In that context they are quite difficult questions to give coherent, neat answers to, are they not? 
A.	There are no simple questions nor simple answers about the Rwandan genocide. 
Q.	I could ask you to turn to tab 5 in the Defence bundle.  You will see there an excerpt of a book by David Lowencraft -- I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly -- "The Past is a Foreign Country".  Do you know this academic? 
A.	No, he's got a good title, but I can't say I'm familiar with the work, no. 
Q.	Will you turn to the excerpt that I have photocopied.
MR. PRESIDENT:
For clarification, Madam Professor, by "title" did you mean "surname," or did you mean the title of his book?  
THE WITNESS:
I meant the title of his book, Your Honour.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, I understood that.  Yes, page 234 in the chapter, "Knowing the Past", halfway down the page where there are those two little black dots, "In short, historical explanation surpasses any understanding available while events are occurring.  The past we construct is more coherent than the past was when it happened."  

Do you appreciate what the author is saying there and do you agree with it?  
A.	Seems to me a reasonable statement. 
Q.	And then he goes on, "What we recognise as the Roman Empire was a series of disconnected experiences with generations that made it up.  It is we who give them coherence,  even more than memory, history clarifies, tidies and illustrates."

Do you agree with that?  
A.	I'm not sure, in fact, because I think what we know about human memory these days suggests that memory, itself, does an awful lot of clarifying, tidying, elucidating.  Whether history does this more than memory, I don't really know. 
Q.	If you will go to the part that is highlighted, second sentence onwards, "To make history intelligible the historian must reveal retrospectively imminent structure in past events, creating an illusion that things happened as they did because they had to."  What do you think about that? 
A.	I think that is a risk for all historians but that some are more likely to fall subject to it than others.  I think it is a constant need for historians to be aware of the need not to read events retrospectively, but it is true that any work of history necessarily includes some events and includes others simply because history, is an exercise of intelligence upon the data from the past.  There is no way that all data from the past can be presented and known.  Obviously there must be some exercise of human intelligence upon that data. 
Q.	This is no criticism, but it is my suggestion that in reaching your conclusions you have, to some extent, inevitably presented a coherent picture of past events, which did not possess that same level of coherence.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could ask Mr. O'Shea to tell us which conclusions he's suggesting to the witness, if he could break it down, give us what conclusions and have her respond to the question item by item.
MR. O'SHEA:
If the witness wants to break it down item by item, she may.

THE WITNESS:
This is, essentially, a highly theoretical discussion which, in my opinion, doesn't take us very far.  If you wish to deal with particular conclusions, then we can deal with them.  But, yes, of course any historian imposes his or her intelligence on past events.  All of these things are true.  I am not an exception to every other historian in the world.  These are commonly recognised as characteristics of the exercise of human intelligence upon data.  I am fully aware of this, I am fully prepared to admit it, and I think, perhaps, we could go to something a little more specific. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Would you accept that your conclusions on the causes and the effects of the genocide -- well, let me put it this way.  Would you describe your conclusions on the causes and effects of genocide as plausible explanations, likely conclusions, or definitive conclusions in which you have absolute confidence? 
A.	I have indicated many times that I accept the possibility of error in my work, as in the work of any historian.  I have also indicated many times that I have not yet, in the six years since the publication of this book, been made aware of any information that causes me to question the conclusions I have presented there about the causes and consequences of the genocide.  Therefore, one could conclude that I believe those conclusions plausible and, indeed, likely, at the time I published them; that I still believe them plausible and likely, but the definitive conclusions are something a scholar rarely ventures to purport to have made in the sense that information upon which conclusions are based is finite and can change.  But, the conclusions have stood the test of time.  There is no one who has brought forward significant scholarly challenges to this piece of work.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may -- I'm sorry, I appreciate Dr. Des Forges's answer but I still am at a loss to understand what is being discussed because I don't know what conclusion Mr. O'Shea had in mind, and I don't know what conclusions Dr. Des Forges is responding to.  And she, in her direct exam, she talked about conditions of scarcity in Rwanda, she talked about the state action, she talked about the lineages of the pre-colonial state and the Habyarimana regime.  She talked about many things.  I would appreciate it, so I could understand her response, if specific conclusions were put to her, and then she can respond on that basis.  But a generalised response is not really helpful for us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the cross-examination has not reached that stage yet.  We are still in the realm of academic discussion on the theory of drawing conclusions and the quality of conclusions that are reached in general and academic terms.  

But, Mr. O'Shea -- I almost feel like saying Professor O'Shea -- don't you think you have exhausted the laying of examination?  

MR. O'SHEA:
I'm almost there, and in the light of what Your Honours have indicated I will be careful not to step over the bounds.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, would you accept that your analysis of interviews and documents is bound, to some extent, to be dependent upon the interpretation of others, perhaps the authors of those documents with the interpretations of the witnesses you interviewed? 
A.	I'm at a loss to find a way to answer questions which, to me, are so totally obvious.  Of course a document, whether written or spoken, reflects necessarily the views of the person speaking or writing.  Isn't that patently clear?  How can it be otherwise, unless one sets out to do a forgery?  
Q.	I will move out of the realm of the theoretical and into the realm of the concrete.  If we could discuss the situation of the MDR.  The MDR, in its more modern form, had its first meeting on the 1st of August 1990 at the Nyamirambo stadium, would that be correct? 
A.	I do not know the date or place of the first party meeting.  I do know that it preceded, by some months, the 1991 establishment of the multiparty system, but I do not know it's exact date. 
Q.	I know that you have your views about what occurred with the MDR from October 1993, but would you accept that prior to that period the MDR was a united and strong opposition against the MRND? 
A.	I have already described the MDR as the primary contender against the MRND in testimony before this Chamber, but it was a strong and united party until October '93 seems to me inaccurate.  There were already serious dissensions in the party as early as January 1993 and perhaps before that time. 
Q.	Would you see the party as united from the 1st of October 1990 until the beginning of 1993 or until shortly before the beginning of 1993, I think you are referring to? 
A.	Certainly, in comparison with the events that transpired after that date, it was relatively united, yes. 
Q.	Would you accept that the statute of the MDR makes it quite clear that the MDR intended to be a non-ethnicist party? 
A.	It has been some time since I have read the party statutes, but certainly, in my experience, in my observations, and in the data that I am aware of, in it's early stages, it was meant to be a multi-ethnic party.  But there was some contention, even relatively early on, about the use of the Parmehutu label and whether or not it would be MDR simply or MDR Parmehutu.  And the Parmehutu reference would certainly have sent it more in the direction of a mono-ethnic party, but that was not adopted, at least not officially. 
Q.	Would you accept that in contrast to the MDR, the ethnicist elements within the MRND, during the same period, prior to 1993, were already quite significant? 
A.	At the level of the leadership, yes.  Less so at the grassroots, because, as I have explained, the MRND was initially a party or a movement to which all Rwandans had to belong, so that even as the multiparty system began to take shape there were still many Tutsis who remained as MRND members, whether out of loyalty to Habyarimana or out of habit, or they didn't want to make a change, or whatever" so it was not a party that was clearly composed of Hutu hardliners, certainly not.  And, as I explained also, it was said, and I believe accurately so, that one of the reasons the CDR was created in March 1992 was to allow for a clearer expression of those ethnicist voices than was possible within the MRND. 
Q.	Would it be right that the MDR, as a party, perceived the MRND as an ethnicist party? 
A.	Which MDR party and what time is a question I think we would have to ask there.  
Q.	Well, if we focus on the same period, prior to 1993, and, rather than focusing on any particular individual, if one focuses on the party policies and public front.  
A.	I don't know that the criticism of ethnicism was such an important part of the MDR criticism of the MRND.  I think there was a great deal of criticism of the MDR people about the cooperation of the MRND about its narrow geographical basis, that it was becoming a party that more and more favoured the northwest.  And the element of criticism for its ethnicism was one of the criticisms, but certainly not the only or the most important of the criticism, that were being made at that time. 
Q.	During the course of your examination-in-chief, you refer to quite an important and significant event, I think in 1992, the Bugesera massacre.  That was quite an important and significant event, wasn't it? 
A.	It was. 
Q.	If you turn to tab 7, this is a document from the Prosecution archives.  Have you seen that document before? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Would that document be an MDR reaction to the Bugesera massacre? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And would it be fair to say that it manifests a strong disapproval of that massacre? 
A.	It does. 
Q.	Would you accept that the MDR party -- you said earlier that the MDR party was a major contester -- I think those were your words or similar words to the MRND.  Would you accept that the MDR had much to gain from the fulfillment of the Arusha Accords in the sense that they had a very good chance of being the future government, if things went properly, once democracy was established? 
A.	I think, as I described the situation, they were the major rival to the MRND, but I would say it was certainly not a foregone conclusion that they would be the government after a period of elections.  It was, in fact, because this remained such a hotly contested issue that the rivalry between the two parties continued to be so bitter.  The MRND was certainly not about to concede that the MDR would become the party to dominate the next government.  

And I would remark in that connection, since we are looking at this document, the press communiqué of the MDR party, K0086932, that at the bottom -- 
Q.	Ma'am, I've moved on from there, unless it is a specific answer to the question I've just asked.
A.	No, but it's just very interesting to see that the criticism is made of the attacks, not just because such a large number of Tutsi are involved but also because it involves attacks on the sympathisers or supporters of the MDR.  So just to illustrate that, in fact, the situation continues to be one that was contested even with violence. 
Q.	Yes, you are referring to the footnote? 
A.	I think it's not a footnote.  I think it's part of a text, the last paragraph on the part of the page.  It appears to me to be part of the text itself, "The victims of those attacks are Tutsi in the majority but they are also members or the opposition parties, members of the (unintelligible) of the opposition parties, mainly of the MDR." 
Q.	Yes, well, of course, Mr. Webster will always have an opportunity to come back, if he wishes.  But now you're on that issue, I'll step forward and step back again.  Would you accept that a number of members of the MDR were murdered by MRND supporters over the years preceding 6th of April 1994? 
A.	That is correct, as was the contrary; that is to say, members of the MRND were murdered by members of the MDR.  It was as I described in my principal testimony, a situation where rival gangs of militia members belonging to these political parties slugged it out on a number of occasions and also, on several occasions, attacked the homes, burnt the homes, and killed family members of people of the opposing party. 
Q.	So can one conclude there was a history of intense animosity between the MDR and the MRND? 
A.	Certainly in the period 1992, late 1991-1992 and through part of 1993, that was the case. 
Q.	Would you accept that if the Arusha Accords had gone through successfully and a democratic government was on the cards, that the MDR was in a likely position of securing a large number of the Hutu votes? 
A.	I believe I've said that already, that it was the principal contender, but that, of course, one couldn't know in advance what the results would be of an electoral choice, but that it was regarded by the MRND as a significant threat to its continued dominance. 
Q.	Yes, and I think you've also said that a member of the MDR was in charge of the negotiations at Arusha? 
A.	That is correct, not because he was a member of the MDR but because he was the foreign minister of Rwanda. 
Q.	And the MDR, as a party, played a major role in the negotiation of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	As I have described, the MDR, the PL, the PSD and the PDC had become part of the Rwandan government.  The Rwandan government was the negotiating party at Arusha through the person of it's foreign minister, who was, indeed, a member of the MDR. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say that, essentially, the MRND was, more or less always, in reality, opposed to power sharing? 
A.	I think it is usual for parties that have been in a position of exclusive control to be reluctant to concede any part of that to other contenders.  But we have described, in some detail, the pressures which were applied, both internally and externally, in order to oblige Habyarimana and the MRND to accept coalition government, sharing powers with parties that had been parties of the opposition. 
Q.	I get the impression that your conclusion on that is that it is more a matter of not having much political choice than really being a willing participant in the process, on the part of the MRND? 
A.	One of the political counselors or advisors to President Habyarimana was his chief of military intelligence, and in June of 1990, if I recall correctly, he wrote a very long document for Habyarimana, addressed to Habyarimana, explaining to him that multipartyism was inevitibaly going to arise in Rwanda, and that the best thing to try to do in that situation was to try to get ahead of the wave by professing a certain openness and accepting to collaborate with opposition parties.  And I believe that his influence was important in shaping the ideas of Habyarimana and perhaps others in the MRND.  And in that sense they would have been purportedly willing partners, rather than, apparently, reluctant partners, to this sharing in power.  But in fact, it did take street demonstrations of some size in order to push for the reality of incorporation and the actual sharing of the government pie between the MRND and these other contenders. 
Q.	Would it be right to say the public willingness, on behalf of the MRND, perhaps drew a curtain on a more profound feeling on the part of Habyarimana, those who surrounded him in the MRND, that they were essentially in a political corner? 
A.	As I said, I know of no case where a group of people or a political party that has enjoyed exclusive control willingly accedes that exclusive control.  I feel, indeed, they felt themselves cornered. 
Q.	You've just made a general statement about parties in power generally, which, of course, is true.  But would it not be the case in the case of the MRND that it was particularly pronounced? 
A.	It was the case; I don't know whether it was any more pronounced than in other similar situations.  They did not have much choice, and so they accepted it.  I think, if I could add in that connection, that the already existing tensions within the army also contributed to the sense of being cornered, so that over time it became an increasing problem for Habyarimana and the people around him to realise that there were officers in the army who continued to exhibit less than total loyalty to Habyarimana, either because of past conflicts or because of the attraction of new political parties, and that then made it then less feasible than it might have been in the case of other situations of simply calling out the armed forces to suppress any demonstration of support for opposing political contenders. 
Q.	In your assessment, how important or significant was the army, in terms of determining the direction of politics in Rwanda? 
A.	Well, Habyarimana himself was a military officer, and even after he was forced to relinquish his active status in the army, he remained a military officer and he consulted a great deal with other military officers.  So I think I attempted, in describing the pre-colonial system in Rwanda, to indicate that there had been a pattern of considerable military interaction with civilian political life, and I think that continued under Habyarimana. 
Q.	In 1992, 1993 and the first half of 1994, would you say that the army were a powerful political force or influence? 
A.	Not in the overt sense of regularly and publicly intervening in political life, but in other senses, clearly, yes, because the military became involved, for example, in the training of the MRND militia.  Soldiers in civilian dress were present at attacks against Tutsis and attacks against people who were opponents of the MRND.  There was a retired military officer of considerable importance on the platform when Mugesera made his speech.  So there are many examples of the importance of the military in political life at that time. 
Q.	Would it be a correct statement that a number of important army officers were essentially -- could be described as Habyarimana's men or men that Habyarimana has either put in place or groomed? 
A.	Yes.  And conversely, there were a number of men who felt that Habyarimana owed his place to them because they were the people who helped him at the time of the coup.  So there was obviously a close and symbiotic relationship there, and if you follow the correspondence within the Rwandan military intelligence, it becomes a serious issue for them when certain army officers begin to suggest that their loyalties might be, in fact, moving in the direction of the MDR or the PSD.  There were officers who were criticised for that form of political leaning.  Now, I stress that in theory, under the multiparty system, military officers were not supposed to be members of political parties, but clearly these political opinions and tendencies of some were well known. 
Q.	Were there people in the army who had clearly ethnicists tendencies? 
A.	Indeed there were. 
Q.	What role would you attribute to the army in terms of how the genocide came about? 
A.	The Rwandan political system, as we have mentioned on many occasions, was a highly complex political regime, political culture, in which military, civilian, and political leaders collaborated in a close and intimate relationship to attempt to carve out the military actors from the other two and to say, "Here is the role we attribute to the military," as opposed to the roles he attributed to others is something that, in my opinion, at this point is futile to attempt.  Perhaps if at some future point a considerable amount of correspondence becomes available between these authorities we may have a better sense, but at this point, given our current state of knowledge, all we can say is, yes, the army was there; yes, the civilian administration were there; yes, the political leaders of certain parties was there, and they cooperated, they talked, they made plans, and made determinations, among themselves in a very continuing and close relationship. 
Q.	Are there individuals within the army who you would attribute major responsibility for what happened in Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	Certainly, as I have just said, there were military figures who were important in the political events preceding and during 1994.  There is no question about it.  
Q.	Was there, in terms of the activities of those individuals which can be -- I'm talking about the army individuals -- which can be attributed towards the cause of the genocide, was there a degree of secrecy in what they did? 
A.	For part of it, yes.  For example, I referred to a document, an undated document, but which from the content was clearly produced in February, late January but most likely February 1994, which was a highly secret document, and that laid out the assignment of various tasks for what was called a system of civilian self-defence.  That government was certainly a highly guarded document.  But there were other kinds of things, for example press statements by persons, even by Habyarimana himself, that were, in fact, public.  And there was, of course, the act of incitement to ethnic hatred over a period of months carried out by the press in close coordination with and supported by important political actors.
MR. O'SHEA:
I was just consulting with Mr. Hooper.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Are you aware of the killing of significant individuals from within the MDR by the army in 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Are you aware of the situation with regard to the treasurer of the MDR, for instance, who it is said died at the hands of the FAR? 
A.	And his name, please, the treasurer?  
Q.	I have to look it up.  Can you help me with that? 
A.	Was it Mr. Gasaranda?  
Q.	It was Twagiryezu, Telesphore.  Do you know that individual? 
A.	I am not aware of the details of his death, no. 
Q.	And what about the gentleman you've already spoken about, Mr. Ngulinzira? 
A.	Yes Mr. Ngulinzira was killed early in the morning of April 7th, either by militia or Rwandan army forces. 
Q.	And, what about other significant figures within the MDR structure that were murdered by the army in 1994? 
A.	Well, of course, the prime minister was the most important in terms of disability and in terms of her rank.  Mr. Rucogoza, I believe, the Minister of Information, was another one.  The president of the constitutional court, by law, was not a member of the political party, but I believe his political tendencies would have put him in the family of MDR, that was Mr. Kavaruganda.  There aren't others who come to mind immediately. 
Q.	Coming back to the MDR properly, Faustin Twagiramungu was president of the MDR from 1992, is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And Dismas Nsengiyaremye was vice-president of the MDR? 
A.	I believe that is correct, yes. 
Q.	In April 1992, was it agreed by all of the parties that -- can I refer to him as Dismas for the sake of simplicity  was it agreed by all of the parties that Dismas should be the prime minister in a broad-based government? 
A.	If he did become the prime minister of the coalition government, and I think that was with the accord of the other members of the coalition, yes. 
Q.	And I referred to the full name in the previous question.  
A.	For the benefit of the stenographers it's Nsengiyaremye, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E. 
Q.	Thank you.  Would it be correct to say that President Habyarimana was initially opposed to Dismas as being prime minister? 
A.	I don't know that.  It could well be the case. 
Q.	Then a point came when Dismas's position was settled for a period of 12 months? 
A.	Yes, although it was not a -- what should we say -- it was not an undisturbed 12 months.  There was an attempted coup against him in October 1992, which, in the end, was aborted in part through the intervention of the Minister of Defence, who was MRND. 
Q.	After those 12 months, his period was extended for a further three months, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And his tenure was to end on the 16th of July 1993? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And the post of prime minister -- I think you've already said this -- the post of prime minister was allocated to the MDR? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And would it be fair to say that when we reached the end of the tenure of Dismas he does not receive the support of the other parties to continue as prime minister? 
A.	I don't know what was the position of other parties.  I don't know that it became that much of an issue, given the dissension within his own party at that point. 
Q.	You don't know about the lack of support for Dismas.  Would you perhaps know about the degree of contention around how Dismas became prime minister? 
A.	In 1992 you mean?  
Q.	Yes, and after. 
A.	I don't recall the details of Dismas's political career. 
Q.	Would it be a reminder if I told you that there was exception on the part of some that Dismas had imposed himself as prime minister under the Arusha Accords? 
A.	I'm sorry?  
Q.	You're not the only one who was misled by my question.  Would it be a reminder if I told you that there was a perception that Dismas had imposed himself as prime minister?  Does that ring a bell? 
A.	That's possible.  What I recall most clearly about Dismas was the accusations that he had been most active in mobilising MDR militia to attack the MRND.  So, many in the MRND were extremely angry at his, supposedly, strong-armed tactics in contesting what they believed to be MRND turf. 
Q.	Are you aware of the fax between Dismas and Boniface Ngulinzira to follow your example, N-G-U-L-I-N-Z-I-R-A, is that correct, that spelling? 
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	Are you aware of fax from Dismas to Boniface that Dismas should be prime minister? 
A.	I do not know that fax. 
Q.	Are you aware of the fact that there was a meeting between Habyarimana, Dismas, Murego and Twagiramungu as to the makeup of the new government at the time of the end of the tenure of Dismas?
A.	Mid-July or later?
Q.	Probably mid-July or a little later. 
A.	I am aware that there were considerable, what shall we say, horse trading is the American parlance, meaning political negotiations about who's to get what, which went on at that point.  But I do not know the details of a specific meeting of that nature. 
Q.	Can I suggest to you -- you don't know about the specific meeting; but this again might remind you of something -- can I suggest to you that at that meeting Faustin Twagiramungu proposed Agathe Uwilingiyimana, U-W-I-L-I-N-G-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A; to be the prime minister under the broad-based government? 
A.	I know that Agathe was Faustin's candidate for the immediate post of prime minister, that is to say to replace Dismas.  
Q.	Well, you've spoken to Faustin Twagiramungu.  Do you know how the proposal of Agathe came about, in his mind? 
A.	It was not a topic that seemed to me of great importance.  I knew there were political deals being cut of various kinds, and to attempt to determine who got what and why was not a primary concern for me. 
Q.	So, you would not know that it was Mr. Twagiramungu's claim that he had done this as a compromise because of the opposition to Dismas? 
A.	That's the kind of explanation he might very well have given. 
Q.	Do you have difficulty with that explanation? 
A.	I have no reason to believe or disbelieve it, except the general knowledge the MRND were very angry with Dismas because of what they believed to be his policy of encouraging violence against the MRND.  So in that context, yes, it seems like a plausible explanation. 
Q.	And this compromise, of presenting Agathe as a candidate, was a compromise that was acceptable to the other parties? 
A.	So it was presented, yes, but obviously within the MDR it was not regarded as an acceptable compromise. 
Q.	We're coming there.  The proposal was, in fact, proposed by Dismas and Murego? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Who were at this meeting I mentioned a moment ago where Twagiramungu proposed Agathe's name? 
A.	I know in general they have posed it; as I said, I do not know the details of that meeting. 
Q.	I think you will agree with this, but the senior MDR politicians, essentially, say for Agathe and Dismas, were, in fact, not happy with Twagiramungu's proposal? 
A.	I think you mean except for Agathe and Faustin. 
Q.	Yes - no. 
A.	Agathe and Dismas?  
Q.	Weren't happy with Twagiramungu's proposal. 
A.	Meaning Agathe and Dismas were happy with it. 
Q.	Sorry, you're right, Agathe which is the wrong part of the equation.  

Would you accept that this proposal made by Faustin Twagiramungu of Agathe was not agreed with the politburo before it was made? 
A.	It appears to have been a decision that Twagiramungu made without following accepted procedures. Whether he had some informal agreement from certain members of the politburo and others which they reneged on later, I don't know.  But he didn't follow the accepted procedures. 
Q.	But, as a result of that meeting, notwithstanding the opposition of Dismas and Murego, at the meeting where Twagiramungu proposed Agathe, as a result of that meeting an interim government was, in fact, appointed with Agathe Uwilingiyimana as prime minister, Anastase Gasana, Faustin Rucogoza and Jean-Marie Vianney Umbanympa (phonetic)? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Was there not a point of view which developed or exception which developed among some people in the MDR that Twagiramungu had made the proposal of Agathe in order to the expression being keep the seat warm for himself in a future government? 
A.	Indeed that accusation was made. 
Q.	So, would it be correct to say that with regard to what Faustin Twagiramungu did, some members of the MDR would have misinterpreted his motives and others would have wanted to exploit the situation politically, is that something you can comment on or not? 
A.	I think it would be perhaps hazardous to comment on Twagiramungu's motives.  He was an extremely adept politician, and whether he saw it as a simple deal where Agathe would keep the seat warm for him or whether he had something else in mind, I'm not sure, but certainly his attempt to assure and his success in assuring her the post resulted in considerable dissension within the MDR. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say that members of the MDR were certainly not happy about the fact that he did not follow the acceptable procedures? 
A.	That's what I just said. 
Q.	Following the move of Twagiramungu, if I can describe it in that way, and for subsequent consequent formation of the government, which was perceived to be against the wishes of the MDR, the political committee met about the situation.  Would that be right? 
A.	There was an extraordinary congress of the party members. 
Q.	We'll come to that, but before that, the political bureau committee met? 
A.	I am not sure of that detail, but it would be a normal step preceding the calling of a congress, yes. 
Q.	And that political bureau called the congress, is that correct? 
A.	That would be my understanding.  That's the way it is usually done. 
Q.	And in the meeting which preceded the congress, which we'll come to, the political bureau disapproved of the actions of Twagiramungu.  You might not know the answer to that, given your previous answer.
A.	That is correct, but presumably, had they approved his actions, they would not have called the party congress.  So I think we can deduce that they did, in fact, disapprove.  
Q.	And once the other leadership of the MDR fully appreciated the opposition to Dismas they proposed another candidate, didn't they? 
A.	The name of Jean Kambanda was proposed. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say that Agathe's home location was Butare? 
A.	Butare préfecture but not Butare town.
(Pages 23 to 35 by R. Lear)





















1230H 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	And the same could be said of Jean Kambanda? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And that would form one reason for moving Kambanda forward as a candidate? 
A.	Possibly.  There was also a history of considerable personal rivalry between if two, so that might actually have been more important than the geographical region of origin. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honours, this might be a convenient moment for the break.  I should, perhaps, indicate, as I know Your Honour will ask me anyway, but I do see difficulties in finishing today, or I'm beginning to see difficulties in finishing today.  So it might be a question to consider, I don't know.  I was probably -- in terms of the scheme that we have, I would have about another two hours.  I can't -- I can't for the moment see it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you have another two hours, we will resume at 1:30, then there would be sufficient time. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
That would -- no, no, that is not what I meant.  I meant if one did resume at 1:30, I would have two hours, and at the moment, I don't think that will be sufficient time, just judging things as they are. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you assess?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Well, it is beginning to look like more four hours than two hours, you know, with my efforts.  And, perhaps, it is a degree of lack of experience which has led me not to be too clever about my estimates, but I think an optimistic view point it is going be four rather than two.  That is the way I see things at the moment. 
 
You see, Your Honours, I can see a progression here, in the sense that I'm realising the unrealisticness of what I am attempting to do gradually -- quite swiftly actually.  And if I'm saying four hours now, I'm not sure where I am going to be at, say 2:30 or 3 o'clock.  I mean, I know -- I know I have to be fair to all of the parties in the court, but I'm not -- I'm worried that I will not be able to finish today.  

What time are Your Honours considering as a possible stopping time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We informed you of the arrangements we have made.  We obviously had made certain contingencies, but you know what our optimum time is, and you know what the ultimate deadline is.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And within those two periods we had made certain contingency plans.  Now, if you need four hours then it is reasonable to try to do it because that is not such -- it just puts a bit of a squeeze on certain people. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
But I can see a situation where I would become extremely unpopular at the end of the day when things shift a bit more. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I can comment, Your Honours?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I would simply like to restate my comments of earlier this morning, is -- that we had agreed yesterday to work until 4 o'clock.  I think we should do that, cut this present conversation short so that we can take the break, if that is the next step, and come back and we can do what we can within the time frames that we have set ourselves.  And if Mr. O'Shea is not finished, then we will address that issue at            4 o'clock.  But I think we had all agreed that we would be here until 4 o'clock this afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. O'SHEA: 
I'm happy with that, Your Honour.  I'm just thinking about the staff, that is all. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, the staff have already agreed to work until 4 o'clock.  It is true that they had agreed, with the understanding that that would see the completion of this testimony.  But we can address that later, if necessary.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the adjournment now.  

Dr. Des Forges, the usual reminder about adjournments, and we will resume at 1:30. 
THE WITNESS:
At 1:30. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
(Court recessed from 1235H to 1345H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, Professor Des Forges, before the break we were addressing the developments within the       MDR Party, and how that revolved around the activities of Mr. Twagiramungu, and got to the point where we have a meeting of the political bureau, which you don't know specifically about, and then an extraordinary congress, as called.  And that congress -- or a congress, let me put it that way, a congress would have been composed of 350 members with a quorum of 200; would that be correct? 
A.	I do not know the precise numbers, but that is approximately correct, yes. 
Q.	Would it also be correct to say that approximately 90 per cent of those at the extraordinary congress voted for the exclusion of Mr. Twagiramungu and Agathe from the party? 
A.	I believe it was in the vicinity of 85 to 90 per cent, yes. 
Q.	And the proposal of Mr. Jean Kambanda as the candidate was put forward at the congress? 
A.	Well --
Q.	Yes, sorry? 
A.	Yes, I believe Kambanda's name had been circulated among the key MDR members before the congress took place, but it may have been on that occasion when it was first publicly announced. 
Q.	And would it be correct to say that, at that congress, Agatha was forced to, and agreed to, offer her resignation? 
A.	That is correct, a decision which she then recanted not long after, I think, the same night or the next morning. 
Q.	Yes.  I think you are right about that.  I think it was the following day she made an announcement on the radio that she remained prime minister -- 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	-- which caused quite a lot of shock and surprise to those who had attended the extraordinary congress?
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Now, there is an explanation, isn't there, as to why Agathe changed her position.  Do you know what that explanation is? 
A.	As I understand it, a number of persons contacted her and persuaded her otherwise. 
Q.	Yes.  Would it be correct to say that Mr. Twagiramungu went to Agatha's (sic) home with 
	Justin Mugenzi from the PL and Gatabazi from the PSD in order to persuade her not to follow the course she was going down? 
A.	I did not know of the connection of Mugenzi and Gatabazi with that initiative. 
Q.	Did you not ask Mr. Twagiramungu about that, or did he not tell you about that? 
A.	I do not recall having discussed this particular issue with him. 
Q.	So, would it be correct to say that Mr. Twagiramungu would take the view that Dismas was the one responsible for causing the division in the party? 
A.	I'm not sure that he would have attributed it to Dismas, certainly not the Dismas alone.  I believe that Murego and Karamira were much more visible as the opponents to Twagiramungu and his part of the party. 
Q.	But in this context, Dismas was Mr. Twagiramungu's essential political opponent? 
A.	Dismas's position was a little hard to read.  He was, like Twagiramungu, a very astute political player.  And I'm not sure that we know the full extent of what his position was. 
Q.	But, others, probably the majority of those within the MDR took the view that it was Twagiramungu who was the cause of the divisions within the party? 
A.	Such was the conclusion of the party congress. 
Q.	Was it also a conclusion of the party congress that the procedures for the implementation of the Arusha Accords should be accelerated? 
A.	Well, the congress had actually annotated the final signature, so in a technical sense I don't suppose they could have called for an acceleration since the final accord had not yet been signed, but certainly they were anxious to move to the stage of elections. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I don't know if the Prosecution can assist me here with the exhibit number -- or the registry, with the exhibit number of the documents on the extraordinary congress, P. 6.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Do you have -- Professor Des Forges do you have access to the Prosecution exhibits at the moment. 
A.	I do not. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Perhaps the registry can help.  For the Prosecution's benefit, it is exhibit 21, as they originally defined it in their exhibit numbers.  And the page that I'm looking at is page 17 of volume II of the Prosecution exhibit bundle. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
What exhibit number in volume II, the exhibit number?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Prosecution exhibit number, in the right-hand corner, is exhibit 21, not the court exhibit number; then it is P. 21, I am told.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Do you have P. 21?  Well I'll read, I will read the disposition to you, and if have any difficulty with it, I will hand you my copy.  

8.5 of the resolutions of the extraordinary congress reads: "Request the president of the republic to expedite the procedure of signing the peace agreement, and, therefore, denounces the trickery of President Habyarimana and certain political party leaders who are trying to delay this signing of the peace agreement and put obstacles on the road to peace democratically chosen --".  So that would seem to suggest that the outcome of extraordinary congress was not anti-thesis to the Arusha Accords, not a wish to slow down the Arusha Accords, but a wish to accelerate them, but accelerate them on a proper basis. 
A.	I had understood your question to be:  Was the -- did the congress resolve to accelerate the implementation?  it did, in fact, implement to resolve -- implement to accelerate the signature.  There is a difference. 
Q.	Yes, I see now.  I didn't quite follow your answer.  Now I understand why it came out the way it did. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the translation of the last bit of the sentence should be, "And placing obstacles on the road to democracy that the country has chosen for itself." 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	And then resolution 9.1 of that is extraordinary congress: "Confirms that the MDR party is ready to participate in the trans -- to the -- to enlarge the transitional government as provided for in the peace agreements signed at Arusha on the 30th of October 1992 and on the 9th of January 1993."

Would it be correct to say that, following this extraordinary congress, Mr. Twagiramungu took the issue over his dismissal from the party to court?  
A.	I believe that is correct, yes. 
Q.	Do you know which court? 
A.	I think it was the Tribunal de premiere instance in Kigali. 
Q.	And do you know what happened there? 
A.	He lost his case. 
Q.	He also filed an appeal, didn't he? 
A.	That could be, I'm not sure of that.  That would have been at the very end of '93.  I don't know that that appeal was ever heard, if it was, in fact, filed. 
Q.	If you could turn to tab number 9 in the Defence bundle.  I suppose that you have seen this document before.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And it is described as a telegram with the MDR logo at the top, dated the 2nd of August 1993, and destined for the president of the republic, president of the RPF, and a number of other destinations, including a number of heads of states and Secretary-General of the United Nations; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And if I may read the first paragraph: "On the eve of signing the peace agreement between the Rwandan government and the RPF, the MDR party is honoured to send you the present message to confirm its position on the self-candidacy, through the position of prime minister of the enlarged transitional government of Twagiramungu, Faustin, ex-chairman of the MDR, presently -- presently excluded from the MDR."

So this confirms the party's position with regard to their unhappiness with what Mr. Twagiramungu had done.  And at  .3 of the same document on the following page, it reads: "Honour, in order to remind you that the said congress confirmed the candidacy of Mr. Jean Kambanda to the position of prime minister of the enlarged transitional government, relying on articles 51, 55 and 56 of the agreement protocol, signed on 9 January 1993, the MDR party considers that to accept an impostor in the person of Faustin Twagiramungu, excluded from the MDR and imposed by the government --  Rwanda government, in --  disdain of the elementary principles of law and party sovereignty and in violation of the agreements already signed, would constitute a basic flaw -- fundamental flaw in the agreement, incalculable consequences for peace and democracy in Rwanda."

So, would you agree that this is a message intended to convey to these various designations a degree of extreme unhappiness at Mr. Twagiramungu`s unilateral actions?  
A.	Yes, and it is very interesting to observe one of the small ironies of history that, here, the protest is that the candidate for prime minister has been imposed by the government, rather than chosen by the party.  And yet Kambanda himself, once he became prime minister, said in one of the documents we were looking at earlier this week, that he had been chosen by all of the parties rather than by his own party.  So it is one of those ironies of history that what is appropriate at one time is apparently deemed inappropriate at another, and vice versa. 
Q.	Well, that is often the case with the speech of politicians; is it not? 
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	It was not a small thing that Mr. Twagiramungu did in terms of the way the MDR operated and, indeed, in terms of the way political parties operate generally everywhere in the world.  There is a political bureau there to make decisions.  It is not expected that an individual make unilateral decisions.  So it is understandable, isn't it, that the unilateral proposal on the part of Mr. Twagiramungu would have been a matter of serious concern to those within the MDR? 
A.	I spoke yesterday about the internal squabbles that happened at this period within political parties and an unseemly scramble for who would get the bigger piece of the pie.  That is, in my estimation, what we are looking at here.  I would not conclude from that that Twagiramungu had made a proposal that was approved by himself alone.  Clearly he took the initiative, but I believe he would not have ventured to take this position had he not been sure of a certain amount of support within the MDR party.  

So, I would simply question your formulation that he alone was -- was the mover of this.  He was certainly the prime mover, but I doubt that he was the sole mover because there were a number of people who chose to hitch themselves to his wagon, just as there were a number of people who chose to hitch themselves to the wagon of Karemera, Murego and Kambanda.  That was just the way things were falling out.  
Q.	You conclude from the fact that some people hitched themselves to Twagiramungu's wagon that, therefore, he must have had support? 
A.	He had support.  The reason he had that support was, in part, a question of opportunism, in the same way that the reason that Karemera and Murego and Kambanda had support was, in part, a question of political opportunism. 
Q.	But you don't know, do you, the extent to which he had support before he made his proposal at the meeting? 
A.	No one took an opinion poll, no. 
Q.	Let me come on to a related, but different, matter: the issue which you have referred to of power.  Would it be correct to say that the first public use of the word power by an MDR minister was in   October 1993? 
A.	I don't know that an MDR minister used the term.  Are you referring to Mr. Karemera. 
Q.	Yes, sorry, an MDR leader not minister? 
A.	Actually, I understand the first use was at a meeting in Gitarama sometime before that important meeting in Kigali, at Amahora stadium. 
Q.	When?
A.	It would have been in the period immediately before the Amahora meeting, perhaps in September. 
Q.	September 1993? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And who was at that meeting? 
A.	That meeting, as far as I know, is not well documented.  In any case, I have not done research on it.  It was just that I was told that the meeting in Kigali had been preceded by another one similar to it in Gitarama where the term Hutu Power was used. 
Q.	It would be correct to say, wouldn't it, that the birth, if there was a birth of a notion of MDR Power, did not lead to any new party structure?
A.	So far as I know, there was no formal structure, but rather it was the announcement of a collaborative relationship.  A collaborative relationship necessarily implies dialogue and conversation among the parties.  But, so far as I know, there was not a secretariat hired or an office rented, or anything of that nature of formality. 
Q.	Do you know when the MDR statute came into being? 
A.	The original statute?  
Q.	Yes; not Parmehutu, the modern MDR. 
A.	It would have been in 1991. 
Q.	And would it be correct to say that between 1991 and April 1994, that statute did not change? 
A.	I am not familiar with the history of amendments to the MDR statute. 
Q.	Now, when you used the term "power", would I be right in saying that, since you say there was no formal structure, that, for you, it represents an ideology or a state of mind.  Is that how you view the concept of power? 
A.	I would identify it as a political tendency, the sharing of which then promoted collaborative action among those who held the ideas of that tendency. 
Q.	When Mr. Karemera used the word in his speech in October 1993, he did not use it as a concept of political tendency, but rather as a popular slogan to entice the crowd, didn't he? 
A.	To entice the crowd into acceptance of the tendency which was described by that title.  It was clearly a propagandist use of a phrase which became a highly popular catch phrase? 
Q.	Do you have any reason to believe that Mr. Karemera, when he made that speech, saw that word as a tendency? 
A.	I think he clearly understood the development of a certain body of ideas and interest.  At what point he decided to put this label on them, I don't know.  But if you go back to the foundation of the CDR, for example, in March of 1992, it is clear that the expression of the idea of a Hutu umbrella organisation which would not be a party as such, but which would encompass and coordinate the action of Hutu who had the same ideas but remained in various political parties was already well developed.  So, in that sense the CDR itself did not fulfill that promise because it became rather a political party, but in its original expression it was meant to be rather a Parmehutu expression of solidarity.  
Q.	If one looks at the speech of Mr. Karemera where he uses the word power, he does not use the word power in any inflammatory sense anywhere in his speech except at the very end.  Is that right, the power is only used at the very end of his speech?
A.	We could look at the speech, but my recollection is that you are correct that it was, in fact, the encapsulation and the concise statement of what the whole speech had been about, and in that sense was the slogan that he felt most appropriate to conclude with. 
Q.	But it was a crowd enticing slogan, wasn't it --
A.	Of course. 
Q.	-- power, power, power? 
A.	Of course. 
Q.	He didn't offer any explanation as to what it meant or give any background to it? 
A.	After having just given a speech in which he said, We are here not just to heat heads, but to correct -- I'm speaking loosely because I don't have the text in front of me, but one of the phrases that was used in the speech, I'm sure of, we are not here just to heat up heads.  There was a reference to the revolution of '59 and to the need to work.  I think that given the other ideas developed in the speech, it was abundantly clear what the slogan was meant to represent.  And, indeed, it was meant to whip up the crowd.  There is no doubt about it. 
Q.	Yes, whip up to crowd? 
A.	And, indeed, as he said himself, we are not here just to whip you up in the sense of making you agitated and angry, we are here to move you to action. 
Q.	Do you really think that the people who listened to that speech, read anything into the word power than power, power, power? 
A.	Given the context of the moment, which was several days after the assassination of the Hutu president of Burundi; given the propaganda which was then spewing out of RTLM and out of various print media, to give this kind of speech before a stadium full of people, and then to end up with shouts of Hutu Power, Hutu Power, Hutus Power, MDR Power, so on and so forth, I think the intent is clear particularly when the speaker says himself, we are not here just to get you excited and to heat up your heads.  We are here to move you to work.  And work was the term which was signifying the killing of Tutsi.  So, I think the audience understood very well what was meant by power.  It was, we have the majority, we have the strength needed to take control of this situation and to ensure that the political developments will go the way we want them to go, even if that means killing other people. 
Q.	Can we look at that speech for a moment.  It is Prosecution bundle two.  It is former Prosecution Exhibit 25.  I don't know if I could be assisted with the court exhibit number, 23rd of October?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The court exhibit number is 25, you said?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
I'm not sure Your Honour.  25 is the Prosecution exhibit number as marked in the bundle. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Did he say volume II?  Excuse me, Counsel. 
MR. O'SHEA:  
Yes, volume II.  I'm told it might be in the bundle of speeches, Exhibit 41.  I don't know if you can assist, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Unfortunately I work from my own prep files, so I don't have it numbered the same way.  But I know it's in the main file at volume II, it is P. 25 -- excuse me, not P. 25, but it is on the Prosecution list as 25.  I don't know what the P number is for that one, but it was entered into evidence. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Let me read to you parts of the speech in the English translation --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If we wait a moment, does Dr. Des Forges have the speech in front of her?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not, and I would prefer to have it before we deal with it in detail. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well, I will wait a moment.
MR. WEBSTER: 
If the registry cannot find it, I will surrender my copy. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	You referred to moment ago to part of the speech, which I think is contained on the third page of the speech, because I'm not sure if you are looking at the same thing that I am looking at, and it is the paragraph that begins, "How then can we go to aid of Burundi;" we should have the same translation because it is the Prosecution document.  

I'm actually going to refer to the sentence that you indicated a moment ago, so that might help you find it, "It is not a matter of stirring people up --" I don't know, are you still looking for it? 
A.	No I have it.  Thank you. 
Q.	"That thing, let's begin, it is not a matter of stirring people up by simply saying that we have goals, that we shall go to work.  From my part, fighting with a Tutsi that you meet by chance in the street, by holding him responsible for all of the ills is to forget the disease that is ravishing you, that is ravishing us as Hutus? Now correct me if I am wrong, but you appear to be interpreting this as an invitation to kill Tutsis? 
A.	I believe that is the correct interpretation.  If you continue further down the paragraph you will see what I mean. 
Q.	Well, all right, which part of the paragraph?
A.	Well, first of all, he refers to Burundi.  Then he says, "Fighting with the Tutsi you meet by chance and holding him response is to forget the disease that is ravishing you, that is ravishing -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, please, slowly, sorry. 
THE WITNESS: 
And that disease is obviously disunity, the lack of solidarity among Hutu, okay.  "It is to forget that someone can send you to go and destroy your neighbor's property, forget that the Hutu have sown terror in a fellow Hutu's house." This is directed at Dismas, right.  "The whole Kabahoza (phonetic) phenomenon which has destroyed Hutu solidarity," right.  "And that others have benefited from the situation.  The Inkotanyi, the RPF, who are here in town, do they speak?"  Obviously, the answer implied here is, no.  "But on that day when we are distracted," meaning by our own disunity and internal quarrels, "When we would have failed to eat the necessary, you will be surprised to find an Inkotanyi on your front door" at your front door he means, "In front of so and so's door, in front of the door, without warning.  Therefore, what we should have done, it is not recommended to keep shouting these words here and there just to get us all excited.  We should explore with the powers that be ways and means.  If they really wish to work, ways and means that would enable us to know what is eating us.  The enemy who is among us right from now, this is not the enemy in Burundi, this is the enemy who is among us here and now, we shall not go to look for things from Burundi which we are told may be reproduced here, and fail to look at what is in Rwanda, whereas the enemy is already in our mist."  Right.  

So, I think for me that is absolutely clear that, yes, he takes off from Burundi but he arrives back in Rwanda very quickly.  And he says at the start of the speech in the second paragraph, he refers, at the second line from the bottom of the second paragraph, "The unspeakable act that has just been committed in Burundi will also be committed in Rwanda if we do not take care."  

So, yes, the context is Burundi and the assassination of Ndadaye, but it is brought home repeatedly that what is his real concern here is not Burundi, it is Rwanda.  And it is what is happening there.  And Burundi is only to be a warning of what is going on under our very own eyes, and that we are not seeing.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	I don't see how -- do you say that the only reasonable interpretation of this speech is a message to kill the Tutsi; is that your position? 
A.	It is not the only reasonable interpretation in the sense of any number of possible interpretations.  But it is the interpretation that best fits the factual context of that time.  In other circumstances, it could have other meanings.  But in Rwanda on October 23rd 1993, that is the interpretation which best fits. 
Q.	Well, where do you see kill the Tutsis? 
A.	The word work is a word which refers back to the 1959-1960's period when the term was used as a euphemism for killing Tutsi. 
Q.	Now earlier --  
A.	Has not been established here?  I'm surprised, it seemed to me that that was an accepted conclusion already.  I'm sorry if I assumed that that was already known, but that is, indeed, the use of the term,  work.  That was also the case in the Sindikubwabo speech. 
Q.	Well, you said that during your examination-in-chief.  I accept that? 
A.	I did, yes. 
Q.	But you see -- I mean, this, I suggest, is an example of what I was saying earlier in my cross-examination of you, when you are conducting your research looking at a document with your own world view.  And your own world view is an American who has 40 years of experience in Rwanda.  You look at a word and you take it back to the 1960's.  

Now, what makes you think that the young people in that crowd interpreted that word in the way that you interpret it? 
A.	When I had a tape recording of this speech and I gave it, without comment, to a young Rwandan and asked him to translate it for me.  When he got to this part of the speech, he turned off of tape recorder and got up and left the room.  And when I asked him what was the issue?  He said, you cannot understand how strong this is for us.  
Q.	Is he --  
A.	He was, by the way, a Hutu and, I believe, although I have never asked him, that his political tendency was MDR. 
Q.	Do you know that Karemera was a Tutsi? 
A.	Kajuga was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Well, yes.  
A.	I mean many people --  
Q.	That is why I raise it.  That is why I raise it? 
A.	People define ethnicity in many ways, we all know that.  It is accepted in social science that ethnicity is a highly variable concept depending on a combination of personal experience and personal interest.  That a Tutsi should, in fact, participated in calls for violence against Tutsi if, in fact, he thought by that way he would cover himself, protect himself and advance his own interests, is not at all a surprising concept.  There are Tutsi who actually killed other Tutsi in order to convince people that they were really Hutu and should continue to live. 
Q.	So, there is no real significance to the fact that this young man was a Hutu, is there? 
A.	I was simply, wanting to, perhaps, anticipate your question as the ethnicity of the translator. 
Q.	So, is it the interview with this young man which has convinced you that this speech carries the message, kill the Tutsi? 
A.	Of course not, of course not.  Haven't I made the point that when I interpret, when I analyse, it is on the basis of extensive context, extensive experience and extensive thought.  I simply was attempting to give you a capsule indication in order to make the idea clear to you.  
Q.	But the people in this crowd did not have extensive knowledge and give extensive thought around this speech, did they? 
A.	If you listen to the recording and you hear the response of the crowd, I think you can sense the reaction to this slogan, as you call it, that Karamera has launched. 
Q.	The power slogan?
A.	Indeed.  And it is welcomed with enormous approval by that crowd.  And I think a significant number of people in that crowd understood this as a new declaration of Hutu solidarity which was going to enable people to come together around a new flag; and to, therefore, undo a situation which they found unsatisfactory in their estimation, a situation in which Tutsi were in the person of the RPF, going to be rejoining the government, in which the national army was going to be seen as essentially having been defeated, and other considerations for -- in terms of their personal lives that they preferred not to have come about. 
Q.	Well, I understand that you put together the reaction of this young man, together with your knowledge of the 60's, to interpret the use of the word work.  But how does that convince us that this speech clearly has the meaning which you are attaching to it? 
A.	I think we could consult the press of the time to see what the reaction of people was to this speech.  My assessment of the importance of the speech is certainly not based upon one person.  But many people spoke about this speech, took it as an event of great symbolic importance in announcing this new Hutu solidarity; which was by definition a solidarity directed against those Inkotanyi who, "Some day were going to appear at your front door without warning."  That is what the words say on this page; Look out, this guy is going to appear at your front door without warning. "And they are ravishing us as Hutu", it is not they are ravishing us a Rwandans, or they are ravishing us as members of the MDR, they are ravishing us as Hutu. 

And if you look back on the previous page, the emphasis on -- in the middle of the page, the preceding page, "You delude yourself into thinking these things concern only MDR.  And every Hutu, wherever he may be, believes that this is a matter for MDR alone.  So who is not a Parmehutu?  Which of you does not have Parmehutu blood flowing through his veins.  Which of you did not benefit from Kayibanda`s generousity.  So, are your eyes open; are you vigilant; do you remember?"  

And here it is not I who am reading back to the 1960's, it is he who is making the conscious reference back to Kayibanda, back to the days of the revolution, back to the Parmehutu.  
Q.	Now, you have given your interpretation which you think is clear, that this is a message to kill the Tutsi.  Let's read it again:  "Let's begin, it is not matter of stirring people up.  By simply saying that we have goals, that we shall go to work."  

So he is there not using the word work in the sense of, let's go to work, assuming your interpretation is correct.  But he is saying, this is not the thing you should do.  You should not simply say, we shall go to work.  He then says "For my part, fighting with a Tutsi that you meet by chance in the street, by holding him responsible for all of the ills is to forget the disease that is ravishing you."  So, he is not approving with fighting the Tutsi which we meet with in the street.  He is saying that by doing that you are forgetting the disease which is ravishing you.  And the disease which is ravishing you he explains later in terms of the RTLM, and the use of the RTLM.  

So your reading of this by reference to the word work is your interpretation of this speech as killing the Tutsi, but it is not the only plausible interpretation of that paragraph, is it? 
A.	I'm just looking at the French translation, which I believe was the first translation done. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could ask, Mr. O'Shea, could you direct me to the passage that you just read, please, in the English translation. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  I mean, I remind you that you will have your opportunity to re- examine, but the passage that I am referring to it begins, "How then can we go to aid of Burundi." 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Well, I mean, Dr. Des Forges, I don't mean to interrupt you, but this is a speech that you know very well? 
A.	But I don't know this particular translation; all right. 
Q.	Fair enough? 
A.	You will see in this speech the use of very harsh language dealing with other members in the MDR, both Higiro, who was the head of Radio Rwanda at the time, and the prime minister being characterised as Inyenzi or cockroaches, right.   And if you look at the conclusion which is what leads up to the final use of this slogan, the clear assertion that there must be solidarity among Hutu, that Hutu must not fight with other Hutu.  The clearly ethnic nature of this is, without doubt, right, "Avoid attacking each other," this is the final paragraph before the end, if I look at the English translation that is here, there is quite a difference between the English and the French.  And it might be good to look at the Kinyarwanda.  The English says, for example, "Hutu should avoid arguing with each other."  Whereas the French is much stronger and says, (French spoken). 
Q.	Why is that stronger?
A.	(French spoken) is quite a bit stronger than argue.  You and I may be arguing but we are not (French spoken).
Q.	I suggest that is going a bit far, Professor Des Forges.  I suggest it is a direct translation.  
A.	"Let us avoid attacking ourselves while we are being attacked.  Let us prevent the traitor from infiltrating our ranks and stealing our power."  Now, there you have the use of it, all right.   The infiltrator, obviously, is to be understood as those people affiliated with the RPF, with the Tutsi side, and with the other Hutu opposition parties that are opposed to this stance, this tendency.  "Henceforth, every Hutu" it is the slogan that we have within MDR, "but we could say that we should demonstrate the power of every Hutu by going to the assistance of Burundi," okay.  So Hutu Power, MRND Power, CDR Power, CDR, the most ethnic statement of hatred of Tutsi from the beginning is clearly affiliated here.  The CDR -- MDR put on the same basis as CDR, Interahamwe, JDR, the Hutu united,okay.  

So, how do you make the transition from a clearly ethnic statement of solidarity and unity to the next step which is calling for violence?  In your opinion, that is not what this speech says, but in the opinion of Rwandans at the time, that is what this speech said.  And it was said in terms that were extremely Rwanda terms, that is by the use of historical allusions and reference back to a previous period of violence against the Tutsi.  It is equivalent to Mukasara saying, "Send them home by the river route."  Knowing full well that the river route was the euphemism covering the slaughter and evacuation of bodies of Tutsi by the river.  

So the chose of work, and in a speech where the reference is to Kayibanda, to Parmehutu, to we are all Hutu together. Finishing with a call to unity, including the CDR and the MRND and and the MDR and the Interahamwe, all Hutu united, to me in the context of the historical knowledge that I have, and in the context of what is said and was said by Rwandans at the time, this is clearly a statement of a call to action which means violence against Tutsi.  
Q.	Well, I would suggest that it says the opposite.  You see this is my point, you come to these speeches and these documents with your historical knowledge.  You focus on specific words, and then bring out meaning to those specific words.  But --  
A.	That is what I am here for. 
Q.	I suggest that you are coming to this speech with a large amounts of baggage, if I can put it that way, your baggage as a historian and as a person who has had contact with Rwanda for 40 years. 
A.	Absolutely, right. 
Q.	But a person who is not a Rwandan, who does not speak fluent Kinyarwanda, you have placed your interpretation on this.  But I suggest to you, that to say that the only -- the only clear interpretation of this speech is a call to kill the Tutsi, is a little far-fetched. 
A.	Well, what I say to you is, and I have said it before, it is not the only possible interpretation of this speech but it is the interpretation which I have given it on the basis of serious research and reflection and on the basis, as you say, of 40 years of knowledge of the region.  Someone who comes from another region and who knows relatively little about the use of allusion in Kinyarwanda who does not know the history of the country, could, of course, easily give it another interpretation.  Although, even so, it seems to me the clearly ethnic orientation, the use of vocabulary should come through even to someone who is not knowledgeable about the region.  

Surely calling members of the opposition cockroaches and associating them with the Tutsi, talking about the Tutsi showing up without warning on your doorstep, surely these are apparent to anyone. 
Q.	Well, you also said, in your examination-in-chief, that the word Inkotanyi was a word used with more respect.  I mean if this was such a speech of ethnic hatred and violence as you attach to it, on your own analysis of the word Inkotanyi, based on your extensive knowledge as a historian, why is the word there? 
A.	In that particular paragraph, it is a reference to the RPF.  But the use of the word Inyenzi is also frequent in this speech, not just the two examples I gave, but on the first page, as well, there is a reference to Inyenzi, referring to -- this is at the bottom of the first page in the French version; in the English version --  
Q.	And the other thing I don't understand is why you attach so much significance to the reference of the CDR.  I mean, I understand your point that the CDR was an extremist party, but here we are in the context of a process of negotiations of peace accords, where it is suggested that all of the parties should come together and form a new government.  And we are also in the context of only several months after what you describe as a massive attack from the RPF.  I mean that -- does that not explain some of the emotion in this speech, if there is emotion in this speech? 
A.	Well, this is not the 12th of February; this is the 23rd of October and a lot of water has gone under the bridge.  So I don't think we can argue that Karemera is reacting to the advance of the RPF in February 1993.  And on the question of the CDR being part of the peace process, remember the CDR has explicitly rejected the Arusha Accords; at this point has refused to sign the code of ethics which would have eliminated calls to ethnic hatred.  That is what the CDR represents at this point. 
Q.	Well, you say that it is water under the bridge, but, I mean, it was a significant event. 
A.	Of course, I described it myself as a significant event. 
Q.	And, for instance, in your country when the incident occurred on September the 11th, I mean, we might be able to say now that it was water under the bridge, but several months afterwards it was still quite deep emotions about it.  

Here we are in Rwanda trying to negotiate peace accords, and then the RPF decides to launch a massive attack which causes hundreds of thousands of displaced persons.  And several months later,  that is water under the bridge.  And this speech is in the context of the death of the president of Burundi.
A.	Of course, my point has been from the start that there was a growing sense of fear and anger and resentment of the RPF, beginning, at least, in February 1993.  And I have attempted to detail the growth of the Hutu Power idea in exactly the terms you have used.  So, I am not saying that that was not a reality.  I am simply saying that it is a little simplistic to present this as a reaction to an attack from many months before.  It is the culmination of a long period here.  And I think it is also abundantly clear that Karemera is attempting to cease the forefront of a Hutu power movement, in part, with the intention of displacing Habyarimana and making himself a central figure of pan Hutu solidarity, in a way that Habyarimana is no longer able to claim to be because he has been someone who has made too many concessions.  So here is Karemera attempting to reclaim the revolutionary heritage of the 1050's and 1060's, calling upon Kayibanda, calling upon the Parmehutu and saying, let us go back to the time when we were all Hutu together.

1530H 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes.  It is, of course, one thing to express ethnic unity, it's quite another thing to call for murder.  What I'm suggesting to you, Professor Des Forges, is that -- and I think you've sort of agreed with me on this, is that there is a context, a very clear context as to why there would be a feeling for ethnic unity.  But it does not follow from that, that the speaker wants people to go and kill the other ethnic group. 
A.	Had Karamira spoken carelessly -- been swept up in the emotion of the moment and used words that were with unintentional meaning taken to represent a call for violence, he had ample opportunity to correct a misperception, if such there were, of what he had said.  But yet if you look at his subsequent pronouncements, at least those with which I'm familiar, he does not distance himself from this notion.  

The way in which the movement was made from the sense of the need for Hutu solidarity to the next stage, which is the need to attack Tutsi, is obviously a movement which takes time and occurs in different ways for different people at different points.  But that this represented a call for violence, an attempt to rally Hutu against Tutsi was clear at the time and remains clear. 
Q.	Yes.  Well, you weren't there at the time.  This man -- 
A.	-- I was in contact with many people at that time. 
Q.	You weren't in contact with the crowd and you weren't in the crowd. 
A.	We can listen to the tape. 
Q.	And  --
A.	That would give us a sense of the crowd. 
Q.	And this is a man who was Tutsi, had a Tutsi wife, four Tutsi children, this is not -- 
A.	Was he acknowledged to be a Tutsi?  I think not.  If you read the content of the speech, whether he was or was not in terms of what was on his identity card, he is clearly claiming to be a Hutu and to be leading a Hutu movement. 
Q.	Well, he's -- he's a leading politician? 
A.	Point proven.
Q.	But it -- it does not prove the point of a wish to kill.  But I'll leave it there.  I -- I think that I've made the point.  

I'm suggesting that you have put one interpretation on this speech, which is not the only plausible interpretation, it's not even the most reasonable one.  Would you accept that insofar as the word "power" was used it was a label accorded by others, not a label which members of the MDR put on themselves?  
A.	If it was an acknowledged leader of the MDR who introduces the term, it seems to me he owns it. 
Q.	Yes, but he didn't call himself "Power" did he, he just said, "power", "power", "power"? 
A.	That's a little bit splitting hairs, isn't it.  Yes, he did not say, "I am the founder of a Hutu Power movement."  He said only, "Hutu Power, MRND Power, CDR Power, Hutu United Power."  No -- he -- yes, he did not say, "I am  founding a Hutu Power movement", that is absolutely correct. 
Q.	And are you aware of any incident where he describes himself as "Power"? 
A.	Well, yeah, right here, what else -- I mean, isn't that the only reasonable interpretation?  How else would -- would -- would one identify a movement except in the terms of the person who has proclaimed the phrase?  He is the initiator of it, he owns it. 
Q.	Again, I suggest that that's a leap of logic which illuminates some of the points I was making earlier in my cross-examination.
A.	Did he ever disavow it?  Did he ever say, "No, no, no, you've all made a mistake.  This is dreadful.  
	I certainly do not mean to speak for Hutu Power?"  
Q.	Did he not say once on the radio that there is no MDR Power?  Or are you not aware of that?  
A.	Let's see -- let's see the reference.  I think he's clearly saying there is no MDR Power.  It is Hutu Power.  It is MDR Power, MRND Power, CDR Power, Interahamwe Power, Hutu United Power.  It is not 
	MDR Power.  
Q.	Well, are you aware of a radio interview where he denies the existence of MDR Power? 
A.	No.  I would like to see it. 
Q.	Would you accept that the word "power" would not have been part of the vocabulary 
	of Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu? 
A.	I certainly would not exclude the possibility of Twairamungu using that term, if it were in his interests and if he chose to found a movement by that name.  He could have been the first to use Hutu Power, but as far as I know, he was not.  

In other words, I see no necessary linkage between Karamira and Power except for the fact that he was the person who used it.  Someone else could have got there first, but didn't. 
Q.	My -- my -- my -- well, you spoke to Mr. Twagiramungu.  Did you not ask him about Power? 
A.	We discussed certain political events of the period. 
Q.	Did you -- did you ask him about the phrase "Power"? 
A.	I do not recall a specific question asking about the use of Power.  I could consult my notes, but I do not recall having asked him specifically about the origin of the term. 
Q.	Why not?  I mean, this is -- 
A.	Because it was a matter of public knowledge that Karamira had enunciated the phrase and it had become identified with him and his political tendency.  It's not the kind of question one needs to ask. 
Q.	So -- so because you had formed your conclusions about Power you didn't feel it necessary to ask 
	Mr. Twagiramungu about it, the man who is central in your theory to this whole issue? 
A.	Because it was an apparent public fact that the person who originated the term was Karamira; that it was associated with him.  It was for that reason I did not find it necessary to ask Mr. Twagiramungu what was the origin of it.  I knew what was the origin of it as a factual matter established by the very documents we've been looking at. 
Q.	Yes, I grant you that.  It was -- it was associated with Mr. Karamira.  It was associated with 
	Mr. Karamira.  But the reasons for the division in the MDR were not directly linked to this Power ideology as you describe it, were they? 
A.	I have attempted to describe the unseemly scramble for spoils, which led to divisions in various political formations.  As I'm sure you will agree, politicians do not normally proclaim themselves the head of a movement simply on the basis of wanting to enrich themselves or assure themselves government posts.  Rather, they choose an idea, an umbrella under which they can take shelter.  And in this case, Mr. Karamira, Murego, Kambanda took the umbrella of Hutu Power.  Could it have been otherwise in other historical circumstances?  Could -- could Twagiramungu have been the person who got the umbrella first?  I don't know.  It could well have been.  But what happened, as a matter of fact, was that it was Karamira, and Murego and Kambanda who got hold of the umbrella and who used it. 
Q.	Well, it's interesting that you focussed on Karamira and Karamira's use of the word -- his word, his label, his "shelter".  

You -- you, I think, accept -- I think you possibly said this during the course of these proceedings; I know you have said it in previous proceedings.  You -- you would accept, wouldn't you, that politics is complicated? 
A.	I think we can all agree on that, can't we? 
Q.	Yes, and particularly Rwandan politics.
A.	I'm not sufficiently versed in the study of all national politics to arrive at a definitive statement concerning the relative complexity of politics everywhere in the world, but I can tell you from my experience, Rwandan politics is complex. 
Q.	Yes, it's complex.  And Power, on the other hand as a concept, is not complex, is it? 
A.	It's a very attractive slogan for the crowds. 
Q.	It's simple.  And if there were an ideology of Power which was being bandied about in the mind of the ordinary person in the streets, knowing that Mr. Karamira was the one that made the famous speech, knowing that Mr. Karamira was opposed to Mr. Twagiramungu, it would be easy to associate the concepts of Power with the split in MDR because of that central figure, Karamira.  It's easy to make that association in the mind of the person who does not know much about the internal politics of the MDR, right?  
A.	Well, I think one needs to also take some care to look at the actual expressions of the person with whom the label is associated.  This is not happenstance that this is associated with Mr. Karamira.  There are numerous statements by 
	Mr. Karamira, in October and subsequently, which indicate what the general contours of the term "Power" was to come to mean.  So it's not simply an accidental thing that this is associated with him; that he was the first person to pronounce those syllables.  But, rather, he does indeed become a spokesperson for a given point of view which is that of Hutu solidarity and which is encapsulated in Hutu Power. 

The speech -- the speech of the 23rd itself, as I say, is a clearly ethnic -- ethnicist speech and the fact that he's Tutsi has nothing to do with whether or not he pronounced it.  He said those words. 
Q.	Well, let's -- let's try and see the wood from the trees here.  We have two things:  We have the split in the MDR party on the one hand, and then we have the Hutu Power ideology, which you have described on the other. 

Now, you presumably would accept, would you not, that they -- I know that you believe that they're 
at least overlapping, but you -- you would accept, would you not, that those are distinct processes or distinct ideas?  The development -- 
A.	No, not at all, because as I've explained, it's not accidental that a choice was made of an ideology.  
	It may be that the fundamental cause of the split between them is personal rivalry or desire for posts, but they have chosen ideological points of view to make clear their demarcation from each other. 
Q.	Well, you -- you've already accepted that the members of the MDR party were very unhappy with what Mr. Twagiramungu did.  Mr. Twagiramungu did not do what he did because of Power.  
	Mr. Twagiramungu did what he did, as you have accepted, as a compromise.  It was a political situation.
A.	Sure.  But it was a political situation that was taking place in a given context and the context was one in which there was a developing movement to pull away from the relationship with the RPF and the desire to collaborate in implementing the arrangements under Arusha towards another kind of position, which would also have constituted a nominal acceptance of Arusha where the power dynamics would be different.  And it was, of course, in connection with that increasing -- what shall we say -- disenchantment with collaboration with the RPF that this particular faction of the MDR party defined itself as it did.  It was not accidental.  It was because of that whole history that we've gone through of an RPF attack and -- and subsequent political discussions with them and the decision to move away from that, not to trust them. 
Q.	We've just gone through the whole history of the division in the MDR party, most of which you agreed with.  Only two or three items you didn't agree with were -- or you didn't comment on was because you didn't know, but -- but essentially the history of the division, as I put it to you, you essentially agreed with.
A.	Sure, but it wasn't a complete history.  I mean, it was a history of one level; it was a history of the personal animosities and the struggle for power within a political formation.  But that political formation also became identified with a stance of increasing distrust of the RPF and of anyone who was willing to collaborate with the RPF. 
Q.	Became identified as -- 
A.	Sure, beginning in February 1993. 
Q.	But you would presumably accept that even on your analysis at the Kabusunzu meeting there may have been people who were absolutely shocked and horrified at what Mr. Twagiramungu did and, therefore, supported the vote to exclude him, but who did not embrace the Hutu Power ideology as you express it.  I mean, that's a matter of simple logic, isn't it? 
A.	It's not inconceivable; it's not inconceivable.  But the point is that in the political system of Rwanda where people more or less line themselves up in terms of the important personages, where clientele relationships are very important and people will align themselves in consideration of those relationships,  
the willingness to participate in the congress and to vote in a given way in the congress could equally well be a reflection of choice of which leader to follow, which clientele to join on the basis of ideological considerations or on the basis of personal considerations and opportunism or -- or a mixture.  I mean, as we have established very clearly, this is a complex situation and people could well be acting for a number of motives simultaneously. 
Q.	See, earlier in my cross-examination I suggested to you that as a historian one can place a coherent and neat description of events when the reality of the past itself might be far more complex. 
I mean, you -- you wouldn't suggest, I suppose, that -- because you said that 85 to 90 percent of the people at the Kabusunzu meeting voted for the exclusion of Twagiramungu and Agathe.  
I suppose you wouldn't suggest that it necessarily follows that all those 85-90 percent embraced the ideology that you've described as Hutu Power? 
A.	Certainly not.  There's no way to know from that particular document or that particular statistic of what percentage would or would not have adhered to the ideology of Hutu Power. 
Q.	So Mr. Webster's point about the fact that there's a name in the attendance list is really neither here nor there when it comes to Hutu Power, is it? 
A.	In and of itself a name on a list would not be totally conclusive, but it might be a starting point for a pattern of behaviour which could lead to certain conclusions. 
Q.	Yes.  But as a careful historian you won't -- you won't commit yourself to saying that any specific proportion of the people who attended that meeting had or -- or -- or grew to have the Hutu Power ideology, would you? 
A.	Without doing an individual study of the 290 or whatever who were there, it would be very difficult to draw such a conclusion. 
Q.	Right.  
A.	But it is a starting point, and if someone is on the list in July and subsequently proves to be a member of a government which is chosen by Karamira and Murego, I think one has another significant point of information in order to begin to build a picture. 
Q.	Now, let's anaylyse for a moment what you mean by Hutu Power.  Am I fair in my constant description of it as an ideology? 
A.	A tendency, a political tendency might be a more accurate way to describe it because ideology perhaps suggests too great a level of formality. 
Q.	And can you describe that political tendency?  Can we have a definition of Hutu Power? 
A.	Hutu Power is defined by Mr. Karamira, which is, after all, the significant definition here; it is one of all Hutus united together without regard to previous points of conflict.  Hutu who will stick together because they're Hutu, regardless of any other considerations and I believe he has the right to give the definition since he was the one who created it. 
Q.	Yes.  But, of course, you give his speech a very particular and pointed meaning.  
A.	I think the words are clear. 
Q.	But -- 
A.	On the question of how he is defining Hutu Power, I don't think you and I have can have any significant difference -- 
Q.	Yes --  
A.	-- because he does say repeatedly, "We are all Hutu together", and that's what he says at the end. 
Q.	So you're not - you're not - you're not embracing all of your conclusions on his speech in the concept of Hutu Power, you're saying that Hutu Power is a concept of Hutu uniting.  You're not saying that it's a concept of Hutu uniting and going out and killing the Tutsis, are you?  That's -- that's not what you mean by Hutu Power, is it? 
A.	It is a -- Hutu Power is the underlying and fundamental unity of Hutu, defined in ethnic terms, which by implication means, in distinction to other people who are of other ethnicity. 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	If those people of other ethnicity are also perceived as a threat to the Hutu and thereby become enemies, and the subsequent next stage is that words alone are not sufficient, but we must move to action with the help of our authorities, then that does indeed become a call for violence against the people of the other ethnicity. 
Q.	Yes.  You -- you -- you, of course, accept that when one's interpreting concepts one has to interpret them in the context of -- of where the person is living and what culture the person has.  You would presumably accept that it would be quite a different thing for me, as a white person from England -- in a South African context, for example -- to talk about the blacks, than it would for a Hutu to talk about the Tutsis.  They're -- they're different psyches, different contexts, aren't they? 
A.	I don't think I follow you.  I'm not quite sure how you would compare a white person of English origin in South Africa as opposed to a Hutu in Rwanda.  How -- how is this comparison valid?
Q.	The point I'm trying to make here is that we, who come from the west, if we hear a Hutu saying the word "Tutsi", coming with our western baggage, we would immediately interpret that as racism perhaps, not necessarily, but perhaps.  But in the Rwandan context, it might not necessarily be racism for a Hutu to talk about a Tutsi.  
A.	Perhaps.  As you said, perhaps. 
Q.	I mean, we have to place ourselves in the African context, don't we? 
A.	Indeed.  In the context of violence, in the context of people being killed for their ethnicity, yes, that is the appropriate context in which to examine the question. 
Q.	Yes, but whether we're in conflict or whether we're not in conflict, if one African group refers to another African group by the name of their tribe, that is not necessarily racism, is it? 
A.	I don't accept the use of the term "tribe" in discussing Rwanda.  It seems to me inappropriate. 
Q.	All right.  I accept that "ethnic group" would probably be better.  Is that right?   It wouldn't necessarily amount to racism.  
A.	No.  It would not necessarily amount to racism.  It would depend on the context.  One does need to look at things in the context of the time, in the reality of the moment, and to make a blanket statement that X is not necessarily Y or Y is not necessarily Z is indeed well within the possibility of statement.  But I don't know that it carries us very well. 
Q.	Well's, let's put it in the Rwandan context.  In the Rwandan context of the war, of the killings and so forth, the mere fact that one Rwandan refers to another as a Tutsi is not necessarily racism, is it? 
A.	Certainly not.  But if he refers to a Tutsi as a cockroach, if he associates him necessarily with a combatant force when such a person may have absolutely no association with a combatant force, if he presumes that the Tutsi is necessarily his enemy, in that case, I think we are indeed in the category of racism. 
Q.	Well, the RPF were an enemy.  They were an enemy with which the country was at war. 
A.	If we're talking October, no.  No longer, we've had the Arusha Peace Accords; we're now at peace. 
Q.	Well, yes.  We -- we have a conflict situation.  We have an attack on the 8th of February 1993 -- 
A.	Which has been resolved by a ceasefire and a return of the troops to their original positions. 
Q.	And then after -- and then after the downing of the plane we then have a further RPF attack, so --
A.	Yes, but let's -- let's try to keep things straight.  Are we talking about October?  Are we talking about April?  Are we talking about the previous February?  Because things change over time and they become very different and it does not forward our discussion in the least to confuse things like this. 
Q.	Well, what I'm suggesting, Professor Des Forges, what I'm suggesting -- yes, Professor Des Forges, could you try to slow down a bit for the interpreters, and that probably applies to me as well.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the pause, please. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	And the pause, I'm reminded.  
MR. O'SHEA:
In fact, talking of pauses, Your Honour, I don't know if we should perhaps break.  No?  Oh, okay, we'll carry on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you have to complete your cross-examination?

MR. O'SHEA:
Honestly and ashamedly, I cannot finish today.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, then there's no point in having a break and coming back. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, very well.  I'll continue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll go to 4 o'clock and then reassess the situation at that time. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	What I'm -- what I'm saying, Professor Des Forges, is that throughout the entire period from the 8th of February 1993 right through to the 15th of July 1994, it was not unreasonable even if the context of the Arusha Accords and the attempt to reach peace in the country -- it's not unreasonable for anybody to consider the RPF as an enemy. 
A.	There had been a peace agreement signed by the Rwandan government accepting the RPF as a partner in future political arrangements.  The RPF was no longer considered a hostile party.  Persons were free to announce their affiliation to the RPF, to make clear that they were supporters of the RPF.  There was a UN peacekeeping force in the country, which would never have been the case had the security council regarded this as anything other than a conflict resolved.  So that from the point of view of an extremely large number of people, including the diplomats, the war was over.  

Now, I'm quite prepared to concede that this was -- this proved to be an inadequate and inaccurate assessment of the situation, because there were parties on both sides who were dissatisfied and who continued to prepare for and anticipate further conflict, but there we get into a question of definitions.  
(Pages 52 to 59 by Jean Baigent)












	1545H
THE WITNESS: (continuing) 
If we have a peace signed and agreed to, and a peacekeeping force, is the fact that parties on both sides continue clandestine preparations for a conflict sufficient to make this a state of war?  Now, I'm not a lawyer, but I would say in a common sense definition, we are not confronted with a state of war.  That means that then from August 4, 1993 through April 7, 1994, at which point the RPF came out of their quarters and began shooting, the situation is legally, I believe, as well as by common sense definition, not a situation of war.  And in that circumstance, the RPF is not legitimately to be considered an enemy.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	These are the Arusha Peace Accords.  They are not the Arusha coalition agreements; they the Arusha Peace Accords.  They are negotiations for peace, peace treaties.  There is an assumption that there is a state of conflict that needs to be resolved.  
A.	And the fact that the peace accord has been signed does not end the state of war?  I'm sorry, I don't follow that.  I thought the peace accords meant an end to war. 
Q.	Well -- 
A.	When does the war end if not at the signing of the accords?  
Q.	I grant you -- I grant you that.  When we have an attack on the 8th of February 1993, we were in a state of conflict.  We continue to be in a state of conflict until the Arusha Accords is signed and then that conflict re-ignites after the downing of the plane.  You would accept that? 
A.	There was ceasefire in March so that an active combat situation was not prevalent throughout the country, although the final accord was signed in August.  I think it was, by any ordinary and even legal definition, a state of peace after the 3rd of August.  
Q.	Well, putting -- putting legal and academic definitions of war aside, it was not unreasonable, at least -- at least prior to the signing of the Arusha Accords and after the downing of the plane, at least at those times, it was certainly not unreasonable to describe the RPF as the enemy, is that right?  I mean, I'm not sure where we would have difficulty with that.  
A.	I have no difficulty with describing the RPF as the -- one of the belligerent or hostile parties.  And in normal parlance, one hostile party describes the other as the enemy in a time of war.  My difficulty comes with that characterization, which is broadened from the military-political movement of combatants to be applied to non-combatants, to ordinary civilians on the basis of their ethnicity. 
Q.	Well, there we are in absolute agreement.  There is no -- there was no -- I'm not taking the position otherwise.  What happened in Rwanda was atrocious.  It was a genocide.  It was horrible.  I do not take that as any other position. 

But -- coming back to your Hutu-Power ideology, this is where we come.  There may have been people in Rwanda who saw the RPF as the enemy.  That is one category of person.  Next category of person would be those who saw the RPF as an enemy and, perhaps, felt a degree of Hutu solidarity as a result of that.  Then we would have a third category who would be those who would see the RPF as an enemy, have that Hutu solidarity, and be racists or ethnists towards Tutsi.  And then we would have a fourth category of person who would have all of the above, and in addition, a desire to kill the Tutsis.  Would you accept that? 
A.	I can easily accept that participants, political actors and ordinary people in Rwanda during this period, experienced a variety of sentiments concerning the RPF and concerning Tutsi in general, that there was a conscious effort to lead them to make an identification between the RPF and Tutsi in general, and that some people who at one point might feel ready to kill Tutsi might not feel that at another point.  And that some people could change their attitudes from one point to another.  This is what I mean when I talk about the complexity of the situation. 
Q.	Yes? 
A.	I think in circumstances people have to decide everyday when they got up just how far they were going to go in terms of would they agree to kill a young Tutsi male and not kill a Tutsi baby, or would they agree to kill both?  It was a situation of enormous pressure and enormous complexity, and I would not want to -- to simplify it. 
Q.	Yes, quite right, too.  And those complexities are likely to have been reflected in the minds of those at Kabusunzu, even those who could be placed somehow or rather under the umbrella of Hutu-Power? 
A.	Possibly.  I doubt that Kabusunzu involved extensive debates on the final points that we have been discussing here.  I suspect Kabusunzu was a situation where people were making political choices in terms of their personal interest, more than in terms of any large scale interpretations of the universe.  But certainly, it is not inconceivable that a variety of points of view were represented among the people present at Kabusunzu on the issue of the war, on the issue of Arusha, or the RPF or the Tutsi in general. 
Q.	Yes, indeed, and non-discussion of Hutu-Power.  I'm in absolute agreement with you.  It is right that Anastase Gasana made use of the word "power" when he came back from a trip from Uganda?  Isn't that something that Mr. Twagiramungu has expressed as an opinion?  
A.	I'm not familiar with that.  It would be interesting if that were the case.  Do you have the reference?  
Q.	Did -- in your opinion, in your expert opinion, did President Habyarimana share the Hutu-Power ideology as you define it? 
A.	Habyarimana was obviously in a very difficult position, subject to many conflicting pressures.  I think his primary interest was to maintain his own power; his secondary interest was perhaps to do the best he could for his country; and I expect that fundamentally he was in agreement with Hutu-Power.  But I think he also saw it as potentially something of a threat in the sense that Karamira and others could turn it against him.  I think he -- he was not completely comfortable with this idea because he had made a sufficient number of compromises himself.  He was known to be the person responsible for the death of Kayibanda; he was very concerned that an eventual judicial prosecution could be carried out against him because of the killing of Kayibanda and some of his political associates.  So I think to the extent that Hutu-Power comes out of that Parmehutu background, and to the extent that it's enunciated by Karamira, that he could very well have seen that as a resource for himself, but also as a potential danger for himself.  And that he could well have been afraid that he could then out-Hutued, if you will excuse the expression, by Karamira, or Murego, or even Nsengiyeremye. 
Q.	Yes.  But, you see, it's interesting, isn't it, that President Habyarimana chose to support Agathe and Twagiramungu? 
A.	Sure, split the opposition.  He was absolutely ruthless, yeah.  Of course, this was a way to weaken them.  
Q.	So, this -- this --
A.	I think I mentioned earlier, didn't I?  That his stance was to attempt destroy the MDR in particular because it was his chief threat. 
Q.	And it would be -- also be correct to say that those who were opposed to Twagiramungu were in open confrontation with President Habyarimana on that very issue? 
A.	Right.  They accused him basically of betraying Hutu solidarity by attacking them in effect and weakening them in such a way that it would make it easier for the enemy to find a bridge.  I think that's -- that's one of the challenges of the speech for Habyarimana and for the MRND; in other words, that his constituency could be pulled out from under him by someone who made a better case for the Hutu than he did. 
Q.	So, if the -- if it was the intention of Karamira when he used the slogan to unite the MDR and the MRND, it wasn't very successful, was it? 
A.	When, that day, or what kind of time perspective are you looking at?  
Q.	Well, the speech post-dates the division in the MRND party.  The -- when Karamira made the speech on 23rd of October 1993, if it was his intention -- I don't accept that it was anything more than a slogan, but if it was -- if it was his intention to create a specific ideology, which would actually lead to cooperation between the MDR and the M -- MRND, it wasn't very successful because the alliance was between Agathe and Twagiramungu and Habyarimana.  It was not between Dismas and Murego and Habyarimana? 
A.	Short term, yes, but look at the long term.  After April 6th or even slightly before April 6th, it had become a very different phenomenon than what it was in November and December of -- and it was, in part, because of the success of the Hutu-Power movement that Habyarimana was essentially obliged to attempt to take it under control and to assume its leadership because it represented a real political risk to him.  So that he was very much threatened in the early months of '94 by the possibility that he would be, as I say, out-Hutued by the Hutu-Power movement.  He had to jump on the bandwagon or risk losing out altogether. 
Q.	Coming back in time for a moment.  Following the court proceedings with Twagiramungu, there were efforts to reconcile the MDR party.  Would you accept that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And it was quite a long process in the sense that initially it had a rocky ride.  Was there not an attempt in December of 1993, with the mediation of the Bishops, to reconcile the party? 
A.	As I recall, there was an attempt by the -- by a church -- a clergy committee -- a committee of clergymen, to mediate between Twagiramungu and Nsengiyeremye.  But the question here is what exactly did Nsengiyeremye -- that is the person we've been referring to as Dismas -- what did he represent in terms of his own political loyalties?  And that is not immediately clear to me.  Was there reconciliation -- a reconciliation that necessarily brought in its trail a reconciliation with Murego and Karamira?  That is not clear to me at all. 
Q.	Yes, I would suggest that there were three groups, not just two, within the MDR:  those who supported Twagiramungu, those who supported Dismas, and those who were very cynical about the RPF, and those who did not necessarily fall in the camp of Dismas.  
A.	Yeah.  Nor did it necessarily fall in any of the three camps.  I think that there was a level of distrust and cynicism on the part of many, but there were some who chose to make that their political flag and others who chose to follow another political flag. 
Q.	Can you turn to tab 11 in the Defence bundle.  This is a document which, again, comes from the Prosecution archive, and it's dated the 24th of December 1993.  Are you able to -- have you seen the document before, or are you able to recognise anything about it? 
A.	I've seen it before but I don't know who's the author. 
Q.	Would the stamp help you at all?  I think that's Flemish, if I'm not mistaken on the stamp.  
A.	Then it was probably Marc Nice in that case who was the Belgian intelligence officer attached to the Belgian troops rather than to the UN as such, but kind of -- his services were lent to the UN. 
Q.	Do you know -- do you know what the title means:  "Briefing de SGR au COPS sur Rwanda"?  Did -- did -- are you able to explain the title at all?  I'm not testing you; I don't know.  
A.	I think it means a briefing of the service of the information group.  It's probably service de group de reinseignments to the commander of operations -- COPS, is the commander of operations -- on in Rwanda. 
Q.	Yes.  And this is a -- is this a UN or a Belgian pseudonym? 
A.	I think it's probably Belgian rather than UN because I think this was one of those documents handed up the Belgian chain of command to the operational centre in Belgium, rather than something that was directed at the UN. 
Q.	So they are describing the politique interieur Rwandaise, and they say -- or the author says "Internal Rwandan politics:  At the MDR, after mediation with the church contact committee, the two conflicting leaders, Mr. Twagiramungu, appointed to be future prime minister of the enlarged transitional government, initials GTBE, and Mr. Nsengiyeremye, former prime minister, accepted to be reconciled.  They reasserted their attachment to the MDR as renewed, and disapproved the terms MDR Parmehutu and MDR-Power".
So this document would at least confirm, would it not, that there was, in December of 1993, at least a significant attempt to reconcile difference with some degree of cooperation on both sides? 
A.	Between Nsengiyeremye and Twagiramungu, but that doesn't tell us an awful lot because Nsengiyeremye, as you have seen, has not been the person clearly identified with Hutu-Power.  If it were an agreement between Karamira or Murego and Twagiramungu, it would have been considerably greater significance.  Because, as you say, Nsengiyeremye was hanging there as a third force that was unattached or perhaps successively attached to different points of view. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Nsengiyeremye was the first vice-president of MDR? 
A.	Right, but that doesn't tell us very much.  Twagiramungu was the president.  I mean, you know -- 
Q.	Yes, but it would -- he would explain his -- his mention there, wouldn't it?  
A.	Yes, but he hasn't really been -- he hasn't really been a player on the scene up until this time, so it's not clear what he represents, in fact.  
Q.	But that's interesting.  I mean, you don't categorise Dismas as Hutu-Power; is that right? 
A.	I don't know how to characterise Dismas, because, as I say, his loyalties appear unclear at this point. 
Q.	So anybody who associates himself with Dismas, his loyalties also would appear unclear?  
A.	Well, not necessarily.  I wouldn't attach this to everyone.  I would say that I personally, I'm unclear what position Nsengiyeremye represented at this point. 
Q.	But the fact that somebody supports Dismas politically would say nothing about the issue of Hutu-Power, would it? 
A.	Well, it might or it might not.  I'm simply saying I don't know what he stood for, and he was apparently -- what we say, playing a sufficiently ambiguous role, but it's hard to know how to characterise him.  Whether someone attached to him would be similarly ambiguous in his position, I don't know.  It would depend on who the person is. 
Q.	Can we turn now to tab 12?  This is a -- a document which, again, comes from the Prosecution archive.  In the Prosecution archive itself, or at least it's a tool that we've been usefully provided with by the Prosecution.  It's given a date which is the 20th of January 1995.  The document itself does not appear to bear a date.  I don't know if you can help at all with this document? 
A.	I'm sorry, what date did you say was given to it?  
Q.	The date that's given to it in the Prosecution archive is the 20th of January 1995, but it's not actually marked on the document.  So we don't know if that's an error or if it's an accurate description of the document.  Are you able to help us with this document? 
A.	No, I find it a very strange document as a matter of fact.  First of all, many Rwandan names are admittedly complicated, but Gasana is not one of them.  And yet on page 2, I see Mr. Gasana's name misspelt. 
Q.	Yes, but --
A.	Which is an odd error to make for anyone who has any basic knowledge of the -- 
Q.	Well, I agree but that might be a typographical error, might it not? 
A.	No, I don't think so, because, you see, it's been written -- it's been read over by somebody who's made handwritten annotations on it.  And had it been -- had it been I, my pen would immediately have struck out those additional letters.  So I would say -- and there is also, in the paragraph -- two paragraphs above Gasana's name, the information that Uwilingiyimana and her husband were beaten to death on the street in front of the UNDP building, which is not so.  So I don't know who's written this or with what fund of knowledge they have -- upon what fund of knowledge they have been able to draw. 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	The very title is very strange, "Pre-crash coalition government members".  What does that mean?  
Q.	Yes --
A.	Pre-crash --
Q.	It also -- it also appears to have the reference to secret somewhere, on the last page? 
A.	Oh, yes, the last page, right. 
Q.	So I don't know what that -- what light that sheds on it, but anyway, it's a document which was found in the Prosecution archive, and on the penultimate -- last page -- not the last page, the one before that, it states at the top there:  "There were three parties which suffered splits and had difficulty resolving their lists.  The MDR and the other -- name not recalled -- eventually resolved the problems, but the 
	Liberal Party did not".  I mean, I take -- I take the point that we have some doubts about the document at the moment, but do you agree with the statement which is made there? 
A.	I would find it hard to give a great deal of credibility to this, given the numerous other errors that I see in this document. 
Q.	What about the statement which is made, the fact assertion? 
A.	Well, it is true that there was finally a list created which apparently -- which put forward persons to be named by these parties to ministerial positions and to the seats in the assembly.  But whether that resolved the difficulty is not really apparent by that.  I mean, the difficulties continued and the agreements to go forward, I think, were essentially short-term compromises as a result of various kinds of pressures on the parties rather than an indication that they have actually resolved their differences.

1600H
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Can we go to tab 13?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Before we go on, I know I'll have an opportunity for redirect, but the witness was directed to a fragment of a sentence, and I would appreciate it if we start with the very beginning of that sentence.  It begins at the bottom of the preceding page.  And maybe if we read the entire sentence, the paragraph, we'll have -- the meaning will be a bit clearer.
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, as I say, Mr. Webster, we have some doubts about the document, so I just wanted the witness's reaction to the factual assertion.
MR. WEBSTER:
But you can't appreciate the factual assertion by reading a fragment of the sentence.  The sentence started on the preceding page.  All I'm suggesting is that the witness have an opportunity to read the entire sentence instead of a fragment of it.  Her answer may not change.  I have no way of knowing, but at least we will be complete.
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm not trying to be unfair to the witness.  She has the document in front of her.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Does that change anything?  
A.	No, it puts it in context because what it's referring to obviously is the division of the seats in the new institution, but I wouldn't say it reflects any greater knowledge on the part of the author of the document than is otherwise revealed. 
Q.	I'm conscious of the time.  Can I just go to tab 13 quickly?  This is a document which is perhaps easier to recognise.  Could you describe that document? 
A.	This is a memo from the secretary-general special representative Booh-Booh in Kigali to Annan and holding to the authorities at the UN headquarters in New York on the 19th of March, reporting on the efforts to install the transitional institution. 
Q.	Dated 19th March 1994.  Paragraph 2 reads, "As reflected in the minutes of the attached statement he also came to the conclusion, following his consultations in Rwanda, that the stumbling block into putting into place" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, sorry, sorry.
MR. O'SHEA:
Am I going too fast?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Just a bit slower, please.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	"As reflected in the minister's attached statement he also came to the conclusion, following his consultations in Rwanda, that the stumbling blocks putting into place the transitional institutions evolves around the internal difficulties within the Parti libéral, PL."  Is that not an indication that the differences within the MDR had been resolved by that time? 
A.	As I say, it's an indication that they had reached a compromise to go forward.  It's not an indication that the fundamental differences were resolved. 
Q.	Yes, that there was a compromise.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, I don't know whether Your Honours want to appreciate the situation now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is an appropriate time for the rest.  It's now five past four.  What's the position?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, the position is, Your Honours, that I'm far from finishing.  I'm aware of my tentative undertaking, which I've failed in fulfilling, I'm afraid.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I did give you the decision that we don't have capital punishment.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, thank you, I heave a big sigh of relief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Dr. Des Forges, the Tribunal is committed to terminate these proceedings at this time, today.  We are going to have to resume, and we have fixed the date of Monday the 22nd of August for the resumption of the hearing of this trial.  It had been our intention or our expectation that proceedings would have reached the stage where it would have permitted the completion of the Prosecution case in a bit less than two working weeks.  So we are hoping to have completed the Prosecution case by the end of the first week in September.  Now, of course, when those calculations were made we would have thought your testimony would have been completed, so there is going to have to be some re-evaluation, but are you available to give testimony during that period?
THE WITNESS:
I would be available, Your Honour, after -- I would have to check my calendar, but I have a number of commitments already scheduled in August.  I was planning to return to the region sometime after the 10th of September, I believe.  I can say the 10th or 11th of September I was planning to be back here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If we were able to schedule and arrange for telephonic or video-conference during an earlier period, would you be at a location that would -- would you be willing to do it that way, and would you be at a location that you would have access to those facilities?

THE WITNESS:  
My own personal experience with teleconferencing has been very negative.  I have to say I have spent many hours sitting waiting for connections to be made that were never made or made so poorly that the end result was not satisfactory.  If the Court believes that this is necessary, I am willing to give it a try again.  But as I say, my experience has not been positive in this regard.  I am not distanced, ordinarily, from New York or from Washington, so that it would be technically possible for me to go to such a site, but I am not absolutely sure of the -- of my availability in the last weeks of August.  I would have to look at my calendar.  As I say, I've made a number of commitments that would be difficult to change.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Is that everything?  

I was supposed to -- I think I have given some indication before, but today I am formally to state that we will be resuming the Rwamakuba hearing on the Monday, the 22nd of August.  

Now, I don't know, in terms of scheduling, we are now left with six Prosecution witnesses, which is just a bit behind the schedule that we had anticipated.  But I think it sounds desirable to move to complete the Rwamakuba Prosecution case, even if it means encroaching briefly on the case that we have scheduled to start on the 5th of September.
MR. WEBSTER:
That is mostly the way to proceed, Your Honour.  In fact, my concern was that there would be some overlap, so that things will be scheduled so tightly together that it would present us with difficulties for my team.  So, if we were to come up with a schedule that would allow all of the Prosecution witnesses in the Rwamakuba case to complete their testimony at least a week or so in advance of starting anything in Karemera, that seems to me the most practical arrangement for us.  

I tend to agree with Dr. Des Forges that her testimony would go much more smoothly in a live session.  As she's going to be here in early September, we should be able to find a way to take the rest of her testimony as the last witness, the last Prosecution witness in the Rwamakuba trial, and schedule things so that, perhaps -- the date that comes to mind, just of the top of my head, is the 29th of August.  If she could make arrangements to be in the region -- I realise that she will have to check her schedule -- but if she came a week or so before she had a commitment in the region, then perhaps we could take her testimony at that time and complete the case or close the case when her examination is complete.  But these are the types of things that are better resolved in a private conversation that I can have with the witness and then communicate the results of that to the Court, to the parties.  

The one thing that I would indicate -- and I think I should indicate in open Court for the benefit of the Defence, and since we are talking about the Karemera case -- is that we have an expert report that is due to be filed in the Karemera case on the 15th of August.  And I do recall the Court's instruction, which were prompted by the Defence, that I have no contact with the witness prior to the completion of the testimony.  So that presents a logistical challenge.  I don't see any problem, and I don't think there should be a problem with me continuing to work with Dr. Des Forges, given the length of her experience and her contact with this Tribunal.  I see no reason why it should compromise her testimony before this Tribunal, before this Trial Chamber, but if the Court is considering the ramifications on its other scheduling, it must also bear in mind that there will be no expert report on the 15th of August filed in the Karemera case if I cannot work with Dr. Des Forges between now and then.  But that's the most reasonable proposal that I can make off the top of my head at this time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper, do you have anything to contribute?
MR. HOOPER:
Not particularly.  We're not, I think, particularly happy with the suggestion that was just made that there should be active discussions at this stage.  I think that it's in the interest of the accused there shouldn't be, but how we get about the problem of that creates in respect to another expert report, I'm not sure what we can do to get about that problem.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are two issues.  There's the issue of schedule in Rwamakuba, that comes first.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we are totally in the Court's hands about that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Dr. Des Forges, the Prosecutor's suggestion of scheduling you for during the week of the 29th of August, is that -- would that be a date you would be able to make?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I'm embarrassed to say that I can't give you a complete answer now.  I have no secretary, and I make my own commitments, but I make them and I write them down, and I retain that I have something to do at the end of August, but I can't tell you on which days or how long it would be.  So, I really would have to get to my computer calendar and take a look and see what exactly is involved here.  There are some commitments which I can reschedule, and I am certainly willing, understanding the pressures on the Chamber, to do that to the extent I can.  There are other commitments that are difficult to change, and I really have to look at the calendar to see what I'm dealing with.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Webster has raised a complication, because he's under order from the Court, in another case, about which I have some knowledge, to file your expert report on the 15th of August.  And we are interested in the maintenance of the tight standards that have been established here.  I don't know if it would be appropriate to make an order clearing the rule, our communication during your testimony, but let's act on the assumption I don't make such an order.  The earlier you give your testimony in this matter, the less impact any variation of the kind of standards it will be.  We would like to have -- I can see problems mounting at the moment, which we have to manage as best we can.  But the fact remains that the earlier your testimony is completed, the more manageable the problem will be, so we have an additional interest in trying to schedule you as early as possible.
THE WITNESS:
I understand that, Your Honour.  I do not know, in fact, what the Prosecutor's plans are for the Karemera case, but, if I understand, my report needs to be filed 60 days ahead.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not 60 days.  We have fixed a date.  We have fixed a date, which is the 15th of August.  So that's the date by which he's currently obliged to file it.
THE WITNESS:
But as I understand it, dates are set in consideration of the anticipated schedule of appearance of the witness.  Is that not a correct understanding?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not always.  The Court has the power to abridge or extend time.
MR. WITNESS:
I see.  Because my reasoning was that, if I were not going to be called within 60 days, then it would not be a difficult undertaking to be flexible about that date.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We -- well, I must say, it is obvious that you will not be called within the 60 days of the 15th of August because we already have -- the Prosecutor has already filed his list of witnesses for the first trial session, and you are not included in that.  But there were other considerations with regard to the filing of the report, because the rule really is it should be filed as soon as possible, but at least 60 days prior.  So we are taking that into account in fixing the date for the filing.
THE WITNESS:
I see that.  But if the considerations in this case make it impossible, since the 60 days -- the 60-day limit can in any way be observed, it would be perhaps possible to file that report a week or so subsequent to my finishing in this case, which would give us the opportunity to complete the consultations necessary for that report.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that is a possibility I was referring to, by saying that the complications can be reduced if you give your testimony early.  So that would be it.
THE WITNESS:
I see that and I am, as I said, quite prepared to do my best to accommodate the schedule of the Court, but I do have other professional obligations.  And I am, I must say, far behind in my work having to do with Burundi and Congo, not to mention Rwanda, and although Human Rights Watch is prepared to accept the importance of this work and to give me leave to come here to do this, I have obligations to my employer and to my colleagues, which I cannot ignore either.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.  

Mr. O'Shea.
MR. O'SHEA:  
Your Honour, I may be able to assist, I don't know, I may be jumping into waters I'm not familiar with.  There may be a special order in the Karemera case, but I think the rule now is 21 days, or is that wrong?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have given an order which attached to a particular date, and we have prepared a standard for a number of activities.  So the order, if it -- but there's a binding order at the moment, which may have to be amended, but we haven't reached the Karemera case yet.

Dr. Des Forges, in order to facilitate as early a solution to this as possible, we would ask our trial coordinator, who is sitting in court and who is, I think, identifiable, to exchange contact information with you.  I appreciate that we can't force you to give a date without referring to your information.  So what you do now, as soon as court is adjourned, is to establish a method of communication, because it is important that we make a decision as soon as possible.  So, when court is -- when we adjourn, you will establish a line of communication and resolve the problem in that manner.  It is more desirable that that is done exactly than that you negotiate with the Prosecutor.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, would the Prosecutor also provide a communication method -- you see, I'm actually speaking -- I'm very embarrassed for us because I'm aware the Court is on reserve, but I think it is necessary to make decisions in this matter and join the process.
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand.  I'm sorry, I didn't hear.  My channel is not working good.  Would you mind repeating what you were saying, please?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I was asking for communication information so that we may be able to address this matter during the recess.  I think it would not be proper to resume in August to make these decisions, so we'd like to do them as soon as possible.  If you are leaving the Tribunal if you could just leave contact information for the Trial Court.
MR. WEBSTER:
That's not a problem at all, Your Honour.  Any time I leave Arusha, in fact, I send an e-mail to the Trial Chamber coordinator with the e-mail address and sometimes a phone number so she can contact me.  In fact, I think she has the information already.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, that is also true for the Defence.  We would need you to leave your contact information with the trial coordinator, and it is important to resolve this as soon as possible.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, sir.  Before we go off the record, I don't know whether this Court is going to adjourn the session now.  There is something I would like to mention.  We've discussed a number of exhibits -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
...previous discussion.  I was already asked by my colleagues that we were, in fact, discussing the issue of audio conference, and Dr. Des Forges was reticent about a video conference or audio conference.  Does she have an aversion to either or both?  We've already seen her.  I'm not quite certain if her testimony will be aided by her presence in our Chamber, and it may be a way of getting her testimony on record as soon as possible.  So, my colleagues would like to find out what is the attitude of the parties and Dr. Des Forges to some arrangements for using technology to facilitate the rest of her testimony.  Do you have a position?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd prefer for the Defence to express themselves, then Dr. Des Forges, then I would confer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You would like the last word?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
We have no objection to that, subject to if it's an audio conference, Professor Des Forges not be sitting in her library.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Even an audio conference for giving testimony is controlled by rules, of course.
MR. HOOPER:
Of course, we have no objection to that course.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Dr. Des Forges, we didn't quite understand exactly what your reservations were.  I don't know if you would mind explaining them to us.
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, my colleagues and I work in many different locations, and it is our frequent habit to hold meetings by either teleconference or audio conference.  In my experience it is always unsatisfactory.  I feel that it is difficult for people to be as fully understood and to understand others as fully through the use of technology.  I regard it as a very poor alternative to face-to-face contact.  I have been involved in many situations where I feel I have not been able to communicate effectively or I have not been able to understand effectively, due to the technological nature of the communication.  But I, of course, will accept the Court's dictate on this issue, and if it is necessary I will do my best to communicate in that way.  But I do say that I personally find it difficult and constantly chide my colleagues for having to resort to this form of communication.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't prefer that form of communication.  What we are interested in is time.  So our interest is really having your testimony given as early as possible, and we thought that might facilitate that.  That is our objective, the timeliness of your testimony.
(Pages 66 to 73 by R. Lear)
















1630H 
THE WITNESS:
I understand that, but if we are looking at setting aside a day or two days to complete the cross-examination and re-direct, it is still time that needs to be taken out of my schedule, whether it is here or there, so there is that consideration.  And I have sat in many a meeting waiting for the television communication to be established and had four or five hours where nothing happens because some connection cannot be made.  And it is simply that kind of waste of time that I find extremely galling.  You schedule something and then a connection, for some reason, cannot go through.  And then people have to be moved to another location or whatever.  And that for me is a waste of time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It puts me in an awkward position.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you don't have to make a comment if you don't have one. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Since we do have a pending application in another case on this very same issue, so it is hard to take inconsistent positions, but inconsistency is not something that bothers me all of the time.  I think one --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you don't have to be on the spot.  Let me make a suggestion, what we think.  We now -- we now know that neither you nor Mr. Hooper have a theoretical aversion to the use of technology.  We have heard what the witness has said, and we take her position into account as well.  Now, the point is that I think that what we need to do now is to find out from her when she is available.  If she can come back to Arusha during the two-week period between the 22nd of August and the 5th of September, then there is no problem. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry, I lost that phone some time ago. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, so I think the first thing is to find out her availability, because if when she checks the calendar, she can give testimony during that two-week period, then we have no problem. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That sounds like a reasonable solution, and if her testimony can begin on the 29th I think that is the optimum solution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
So, we will continue to -- we will allow Dr. Des Forges at the time that she needs to consult her calendar, and then I and Dr. Des Forges can independently be in touch with the Trial Chamber coordinator and resolve it that way. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Beg your pardon?  Are you asking for judicial approval to communicate with Dr. Des Forges while she is still a witness?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you asking for judicial approval to communicate with Dr. Des Forges?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, I said Dr. Des Forges and I independently -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Independently --
MR. WEBSTER:
-- be in contact with the Trial Chamber coordinator and we will resolve it that way. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that is a preferable solution.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay, that is fine.
MR. PRESIDENT:
     Thank you very much, so we will operate on that basis.  Now, you had a point that you wished to raise?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, and I am not trying to extend the day, because I don't want to do this now, but I want us to recollect collectively what we are going to put -- what we are going to mark in evidence because if we wait for a month and come back to this issue --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are quite right.
MR. WEBSTER:
-- there may be disagreement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are quite right.  Have you got your -- you are ready with your exhibit list?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't have anything written down. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, are you ready with your exhibit list?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
I think the only thing that is outstanding, Your Honour, is with regard to Dr. Des Forges's testimony. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
My concern is to not to do it now because it will take at least 30 to 40 minutes to go through all of the exhibits and number them.  But I would like to put on the record specifically what our recollections are so that we can come back to this information in one place at a later time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I suggest is -- well, we have the record, so we know what documents have been addressed.  It is on the -- we have a verbatim transcript of what has transpired.  What will be helpful to us from an organisational point of view is if you could just send a communication to our trial coordinator, where both parties would identify the documents for the trial coordinator.  And we will forward that to the registrar so we have a record -- a concurrent record which will facilitate what happens when we resume.  That will assist us to organise information.  But it already exists on the transcript.

Well, before I adjourn, I have to say with a degree of apology, I have to thank the court staff members for the high quality of their service during this trial session.  Of course, my thank you has to make special reference to yesterday afternoon and today.  I must say that I would not have asked you to give the extra time if I had not felt that we would have completed Dr. Des Forges's testimony.  If I had realised that this was going to be the position, I would have not tried to use the extra time to achieve this result.  

But at the same time we have to face the reality of the situation; this is what has transpired, and your additional service is particularly appreciated.  And I say thank you and sorry in the same breath.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
I think I am the one who should apologise, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we take the adjournment now, the Court goes on recess -- well, our Trial Chamber goes on recess and we resume on the 22nd of August.  The registrar has asked me to note that they will announce the venue, which trial chamber -- which trial courtroom we will be using in due course.  But the date for resumption is the 22nd of August.  And the registrar will announce the courtroom that we will be using.  

I now adjourn our court session 
(Court adjourned at 1640H)
