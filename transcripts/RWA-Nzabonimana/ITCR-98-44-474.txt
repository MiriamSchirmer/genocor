P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.

The proceedings are resumed.

Could we have the appearances of the parties for the record please, starting with the Prosecution?  
MR. MAWERE:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution is represented by Mr. Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; Memory Maposa, appeals counsel; Diana Karanja, associated legal officer; Ephrem Mutashya, language assistant; two interns, Igor Barilik and Jamet Marion; and myself, 
	Simba Mawere,	assistant trial attorney.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Defence?
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  On the Defence side the members of the intern battalion that are present are Erick Sullivan, Charles Brozille, Anga Kortonaar, Élise Le Gall.  There's also Justin Habineza, investigator; Nathalie Leblanc, legal officer; and myself, 
	Philippe Larochelle. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We hope your battalion is not armed with weapons of mass destruction.

Good morning, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we'd like to remind you about the solemn declaration you made at the beginning of your testimony.  You will continue with your testimony today bearing that declaration in mind as well as all the other instructions or directives that were given to you at the beginning of your testimony.  

Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President.  I can reassure you that the weapons used by the battalion are very accurate and very precise and will cause casualties only where they're meant to be caused. 
WITNESS T25,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Let me remind you to have a three-second pause after you've turned on your microphone in order to enable the stenographers and interpreters and Mr. Nzabonimana to quite understand what you're saying.

So with that notice to you, we can continue with your examination-in-chief.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, before you begin, we're in open session.  We should like to know whether we should warn the witness or not.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The witness should be warned.  I think I can go for a while in open session if the witness is warned not to identify his place of residence and his name.  And I will -- what I will do is I will reserve the portion which should be in closed session for the end of the examination-in-chief, so that we can proceed like that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Witness, we are in open session so do not disclose any information that may identify you.  Don't name people or places that may be connected to your identity.  Is that understood, Witness?  

If you have any difficulty in answering a question and your fear is that you may be identified, please let the Chamber know.  Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I've understood you, Madam President.
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, when we broke off yesterday in the evening, we were talking about the Gasenyi trading centre.  I would like you to inform the Chamber whether close by the Gasenyi trading centre there existed a football pitch. 
A.	Yes, there does exist a football pitch in that area. 
Q.	I would like you also to tell us whether close by the Gasenyi centre there is an area where cattle can be grazed. 
MR. MAWERE:
Madam President, Your Honours, we'd like to raise an objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the witness is present in court, Learned Counsel. 
MR. MAWERE:
I think the witness can just remove his earphones. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you remove your earphones.  We have a matter to discuss with learned counsel.  Usually we require you to be absent, but in this case removal of your earphones will suffice. 
MR. MAWERE:
Madam President, Your Honours, it appears learned counsel has forgotten that he's leading evidence in-chief and should desist from questions that are leading, questions which have suggestive answers.  The very first question was also suggestive, but we thought perhaps counsel would desist, and we've noticed that even the second one is also leading.  And we'd like that he be advised to put inquisitive questions to the witness and let the answers come from the witness.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  Indeed, that is the case, so if you could rephrase your questions and avoid leading the witness, Learned Counsel.  Put open-ended questions and -- but precise ones as well, so that we can get the answer of the witness.

You may proceed, Counsel. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, can you please tell the Chamber what one could find close by the football pitch in Gasenyi?
A.	When one is at that football pitch one can see the marketplace of the Gasenyi centre as well as the buildings that are located at that centre. 
Q.	Is there a river close by that football pitch? 
MR. MAWERE:
Madam President, Your Honours, this is exactly what we have just been talking about.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I'm sorry.  The witness has established that he knows Gasenyi centre -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, Learned Counsel.  

Learned Counsel, just a moment.  

Witness, can you remove your microphone -- your earphones, please. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Madam President, I think we're just losing time here.  I can certainly ask him if there were restaurants, a cinema, what kind of buildings were there.  I think -- I don't agree with the Prosecutor's position that this is leading.  Once the witness has established that he knows Gasenyi centre and that he's been there, then it is -- the basis has been established and it is thereafter perfectly proper to ask him what was the geographical features and the buildings that formed Gasenyi.  I don't agree with the 
	Prosecutor's position that I'm leading the witness at this stage.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam Witness, Your Honours -- sorry, that was a bad start.  

Madam President, Your Honours, it is quite clear that counsel is avoiding the legal argument and entering into an area which you have asked us to desist from.  There's no need to be emotive about this.  We're only saying that he is leading a witness.  If he does not understand what that means, we can assist him with Rule 90 and other provisions of the jurisprudence of this Court.  

Clearly, if the witness indeed knows Gasenyi market, he should be able to describe it.  We cannot then even ask him whether there are certain geographical features nearby because he ought to know them.  This witness has spent time with the Defence.  He knows why he is here.  And counsel should address the legal issue of leading and not start saying that the witness has said that he knows Gasenyi centre, therefore we can put these things to him.  That is precisely why they should not be put.  

My learned friend is delving into an area where responsible counsel should not delve.  He is not answering the question and we therefore ask the Court to direct him so that he asks appropriate questions in this phase of the trial.  

As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Chamber will deliberate and give a ruling.

This is the ruling and the observations of the Trial Chamber:  The Trial Chamber would like to caution both counsel to not be emotionally charged when they're delivering their submissions to the Court.  There is no need for this.  We need to have civil proceedings and we can deal with legal arguments without being emotionally involved.  

The second issue is that we sustain the objection for the reason that we consider that this is a contentious area.  This is examination-in-chief and the witness should give answers which are not guided by the questions.  The witness could be asked:  What striking geographical features exist in this town, since he says he knows the place.

So, Counsel, rephrase your question taking into account the ruling we have made.

Witness, could you put back on your earphones with the assistance of the registry.  

Counsel, you may continue. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, I now want you to put yourself on the football pitch which is close by the 
	Gasenyi trading centre.  
A.	Yes, I'm with you. 
Q.	And that you describe to us making circle of 360 degrees all that you will see from that position.  
A.	If you were on the football pitch, you would see the football pitch itself and beyond.  You would have the river, and beyond the river you would see the hills in the Rushasi area.  To your left there would be the Gasenyi market and the buildings at the market square.  Behind you there would be 
	banana plantations, which are down below the Kabilizi school.  If you look to your right, you would find a coffee plantation.  That was the case at the time.  And behind you there would be the health centre, Birehe dispensary.  There would also be the road which passes by that football pitch. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, could we have those names, Birehe and others, spelt out please?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I will seek the assistance of the interpreter because I don't think these names are -- okay.  
	Birehe is B-I-R-E-H-E.  Rushashi is R-U-S-H-A-S-H-I.  Kabilizi is K-A-B-I-L-I-Z-E (sic). 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Now, between that football pitch -- I'm sorry.  Between that football pitch and the river, what can you see there? 
A.	Between the football pitch and the river, there is a vast field where people grazed their cattle. 
Q.	If you were to look to your right, what would be the buildings or houses that you would see at the market square?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The interpreter was not correct.  I had said that if you look -- if you look to the marketplace, not to your right.  
THE WITNESS:
You would see the shops.  There are shops to the upper part of the road, which is easily visible.  There is also another building, which is in a location which is somewhat elevated, and there are other buildings, which are in a valley which cannot really be seen that easily but whose roofs can be seen. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you know the owners of the shops that one can see? 
A.	I remember the owners of some of the buildings. 
Q.	Are you able to give us their names? 
A.	Up above the road is the house belonging to Mr. Sengiriye, which is followed by 
	Mr. Fidèle Nzamuye's house.  And there's also Philippe Binyaranga's house, the house belonging to Mr. Kamili.  And those are the buildings or houses that I knew the owners of.

Now, down below the road there's the building belonging to Mr. Cypridio.  And then the hill or elevated area there's the building belonging to Mr. Ndahogoye.  And on the other side there was the house 
of -- Mathias Bernardo's house, as well as a building which belonged to -- or which housed a cooperative.  There was Froduald's house.  

I don't remember the owners of the other houses which were in that location.  
Q.	Could you tell us Mathias' second name? 
A.	Barajiginywa. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Mr. Barajiginywa is number 9 on the spelling list.  As for the others, I will have to spell them out.  Nzamuye, N-Z-A-M-U-Y-E; Binyaranga, B-I-N-Y-A-R-A-N-G-A; Kamili, K-A-M-I-L-I; 
Cypridio, C-Y-P-R-I-D-I-O; Ndahogoye is number 3 on the list; Bernardo, B-E-R-N-A-R-D-O; 
Froduald, F-R-O-D-U-A-L-D. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Yesterday you told us that on the 8th, 9th and 10th of April you did not go to the Gasenyi trading centre.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	On those dates you have just mentioned, I did not go to the trading centre. 
Q.	Your microphone, Witness.

Let me tell you the evidence that has been adduced before this Trial Chamber, and after that I'd like you to give us your remarks.  

It was said before this Trial Chamber that on the 8th of April 1994 you in your capacity as a member of the CDR, just like Callixte Nzabonimana, gendarmes, a crowd of about 100 people, Mr. Ndahogoye attended a meeting at the shop belonging to Mr. Mathias Barajiginywa.  

And during that meeting Mr. Nzabonimana addressed the crowd asking them who the enemy was, and he himself responded that the enemy was the Tutsi.  He subsequently told the crowd that Tutsis had to be killed before their cows were eaten.  It was said that you participated in the distribution of machetes that took place during that event.  And that subsequently the people present went to drink at a place that I cannot identify here, and that amongst the people present there was a certain Habumugisha, a certain Munyabuza (phonetic) and a certain Kambanda.  

I'd like to have your reaction in connection with this allegation.  
A.	That allegation is a lie.  This never happened.  We left the Gasenyi centre on Thursday and on that Thursday the market did not hold, so why did we have to go back there on 
	Friday, Saturday and Sunday?  To do what?  I remained at home on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Who would have seen me in Gasenyi on that day?  I did not go to Gasenyi on those days.  And if that meeting being referred to had taken place, I would have learnt about it from other people.  This is a pure lie because that event never took place. 
Q.	At any time during the genocide did you receive any weapons from Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I had never seen Mr. Nzabonimana.  I had seen him only once at the time when he passed by *********** towards the end of April or early May. 
Q.	We shall come back to that in closed session later.

Now, Witness, following the genocide and the war in Rwanda, did you leave the country? 
A.	I never left the country. 
Q.	Were you imprisoned at any time? 
A.	Yes, I was arrested and detained. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court when you were arrested and detained? 
A.	I was arrested on the *****************************. 
Q.	And on what date were you released? 
A.	I was released on the **********************. 
Q.	So you were in prison for slightly more than ten years.  Were you accused of anything whatsoever? 
A.	I was detained for ten years and then we were taken before members of the population.  On that occasion the judges or the prosecutor's office could not find anyone who would say that I had committed any crime whatsoever against him or her.  It is for this reason that I was released, because no one ever showed up to accuse me. 
Q.	Would anyone have been able or in a position to accuse you of anything whatsoever? 
A.	No one. 
Q.	Did anyone say that you distributed weapons at the place of ********************* in the presence of Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	No one accused me of that, and I have told you that such an event never took place. 
Q.	Did anyone whatsoever accuse you of being a member of the CDR? 
A.	The CDR never existed in our place.  If such a person had made such an attempt to say such a thing, it would have been ridiculous. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Madam President, I am almost through my examination.  I would request that we move in 
	closed session to finish.  I have one or two questions relating to the Gacaca sessions.  Out of caution, I would prefer that certain names that I will mention be -- be referred to in closed session.  And then I have another topic which I want to explore with the witness.  

But I think within 15 minutes I would be done.  But because we will touch on matters that could allow the identification of the witness, I would request that we move into a closed session at this stage. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

We have to request members of the public to leave.  We regret this is necessary to protect the identity of the witness who is a protected witness.

Registry, can we go into a closed session, please. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 9 to 18] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 8 by Melissa Hook)




















MR. MATEMANGA:
We are now in closed session, Madam President -- we are now in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are now in open session.  Do not mention names of people or places who may identify you, as the public is allowed to attend this session.  

Learned Counsel, you may continue.  And please be very careful in the way you phrase your questions.  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	How did you know the person you had seen was Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	It was the first time that I was seeing this person.  I had never seen him before anywhere. 
Q.	Can you please answer my question.
A.	The people who were there said, "That is Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana." 
Q.	You have indicated that on the 9th -- 8th and 9th you never left your home; is that correct? 
A.	I said that on the 8th, the 9th and the 10th I did not go to the trading centre in question. 
Q.	I will read for you.  You said, "I was at home on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  I did not go to Gasenyi."  Correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, which record are you quoting?  For the record we need to know whether you are referring to a statement or his testimony in court.  
MR. MAWERE:
I am referring to his testimony in court.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Today?  
MR. MAWERE:
Today.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you understand the question put to you by counsel?  
THE WITNESS:
Could you please repeat the question, Counsel for the Prosecution?  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	I said in your evidence in chief you said that on Friday, Saturday and Sunday you were at home and you did not go to Gasenyi market; correct? 
A.	Correct.  I did not go to that marketplace. 
Q.	You also did not go to Magarure on Friday, Saturday and Sunday of 8, 9, 10 April 1994; correct? 
A.	I went there in the afternoon.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Of which day, Witness?  Because three days have been put to you, three days and three dates.  So which day are you referring to in your answer?  
THE WITNESS:
Regularly I went to that centre in the afternoons.  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Why then in your evidence in chief did you say you remained at home on 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday? 
A.	It is because your question was dealing with Gasenyi.  I did not go to Gasenyi during that period. 
Q.	Neither did you remain at home during those three days; correct? 
A.	I stayed in the house in the morning.  If you need any further clarifications, please request that we go into closed session and I would give you further clarifications. 
Q.	Does it need us to go into closed session to simply explain why you said you remained at home when in fact you did not remain at home? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, don't argue with the witness.  Put your next question so we can move on.  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	I suggest to you, Witness, you are saying you remained at home on the 8th and 9th of April to simply evade the fact that you were with Callixte Nzabonimana at Gasenyi centre on those days.  Comment? 
A.	It's not as part of avoiding that meeting.  I said that on Friday, Saturday and Sunday I did not go to Gasenyi.  I stayed at home in the mornings. 
Q.	Witness, what was the reason for your arrest in *****************? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are in closed session (sic).  Be careful not to mention names and places which may identify you in your answer.  
MR. MAWERE:
Perhaps we would move into closed, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Members of the public, we regret you have to move out at this stage as we are going to deal with matters that may identify the witness.  We regret this.  

And we go into closed session, Registry.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 21 to 34] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 19 to 20 by Claudette Ask) 





MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you arrange to administer the oath to the witness, please.
(Declaration made by Witness T34 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness T34, good afternoon and welcome.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Kindly switch off your microphone when you're not speaking.  Yes.  Learn to switch it on and off, depending on whether you are speaking or not.  And in what language will you be testifying, Witness?  Yes, switch on your microphone before you begin to speak.  
THE WITNESS:
In Kinyarwanda, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now that you are testifying in Kinyarwanda, you need to observe a small pause.  
Count one, two, three before you speak -- before you answer any question put to you.  This is to enable the Accused to follow your testimony and to enable him to hear you speak Kinyarwanda.  We will now go through the procedures that obtain here.  

Your evidence will be elicited through questions put to you in examination-in-chief, cross-examination, re-examination and the questions by the Judges.  

The examination-in-chief will be led by the Defence team, which is seated on your left side.  When the Defence has finished putting questions to you in examination-in-chief, the Prosecution will in turn ask you questions.  The Prosecution is seated on your right below the translation booth.  

The Judges may ask you questions at any time during the proceedings.  You are required to answer all questions put to you.  And because your answers will be given in Kinyarwanda and will be required to be translated in other languages, we would like to advise you to speak clearly, briefly and directly to answer the question put to you.  

Do not make long narrations, as they make your evidence difficult to understand and difficult to translate and record.  If you have not understood a question put to you by any party or even by the Judges, you may request for that question to be repeated or clarified.  

We require you to be courteous to the parties asking you questions, to the Judges and to all the other staff present in this courtroom.  Likewise, we expect and require all of them to be courteous to you.  
These proceedings are conducted in both open and closed sessions, and it's the Trial Chamber to decide whether you should be giving your testimony in open or closed session.  In an open session like the one we are in at the moment, we will be warning you not to mention names of people or places which may identify you, as the public is allowed to attend open sessions and even acquire records made of such sessions. 

If the evidence you are to give may identify you, we will order a closed session, in which case you will be required to state all the details asked of you, including any information regarding people or places that are close to you.  

We believe that if you follow these simple instructions or directives, your testimony will be smooth and will be concluded quickly and enable you to go back home as soon as possible.  

Could you now let us know whether you have understood the directives given to you.  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood the instructions you have just given me, but I would have preferred to make -- to provide my testimony in a closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that will be done, Witness, where it is necessary.  But where it is not necessary you will give your testimony in open court because that is the procedure here.  

Learned Counsel for the Defence, we would like to hand over the witness to you, and we are in 
open session.  
WITNESS T34,
first having been duly sworn,

 	EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Counsel, to interrupt you, but the registry has just reminded us about an important point we overlooked.  The exhibits, P. 57A and B, should be under seal as they contain the personal particulars of the witness, who is a protected witness.  

Counsel, you may continue.

BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  I have just realised that my microphone was not on earlier.  I'm sorry.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, Counsel, you'll have to repeat your question or whatever you were saying because we didn't get any interpretation of what you said.  The interpreter didn't switch on her microphone in time.  So if you could kindly repeat.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
	I was just telling the witness that he should have a personal identification sheet which he should look at and to be careful because we are still in open session in the event that he is to find any mistake on the sheet.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Do you understand the document, Witness?  Is everything correct on the document?  
MR. MAWERE:
Madam President, Your Honours, it appears the witness does not understand.  I'm saying it appears the witness does not have his set on.  I don't know if I am seeing it properly.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is not properly fixed on his head.  

Registry, could you assist the witness.  

We didn't get the answer of the witness because counsel for the Prosecution intervened.
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Do you agree with the document, or are there any mistakes on it?  
A.	The information is correct.  
Q.	Very well.  If you have a pen, can you sign the document, please.  Could you put a date on it, please. 
(Pages 35 to 37 by Claudette Ask)










1230H 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Yes.  I'm going to ask you, Witness:  What have you written on the document?  Are they dates? 
A.	I was somewhat mistaken.  
Q.	Could you check the document again and sign it.  At any rate, it should have the date or -- of the day in which it was admitted into evidence.  
A.	What date did you say? 
Q.	As far as I know, it's the 1st of June 2010.  
MR. MAWERE:
Could -- could we also be shown the one where he had written on initially, Madam President.  We'd like to look at the two of them.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. MAWERE:
Thank you, Madam President.  We have seen both documents.  We have no objection to their being produced.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Both of them?  
MR. MAWERE:
No, just -- just the correct one. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And perhaps, Counsel, you could ensure that the other one is destroyed, the one which we're not going to use. 
MR. MAWERE:
I'm giving both back.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification sheet of the witness is entered as Defence exhibit number?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
D. 36, Madam President.  That will be the exhibit number.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Exhibit D. 36, under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of this witness who is a protected witness.  
(Exhibit No. D. 36 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours.  The brief questions, which I'll put to the witness, which will be circumscribed in time, space and action and at a specifically located place -- I am obligated to request a closed session for those reasons.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We'll now go into closed session to safeguard the identify of the witness who is protected.  

And we request members of the public to leave at this juncture.  We regret this.  

In the meantime, Registry, could we look at the exhibit, D. 36.
