P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber III is now in session.  Could the registry kindly announce the matter before us today? 
MS. THOMPSON:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge F.R. Array, today is now sitting in open session, Monday, 23rd of February, 2004, for the further initial appearance in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Can we have the appearances of counsel, please, starting with the Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, good afternoon, Your Honour.  Good afternoon to the parties.  Today the Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, along with Holo Makwaia, Dior Fall; a new addition to our team, Gregory Lombardi; and Bill Egbe.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And the Defence, please. 
MS. DIAGNE:
Good afternoon, madam.  Good afternoon, Prosecution.  I am counsel Dior Diagne, lead counsel for Édouard Karemera, assisted by Mr. Jean Paul Temahagali, our legal assistant. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, good afternoon.  Good afternoon to the Prosecution.  I am Frederic Weyl, 
co-counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.  I am Peter Robinson, counsel for Joseph Nzirorera, and today I am also appearing on behalf of David Hooper for André Rwamakuba.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Is that the only brief you are holding? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm afraid so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before we proceed, I would like to render two decisions by the Chambers.  

The Chamber wishes to confirm that after verification of the document, the amended indictment of the 18th February 2004 is in conformity with the modifications ordered by the Chamber in its decision of 13th February 2004. 

The second decision is on the motion by Karemera filed today, asking the Court to reject the indictment filed by the Prosecutor on the 18th of February this year to sanction the Prosecutor for refusal to comply with the Chamber's decision of 13 February this year.  The Chamber has verified that the Prosecutor has removed all allegations of Karemera's physical presence at Bisesero on or about the 13th of May 1994 from paragraph 34.2 and 53.1 of his amended indictment filed on the 18th of February this year.  The Chamber is satisfied that the Prosecutor's modifications of paragraphs 34.2 and 53.1 comply with the Chamber's decision of 13th February this year. 

Considering that the paragraph 53 contains no allegations of Karemera's physical presence at Bisesero on or about 13 May 1994, the Chamber therefore rejects the motion. 

The Chamber will decide on the Defence application for certification to appeal at a later date. 

Before we proceed, I would like to know if the commander of UNDF is here.  Is he present? 
MR. GUINDO:
Yes, Madam President, I am here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you tell us when you served the Accused persons with the amended indictment in French, please, for the record? 
MR. GUINDO:
Thank you, Madam President.  It was on Friday afternoon we handed the indictment to the Accused and the -- except, of course for Rwamakuba, who refused to accept the document.  The others signed the receipt, and the receipt was transmitted to the registry. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
 MR. GUINDO:
(No interpretation)
 MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  Starting with the Counsel for Karemera, we would like to know if you have explained the indictment to your client. 
MS. DIAGNE:
No, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Tell me why.
MS. DIAGNE:
Because, Madam President, as you know, the indictment was served on the 18th of February -- I think it was midnight -- and on the 18th I was on my way to Arusha, and we in fact did not have the material in time to explain it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Previous translation continued)... the weekend to do that.
MS. DIAGNE:
Yes, Madam President, as you know, you've just stated your decision on one of my motions, which I thought was crucial to present to the Trial Chamber before this hearing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for Ngirumpatse. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, what I have to say is what Madam Dior Diagne has said, with the slight difference that the indictment was not formally served on me, and I arrived yesterday evening.  The time I could have this morning at the UNDF with Mr. Ngirumpatse did not materialise.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Previous translation continued)... the whole of the weekend, and your client was served it on Friday.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honour, I did attempt to discuss the indictment with my client.  However, it was his position that until the concerns that were raised in his letter were addressed by the Trial Chamber, he did not wish to discuss the amended indictment with me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Could the registrar now read out the indictment?  Just a minute.  

Prosecutor, you have something to say? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I do, Your Honour.  First of all, there are three or four textual precisions that I'd like to bring to the Court's attention in regard to the amended indictment that was filed on the 18th of February.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  Just a minute.  Could you start again, please?
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd like to clarify one or two items with the Court before we actually begin with the initial appearance.  As the Court and the parties are aware, the indictment -- or the amended indictment was drafted in English.  English was the language that -- it was the English text that was actually signed by the Prosecutor.  The French text is a translation and in any disputes over the translation, the English of course, is the controlling language, but nonetheless, I've noted four items in the French translation that may have to be corrected at a later time, and I prefer to bring it to the Court's attention and to the attention of the parties before the indictment is actually -- a plea is entered for the indictment. 

The first concerns 20.1.  In the original English, there's a reference to the "constitutional court," and in the French translation, it is translated as court supreme, when it would be more accurate to state "cour de cassation".  

Secondly, in paragraph 29, where in English it states "publicising", that word "publicising" is translated in the French as "à la population", when it would be more accurate to state "à la propagation".  

Thirdly, in paragraph 31.1, in the English it states "reports on the widespread killing that criticised the government."  It's translated in the French as "dépêche critique du gouvernement faisant état de tuer".  I believe it would be more accurate if it was reworded as "dépêche du critiquait du gouvernement faisant état des tueries".  

Fourthly, in paragraph 35.2, where it states, "As he looked on" in English, it's translated "surveiller" in the French, when perhaps it would be more accurate to state "pourvait voir". 

Now, I bring these items to the Court's attention and to the attention of the parties.  At a later point, the language section itself may introduce these changes officially.  I'm simply bringing it to the Court's attention at this point to clarify the record.  There may be other imprecisions.  The language section has agreed that it will revise or re-revise the entire text and then perhaps make adjustments accordingly.  

The Prosecutor notes the absence of the four Accused, which we find a bit lamentable inasmuch as their counsel were brought from very distant lands to be present here to discuss this amended indictment with them and to represent them in Court.  We would note that all of the Accused have had the text of this indictment or this proposed amendment available to them for the most part since August of 2003, certainly from the 23rd of January 2004, and with the minor modifications that were ordered by the Trial Chamber on the 13th of February, which we in fact served upon the Accused on the 18th of February.  So there has been a number of months that have transpired for the Accused to become familiar with this indictment and to discuss it with their counsel. 

I note for the record that counsel for Nzirorera, on his behalf, did not object to the amendment and simply stated that he wanted an opportunity to plead to any new charges.  I believe it was counsel for Nzirorera that made a number of objections to proceeding with the trial back on the 19th of January, and we find ourselves in a situation where this Tribunal has gone to great expense to afford these Accused with the opportunity to meet with their counsel specifically for the purpose of discussing this amended indictment as a prelude to pleading on the new charges, and none of them are here before the Court.  

Taking note of that, when I look at Rule 62, Initial Appearance of the Accused and Plea, it states, under paragraph (A)(ii) that the indictment should be read -- excuse me, that the Trial Chamber or the Judge shall read or have read the indictment to the Accused in a language he speaks and understands; and satisfy itself or himself that the Accused understands the indictment. 

Your Honour, in the present circumstance, that seems like quite a waste of time and a waste of Tribunal resources to have everyone in this Trial Chamber sit down and listen to an indictment, when the intention of the framers of this Rule was that the Accused themselves hear it and understand it.  On the basis of that, I'm asking this Court to waive the reading of the indictment and to simply enter pleas of not guilty on all the counts in the indictment pursuant to Rule 62(A) -- excuse me one 
second -- (A)(iv), Your Honour.  

There is precedent for that.  I would recall that back in April of 1999, I believe it was, when 
Mr. Karemera took his plea on the first indictment, at that time he refused to plea.  So back in April of 1999, even with respect to the defendant Karemera, the Court had to enter a plea on his behalf because he refused to plea.  In the case of Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, who elected not to come to court, the trial continued in his absence.  And on the basis of those two precedents -- and there is one other that I'd like to bring to the Court's attention, it's the case of the Prosecutor versus Joseph Kanyabashi, decision following the initial appearance of the 29th of November 1996, in that case as well the Accused refused to plea and the Court entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf.  

So in light of those precedents, Your Honour, and in view of the expense and the waste that has already been allotted to the issue of allowing these Accused to plea to an amended indictment, I would suggest or submit to the Court that we should be able -- the Court should be able to enter pleas of not guilty to each of the seven counts without going through the exercise of reading the indictment out loud to the Accused who are not even present to hear it.  

And simply to bring a bit of precision to what I was saying earlier, the appropriate Rule is 
Rule 62(A)(iii).  So that's my submission.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honour, I, too, think it's very lamentable that the Accused are not here today to enter their pleas and to hear the indictment and to tell you in their own words that they understand it or if they don't, and I think they expressed to the Trial Chamber in a letter dated February 19th, which I hope you have, the reasons why they're not here.  And it's my request that the letter that they have sent to the Trial Chamber be answered by the Trial Chamber, that it be -- it seems a matter of common courtesy, and that we have the initial appearance.  As soon as that has been done, I believe that once the Accused have received an answer to their letter, that they would come to Court and we could have a regular initial appearance.  

As a lawyer, I don't like to have my clients writing letters to the Court because I think it's my job to speak for my clients, and over the course of the proceedings with this Trial Chamber, I have spent many hours trying to explain to Mr. Nzirorera what's been going on in his case and all of the decisions that have been made and the rulings that have been made.  And obviously, my explanations to him were not such as to convince him that he's receiving a fair trial.  And I'd have to say that I agree with him on that point.  

And so I feel that the Trial Chamber should take the opportunity to address the concerns that the Accused have raised in a letter.  I think it would be a wise thing to do, because every effort should be made to encourage the Accused to participate in their trial.  If they don't participate in their trial, we are going to have a very bad future in this case, where both the Accused and their counsel will not be present for the trial and it may very well be that the trial cannot proceed.  And so to take a little time at this juncture to address the concerns of the Accused seems to be a very wise thing to do, and I would ask the Trial Chamber to continue this initial appearance for a very short period, to have directed staff to respond to the concerns expressed by the Accused in the letter and have us come back and all be on the same page.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Any other remarks from the Defence before we proceed?  Yes.
MS. DIAGNE:
Yes, Madam President.  Thank you, Madam President for giving -- allowing me to speak.  You have just heard the Prosecutor say again here before you that his indictment contains errors.  This is not the indictment that will be confirmed, surely.  I don't think we're in a race against the clock, in view of what he himself admits, that the translation -- the French translation of the indictment is not faithful.  And as everyone knows, the indictment is the basis for everything.  Why not postpone this hearing until the Prosecutor will be prepared to give a proper indictment?  And that is all I wanted to say.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, thank you.  First of all, for the record, or for clarification, I should like to rectify a comment by the translator, who said that I had the whole weekend to talk with Mr. Ngirumpatse about the indictment.  I must state again what I said.  I arrived last night, because the conditions under which we were to respond to this initial -- further initial appearance hearing did not allow me to arrive before last night.  I therefore did not have the whole weekend to talk with Mr. Ngirumpatse about an indictment which has, moreover, not been served on me.  

And as the rest -- as far as the rest of the matter is concerned, in view of the seriousness and gravity of this hearing, I should like to repeat what has been said by my learned friends Mr. Robinson and Madam Dior Diagne.  We are at a very unusual juncture at this trial, where the indictees are asked to plead guilty or not guilty on an indictment served on them on the 18th of February -- I didn't understand whether it was Wednesday, 18th February or Friday, 20th February, but there is no such date as Friday, 18th of February.  They are invited to plead guilty or not guilty on an indictment which arises in the course of trial, whereas as we started hearings in November under conditions in certainty of which we denounced and we had to denounce also to what extent we were obliged to work on incomplete communications and insincere communications -- incomplete communications.  

The Prosecutor spoke -- has spoken of precedent.  Yes, we must follow precedent in our trial, but I have the feeling that this trial is a trial of precedents.  I think there are very few trials having begun on an indictment where one changed horses in midstream.  It's one of the rare examples of a trial having begun without a list of witnesses, without proceedings that would respect the normal order of things, the chronological order of things, in which there are preliminaries, but here the preliminaries arrive after the beginning of the proceedings. 

Since the month of October, the Accused have shown themselves extremely gracefully cooperative.  They have been actors present in the process, and in the trial they have stubbornly -- and that is where the admiration has come, participated in the proceedings and expressed their opinion on the proceedings regularly.  

If they are not here today, I think the Trial Chamber must question itself.  This is not just by chance.  It's the reflection of some deep-rooted discomfort, and if they have this deep-rooted discomfort as to the way their fate is being handled, the international community must seriously be concerned, as well as must be your Trial Chamber.  So citing precedents where indictees have refused to appear or where indictees have not pleaded is totally inappropriate for the situation today, where there are indictees who want to participate in their trial, but in a trial where their full role is in a fair trial.  When they come to say to you that, at present, they do not feel that their rights are being safeguarded, are not being defended and therefore they await other circumstances for the possibility to plead, it is sufficiently serious for us to stop here and lend some attention to the letter informing you of this, and which is the outcome of the various alarm signals we've heard since October, when we have on numerous occasions been obliged to say that we are seriously questioning ourselves on progress in the proceedings under these circumstances, the way our motions are treated, the way certification to appeal -- our only ground on one side.  

We wonder as to the image given to the world of the decisions that follow one upon the other.  We have said it; we have repeated it at all hearings where we participated.  We have perhaps said things insufficiently to be understood, but I think the defendants tell you clearly in what is -- should be called a solemn address, which it would extremely prejudicial to the history -- to the credit historically to the Tribunal that it be heard or not heard.  So the Accused not being here today, we can consider that we are at an impasse and that they have pleaded not guilty.  That is perhaps hanging on desperately to the letter of the Rules of Evidence and Procedure because in this case the defendants have not said that, did not say that they do not want to plead, but they have written a letter explaining, in detail, why the conditions were not appropriate for them to plead one way or another, in the hope that they could be heard in their plea, whichever it might be.  It's their fear of not being heard which has led them today not to refuse to stay, but to ask you to ensure the conditions where they might be appropriately heard in the courtroom, which is certainly the case for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  He is quite ready, as he was since October, as he has been since 1998, when he was arrested and since -- dates since he has been expecting his trial, waiting for his trial.  He's perfectly ready to be heard, but unless he feels that there is an ear to hear him -- they hope for an answer to their letter, communication, and hope for a initial appearance in the appropriate circumstances in respect of his rights, and it having been demonstrated that the trial is fair and that the Defence can be heard, as well as the Prosecution is heard.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 

MR. GUINDO:
Madam President, with your permission, I should like to bring a clarification.  Friday was indeed the 20th of February 2004.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, one last comment, Your Honour.  First of all, I'd like to state that the jurisprudence of this Tribunal establishes that this initial appearance can go on, and it is the Prosecutor's submission that it should go on unimpeded by the dilatory response of the Defence and the Accused in this matter.  

With regard to the letter that was sent by the Accused on the 18th -- which is dated the 18th of February, this is not a motion before the Court.  If the Court sees fit to answer this letter, that is its concern.  It is not any application filed by the parties pursuant to any of the procedures of this Tribunal or this Trial Chamber that should slow down, retard or stop the proceedings that are currently in course.  My application is simply that we proceed with the initial appearance but that we dispense with the reading of the indictment.  

As for Mr. Robinson's intimation that the absence of the Defence and even the absence of their counsel, that the Defence would actually go to the extent of absenting themselves from the procedure to bring things to a halt is an outrage, and this Court should recognise it as such.  If the Accused decide not to be present, these proceedings should continue.  If the Defence decides to absent themselves, they should be sanctioned by this Trial Chamber.  

Having said that, my recommendation is that we should proceed, that the Court enter a plea of not guilty for the Accused who are not present, and that we dispense with the reading of the indictment.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The first matter I would like to say, that all the translation, the errors in translation in the French text that the Prosecutor has pointed out are noted and should be included in the French version of the indictment.

Secondly, it was mentioned that a letter was written by the Accused persons.  Yes, a letter was written to the President of this Chamber, and I think she's going to take the necessary action.  In regard to all the other points that you have raised, at the end of these proceedings, senior counsel, Mr. O'Donnell, is going to arrange an informal meeting with the parties.  But for now, we follow the proceedings -- the Rules, and we are going to go on with the initial appearance.  Contrary to what the Prosecutor has said, I would like the entire indictment to be read out, even if the Accused persons are absent, so that when it comes to entering the plea, we will know what to do, entering it in respect of each person count by count.  

So could the registry go on with the reading of the indictment, please?  That's why we're here today, so we won't avoid that part of it. 

Go on with the reading of the indictment in French, please -- or since the Accused persons are not here, you can read it in English, in whatever language you want. 
MR. KOUAMBO:
Thank you, Madam President.  The registry had made arrangements for the reading to be done in French.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, go ahead. 
MR. KOUAMBO:
Thank you, Madam President.  

International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Case No. ICTR-98-44-I.  The Prosecutor against

The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Prosecutor, pursuant to the authority stipulated in Article 17 of the Statute.

MR. KOUAMBO:
Thank you, Madam President.  

The Accused 

I. Particulars of the Accused

1.  Édouard Karemera, alias Rukusanya, was born in Mwendo commune, Kibuye préfecture, in 1951.  Édouard Karemera was trained as a lawyer and was Minister of the Interior in the Interim Government of 8 April 1994, taking the oath of office on the 25th of May 1994 and continuing in that capacity until the Interim Government fled from Rwanda in July 1994.  During 1994 Édouard Karemera was also first vice-president of the MRND political party and a member of the party's Steering Committee, serving in that capacity since July 1993. 
2.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was born in 1939 in Tare commune, Kigali-rural préfecture, Rwanda.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was trained as a lawyer and during 1994 was president of the MRND political party and a member of the party's Steering Committee, serving in that capacity since July 1993.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse previously served as Minister of Justice in Rwanda's first "multi-party" government of 31 December 1991 and was also Secretary-General of the MRND from May 1992 through July 1993 and a member of its Steering Committee.  Previously he was also Ambassador to Germany and Ethiopia, Director General for Foreign Affairs in the President's office and general manager of SONARWA, an insurance company. 

3.  Joseph Nzirorera was born in 1950 in Mukingo commune, Ruhengeri préfecture, Rwanda.  During 1994 Joseph Nzirorera was National-Secretary of the MRND political party and a member of its Steering Committee, serving in that capacity since July 1993.  Joseph Nzirorera was also a member of the Chambre des Deputés in the Assemblée Nationale, representing the MRND and Ruhengeri préfecture in that capacity, and served as President in the Interim Government of 8 April 1994.  Previously Joseph Nzirorera was Minister of Public Works in the MRND government of 15 January 1989 and was Minister of Industry, Mines and Artisanry in the MRND governments formed on 9 July 1990 and on 4 February 1991.  Joseph Nzirorera was a member of the MRND Steering Committee throughout the period of 1992 to 1994 and even prior to 1991. 

4.  André Rwamakuba was born in 1950 in Gikomero commune, Kigali-rural préfecture, Rwanda.  André Rwamakuba was trained as a physician and was Minister of Primary and Secondary Education in the Interim Government of 8 April 1994, taking the oath of office on 9 April 1994 and continuing in that capacity until the Interim Government fled from Rwanda in July 1994.  André Rwamakuba also served as "spokesman" for the Interim Government and was a member of the MDR political party, associated with the party's "Hutu Power" wing.

II.  Authority and Legal Duties of the Accused  

5.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Édouard Karemera constituted the national executive leadership of the MRND political party and, along with Second Vice-President Ferdinand Kabagema, comprised its Steering Committee.  In their respective capacities as President, National-Secretary, and First and Second Vice-Presidents, they participated in the MRND Political Bureau, (made up of the Steering Committee and the MRND chairmen at the préfectural level) and of the MRND central committee (made up of the Steering Committee and five members from every préfecture). 

6.  On the basis of their executive leadership positions in the MRND, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, 
Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera exercised authority over government officials in the territorial administration that were also MRND party members.  Governmental authority, as mediated by the territorial administration, either complemented or was subordinate to structures of the authority of the MRND in those préfectures or communes controlled by the MRND. 

7.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera exercised effective control over the Interahamwe, the youth wing of the MRND political party, through structures of authority in the MRND party at the level of the préfecture.  As President of the MRND, Mathieu Ngirumpatse exercised the ultimate authority over the MRND and the Interahamwe. 

8.  Édouard Karemera was Minister of the Interior in the Interim Government during the period after 25 May 1994.  In that capacity he exercised de jure and de facto authority and effective control over the regional territorial administration of préfets, sous-préfets, and bourgmestres throughout Rwanda.  Furthermore, as Minister of Interior, Édouard Karemera (i) was responsible for appointments of préfets and bourgmestres nationwide; and (ii) received regular reports from préfets and bourgmestres on security in their respective administrative constituencies. 

9.  Collectively, the national leadership in the MRND political party, particularly its Steering Committee and the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, both of which were controlled by the MRND political party, initiated and exercised authority over the "civil defence programme".  Particularly after 6 April 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera exercised effective control over the network of national and regional leaders in the "civil defence programme" and the Interahamwe militias. 

10.  In this context, the following persons or classes of persons were subordinates of 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera and were subject to their command responsibility:  members of the Interahamwe militias, particularly those members of its leadership that were already in place by 6 April 1994, including Robert Kajuga, Georges Rutaganda, Joseph Setiba, Bernard Maniragaba, among others; préfets, bourgmestres and conseillers that were members of the MRND, and members of their respective conseils de securité at préfectural and communal levels; commanders of the "civil defence programme", particularly those military officials that held appointments in the territorial administration, such as Butare préfet Col. Alphonse Nteziryayo, Kigali préfet Col. Tharcisse Renzaho, and Gitarama préfet Maj. Damascene Ukulikiyezu; and administrative personnel in the ministries controlled by the MRND, such as Callixte Kalimanzira, Directeur de cabinet in the Ministry of the Interior.  

11.  André Rwamakuba was a member of the MDR political party, identifying with that party's "Hutu Power" wing.  During the period that he served as Minister of Primary and Secondary Education in the Interim Government, he also served as one of the coordinators of the "civil defence programme".  In that capacity he exercised command responsibility and effective control over regional and local leaders of the "civil defence force", particularly over Interahamwe and related militias in Gikomero, his home commune, and militiamen that were present in and around the Butare University Hospital. 
Charges, including a Concise Statement of Facts  

Count 1:  Conspiracy to Commit Genocide

The Prosecutor charges Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, and 
André Rwamakuba with conspiracy to commit genocide pursuant to Articles 2 and 6(1) of the Statute of the Tribunal in that over a period of at least one year leading up to and including 6 April - 17 July 1994 all named accused conspired together, and with others, to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi racial or ethnic group, committed as follows:  

12.  Unless otherwise stated all events detailed in the present indictment, including the acts and omissions of the accused, took place in Rwanda between 1 January and 31 December 1994. 

13.  Over the course of several years leading up to and including 1994, particularly after 1992, Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and André Rwamakuba conspired amongst themselves, and with numerous others, meeting severally at various locations on disparate occasions in the context of their political party and official government activities, to plan and prepare the destruction of Rwanda's Tutsi population, particularly the killing of persons identified as Tutsi.

14.  Among those conspiring and acting in concert with all named accused were (i) military authorities, including Augustin Bizimana, Minister of Defence, Col. Theoneste Bagosora, Directeur de cabinet in the Ministry of Defense; Lt. Col. Anatole Nsengiyumva, commandant de place in Gisenyi; Col. Tharcisse Renzaho, préfet of Kigali-ville, Augustin Bizimungu, Army Chief of Staff, and Augustin Ndindiliyimana, Chief of Staff of the Gendarmerie, among others; (ii) political authorities at the regional and national level, particularly those ministers participating in the Interim Government of 8 April 1994, including Callixte Nzabonimana, Minister of Youth and Sports; Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, Minister of Family and Gender; Eliézer Niyitegeka, Minister of Information; Justin Mugenzi, Minister of Commerce; Casimir Bizimungu, Minister of Health; and Jerôme-Clément Bicamumpaka, Minister of Foreign Affairs, amongst others; and regional officials such as Clément Kayishema, préfet of Kibuye, Sylvain Nsabimana, préfet of Butare, Juvenal Kajelijeli, bourgmestre of Mukingo; and

Rwagafilitia, leader of the "civil defence" in Kibungo; Bernard Munyemvano, President of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi; and 
Omar Serushago, an Interahamwe leader in Gisenyi; among others. 

Prior to 8 April 1994

Formation of the Interahamwe; meetings and public speeches; financing, military training, stockpiling of firearms and weapons distributions for militias:  

15.  Over the course of 1993 and 1994 Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and 
Édouard Karemera agreed amongst themselves, and with others, and collectively undertook initiatives that were intended to create and extend their own personal control, and that of the MRND Steering committee, over an organised, centrally commanded corps of militiamen that would respond to their call to attack, kill and destroy the Tutsi population.

15.1. Sometime during 1992 Mathieu Ngirumpatse initiated or supported the proposal that the MRND should establish a "youth wing" that would be called the Interahamwe.  This MRND "youth wing" would compete with rival "youth wings" of opposition political parties to recruit members for the MRND.  Over time, the MRND-Interahamwe "youth wing" attracted and incorporated unemployed, delinquent youth that often engaged in illegal activity under the auspices of "multi-party politics" and kibuhoza. 

15.2.  In July 1993 Mathieu Ngirumpatse became the national President of the MRND political party.  During an MRND national congress held sometime around June or July 1993, the MRND Central Committee, at that time including Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera, authorised and founded MRND-Interahamwe committees at the préfectural level throughout Rwanda, thereby extending the illicit activities of the Interahamwe and bringing the MRND "youth wing" squarely under the control of the MRND préfectural chairmen, who themselves were subject to the authority of the MRND Steering Committee.

15.3.  Starting in 1993 Mathieu Ngirumpatse and other national leaders of the MRND political party conspired among themselves, and with civilian authorities in the territorial administration and military authorities in the Minister of Defense and the FAR, to provide military training and arms to Interahamwe militias, and to stockpile firearms from the Ministry of Defense for later distribution to Interahamwe militias, intending that Interahamwe militias would be deployed to kill and arm Rwanda's Tutsi population. 

15.4.  In this regard Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera were aware of, and complicit in, decisions taken by the Minister of Defense Augustin Bizimana and Minister of Defense directeur de cabinet Theoneste Bagosora, and certain FAR military officers, to provide military training to the Interahamwe militias in military camps in Kigali, Cyangugu, Gisenyi and Butare, as well as in the Mutara sector, notably at Gabiro, Gako,  Mukamira and Bigogwe camps and in neighbouring forests, including Gishwati in Gisenyi and Akagera in Umutara. 

15.5.  In furtherance of this conspiracy Mathieu Ngirumpatse ordered, facilitated or assisted the distributions of weapons to the Interahamwe during 1993 and in early 1994 and also ordered or assisted the concealing of stockpiled firearms so that they would not be removed pursuant to the KWSA (Kigali Weapons Secure Area), a disarmament initiative launched by UNAMIR, intending that such weapons should later be distributed to the MRND-Interahamwe. 

15.6.  During this period, and continuing through early 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse participated in meetings of the MRND party at the préfectural level in Kigali-rural, Kibungo and in several other préfectures, during which he presented and endorsed local leaders of the Interahamwe to the various regional constituencies of the MRND.  Such efforts were means to expand membership in the Interahamwe and to exercise control over the militias through structures of authority in the MRND party.  

15.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera participated in fund-raising activities for the Interahamwe.  Particularly noteworthy are several meetings organised under the auspices of the MRND political party to arrange collections of money from businessmen and wealthy party members.  On or about 27 February 1994, Joseph Nzirorera organised a fund-raising banquet for the Interahamwe at the Hotel Rebero in Kigali.  Persons in attendance included President Juvénal Habyarimana, Seraphin Rwabukumba, Augustin Ngirumpatse, Robert Kajuga, among many other notable MRND party members, several of whom made congratulatory speeches, including the President of the Republic, who praised the Interahamwe and encouraged participants to donate funds for their support.

16.  Over the course of 1993 and early 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and 
Edouard Karemera often participated in various MRND political party meetings and addressed public gatherings and rallies where they characterised the Tutsi as "the enemy".  These various meetings and gatherings were intended to indoctrinate MRND party members, particularly the 
MRND-Interahamwe "youth wing", with anti-Tutsi sentiment and to generate fear and loathing of the Tutsi as a group among Rwanda's Hutu population.  These initiatives were consistent with recommendations made in a report from a Special Military Commission chaired by Théoneste Bagosora to devise an agenda to "defeat the enemy militarily, in the media and politically" that Juvénal Habyarimana, at that time Commander in Chief of the Forces Armées Rwandaises (FAR) as well as Rwandan head of state, established in December 1991.  Army chief of staff, Déogratias Nsabimana caused the report to be circulated among FAR military officers in September 1992.

16.  On or about 23 October 1993, in particular, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, 
Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, among others, participated in a rally at Nyamirambo stadium in Kigali where they made speeches that characterised the Tutsi as accomplices of "the enemy." 
The rally included animation and pageantry by Interahamwe

16.2  On or about 27 October 1993, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Edouard Karemera, along with Col. Théoneste Bagosora, Augustin Ngirabatware, among other high-level officials of the MRND, participated in a rally with thousands of persons in attendance at Umuganda Stadium in Gisenyi.  Again, those that addressed the crowd, including Mathieu Ngirumpatse and 
Edouard Karemera opposed the Arusha Accords and exhorted the crowd to "combat the enemy".  Interahamwe in kitenge uniforms provided security and animation for the event.

16.3  Towards mid-February 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse addressed a rally at Nyamirambo Stadium in Kigali.  The rally assembled leading politicians that espoused the cause of the "Hutu Power" and ended with chants of "Tubatsembasembe", "Let us exterminate them", referring to the Tutsi, members of the Interahamwe participated in the rally.

17.  On or about 29 March 1994, Army Chief of Staff Déogratias Nsabimana held a meeting with the préfet of Kigali and the commandant de secteur for the city of Kigali to  fine-tune the structure and organisation of a civil defence plan.  Elements of the plan included: establishing the cellule, an administrative unit in the territorial administration, as the organisational equivalent of the platoon; drawing up lists of reservists resident in Kigali at the level of the cellule that would be available to work with soldiers; training civilians to work with reservists and soldiers; stockpiling weapons and ammunitions at the level of the cellule; instructing civilians on the use of swords, spears, machetes, bows and arrows; et cetera.  Other documentation of the "civil defence" plan from the same period emphasised the need for secrecy and close collaboration between military commanders, the national gendamerie and political parties "defending the principle of the republic and democracy", a reference to the MRND.

18. Over a period of several months leading up to 6 April 1994, Joseph Nzirorera made regular weekly weekend trips to Mukingo commune.  During those visits, Joseph Nzirorera held meetings with local political and military officials at his mother's Busogo secteur residence.  Persons that attended those meetings, including Juvénal Kajelijeli, Casmir Bizimungu and Augustin Bizimungu, among others, agreed that they would combat the RPF and oppose the Arusha Accords by exterminating the Tutsi and prepared for attacks against the local Tutsi population by organising military training for the Interahamwe and by stockpiling weapons and ammunitions and by distributing weapons to Interahamwe militiamen for use in future attacks.

19.  Following an extraordinary congress of the MDR political party at Kabusunzu in Kigali on or about 26 July 1993, André Rwamakuba became associated with the party's extremist "Hutu Power" wing as a member of its executive team, along with Froudouald Karamira, a leader of the party, and 
Jean Kambanda, a leading politician who would subsequently become prime minister in the interim government of 8 April 1994.  Thereafter, André Rwamakuba travelled about his home commune in Gikomero in Kigali-rural préfecture and chaired meetings in Nduba, Shago and Kayanga secteurs and in neighbouring communes in Rutongo, Rubungo and Kanombe, where he called upon the Hutu majority to oppose the Arusha peace agreement and to exterminate the Tutsi.

After 8 April 1994: An interim government policy of genocide

20.  The assassinations of President Juvénal Habyarimana and army chief of staff 
Déogratias Nsabimana on the evening of 6 April 1994 created a crisis of leadership for Rwandan civilian and military authorities.  When Théoneste Bagosora was unable to take control through structures of authority in the ministry of defence or the FAR, extremist elements in the military and the MRND and "Hutu Power" political parties, including Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Edouard Karemera and André Rwamakuba, agreed among themselves to impose an interim civilian government to fill the power vacuum.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Col. Théoneste Bagosora, 
Edouard Karemera, Joseph Nzirorera, André Rwamakuba, Donat Murego, Froudouald Karamira, Hyacinthe Rafiki Nsengiyumva conspired amongst themselves and with other leading members of the MRND and the "Hutu Power" opposition parties to assemble the interim government of 8 April 1994 with the intention of using the apparatus and resources of the state, and the legitimacy of the state authority, to execute the destruction of Rwanda's Tutsi population.
20.1  The various participants in the conspiracy, including Mathieu Ngirumpatse Edouard Karemera, Joseph Nzirorera and André Rwamakuba, convened in meetings with Théoneste Bagosora at the ministry of defence on the morning and afternoon of 8th April 1994, by which time Presidential Guard soldiers loyal to Col. Théoneste Bagosora and subject to his effective control, had already killed 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, Parti Social Democrat party chairman Frederick Nzamurambaho, Parti Liberal party chairman Landouald Ndasingwa, constitutional court president Joseph Kavaruganda, all of whom would otherwise have assumed control of the government or whose participation would have been required to constitute a new civilian authority under the terms of the Broad Based Transitional Government anticipated by the Arusha Accords or the 1991 Constitution, facts known to all members of the conspiracy by the afternoon of 7 April 1994.

20.2  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Edouard Karemera, Joseph Nzirorera, André Rwamakuba, Justin Mugenzi, Frodouald Karamira, Jean Kambanda, among others, agreed among themselves and with others to place structures of authority in the MRND and "Hutu Power" political parties at the service of the interim government through the ministry of the interior and the territorial administration, and the military, through the ministry of defence and the FAR, as a means to mobilise extremist militiamen in the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militias and armed civilians to attack, kill and destroy Rwanda's Tutsi population.

20.3  This agreement was manifested in various orders, directives and instructions issued to préfets and bourgmestres and to the general population during the course of April, May and June 1994, among them, (i) the prime minister's instructions to  restore security in the country of 27 April 1994;  (ii) the directives of the prime minister to all préfets on the organisation of civil defence of 25 May 1994; (iii) the letter to all préfets on the implementation of the prime minister's directive on the organisation of civil defence of 25 May 1994; (iv) the ministerial instructions to the préfets of the préfecture on the use of funds earmarked for the  ministry of the interior and communal development for civil self-defence of mid-June 1994; and (v) the letter to commandant de secteur 
Anatole Nsengiyumva for the opération de ratissage à Kibuye of 18 June 1994, among others, all of which were issued on the basis of unanimous agreement during various cabinet meetings of the interim government and derived from recommendations from the MRND steering committee, including Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Edouard Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera.

21.  These various agreements and initiatives in furtherance of the agreements were intended to galvanise anti-Tutsi fear and loathing among the Hutu population and to mould it into a lethal apparatus, in the form of militias trained and armed with resources from the state, for deployment in a campaign of destruction against the Tutsi as a group.

Count 2.  Direct and Public Incitement to Commit Genocide

The Prosecutor charges Edouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, and 
André Rwamakuba with direct and public incitement to commit genocide pursuant to Articles 2.6(1) and 6(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal, in that during the period 1 January to 17 July 1994, all named accused, directly and publicly incited other persons to destroy in whole or in part the Tutsi racial ethnic group, committed as follows:

22.  All named accused prepared or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation and execution of a campaign of propaganda to instigate and incite the broad masses of Hutu subsistence farmers, particularly the members of the political party "youth wing" militias, to target Tutsi for  attack or to join in or support the killing of the Tutsi population.  All named accused participated in public meetings and rallies and made public statements, some of which were broadcast in the mass media, that were intended to foment fear and loathing of the Tutsi among Rwanda's Hutu citizens.

Furthermore, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, among others, participated in the creation and the financing of the RTLM radio station, which served as a vehicle for disseminating their extremist ideology.

23.  Over the course of January through June 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse made statements at various public meetings and gatherings, or publicly associated himself with statements or acts by other persons at such gatherings, that characterised all Tutsi as "the enemy" or as "accomplices of the enemy" or as "accomplices of the RPF" intending to instigate those in attendance to "fight the enemy" and to physically attack, harm and destroy the Tutsi as a group.

23.1  On a date uncertain during February 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse addressed a rally at Nyamirambo stadium in Kigali.  The rally assembled leading politicians that espoused the cause of "Hutu Power" and ended with chants of "Tumbatsembasembe", "Let us exterminate them", referring the Tutsi.  Members of the Interahamwe participated in the rally.

23.2  On or about 8 April 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse participated in a meeting with local MRND party officials in Gitega secteur in Kigali-ville préfecture, during which he exhorted those in attendance to "work harder now that the president was dead."  Immediately thereafter, several groups of Interahamwe militiamen in attendance were dispatched to Gitarama, Kibuye and Gisenyi to commence the killing of the Tutsi population.

24.  Over the course of January through June 1994, Joseph Nzirorera made statements at various public meetings and gatherings, or publicly associated himself with statements or acts by other persons at such gatherings, to instigate and incite those in attendance to "fight the enemy" and to destroy the Tutsi as a group.  Furthermore, after 6 April 1994, Joseph Nzirorera often publicly congratulated groups of militiamen for having killed Tutsis, thereby instigating and inciting militiamen and other armed civilians to participate in further attacks against the Tutsi population.

24.1  On or about the evening of 6 April and in the morning of 7 April 1994, Joseph Nzirorera participated in meetings in Mukingo and Nkuli communes and delivered firearms to militiamen and exhorted them to start killing the Tutsi population in Ruhengeri.  Joseph Nzirorera went so far as to instruct that the killings should begin with one of his own daughters born of Nyabuhu, a Tutsi woman, to incite participants to kill all Tutsi without exception.

24.2  On one particular occasion, sometime after 6 April 1994 during a grandiose "passing out" ceremony for newly trained Interahamwe militias, Joseph Nzirorera publicly thanked military instructors and further praised the Interahamwe, urging the militiamen to continue in their mission and acknowledging their accomplishments since no single Tutsi in the commune had survived.

24.3  On a date unknown between 6 April and 30 April 1994, Joseph Nzirorera along with several Presidential Guard soldiers arrived at the Canadian Embassy in Kigali searching for the wife of President of the Supreme Court, Joseph Kavaruganda.  Failing to locate her, Joseph Nzirorera shouted, "All Tutsis who are here should die!" loud enough to be heard by militiamen at a nearby roadblock, referring to persons sheltered in the embassy.  Later that same day those same militiamen killed several Tutsi youth that had taken shelter in the courtyard of the Canadian Embassy, exclaiming, "Now that Nzirorera has given us the order to kill all the Tutsi, we must eliminate you".

24.4  On or about 30 April 1994, at a meeting of the conseil de securité in Kigali, Joseph Nzirorera publicly thanked the Interahamwe of Kigali for the good work that they were doing and offered them money for the purchase of beer.  Tharcisse Renzaho and Laurent Semanza, among others, also participated in the meeting.  All participants were aware that Interahamwe in Kigali were systematically killing Tutsi residents at roadblocks and in neighbourhood patrols.  When a participant at the meeting asked for an explanation of who the enemy was, Joseph Nzirorera responded that "a Hutu who joined the RPF is our food, while a Tutsi who joined the MRND is now the enemy of the country", concluding that "a Tutsi is the enemy of Rwanda."  Such remarks were intended to, and had the consequence of inciting attacks upon all Tutsi.

24.5  On or about 6 May 1994, Joseph Nzirorera participated in a large meeting with high-level government officials, including Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, in Ruhengeri préfecture.  The prime minister encouraged the audience to work their fields, but with gun in hand in case of an attack, and explained that the government was negotiating for assistance to win the war.  By that time massive killings of Tutsi civilians in Ruhengeri had already substantially eliminated the Tutsi population in the region.  Joseph Nzirorera's public association and endorsement of interim government ministers and policies were intended to, and had the consequence of inciting further attacks upon the Tutsi.

24.6  Also sometime in May or June 1994, Joseph Nzirorera, along with Minister of Foreign Affairs Jérôme-Clément Bicamumpaka, participated in a ceremony at the Mukingo bureau communal for there-investiture of Juvénal Kajelijeli as bourgmestre.  Interahamwe militiamen assembled and paraded for the delegation, whereupon Joseph Nzirorera thanked them for the "excellent work" that they had done, referring to the killings of Tutsis.  Such remarks incited militiamen and armed civilians to participate in further attacks against the Tutsi population.

25.  During April, May and June 1994, Edouard Karemera made statements at various public meetings and gatherings, or publicly associated himself with statements from other MRND and "Hutu Power" politicians, or publicly championed policies of the interim government intended to characterise all Tutsi as "the enemy" or as "accomplices of the enemy" or as "accomplices of the RPF", thereby instigating and inciting those in attendance to "fight the enemy" and to physically attack and destroy the Tutsi as a group.

25.1  On or about 3 May 1994, Edouard Karemera participated in a large meeting called by interim government officials at the Kibuye bureau communal.  Prime Minister Jean Kambanda addressed the gathering and promoted "civil defence" as a means to combat the RPF, reporting that the war was in "all communes in Rwanda.  Eliezer Niyitegeka made comments that characterised Tutsi children as "the enemy".  Edouard Karemera also addressed the gathering and paid tribute to the Interahamwe and called upon them to "flush out, stop and combat the enemy" in collaboration with the "youth wings" of the other parties.  The speeches and some of the commentary from that meeting were 
re-broadcast to the nation by Radio Rwanda several days later on or about 9 May 1994.

25.2  On or about 16 May 1994, President Sindikubwabo, accompanied by Edouard Karemera, held a security meeting in Kibuye during which he thanked Kibuye préfet Clement Kayishema for accomplishing his mission, referring to the killings of Tutsi in Kibuye.

25.3  Attacks against the Tutsi population in Kibuye escalated after the 3rd of May 1994 meeting, 
and after the Radio Rwanda re-broadcast of that meeting under circumstances in which 
Edouard Karemera knew or had reason to know or must have known and intended that his subsequently repeated public statements, associations and endorsements would incite further killings of Tutsis in Kibuye.
26.  During the period from January through June 1994, André Rwamakuba made statements at various public meetings and gatherings in Gikomero commune, or publicly associated himself with statements or acts by other persons at such gatherings, that characterised all Tutsi as "the enemy" or as "accomplices of the enemy" or as "accomplices of the RPF", as a means of inciting those in attendance to "fight the enemy" and to physically attack and destroy the Tutsi as a group.  Furthermore, after 6 April 1994, André Rwamakuba often praised and publicly congratulated militiamen for having killed Tutsis, thereby instigating and inciting militias and other armed civilians to participate in further attacks upon the Tutsi population.

26.1  During those "sensitisation" campaigns in Gikomero in early 1994, André Rwamakuba occasionally circulated in a vehicle equipped with a public address system exhorting Hutus to unite in order to get rid of the Tutsi, repeatedly making statements such as "the time has come for the Hutus to get rid of the enemy".

26.2  On a date unknown between 6 and 12 of April 1994, André Rwamakuba travelled to Gikomero commune to instigate local residents to commence or to participate in killing the Tutsi population.  On that occasion he instigated a crowd gathered near the Gikomero bureau communal to kill several persons among them that were identified as Tutsi.

26.3  On a date unknown between 8 and 30 April 1994, André Rwamakuba was appointed spokesman for the interim government, and in that capacity delivered radio addresses and communiqués on Radio Rwanda and RTLM, encouraging the Interahamwe to continue the hunt for Tutsis.  Furthermore, André Rwamakuba regularly returned to Kigali to assess the situation and the activities of the Interahamwe.  Throughout May and June 1994, André Rwamakuba made regular radio broadcasts where he appealed to Interahamwe militiamen to continue to hunt down the Tutsis wherever they were hiding and to exterminate them.

Count 3:  Genocide

The Prosecutor charges Edouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and 
André Rwamakuba with Genocide pursuant to Articles 2,6(1) and 6(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal, in that during the period 1 January to 17 July 1994, all named accused were responsible for killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the Tutsi population, or deliberately inflicting conditions of life upon the Tutsi population that were calculated to bring about its physical destruction, with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi racial or ethnic group, committed as follows:

27.  During 1994, particularly between the 6th of April and the 17th of July, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Edouard Karemera and André Rwamakuba, planned, instigated, ordered, participated in (committed), or otherwise aided or abetted a campaign of destruction against the Tutsi throughout Rwanda.  In so doing, all named accused, individually and severally, and acting in concert with others in the nature of a joint criminal enterprise, mobilised the physical and logistical resources of their respective political parties and the interim government ministries controlled by those parties, and the military, to target Rwanda's Tutsi population as "the enemy" or as "accomplices of the enemy", and to attack, kill and destroy the Tutsi as a group.

28.  In furtherance of the objectives of the joint criminal enterprise, all named accused participated in creating, organising and exercising control over political party "youth wing" militias.  These militias responded to their authority as senior officials in the MRND or MDR-Power political parties.  The Accused, directly or indirectly provided military training to the militias, caused weapons to be distributed to the militias and participated in indoctrinating the militias with anti-Tutsi propaganda, intending that the militias would lead or participate in killing and harming the Tutsi population in response to their orders and instructions.

29.  All named accused participated in formulating, articulating, publicising, and legitimising policies of the interim government of 8 April 1994 that were used to dismantle any resistance to the campaign of violence against the Tutsi population in the territorial administration and in civil society, including the dismissal and replacement of préfets and bourgmestres and civil servants that did not support the campaign of violence against the Tutsi population.

30.  All named accused, individually and severally, and acting in concert, organised or authorised a state-endorsed programme of "civilian self-defence" whereby officials in the territorial administration, préfets, bourgmestres and conseillers, and officials in the MRND and MDR-Power political parties recruited civilians, usually local Hutu youth, and consolidated them with political party "youth wing" militias under the authority of retired military officers and reservists.  In so doing, all named accused collaborated with segments of the military and enlisted the resources and logistics of the ministry of defence and the Forces Armées Rwandaises and structures of authority in the territorial administration, governed by the ministry of the interior to distribute firearms to political party 
"youth wing" militias and to legitimise and control the setting up of roadblocks and the tracking and killing of civilians at such roadblocks.  Furthermore, this "civilian self-defence" corps was deployed in armed patrols to identify, search out and kill the Tutsi population.

31.  As the RPF pushed the line of battle against the FAR southward and westward, all named accused enlisted structures of authority in the MRND and Hutu-Power political parties and the territorial administration to recruit, organise and deploy militiamen and armed civilians, supported by soldiers, gendarmes and communal police, to target and kill Rwanda's Tutsi population and to kill persons deemed to be political opponents.  These systematic attacks against the Tutsi occurring between 6 April and 17 July 1994 claimed the lives of over 75 per cent of the Rwanda's Tutsi population; over 500,000 persons, including men, women, children and the elderly.  Furthermore, thousands of Hutu that were deemed or presumed to be "accomplices" of the Tutsi because of their political opposition to "Hutu-Power" or other resistance to the campaign of violence against the Tutsi were targeted in attacks and were also killed.

31.1  Over the weekend of 8th to 10th April 1994, soldiers and militiamen set up roadblocks in Kigali and checked the identity cards of passers-by and killed most of those who were identified as Tutsi.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Edouard Karemera exercised control over Interahamwe at the roadblocks and were aware of the killings, as demonstrated by their directions to militiamen to stop the killings temporarily when international journalists present in Kigali began to issue reports on the widespread killing that criticised the government.

31.2  On or about 10 April 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Edouard Karemera convened a meeting with the national leadership of the Interahamwe at the Hotel des Diplomates that included participants from the recently appointed interim government ministers.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse directed the Interahamwe leaders to control their men and to invoke the authority of the interim government to organise the removal of corpses from the streets.  The campaign was deemed one of "pacification", though essentially and practically, it was a means of exerting control and direction over Interahamwe militias so that the killings would be focused on the most important targets first, the Tutsi intellectuals, and so that the killings would proceed with greater discretion.

31.3  Even as they attempted to control the killings at roadblocks, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and 
Joseph Nzirorera made arrangements with Théoneste Bagosora to obtain firearms from the ministry of defence and caused such weapons to be distributed to militiamen in Kigali, intending that they be used to attack and kill the Tutsi population.

31.4  On or about 11th April 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Edouard Karemera and André Rwamakuba participated in a meeting of the interim government with all préfets at the 
Hôtel de Diplomates in Kigali, intending to mobilise the territorial administration in the campaign of destruction against the Tutsi.  During that meeting, the préfets in attendance made reports on the situation of "security" in their respective regions.  Butare and Gitarama préfectures were labelled inactive because the killings of Tutsi had not advanced.

31.5  By 12 April 1994, soldiers and militiamen responding to order and instigations of  attacks from national leaders of the MRND and highly-placed government officials, including Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Edouard Karemera and André Rwamakuba, had killed thousands of civilians in Kigali and throughout Rwanda.  The victims were primarily of Tutsi ethnic or racial identification, but also included persons deemed to be political opponents to "Hutu Power".  Cumulatively, all named accused are responsible for the killings by virtue of their control and authority over militiamen that perpetrated the attacks and, as a result of their instigation and incitement of anti-Tutsi violence among militiamen and armed civilians responding to their authority and because they failed to prevent or halt such attacks, or to punish the perpetrators thereof, when they had the material capacity to do so.

31.6  On the morning of 12 April 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Edouard Karemera and André Rwamakuba accompanied the interim government in its flight to Gitarama as RPF troops descended upon Kigali from the north.

31.7  Over the course of the next two months, until early June 1994, the Murambi Training School in Gitarama served as the temporary headquarters of the interim government.  High level officials of those political parties represented in the interim government, including Mathieu Ngirumpatse, 
Joseph Nzirorera, Edouard Karemera and André Rwamakuba convened on a regular basis throughout that period, with each party meeting separately to consider policy matters, after which the various ministers of the respective parties convened the conseils des ministres to set the policy for the government.  The conseils des ministres or various other meetings of interim government ministers convened on numerous occasions throughout that period, almost on a daily basis, but notably on 
16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23 and 27 April 1993 and 25 May.  

31.8  During these numerous cabinet meetings the interim government adopted directives and issued instructions to the préfets and the bourgmestres.  The decisions which were then passed on to the general public were intended to instigate and aid and abet further attacks against the Tutsi population.  In order to ensure that the directives and instructions were carried out, Jean Kambanda's interim government designated a minister from each préfecture to be responsible for what was termed "pacification".  Interim government ministers were dispatched to their préfectures of origin to incite further killings and to exercise control over the militias.  During several conseils des ministres, the various ministers made requests for weapons to distribute in their respective home préfectures, knowing and intending that the weapons would be used to attack and kill the Tutsi population.

31.9  On or about 17 April 1994, the conseil des ministres of the interim government convened to review the status of office-holders in the territorial administration.  They removed the préfets  of Butare and Kibungo, both of whom were known to have opposed the attacks upon the Tutsi population, and appointed several new préfets that embraced the interim government's policy of targeting Tutsi civilians as "the enemy".  These decisions on appointments of préfets were broadcast to the nation in a Radio Rwanda communiqué read by Minister of Information Eliézer Niyitegeka on or about that same day.  The new office-holders would be installed on 19 April.

31.10  The interim government also controlled the appointments, promotions and transfers of military officers throughout the country.  Officers in the gendarmerie that were perceived as not supporting the interim government policy of attacking the civilian Tutsi population were transferred from the interior of the country, where they were duty-bound to maintain security, to the battlefront with the RPF in or near Kigali, so that the attacks against the Tutsi in Butare, Kibuye and elsewhere would not be impeded.  The interim government also recalled into active service certain retired military officers that were closely associated with extremist currents in the Habyarimana government.  These retired colonels were then installed as regional managers of the "civil defence".

31.11  On or about 18 April 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Edouard Karemera, André Rwamakuba, Justin Mugenzi, Eliézer Niyitegeka, Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, among others, participated in a meeting at the Murambi Training School during which the préfet and several bourgmestres from Gitarama préfecture requested Prime Minister Jean Kambanda to provide reinforcement to protect the Tutsi population and to restore order in the region.  Instead, several interim government ministers and political party leaders, notably Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Edouard Karemera and Justin Mugenzi, pressured the Gitarama delegation to stop protecting the Tutsi population and instead to allow killings of Tutsi civilians by Interahamwe to proceed.

31.12  On or about 19 April 1994, Interim President Sindikubwabo addressed a public rally in Butare préfecture and encouraged those that did not adopt the government programme to "step aside".  Thereafter, killings of Tutsi civilians started or accelerated in Butare.  The rally was also the occasion on which the interim government publicly deposed the only Tutsi préfet in Rwanda, 
Jean-Baptiste Habimana of Butare, a member of the Parti Liberal, and replaced him by Sylvain Nsabimana.

31.13  On or about 19 April 1994, Justin Mugenzi, representing the interim government, travelled to Kibungo préfecture to participate in the public installation of Enucleate Rudakubana as préfet.  On or about 20 April 1994, Justin Mugenzi travelled to Gisenyi to participate in a rally at Umuganda Stadium to install a new Gisenyi préfet.  Speaking on behalf of the interim government, Justin Mugenzi ordered or instigated attacks against the Tutsi population, emphasising the new préfet's mission as the elimination of the Tutsis.

31.14  On or about 25 April 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Edouard Karemera, and Anatole Nsengiyumva, among others, participated in a meeting in Gisenyi called by Felicién Kabuga to create a Fonds de Défense Nationale to support the interim government in "combating the enemy and its accomplices".  By 25 April 1994, all named accused knew or had reason to know that militiamen armed by  he military were incorporated in systematic attacks against the Tutsi population in Gisenyi and throughout Rwanda and that the Fonds de Défense Nationale was intended to re-supply the militias -- to re-provision the militias.  The funds were deposited in an account of the Banque Commercial de Rwanda to be used for the purchase of weapons for the army and the Interahamwe.  Shortly thereafter, Lieutenant Col. Anatole Nsengiyumva distributed weapons to militiamen in Gisenyi that were used to kill Tutsi men, women and children.

31.15  On 27 April 1994, the conseils des ministres again addressed the "civil defence".  By letter of the same date, Prime Minister Jean Kambanda issued "Instructions to restore security in the country", also addressed to all préfets, reiterating the interim government policy of making all citizens responsible for "unmasking the enemy and its accomplices" and ordered or authorised the setting up of roadblocks, knowing that the roadblocks were being used to identify the Tutsi and their "accomplices" for the purpose of killing them.  The conseil des ministres convened again on 29 and 30 April.  

31.16  On or about 3 May 1994, Edouard Karemera participated in a large meeting called by the interim government officials at the Kibuye bureau préfectoral.  Prime Minister Jean Kambanda addressed the gathering and again promoted civil defence as a means to combat the RPF, reporting that the war was in "all communes" in Rwanda.  Edouard Karemera also addressed the gathering and paid tribute to the MRND-Interahamwe and called upon them to "flush out, stop and combat the enemy" in collaboration with "youth wings" of the other parties.  The speeches and some of the commentary from that meeting were re-broadcast to the nation by Radio Rwanda several days later on or about 9 May 1994.

31.17  On a date unknown, between 1 May to 30 June 1994, Joseph Nzirorera, along with interim minister of foreign affairs Jérômé-Clément Bicamumpaka, participated in a ceremony at the Mukingo bureau communal for the re-investiture of Juvenal Kajelijeli as bourgmestre.  Interahamwe militiamen assembled and paraded for the delegation, whereupon Joseph Nzirorera thanked them for the "excellent work" that they had done, referring to the killings of Tutsis.

31.18  Throughout April, May and June 1994, local officials in the MRND and MDR-Power political parties and the territorial administration organised attacks against the Tutsi that took refuge in the Bisesero hills, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of Tutsi men, women and children.  Groups of Interahamwe and gendarmes brought in from Gisenyi, Cyangugu and Kigali reinforced local attackers in Kibuye during several large-scale attacks in mid-May.  Well-coordinated attacks on 13 and 14 May 1994 that caused the deaths of several thousands of persons are particularly noteworthy.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Edouard Karemera and André Rwamakuba knew or had reason to know of these attacks against civilians committed by persons over whom they exercised effective control and failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such crimes or to punish the perpetrators.

31.19  On or about 16 May 1994, President Sindikubwabo, accompanied by Edouard Karemera, held a "security" meeting in Kibuye during which he thanked Kibuye préfet Clement Kayishema for accomplishing his mission, referring to  the killings of Tutsi in Kibuye.

31.20  On or about 17 May 1994, during a meeting of the conseil des ministres, the interim government implemented measures to manage the "civil defence force", formally entrusting the Minister of Defence Augustin Bizimana, the Minister of the Interior Edouard Karemera, the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education André Rwamakuba, the Minister of Youth and Sports Callixte Nzabonimana, and the Minister for Family Affairs Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, and the Minister of Tourism, Gaspard Ruhumuliza, with responsibility for the "civil defence programme".

31.21  On or about 25 May 1994, Edouard Karemera was sworn in as minister of the interior.  Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda was also sworn in as minister of higher education, replacing Daniel Mbangura, who became a special adviser to the president.

31.22  Also on or about 25 May 1994, the ministry of the interior issued a letter to all préfets on the implementation of the prime minister's directive on the organisation of civil defence.  Its purpose was to legalise the distribution of weapons to the militiamen on the one hand and to legitimise the massacres of the civilian population on the other.  As part of the "civil defence programme", the interim government, by ministerial decision, appointed several military officers to lead the
"self-defence committees" established in each préfecture.  Some of these officers took an active part in the massacres, including Col. Alphonse Nteziryayo in Butare, who subsequently replaced Sylvain Nsabimana as Butare préfet when the interim government yet again deemed authorities in Butare insufficiently aggressive in the campaign of violence against the Tutsi.

31.23  Among the newly appointed regional leaders of the civil defence was Major Damascene Ukulikiyeyezu, designated for Gitarama préfecture.  When the interim government appointed several new sous-préfets for Gitarama, interim government minister for youth and sports Callixte Nzabonimana, originally from Gitarama, and the new appointees supported Maj. Damascene Ukulikiyeyezu, then operating as de facto préfet in Gitarama, in directing the resources of the préfecture towards the ends of the "civil defence":  Extermination of the Tutsi in Gitarama.  The interim government deposed the former préfet of Gitarama in early June 1994, after which he went into hiding, one of the few deposed préfets that managed to escape the wrath of the interim government's campaign of violence.  Both Jean-Baptiste Habyalimana of Butare, and Godfroide Ruzindana, from Kibungo, were killed shortly after the interim government removed them.

31.24  Throughout April and May, the interim government met regularly in conseils des ministres to attend to the affairs of state, which at that time included war with the RPF and systematic attacks against Rwanda's domestic Tutsi population.  Cabinet meetings were held on or about 20, 25, 30 and 31 May 1994.

31.25  The interim government retreated to Gisenyi sometime after 5 June 1994.  The arrival of the interim government in Gisenyi provoked a fresh wave of killings of Tutsi civilians in Gisenyi.  A number of influential Tutsis that had managed to survive until then by hiding in the Meridién Hotel were forced to vacate the hotel and were eventually killed.

31.26  On several occasions on dates unknown in June 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, 
Edouald Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera participated in meetings with influential businessmen linked to the MRND political party and "Hutu Power".  The purpose of the meeting was to raise funds to buy weapons to be distributed to soldiers, Interahamwe and other militias.  At that time, all named accused knew or had reason to know that the Interahamwe and other militias were systematically attacking the civilian Tutsi population in Gisenyi and throughout Rwanda and that re-provisioning of militiamen would lead to further killings of civilians.

31.27  On or about 17 June 1994, the interim government convened a conseils des ministres whereupon it decided to request reinforcement for Gisenyi commandant de secteur, Lieutenant Col. Anatole Nsengiyumva for further attacks upon surviving Tutsi in the Bisesero hills in Kibuye préfecture.  The minister of the interior Edouard Karemera participated in the conseil des ministres and made the formal written request to Lieutenant Col. Nsengiyumva the following day.  Attacks against those Tutsi that had survived the major attacks in May and early June continued with reinforcements of Interahamwe from Gisenyi, Cyangugu and Kigali, causing many deaths.

31.28  During June and July 1994, the interim government assembled regularly in conseils des ministres and various other meetings to manage the affairs of state, which at that time included provisioning militias and the army for continued attacks against the Tutsi population.

31.29  All named accused, individually and severally, exercised effective control over the Interahamwe militias and the expanded corps of militiamen that were incorporated under the authority of the territorial administration and the "Hutu Power" affiliated political parties, including the MRND, in the civil defence programme.

31.30  All named accused were regularly apprised of the killings and the widespread violence against the Tutsi population committed by militiamen subject to their control.  Each Accused knew or had reason to know that crimes were about to be committed or had been committed by their subordinates.  The circuits of information that brought news of the widespread killings were the  same that provided structures of authority for effective control of the militiamen: The territorial administration and MRND and MDR-Power political parties.

31.31  Furthermore, the killings of Tutsi civilians and of political opponents or others deemed to be "accomplices of the enemy" were so widespread and were committed so openly that each Accused must have known, or ought to have been aware of the attacks.

31.32  All named accused had the material capacity to halt or prevent killings by militiamen, or to punish or sanction those that committed such acts, but failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such killings or to punish the perpetrators thereof.  Moreover, both practically and legally, the interim government exercised authority over the military.  Given the procedures established for decision-making and enforcement in the interim government, the MRND dominated policy-making for the interim government and retained substantial influence over high-level military officers, affording Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Edouard Karemera, through the ministries of defence and the interior, the means to  call upon the army, the gendarmerie and communal police to halt, prevent or punish militiamen that were committing attacks upon the civilian population, or failing that, making it incumbent upon them to denounce the killings and those that committed them.  The Accused did neither.  

Furthermore, the Accused, (i) employed structures of authority in the territorial administration to dispose of  he corpses of victims of the killings expeditiously, attempting to conceal such crimes from international media scrutiny; (ii) used their control of the mass media to mischaracterise the killings, all the while encouraging or tacitly abetting the killings, and (iii) dispatched emissaries of the interim government, or themselves undertook missions abroad, to purchase weapons and provisions for the army and the militias and to misinform the world and legitimise the interim government, and its crimes, in international forums.

	31.32  All named accused had the material capacity to halt or prevent killings by militiamen, or to punish or sanction those that committed such acts, but failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such killings or to punish the perpetrators thereof.  Moreover, both practically and legally, the interim government exercised authority over the military.  Given the procedures established for decision-making and enforcement in the Interim Government, the MRND dominated policy making for the Interim Government and retained substantial influence over high-level military officers, affording Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera, through the Ministries of Defence and the Interior, the means to call upon the army, the gendarmerie, and the communal police to halt, prevent or punish militiamen that were committing attacks upon the civilian population, or failing that, making it incumbent upon them to denounce the killings and those that committed them.  The accused did neither.  Furthermore the accused (i) employed structures of authority in the territorial administration to dispose of the corpses of victims of the killings expeditiously, attempting to conceal such crimes from international media scrutiny; (ii) used their control of the mass media to mischaracterise killings all the while encouraging or tacitly abetting the killings, and (iii) dispatched emissaries of the Interim Government or themselves undertook missions abroad to purchase weapons and provisions for the army and the militias and to misinform the world and legitimise the Interim Government and its crimes in international forums.

32.  In furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi population throughout Rwanda, Mathieu Ngirumpatse planned, prepared, ordered and aided and abetted attacks against the Tutsi population in Kigali-ville, Cyangugu and Kibuye préfectures. 

32.1.  On or about the 1st of January 1993, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, André Ntagerura, Casimir Bizimungu and Yusuf Munyakazi, among others, participated in a meeting in Nyakabuye commune in Cyangugu préfecture where Mathieu Ngirumpatse officially propounded the new ideology of the Interahamwe, which gave "the green light to combat with arms the Tutsi enemy wherever he was found".

32.2.  On or about the 5th of July 1993, Mathieu Ngirumpatse travelled to Cyangugu and gave money to Yusuf Munyakazi to purchase guns and boots for the Interahamwe there.  Around two weeks later Mathieu Ngirumpatse returned to Yusuf Munyakazi's Cyangugu home and inspected the guns and boots and promised to provide monthly payments to the Interahamwe. 

32.3  Sometime in July 1993, Mathieu Ngirumpatse participated in a meeting in Karengera commune,Cyangugu préfecture, along with André Ntagerura, Yusuf Munyakazi, army lieutenant Ndamukize, and the bourgmestre of Karengera, among others, where he told a group of approximately 70 new Interahamwe recruits that they were being prepared to combat the "Tutsi enemy", who should be "encircled and exterminated" if the Arusha Accords were signed. 

32.4.  On or about 15th of April 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse contacted Yusuf Munyakazi by telephone and ordered him to send reinforcements to Kibuye.  Immediately thereafter, Yusuf Munyakazi gathered together a large number of Interahamwe militiamen, soldiers and armed Burundi refugees and travelled to Bisesero aboard ONATRACOM buses, where they launched attacks against the Tutsi population.  The attacks continued the next day with additional reinforcements in men, guns, grenades and munitions. 

32.5.  Sometime in early June 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse returned to Cyangugu préfecture with an Interim Government delegation and addressed a gathering at the MRND palace, where he asked the population to search for the Tutsi survivors and exterminate them. 

33.  In furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi population throughout Rwanda, Joseph Nzirorera undertook specific initiatives in Ruhengeri, his préfecture of origin.  Even prior to January 1994, and continuing through to late June 1994, Joseph Nzirorera made regular weekend trips to Mukingo and Nkuli communes to plan, prepare and organise the killing of the Tutsi population. 

33.1.  To this end Joseph Nzirorera held meetings in Ruhengeri with local and regional civilian and military authorities, including Casimir Bizimungu, president of the MRND in Ruhengeri, Col. Augustin Bizimungu, commandant de secteur in Ruhengeri, Juvenal Kajelijeli, intermittently bourgmestre at Mukingo commune, Esdras Baheza, a businessman in Mukingo, among others. 

33.2.  The meetings usually took place at the Busugo secteur residence of Joseph Nzirorera's mother or at Joseph Nzirorera's Mukingo commune residence.  Meetings were also held at the ISIMBI building in Busugo secteur, the local headquarters of the Interahamwe, and at the residences of other MRND leaders.  During those meetings Joseph Nzirorera and others present agreed to combat the RPF and to oppose the Arusha Accords by exterminating the Tutsi population. 

33.3.  During those meetings Joseph Nzirorera and others agreed to provide financial support, weapons, uniforms, provisions, and logistical and administrative support for the creation, military training, indoctrination and organisation of Interahamwe militias. 

33.4.  From mid-1993 onwards, Joseph Nzirorera also participated in the formation of the AMAHINDURE, a related group of militiamen in Nkuli and Mukingo communes within the broader category of the Interahamwe.  Juvenal Kajelijeli became responsible for recruiting, training and organising the AMAHINDURE, who were regarded as owing personal loyalty to, and operating under the control of, Joseph Nzirorera and Juvenal Kajelijeli. 

33.5.  Prior to April 1994 the AMAHINDURE (Volcanic Lava Force) was composed of approximately 80 young men.  All members were of Tutsi racial or ethnic identity.  The AMAHINDURE wore Interahamwe kitenge uniforms, provided by Joseph Nzirorera, and received military training and firearms from FAR officers from the nearby Mukamira military camp.  Joseph Nzirorera regularly supervised the military training of the AMAHINDURE and addressed the recruits in various meetings and gatherings, at which time he explained that their mission was to exterminate all Tutsi throughout Ruhengeri préfecture and to combat the RPF. 

33.6.  After 6 April 1994 the AMAHINDURE expanded in number to almost 700 members.  During April, May and June of 1994, Joseph Nzirorera continued to provide materiel and logistical support, including military training, weapons, provisions and indoctrination to AMAHINDURE and Interahamwe militiamen in Mukingo and Nkuli communes.  Joseph Nzirorera addressed the expanded corps of militiamen during numerous meetings, gatherings and rallies, at which times he instigated them to exterminate the Tutsi population. 

33.7 Joseph Nzirorera participated in decisions taken at a meeting at his mother's Busugo secteur residence on the evening of 6 April 1994 or the morning of 7 April 1994, or both.  Other participants at one or the other of those meetings were Casimir Bizimungu, Augustin Bizimungu, and Juvenal Kajelijeli.  During the meeting that took place on or about the early morning of 7 April 1994 Joseph Nzirorera agreed with the other participants and ordered that Interahamwe militias and local recruited armed civilians should attack and kill the Tutsi population in Mukingo and Nkuli communes. 

33.8.  Some time thereafter, Juvenal Kajelijeli circulated about Mukingo and Nkuli communes and ordered and instigated Interahamwe militias and armed civilians, including his own band of AMAHINDURE, to attack and kill the Tutsi population, killing hundreds of unarmed Tutsi men, women, children and elderly persons and burning their homesteads.  Nyabuhu, a Tutsi woman, and the daughter she bore for Joseph Nzirorera, were among the first victims that were killed that morning, as he had previously instructed. 

33.9.  During the course of 7 April 1994 Juvenal Kajelijeli, among others, executed the decisions taken with Joseph Nzirorera, Casimir Bizimungu and Augustin Bizimungu earlier that morning by ordering and commanding members of the Interahamwe and other militiamen and armed civilians to attack and kill persons sheltered in the Busogo parish church. 

33.10.  Following those generalised attacks on the Tutsi in Ruhengeri of 7 April 1994, 
Joseph Nzirorera made regular telephone calls to the Mukingo bureau communal for updates on the progress of the killings and to order further attacks against the Tutsi population.  On or about 9 April 1994 Joseph Nzirorera telephoned the sous-préfecture office in Busugo to find out if any Tutsi were hiding there.  A few days later a group of Interahamwe armed with firearms attacked the sous-préfecture office and killed over 40 persons. 

33.11.  On or about the 14th of April 1994 gendarmes and Interahamwe militiamen attacked displaced Tutsi civilians that were sheltered in the Court of Appeals building in Kigombe commune, killing over 80 Tutsi, men, women and children.  Joseph Nzirorera, along with the commandant de secteur, Col. Augustin Bizimungu and other regional authorities, were responsible for ordering the attack and knew or had reason to know of the attack and that the perpetrators were persons over whom they exercised effective control.  Subsequent to the killings, Joseph Nzirorera participated in public gatherings with Interahamwe militiamen and local and regional civilian and military authorities in Ruhengeri, many of who were known to have authorised or participated in the attack.  On those occasions, Joseph Nzirorera praised militiamen for the killings of opportunity throughout the préfecture. 

33.12.  Furthermore, sometime thereafter, on or about 16 April 1994 when Col. Augustin Bizimungu was appointed army chief of staff, Joseph Nzirorera travelled to Ruhengeri to congratulate Col. Augustin Bizimungu personally on his appointment.  This visit was one of the many trips that Joseph Nzirorera made to Ruhengeri.  He regularly visited Mukingo commune on the weekends in order to assess the situation and to monitor and supervise the military training of the Interahamwe militiamen.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think we will take a break and come back so that he can catch his breath and the translators can also have a drink of water.  So we will adjourn and come back in ten minutes, please. 
	(Court recessed from 1717H to 1728H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could we now continue with the reading of the indictment, please?  You were on 34. 
MR. KOUAMBO:
34.  In furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi population throughout Rwanda, Édouard Karemera planned, prepared, ordered and aided and abetted attacks against the Tutsi population in Kibuye préfecture. 

34.1.  Toward the end of April 1994 Édouard Karemera arrived in Mwendo commune, Kibuye préfecture, and addressed local administrative authorities and a small crowd that gathered to greet him, whereupon he explained that Tutsis in Bisesero area were attacking Hutus and "... now that [they had] finished Tutsis of this area and the problem is there in Bisesero ..." that they should go to Bisesero to help Hutus there to kill Tutsis. 

34.2.  Sometime mid-May 1994, on or about 13 May 1994, national and regional political authorities from Kibuye that were known to collaborate with Édouard Karemera, and who were present for Édouard Karemera's address during the meeting at the Kibuye préfecture office on 3rd May 1994, arrived in Bisesero.  Among them were Minister of Information Eliezer Niyitegeka, Kibuye préfet Clement Kayishema, businessman Obed Ruzindana, among other authorities, including several bourgmestres and conseillers, accompanied by Interahamwe militiamen, soldiers and gendarmes.  These same authorities ordered, instigated and directed large-scale attacks against Tutsi civilians in Bisesero over the course of several days.  Militiamen and soldiers taking orders from such authorities surrounded, searched out and combed the hills to kill Tutsis with firearms, machetes and clubs. 

34.3.  Attacks against the Tutsi of Bisesero continued through late June 1994, particularly after 17 June 1994, when Minister of Interior Édouard Karemera, on behalf of the Interim Government, requested military authorities to send reinforcements from Gisenyi to eliminate any surviving Tutsis in Bisesero.  The requested "ratissage" (mopping up operation) was intended to destroy the Tutsi of Kibuye completely and to conceal the crimes of preceding months that would be revealed by the accounts of survivors. 

35.  In furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi population throughout Rwanda, André Rwamakuba planned, prepared, ordered, and aided and abetted attacks against the Tutsi population in his commune of origin in Gikomero.  André Rwamakuba also ordered and instigated killings of Tutsi patients and displaced persons sheltered at Butare University Hospital. 

35.1.  On a date unknown between 6 and 12th April 1994, André Rwamakuba delivered bags of machetes to the home of André Muhire near Ndatemwa trading centre in Gasabo secteur in Gikomero, his home commune in Kigali-rural préfecture, knowing and intending that they would be used in attacks against the local Tutsi population.  On that occasion André Rwamakuba held a meeting with several influential local members of the MDR-Hutu Power political party.  Several days later André Muhire distributed the machetes to local residents, who then used them to attack and kill the Tutsi population. 

35.2.  On a date unknown between 6 - 12 April 1994, André Rwamakuba went to Gikomero commune.  On that occasion he instigated a crowd gathered near the Gikomero bureau communal to commence or to participate in killing the Tutsi population and ordered those assembled to kill several persons among them that were believed to be Tutsi.  Thereupon members of the crowd armed with firearms, machetes and clubs seized two young men that André Rwamakuba had indicated and led them away to a forested area and killed them as he looked on. 

35.3.  On a date unknown between 8 April and 30 April 1994 André Rwamakuba was appointed spokesman for the Interim Government and in that capacity delivered radio addresses and communiques on Radio Rwanda and RTLM encouraging the Interahamwe to continue the hunt for Tutsis.  Furthermore, André Rwamakuba regularly returned to Kigali to assess the situation and the activities of the Interahamwe.  Throughout May and June 1994 André Rwamakuba made regular radio broadcasts where he appealed to Interahamwe militiamen to continue to hunt down the Tutsis wherever they were hiding and to exterminate them. 

35.4.  On a date unknown between 18 and 25 April 1994, André Rwamakuba, along with another 
Dr. Geoffroy Gatera, ordered and instigated the killing of Tutsi displaced persons and patients at Butare University Hospital.  On one occasion he instructed that several Tutsi patients be handed over to crippled FAR soldiers manning a roadblock near the École des Sous-Officiers so that those soldiers would kill them there and feel like they were participating in the war.  On another occasion André Rwamakuba referred to lists of Tutsi displaced persons at the hospital and checked the identity cards of patients and displaced persons and directed that persons identified as Tutsi be taken away in a vehicle that was commanded by Interahamwe militiamen armed with clubs and machetes. 

35.5.  On several occasions during that same period André Rwamakuba directly participated in killing several persons that were identified as Tutsi at the hospital, in one case striking a man with an axe across the head while he was lying on a hospital bed, causing his death. 

35.6.  On or about 28 April 1994 André Rwamakuba announced on Radio Rwanda that "security had been restored in Butare because the Inyenzi had been suppressed", referring to massacres of Tutsi residents that had taken place after the sensitisation campaign led by an Interim Government delegation in which he participated only days previously, on or about 25 April 1994. 

35.7 killings of Tutsi at the hospital continued and intensified through late May 1994, particularly after a meeting at the faculty of medicine held on or about 15 May 1994 when Prime Minister 
	Jean Kambanda addressed university authorities, encouraging them to "continue the fight until ultimate victory". 

35.  By the time the Interim Government fled Rwanda in mid-July 1994, hundreds of thousands of unarmed men, women and children had been killed as a direct result of policies initiated and authorised by the MRND and affiliated "Hutu Power" political parties and executed through the instrumentalities of the state.  Cumulatively the acts and omissions of André Rwamakuba, 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera furthered the objectives of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi as a group and to exterminate the political opponents of "Hutu Power".  This joint criminal enterprise was the means by which all named accused and other persons that favoured, or sought to benefit from, the political regime of the MRND party-state attempted to combat the RPF and to perpetuate "Hutu Power" in Rwanda. 

37.  All named accused knew or had reason to know about the widespread attacks upon the Tutsi population and abetted the killings of Tutsi civilians by refraining from taking reasonable or practicable measures to criticise, publicly condemn or discourage the perpetrators of such attacks when they had the capacity and opportunity to do so, and instead undertook to conceal, mischaracterise or condone the killings.  Furthermore, the accused knew that perpetrators of the attacks were their subordinates or persons over whom they exercised effective control measures and nevertheless failed to take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such crimes or to punish the perpetrators thereof. 

38.  The generalised attacks upon the Tutsi population targeted Tutsi women, in particular.  Sexual violence against Tutsi women, particularly rape and sexual torture, was often a prelude to killing them or the means by which death was inflicted upon them.  Such serious bodily or mental harm inflicted upon Tutsi women was intended to destroy the capacity of persons of Tutsi ethnic or racial identity to sustain themselves physically or psychologically as a group or to reproduce themselves as a group.  Furthermore, given the historical antecedents and general context of the war, and the incitements and instigations of the accused therein, the acts and omissions of all named accused in furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi as a group had as its natural and foreseeable consequence attacks of a sexual nature against Tutsi women in particular, including rape and sexual torture. 

39.  All named accused instigated, ordered, participated in (committed) and otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation or execution of these attacks against the civilian Tutsi population as a strategy of war against the RPF and as acts of reprisal in warfare against the RPF.  The physical or moral destruction of the Tutsi as a group was central to the Interim Government's strategy to combat and defeat the RPF militarily and politically.  The accused intended to commit violence against the lives of protected persons, particularly Tutsis, and instigated killings of protected persons by participating in, and authorising or supporting, by action or omission, the Interim Government decisions, directives, orders, policies, and incitements directed toward military and civilian authorities that characterised the Tutsi, without distinction, as "the enemy" or as "accomplices of the RPF" or aided and abetted such characterisations. 

40.  The massive slaughter of the Tutsi population and of political opponents of the Interim Government and the campaign of pillage, persecutions, sexual violence and mayhem against the Tutsi population were perpetuated by soldiers, militias, the communal police, territorial administrative personnel and ordinary citizens that were armed, trained, indoctrinated, organised, commanded and instigated by all named accused, acting in concert with a common plan or strategy and with a common purpose.

Count 4:  Complicity in Genocide

The Prosecutor charges Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and André Rwamakuba with complicity in genocide pursuant to Articles 2 and 6(i) of the Statute of the Tribunal in that during the period of 1st of January to 17th of July 1994 all named accused instigated or provided the means to other persons to kill or cause serious bodily or mental harm to members of the Tutsi population, or to deliberately inflict conditions of life upon the Tutsi population that were calculated to bring about its physical destruction, knowing that those other persons intended to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi racial or ethnic group, committed as follows: 

41.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 22 through 39, above, are reiterated and incorporated herein by reference as a concise statement of facts to support the charges under this specific count of the indictment. 

42.  Throughout April, May and June 1994, all named accused authorised structures of authority that they controlled in the MRND and MDR-"Hutu Power" political parties, and the government ministers attributed to those political parties, to be used for recruitment of, and arms distributions to, Interahamwe and other militias that were incorporated in a "civil defence" programme organised by the FAR military officers.  The architects or managers of the "civil defence" programme, including though not limited to Col. Theoneste Bagosora, Col. Anatole Nsengiyumva, Col. Augustin Bizimungu, 
	Col. Tharcisse Renzaho, Col. Aloys Simba, Col. Alphonse Nteziryayo, and Maj. Damascene Ukulikiyeyezu intended to deploy militiamen incorporated under their command as civil defence corps to attack, harm and destroy the Tutsi as a group, which was known to all named accused when they provided assistance to these military officers, as set forth in preceding paragraphs 22 through 39, above. 

43.  Furthermore, all named accused enlisted structures of authority in the MRND and MDR-"Hutu Power" political parties and participated individually, in public appeals to militiamen and armed civilians to "combat the enemy" knowing that the militias incorporated in "civil defence" campaign targeted all Tutsis as "the enemy" and intended to attack, harm and destroy the Tutsi as a group, as set forth in preceding paragraphs 22 through 39, above. 

Count 5:  Rape as a Crime against Humanity 

The Prosecutor charges Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, and 
	André Rwamakuba with rape as a crime against humanity pursuant to Articles 3, 6(i) and 6(iii) of the Statute of the Tribunal in that on or between the dates of 6th of April and 17th of July 1994, throughout the territory of Rwanda, all named accused were responsible for raping persons or causing persons to be raped, as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population on political, ethnic, or racial grounds. 

44.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 39, above, are reiterated and incorporated herein by reference as a concise statement of facts to support the charges under this specific count of the indictment. 

45.  During the course of April through July 1994 Interahamwe and other militiamen raped thousands of Tutsi women during the course of widespread or systematic attacks against Rwanda's civilian Tutsi population and against persons deemed to be politically opposed to "Hutu Power". 

46.  Notably, sexual violence, including rape, was incorporated in attacks against the civilian opportunity population of Mukingo commune in Ruhengeri during early-mid April 1994.  These attacks were the natural and foreseeable consequence of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi as a group undertaken in Ruhengeri by Joseph Nzirorera, Juvenal Kajelijeli, Augustin Bizimungu and Casimir Bizimungu, among others, when they planned, prepared, ordered and instigated genocidal violence against the Tutsi population during April, May, June and July 1994. 

47.  Sexual violence, including rape, was incorporated in widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian Tutsi population in Kigali-ville préfecture during April 1994, in Gikomero commune and Butare préfecture during mid-late April 1994, and in Kibuye and Gisenyi préfectures during May and June 1994 and in Gitarama préfecture during April and May 1994.  These attacks were the natural and foreseeable consequences of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi as a group undertaken in those areas by Joseph Nzirorera, Édouard Karemera, André Rwamakuba and 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse, among others, in planning, preparing, ordering and instigating genocidal violence against Rwanda's Tutsi population. 

48.  Rape and sexual violence against Tutsi women during April to June 1994 were so widespread and so systematically incorporated in the campaign to destroy the Tutsi as a group that each accused must have known about such attacks, or ought to have been aware of the sexualised and gendered nature of the attack.  The rapes were almost always aggregated by the manner or circumstances of the rape; there was widespread gang rape and widespread rape of virgin girls.  In some instances, mothers were forced to witness the rape of their daughters; in other instances the rape victim witnessed the killing of her children by the rapist or rapists' accomplices.  Many women were raped with objects, especially sharpened sticks or bottles.  Rape with violence, verbal abuse and spitting were common.  There was oral rape, anal rape and vaginal rape.  Tutsi women and young girls who were held in sexual slavery were abducted and detained for varying durations of a few days up to two years.  The perpetrators of rape and sexual violence against Tutsi women were the same persons, or the same groups or classes of persons, that committed the killings of Tutsi and political opponents, and were subject to the effective control of all named accused through structures of authority in the territorial administration and the MRND and MDR opinion power political parties.  All named accused had the material capacity to halt or prevent rape and sexual violence against Tutsi women by militiamen, or to punish or sanction those that committed such acts, and failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish the perpetrators thereof. 

Count 6:  Extermination as a Crime against Humanity: 

The Prosecutor charges Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and 
	André Rwamakuba with extermination as a crime against humanity pursuant to Articles 3, 6(i) and 
	6(iii) of the Statute of the Tribunal in that on or about the dates of 6 April and 17 July 1994 throughout the territory of Rwanda all named accused were responsible for killings persons, or causing persons to be killed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population or on political, ethnic or racial grounds.

	1650H
	49.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 39, above, are reiterated and incorporated herein by reference as a concise statement of facts to support the charges under this specific count of the indictment.

50.  Between 6 April 1994 and 17 July 1994, throughout Rwanda there were widespread or systematic attacks against a civilian population based on Tutsi ethnic or racial identification or political opposition to the MRND and Hutu-Power political parties.  All named accused, individually and severally, and acting in concert, planned, ordered, organised and facilitated killings of person perceived to be Tutsi or deemed to be political opponents to Hutu Power, or knew that such killings were about to be committed or had been committed by persons, over whom they exercised effective control and failed to take the necessary and reasonable measure to halt or prevent such crimes or to punish the perpetrators thereof.

51.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse is responsible for killing numerous persons that were tracked, identified and killed at roadblocks or in their homes or in places of public shelter in Kigali-ville during the period 
6th to 12th April 1994 by virtue of his acts and omissions in planning, instigating, ordering, preparation and execution of widespread and systematic attacks against the Tutsi population throughout Rwanda during the period January to late June 1994.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse is also responsible for the deaths of numerous persons that were killed in Bisesero when militiamen from Cyangugu and elsewhere were transported to Kibuye upon his orders to reinforce the attacks against Tutsi civilians, particularly during mid-April 1994.

51.1  The identities of the victims and the proximate number of fatalities and the exact circumstances of each killing cannot be detailed exhaustively due to the overwhelming devastation of the attacks and the systemic efforts of the perpetrators and the civilian and military authorities in Kigali during the period 6th to 12th April 1994 to conceal their crimes and to dispose of the corpses at or near the roadblocks in Kigali.

51.2  The killings in Bisesero continued systematically over several weeks, particularly in mid-April and mid-May 1994.  The identities of the victims and the approximate number of fatalities and the exact circumstances of each killing cannot be detailed exhaustively due to the overwhelming devastation of the attacks.

52.  Joseph Nzirorera is responsible for killing numerous persons resident in Busogo secteur, Mukingo commune, and hundreds of persons sheltered in the Busogo parish church and for killing numerous persons resident in Nkuli commune on or about the morning and afternoon of 7 April 1994.  He is also responsible for killings at the Court of Appeals building in Kigombe commune on 14 April 1994.  This is by virtue of his acts and omissions in planning, ordering, instigating, participating in, or otherwise aiding and abetting the planning, preparation and execution of widespread or systematic attacks against Tutsi population in Ruhengeri during the period January to June 1994.

52.1  Victims of those attacks include: approximately 12 families, almost 80 Tutsi men and women, including the Ziragwira and Seruyombo families, residing in Kinyababa cellule, Gitwa secteur, Nkuli commune that were killed by militias that were armed by Joseph Nzirorera on 7 April 1994; Rukara, a Tutsi man, killed by militiamen responding to orders from Juvénal Kajelijeli in Byangabo business district almost immediately following his communication with Joseph Nzirorera on the morning of 
7th April 1994; several whole families of Tutsis that took shelter at the Munyemvano family compound in Manjari II cellule in Rwinzovu secteur, Mukingo commune that were killed during attacks commanded by Juvénal Kajelijeli on the morning and afternoon of 7 April 1994; over 300 Tutsi men, women and children that were sheltered at the Busogo parish church that were killed in attacks by militiamen commanded by Juvénal Kajelijeli on the morning of 7 April 1994, following his communication with Joseph Nzirorera; and numerous Tutsi persons, including children of mixed Tutsi and Hutu marriages, killed during attacks in Gitwa secteur on 8th and 9th April 1994 by militiamen determined to eliminate all traces of Tutsi racial or ethnic identification in Ruhengeri, among them a certain Tutsi woman called Nyirabusoro, married to a Hutu called Mvuka, and her five children, and Ndagijimana and his sister, Nyirabujobwa; and approximately 80 Tutsi men, women and children that were killed by militiamen and soldiers at the Court of Appeals building in Kigombe commune on 14 April 1994, among many unnamed others killed during attacks by militiamen armed and commanded by Juvénal Kajelijeli and Joseph Nzirorera.

52.2  The attacks against the Busogo parish church and the Court of Appeals were in the nature of a mass killing event.  The killings in Gitwa secteur, Nkuli commune and Rwinzovu secteur, Mukingo commune on the morning and afternoon of 7 April 1994, where entire groups of families were attacked and killed en masse, and the individual killings of Tutsi men and women that were tracked in their homes and neighbourhoods in Rwankeli cellule and Busogo cellule in Busogo secteur  were the product of a systematic plan of extermination in which the personality of the victims was submerged in their identification as a group.  

53.  Edouard Karemera is responsible for killing numerous persons resident or taking refuge on the Bisesero hills during April, May and June 1994 by virtue of his acts and omissions in planning, instigating, ordering, participating in, or otherwise aiding and abetting the planning, preparation and execution of attacks against the Tutsi population in Kibuye préfecture during the period 1 January to 30 June 1994, particularly persons killed as part of the operation of "ratissage" ordered by the interim government after cabinet meeting of the 17th June 1994.

53.1  Victims of those attacked include:  Tutsi civilians in Bisesero killed in April and May 1994, including at least six members of the Seromba family in Muyira hill and other areas of Bisesero that were attacked by militias; Tutsi civilians in Bisesero killed by Hutu civilians upon instructions from national and regional government authorities in late April or early May 1994; and Tutsi civilians in the Jurwe cellule of Bisesero secteur killed in mid-May 1994, including Kageruka, Mukantwari, Buhigira, and the son of Nzaramba, who were shot dead by soldiers taking orders from national and regional government authorities known to have collaborated with Edouard Karemera or who were subject to his effective control.  The aforementioned victims represent only a small fraction of victims of the attacks against Tutsi civilians resulting from orders, instigations, co-perpetrations and dereliction of duty by Edouard Karemera.  The identities of the victims and the proximate number of the fatalities, as well as the exact circumstances of each killing, cannot be detailed exhaustively due to the overwhelming devastation of the attacks and the systematic efforts of the perpetrators and the civilian and military authorities to conceal their crimes and to dispose of the corpses.

54.  André Rwamakuba is responsible for killing numerous persons resident in Gikomero commune and numerous persons sheltered at the Butare University Hospital during the period from 19 through 30 April 1994 by virtue of his acts and omissions in planning, instigating, ordering, participating in, [committing], or otherwise aiding and abetting the planning, preparation and execution of widespread or systematic attacks against the Tutsi population in Kigali-rural and Butare préfectures, specifically in Gikomero commune in Kigali-rural and at the Butare University Hospital during the period 1 January to 30 June 1994.

54.1  Victims of those attacks include: two men identified as Tutsi among a crowd that gathered in André Rwamakuba's residence in Gikomero commune on or about 9 or 10 April; a man identified as Tutsi that was a patient at Butare University Hospital, whom André Rwamakuba struck upon the head with an axe sometime in mid-April; numerous persons that were forcibly removed from Butare University Hospital by militiamen responding to André Rwamakuba's instructions in mid-April; numerous persons that were killed by militiamen upon the premises of the Butare University Hospital in mid-late April at André Rwamakuba's behest or in his presence; among numerous other persons that were killed as a result of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi as a group undertaken by all named accused during April-June 1994, including André Rwamakuba.

COUNT 7:  Serious Violations of Article 3 Common to the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II thereof:  Killing and causing violence to health and physical or mental well-being.

The Prosecutor charges Edouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and André Rwamakuba with killing and causing violence to health and physical or mental well-being as a Serious Violation of Article 3 Common to the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II pursuant to Articles 4, 6(1) and 6(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal in that on or between the dates of 6 April and 
17 July 1994, throughout the territory of Rwanda, all named accused were responsible for killing, seriously harming, raping, and/or otherwise treating in a cruel manner persons taking no active part in the hostilities in the context of an armed conflict not of an international nature.

55.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 39 and 50 through 54.1, above, are reiterated and incorporated herein by reference as a concise statement of facts to support the charges under this specific count of the indictment.

56.  Between 1 January 1994 and 17 July 1994, there existed in Rwanda a state of non-international armed conflict within the meaning of Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.

57.  Between 6 April 1994 and 17 July 1994 the belligerents in the non-international armed conflict were the FAR and the RPF.  The parties to that conflict were bound by the rules contained in Article 3 Common to the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II.

58.  The FAR trained and armed the Interahamwe with assistance from, and with the complicity of, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Edouard Karemera, particularly insofar as structures of authority in the MRND political party were deployed to recruit, indoctrinate and exercise control over militiamen.  From its inception the interim government of 8 April 1994, including André Rwamakuba, endorsed a programme of "civil defence" through which civilian authorities in the territorial administration and the MRND and MDR-Power political parties, and military authorities in the FAR, organised through the ministries of interior and defence, respectively, incorporated Interahamwe and other militias in structures of authority over which it exercised effective control to support the FAR in its war efforts against the RPF.

59.  The victims referred to under this count of the indictment were persons taking no active or direct part in the hostilities, or persons who had ceased to take part in the hostilities, and were thus persons protected by the terms of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and Protocol II.  

60.  Whilst an end in itself, the campaign of destruction perpetrated against the Tutsi population of Rwanda was also closely related to the armed conflict.  All named accused used the environment and the context of the non-international and structures of authority in the MRND and the MDR-Power political parties, and the physical and logistical resources of the military, to achieve the criminal goal of destroying the Tutsi as a group, particularly the killing and raping of Tutsi civilians, the pillaging of goods belonging to Tutsis and the destruction of Tutsi homesteads.

61.  During April to July 1994 interim government authorities, including leaders of the MRND and affiliated "Hutu-Power" political parties, particularly all named accused, ordered or instigated killings of Tutsi civilians and political opponents as a means to eliminate possible support for the RPF from within the country as a bargaining chip to force the RPF to agree to its terms for a cease-fire, and as acts of reprisals and vengeance for RPF advances on the battlefield.  Consequently, the killings were intended to advance the war, or were closely related to the war, and were also the means by which the accused attempted and intended to destroy the Tutsi as a group.

62.  On the basis of the foregoing, Mathieu Ngirumpatse is responsible for killings of protected persons in Kigali-ville during 6 April to 12 April 1994, and in Bisesero in Kibuye préfecture in mid-April 1994 as detailed in paragraphs 51 through 51.2, above.

63.  On the basis of the foregoing, Joseph Nzirorera is responsible for the killings of protected persons in Ruhengeri préfecture, particularly in Nkuli and Mukingo communes during the course of 7 April 1994, as detailed in paragraphs 52 through 52.2, above.

64.  On the basis of the foregoing Edouard Karemera is responsible for the killings of protected persons in Kibuye préfecture, particularly in Bisesero, during May and June 1994, as detailed in paragraphs 53 and 53.1, above. 

65.  On the basis of the foregoing André Rwamakuba is responsible for the killings of protected persons in Butare University Hospital during mid-late April 1994, as detailed in paragraphs 54 and 54.1 above.

66.  All named accused are held responsible for the killings of protected persons committed by their named and unnamed co-perpetrators, including, individually and severally, each co-accused charged by the present indictment, insofar as such killings were committed pursuant to a common plan, strategy or design, or were the natural and foreseeable consequence of such joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi as a group.

The acts and omissions of Edouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, and 
André Rwamakuba detailed herein are punishable in reference to Articles 22 and 23 of the Statute of the Tribunal.
Dated: Arusha, this 18th day of February 2004.
Hassan Bubacar Jallow
Prosecutor.

I would like to reiterate that senior counsel O'Donnell will preside over an informal meeting with the Defence and Prosecution to look into the problems of disclosure and other matters concerning the progress of the trial.  He will give you the date later on.  You will have to confer with him.  

Are there any other matters?

Yes.  Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Your Honour.  I do have a few other matters I would like to raise with the Court at this time.  I want to first just express what is already in the Rule, which is that we have the intention of filing preliminary motions, and we will file them within 30 days from today.  And I would just also want to express that we believe that any irregularities or defects in the indictment or the procedure about the confirmation of the indictment has not been waived by the entry of not guilty pleas, and we will raise all of those issues in our preliminary motions.
Next, I would like to request some consequential order from Your Honour, and the first is pursuant to Rule 73 bis (B)(iv) that the Prosecutor be ordered to file a final witness list, including the paragraph numbers to which the testimony of each witness pertains.  This is something that is required at a 
pre-trial conference, and since I assume we are not going to have another pre-trial conference, I would ask that you -- for you to make that order.  
Next, I would like to move under Rule 73 bis (B)(v) that the Prosecutor be ordered to file a final exhibit list and to provide the Defence with copies of the exhibits he intends to offer at the trial.  

Next, I would like to make a motion that the Prosecutor be ordered to provide us with the order of witnesses in which they will be called for the next trial session, as well as any unredacted statements for witnesses in that trial session.  

I note that the Court has designated the trial to recommence on the 29th of March and so, 30 days prior to that would be approximately the 28th of February, which is this coming Saturday, so I would ask that the Court reminds the Prosecutor of its obligation under previous order modifying the protective orders that we receive all this information in 30 days in advance of the session.

I would like to also note that -- I have made an oral motion on the 27th of November 2003 to preclude reference to or reliance upon the extended form of a joint criminal enterprise liability.  And at this time I would like to withdraw that motion because I believe it is now moot because the Trial Chamber has approved the amended indictment.  

And finally, I had made a motion to suspend the trial proceedings pending resolution of the indictment.  I made that orally on the 19th of January 2004, and I renew that motion at this time.  

And I would like to observe that I don't believe that the date of March 29th allows enough time for the Trial Chamber to receive both our motions, the responses of the Prosecutors, a reply memorandum, and also to have any appeals of those preliminary motions adjudicated by the Appeals Chamber.  So I renew my motion to suspend the trial proceedings until the indictment is fully resolved, and I would ask the Trial Chamber to consider any in the interim whether it makes sense to have back on the 29th of March when I believe that we will not be ready to proceed, and that witnesses who may otherwise be brought from Rwanda will be unnecessarily brought to Arusha.  

So those are all the requests and comments that I have, and I thank you for the opportunity. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Robinson.  
Has the Prosecution anything to say?  Nothing.
MR. WEBSTER:
I was almost sure that Mr. Weyl was going to respond, so I was slow on my feet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, sorry.  I didn't see you.  Please, let us finish with the Defence.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl, I am sorry, I didn't see you.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, thank you.  Otherwise, I would have made my submissions after Mr. Webster, but I fully concur with my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, in repeating what I said at the outset, that as and when you have a new indictment, there is the normal procedure with preliminaries and the time limit involved.  

I should not like us to find ourselves in March in the same situation where we were on the 19th of January, and for the record, I should like to head one thing.  In the parallelism of forms as you handed down a decision on the 8th of October rejecting his motion, Mr. Webster made a request for certification.  The shepherd has answered the shepherd and I shall also file a request for a certificate to appeal.  Let there be no misunderstanding. 

Friday at 1840 we obtained the revised amendment.  It would appear that it was filed on the 23rd of January.  My motion was raised on the 20th of February in view of the normal time limit running.  Inasmuch as when my fax arrived, Court Management was closed.  I am convinced that what was true for the Prosecutor when we were served a notice of draft indictment and motion at 10 p.m. on Friday night will also hold for a Defence motion submitted at 1845, will also be submitted to you for due consideration so as to allow a certificate of appeal so that we can apply to the Court of Appeal to amend his indictment.  Thank you, Madam President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Now can we have submission from the Prosecutor?
MR. WEYL:
I am sorry, forgive me.  I should also like -- forgive me for having made the submission.

I should also like to recall the importance that we feel for the decision that will have to be rendered on the oral motion raised by Mr. Roach on the 19th of January as to the outcome of the proceedings on the initial indictment and subsequent indictment to annul all previous proceedings.  I am sure we will have a ruling on that application deliberately and properly considered and reasoned, unlike much of the proceedings that have been occurring so far. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

Prosecutor. 

MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I would like to begin by indicating to the parties and to the Court one or two additional items that I would like to correct on the record in terms of the text of the amended indictment.  

There are two paragraphs where I would like to make corrections.  I would be happy to submit an errata sheet which could be joined to today's transcripts to clarify matters.  One concerning paragraph 25.1 were in both the English and the French text.  There is a reference to the Kibuye bureau communal.  In both the French and the English, it should read "bureau préfectural", and I think that would be clear in the supporting materials to those paragraphs, that should come as no surprise to the Defence.  I am simply making this note now to put the parties on notice and to facilitate matters so that at a later time, should there be any dispute, it would be clear from the record of these proceedings that there is some acknowledgement on the part of the Prosecutor that paragraph 25.1 concerns the bureau préfectural of Kibuye.  The same goes for paragraph 31.16.  In that case, it is not an erratum in the English text; it is simply a correction in the translation.  Where in the French text it reads "bureau communal", but it should be "bureau préfectural", and that would become clear when we read the indictment as a whole, because in every other reference to the meeting of May 3rd, in Kibuye the reference is to the bureau préfectural, not the bureau communal.  

There is also -- in paragraph 33.10, which also is an errata, which means that in both the English and the French texts there would have to be a correction.  There is a reference to the commune de 
sous-préfecture of Busogo, it should be Bushango, which will also become clear in the witness statements that support that particular paragraph.  Instead of B-U-S-O-G-O, it should be 
B-U-S-E-N-G-O.  Busengo is quite different from Busogo; paragraph 33.10 refers to the 
sous-préfecture of Busengo.  

In paragraph 52, and this is a matter of translation, it has nothing to do with the original English text.  There is a reference to the colline of Nkuli, and it should be the commune - commune, 
C-O-M-M-U-N-E of Mukingo.  

In paragraph 53.1 in the French, there is reference to co entente il faudrait lire co perpétration, but I say this simply to bring it to the attention of the Court and the parties.  We will submit an errata sheet which will clarify matters for the record and where the French translation is concerned, it is language section itself that will revise the translation; it is not an issue of  lack of diligence of the Prosecutor, it is simply imprecision in the translation, and we will assist -- provide some assistance in the revision of the text because much of this has to do not with faulty translations but just unfamiliarity with the events and the intention of the Prosecutor in certain formulations.  So, that would be submitted at a later time simply for purposes of clarification.  

There are one or two others, I won't burden the Court and the parties with it now.  It will become clear in a written submission that I will make during the course of the week.  

In response to Mr. Robinson's applications, we would be happy to file a revised witness list and a revised exhibit list.  We can do that in the weeks ahead.  I am sure that during the informal meeting of the parties we will be able to agree on a date for that, unless the Court would wish to set one now.  

I would object, however, to his request for a submission on our part where we list paragraphs in the indictment for which each witness will testify.  That is not the formulation in the Rules.  If we look to Rule 73 bis paragraph (B)(iv), it states that: "The Judge will request -- "  Excuse me.  If we look at a pre-trial conference, the Trial Chamber or Judge designated from among the members may order the Prosecutor within a time limit set by the Trial Chamber or the said Judge and before the date of the trial to file the following:  (iv) is a list of witnesses the Prosecutor intends to call with and then
sub(c) is the points in the indictment on which each witness will testify.  

It is clear that if the framers of this Rule wanted the precision of having specific paragraphs 
identified -- we have indicated in paragraphs in those points.  It's been past practice in our office to simply indicate the charges of the counts in the indictment that each witness will support.  So at this point we would decline to provide the specific paragraph that each witness will testify on, but we will indicate whether it is genocide, extermination, rape or war crimes, et cetera.

	1830H 
MR. WEBSTER (continuing): 
	In terms of our disclosure obligations, I believe disclosure was fully -- we made a full compliance of the disclosure in anticipation of starting trial on the 19th of February.  We don't expect to start until the 29th of March.  I would presume that all our disclosure obligations have been met.  We would certainly look at those issues when we meet informally with the parties.  My understanding is that most, if not all, of the outstanding applications concern matters of translation, which is the responsibility of the registry, not the Prosecutor, and it is not within the regime of disclosure under Rule 66.  So my understanding is that we have fully complied with our obligations; it's just a question of translations of certain documents. 

In terms of Mr. Robinson's request for further delays, I'll state for the record that the Prosecutor is ready to proceed; the start date of the 29th of March seems very reasonable.  I would, however, join in expressing some caution that if procedures are going to be delayed on the 29th of March, it would be better for the parties to know that now and for the Court to take note of that as soon as possible because within several weeks witnesses will start to make their way towards Arusha.  They always arrive at least a week ahead of time.  And if there's going to be any disruption to the proceedings, we should know that as soon as possible, and if there are going to be any additional delays because of Defence applications, that's something that the Court should consider at this stage because once we get to mid-March, this Tribunal will start to spend great sums of money and the resources of its personnel to move and take care of witnesses that will be housed in the safe houses.  So I would hope that we could address that either today or during our informal meeting but, by all means, the issue of when we actually start taking testimony has to be resolved conclusively by mid-March because by the 29th of March we would have already expended considerable resources to start the trial rolling.  

Having said that, I conclude.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Prosecutor.  I would like to start with the submission -- the motion by 
	Mr. Weyl talking about the annulment.  We have already given a decision on the mistrial motion, and we issued that last week.  It's a pity that you don't have it here, but it should be with the -- I think the court management should make sure that these decisions are given to the Defence.  We've rendered a lot of decisions during the last week.  

As for the dates of the trial, we took all the 30 days in consideration before we arrived at the 29th but then you can have an informal meeting with Mr. O'Donnell and look at that.  We think that by the 29th we would have fulfilled the 30 days and we should be ready to start. 
For the Prosecutor, we are waiting for you to circulate the corrections that you spoke about, because actually we can only have a full indictment when those mistakes have been corrected.  And, of course, you are aware of your obligations under the Rules.  

We also know that the Defence, from today, you can start filing your motions, your preliminary motions under the Rules.  That is why we gave you 30 days.  We thought by then we would have gone through, and any other motions for certification, we take care of that.  So I think all of you are free now to file your motions.  Is there another point that I want to address?  So concerning the trial, we can't go over; we have already given the date for, the 29th.  We took that into consideration, but we will see how things go.  We are hoping that everybody will be true to his own obligation.  The Prosecutor will disclose, and you will file your motions in time.  If you file them in time, we will be able to go into everything before the 29th, but if you delay in filing the motions, that is when we will not be able to finish.  We are hoping there the Defence will cooperate in filing the motions in time and then the Prosecution should also fulfil its obligation of disclosure. 

Having said that, I want to thank all of you for being present, and in the absence of any other matter, I will call the proceedings - I'd like to bring the proceedings to an end.  And the Court is adjourned until the 29th of March, hopefully.
