P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MS. NTILATWA:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 29th May 2006, for continuation of trial in the matter of the                                   Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case number ICTR-98-44-T.  Please, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, madam registrar.  The appearances here are the same.  

Mr. Hometowu, can you con -- sorry, I notice a new addition.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, back in Arusha; I wish to present my respects to you and Your Honours, and wish you a very pleasant day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Welcome back to the trial. 

Mr. Hometowu, could you confirm that the appearances are the same at your location?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Good morning, Mr. President --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The composition is the same.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Maybe Mr. Hometowu could sit down and talk into the microphone.  I'm sorry, this is shocking.  Something about Madam Anta Guissé being among them. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Can you hear me well?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we get some assistance from the technicians, please?

Madam registrar, isn't there a telephone that works at the location?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Hometowu.  Can you hear me now?  

MR. HOMETOWU:
Good morning, Mr. President, we hear you well, but I don't know whether you can hear us.  Could you confirm, please, that we are getting through?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can hear you now, and I can see the chamber.  I can see you standing by a window, it looks like.  Is there a problem?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He is saying that there seems to be a little problem, Mr. President.  At their end, they have no problem.  Perhaps the technicians in Arusha should try and solve the problem, if there is any, says                    Mr. Hometowu.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you inform me, are you sitting around the table, are all of the appearances present?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President, all of the parties are present, and Madam Anta Guissé has replaced             Counsel Frédéric Weyl.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The picture that we are getting shows an empty table.  It is a still picture. 

Mr. Hometowu, I am now seeing you sitting at the table.  Can you hear me?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President, I hear you very well, very clearly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Now, I notice that the seat beside you is not occupied.  Is the witness in the room, in the chamber?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
The witness is right here.  It's because we wanted to settle all of the problems first and then call the witness forthwith. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will be continuing this morning.  I remind you that you remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  Mr. Robinson will continue his examination of you.

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning to members of the Trial Chamber. 
WITNESS T,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Witness T.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel Robinson. 
Q.	I wanted to ask you about --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could they please stop all of that background noise in (By order of the Court this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) -- wherever it is, sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We redact the name of the place.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, sorry.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, I wanted to ask you about some testimony we've  heard that about six months after the creation of the national committee of the Interahamwe, a parallel committee consisting of           numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9 started doing things which the officers of the national committee were not aware of.  So, first of, all can you tell me, do you have Exhibit P. 9 in front of you that would enable you to know the identities of numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9? 
A.	Yes, I have the document before me. 
Q.	Okay.  And is it true, then, that a parallel committee consisting of numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9 started doing things which the officers of the national committee were not aware of? 
A.	Counsel, I don't understand what you mean by "parallel committee". 
Q.	Well, we have had testimony that the group of individuals, 6, 7, 8 and 9, took it upon themselves to act on behalf of the national committee of the Interahamwe to the exclusion of other people on that committee, particularly, number 5 and number 1.  Is that correct, as far as you know? 
A.	Counsel, as far as I am concerned and, indeed, all members of the committee, this is a fairy tale.  Forgive the term, but it's unbelievable. 
Q.	And are you aware that in 1996, in Nairobi, numbers 5 and 2 created this fairy tale as a way of escaping their own responsibility for the Interahamwe? 
A.	Of the 11 members of the committee, no one ever heard mention of that concept.  It can only be a fabrication for reasons that usually lead people to indulge in such manipulations, but it surprises me.  I'd like to know the why and the wherefore, how, why, whom, when, where -- how, why, where, whom.  What's behind this so-called parallel committee?  I don't know if anybody else knows anything about it except, perhaps, those that have spoken of it. 
Q.	If such a parallel committee had existed in the Interahamwe, would the opposition parties and their media have widely reported such a thing? 
A.	Well, you remember the document we looked at on Friday.  Such an event would certainly have been in the headlines, headline stuff for the opposition press.  It is very bizarre, very bizarre. 
Q.	And are you aware that one of the Prosecution's so-called experts, Andre Guichaoua, has adopted this concept of the parallel committee as fact which he has based his expert opinion in your case, as well as ours? 
A.	I was very surprised when I took cognizance of Mr. Guichaoua's work, and I don't know for what reason he sent me that book.  I don't know him; he doesn't know me.  But that is where I found full confirmation of manoeuvres without being a judicial -- a legal expert, seems to be contrary to all judicial ethnics.     Mr. Guichaoua spoke of a parallel committee that allegedly was under Nzirorera.  He said that committee came to life in April.  Nzirorera wasn't yet secretary general.  There are all sorts of things.  

Personally, I know that this matter weighs in my trial, my proceedings.  I shouldn't like to go into too much detail because I think that's part of the secret confidentiality of my file, and when the time comes, I will demonstrate the full extent of the untruthfulness of these allegations at my trial.  I won't go into greater depth for the reasons I have just put forward, but it is not believable. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now I want to turn to some other information that has come out at our trial, and it relates to the period in the second half of 1992.  And I want to ask you whether or not you were aware at any time that Robert Kajuga had attended a meeting at the Butotori camp in Gisenyi with Colonel Bagosora, Colonel Nsengiyumva, Major Ngendi, Hamana (phonetic) and civilians such as  Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, Joseph Nzirorera, Ambassador Bonaventure Ubarijiro, at which discussions were held about exterminating the Tutsi?  Did Mr. Kajuga ever tell you that he had attended such a meeting? 
A.	Counsel, this is the very first time I have heard such news, the very first time, from your mouth.  I have just heard that information at this very instance.  I know, of course, Butotori camp because of my profession.  I know, more or less, all of Rwanda, but this is the very, very first time I have heard this item of information.  I repeat that I respect the oath I gave on the first day -- I took on the first day, and I tell you this is the very first time I have heard this item of information. 
Q.	And Mr. Kajuga was himself a Tutsi, correct? 
A.	Counsel, in Rwanda, you can have a Tutsi mother and a Hutu father.  One in sociology, because of the patriarchal system, will consider you to be Hutu.  I as a friend, a personal friend of Robert Kajuga, I was invited home with his parents.  His mother was Tutsi, his father was Hutu.  Kajuga, as far as I am concerned, is therefore a Hutu, and that is the way he conducted himself.  But I call that evil tongues, people who envied his position, who envied his popularity, which was --  he was very popular with the head of state.  
To be able to one day evict him from his post, they would say he was a Tutsi, and indeed from his physical size and appearance.  But he wasn't the only one of that size.  But for me and for many other people, Kajuga was a Hutu.  And even if he wasn't, he defended the ideas of the revolution of 1959.  That is what I can succinctly tell you on that aspect of the matter. 
Q.	Okay.  And Ambassador Ubarijoro, do you know which party he was affiliated and with whom in that party he was affiliated? 
A.	Well, it is all the more surprising as I knew that Mr. Ubarijoro, the ex-ambassador in France, I think, had been Habyarimana's friend, President Habyarimana's friend, but he'd slammed the door with a lot of noise and passed over to the MDR, crossed over to the MDR, with all of the virulence that was ambient at the time of the beginning of multiparty politics.  So, to say that Robert Kajuga had connections with the leading figures of the MDR and that he allegedly participated -- attended a terrorist or murderous meeting involving the opposition parties when Mr. Ubarijoro was one -- from one of those opposition parties, I don't understand how two former friends could fall out like that.  It appears to me to be contradictory. 
Q.	Now, in Rwanda, did you ever hear of an organisation known as the "dragons"? 
A.	Once again, Counsel, I am learning of this from you, the existence of this organisation.  And, no, I have never heard of it. 
Q.	Did you every hear of the Abakozi? 
A.	Abakozi, in Kinyarwanda, means "the workers", and it is in that context that I heard of Abakozi.  It is a common word, but as an organisation, I have never heard of that. 
Q.	Have you ever heard of the friends of the alliance? 
A.	Did you say the friends of the alliance?  
Q.	Yes.
A.	I have not heard of this either, Counsel. 
Q.	Was there a communication network in Rwanda known as the zero network that you were aware of?
A.	That term first appeared or came to be heard on the streets of Kigali, on the political scene, through an open letter that Mr. Christophe Mfizi, former ORINFOR director had addressed to the MRND president, President Habyarimana, by way of explanation for his motives, and that is the first time I heard of the zero network.  Other than that, I did not understand, and many others did not understand, what the author of the letter meant.  It was a term that was repeated often by people, but I know no more about it. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us what is the Akazu, as you understood it? 
A.	The term appeared in -- or with speeches of the opposition.  I personally heard the term in a portion of a speech broadcast on radio, a speech made by the late Felicien Gatabazi of the PSD party.  So, since I did not know the term, I sought to enquire about it.  And now I know that it appears it was a clan that was very close to royal power and that had an influence on all decisions as advisors or persons close to power.  So this term, this word, came to be used or applied to President Habyarimana's entourage, more specifically, the members of his family-in-law.  

These are things that I came to learn subsequently.  But I think it first came to be used during the first quarter of 1992, or early 1992; that is when the term was expanded and came to be used widely in the speeches of politicians. 
Q.	Now, in every country, every head of state has a group of people who are close to him.  Was there anything criminal about the Akazu that you were aware of? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet.  Very briefly, I'm a little troubled by the word "criminal".  That is a legal judgement.  My learned friend is entitled to ask questions about how the Akazu influenced policy in Rwanda, but to ask such a loaded legal question of a factual witness, I respectfully submit, Your Honours may think is inappropriate. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I can rephrase my question, Mr. President; it's no problem.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, with respect to the Akazu, to your knowledge were its members engaged in a plan to exterminate the Tutsis? 
A.	It is to be noted that some accused those close to the president, be they his in-laws or his own family, that they were accused of having favoured the Tutsi too much.  So, personally, we did not understand how politicians could have such contradictory arguments, but we thought that this was all part of the conflict between parties opposed to each other.  But I must say I said to myself that this was not something I could understand.  I, therefore, did not understand what serious accusations could be leveled in such a way at Habyarimana, for which reason I said to myself it's better to remain in the MRND if this is the game that is going to be played with the multiparty system. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now I want to turn to the meeting at Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992 at which you attended and President Habyarimana spoke.  It's true, is it not, that the opposition immediately misrepresented his speech as being against the Arusha Accords and as being a call to arms by the Interahamwe?  
A.	What was my perception?  Once again, I understood that this was part of the game, this twisted game which consisted of twisting his words so as to caricature his remarks.  It had turned into a game which the grass roots population quickly sensed, and most of them said that the multiparty system was a waste of time to them.  So I can confirm that those remarks were twisted.  

I was in Ruhengeri, I was there, but very quickly that evening a certain meaning was attributed to those words, to the effect that once again it is the Inkotanyi, the death squads, and bludge --  I must apologise, but I think it is unhealthy.  Democracy could have been played out differently.  And it is something that was noticed by everyone in the final analysis. 
Q.	Now, during his speech, President Habyarimana spoke of elections and said that he wanted the elections to be held as soon as possible.  If the elections were held in November of 1992, in your opinion, who would have won? 
A.	It is not because I belonged to the MRND party that I am saying this, because everyone knows it, all those who were witnesses; I would like to make special mention of persons or players like ambassadors, foreigners who were well acquainted with Rwanda.  Perhaps, with the advent of the multiparty system, until late 1991, if the elections had been organised at that time the MRND would have lost them.  That is my feeling.  But from the congress of 1992, the balance shifted.  And to answer your question, specifically, in 1992 -- in November 1992, by a broad margin, the MRND would have won the election and, in fact, that is what was feared.  

Why were they constantly postponing the dates proposed by political party leaders?  It was for fear of losing the elections.  There is no other explanation for the constant delays; whereas, the multiparty system should be anchored in the elections which are the expression of the electorate's desires and not to be marred by the political violence like the Kubohoza or others. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now turning to the speech of Leon Mugesera in Kabaya in Gisenyi préfecture in 1992.  First of all, did you know beforehand that Mr. Mugesera was going to say such things? 
A.	I did not personally attend the meeting or rally, so I heard the speech in excerpts that were broadcast on radio as well as the castigations that were launched left and right, especially by the opposition parties.  So I'm not very well acquainted with the speeches as given by various leaders. 
Q.	Do you believe that the MRND executive bureau, in particular, Mr. Ngirumpatse, who was secretary general at that time, approved the speech of Leon Mugesera of 22nd November 1992 in advance? 
A.	In my opinion, no, because -- it is a personal opinion, a personal conclusion.  If the speech had been approved in advance, I do not understand then why Mr. Leon Mugesera would have been abandoned by his seniors -- or, rather, peers, because it seems he was not supported in the wake of speech.  So I wonder, if it had been approved in advance, would they not have tried to protect him?  At any rate, as far as I can see, he was abandoned thereafter. 
Q.	Did the contents of Mr. Mugesera speech reflect the beliefs of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, as far as you knew? 
A.	Not just in my opinion, but in everyone's opinion, not only did this speech not reflect Ngirumpatse's views but it also did not reflect the line toed by the MRND party.  Moreover, if I may digress, I think that from that moment on, the MRND began to witness the departure of prominent members of its party of Tutsi extraction following that speech.  There was -- I cannot call it desertion because people did express their view to the effect that they did not agree with that speech, and they left subsequently. 
Q.	Now, it has been reported in the report of Alison Des Forges that during the year 1992 there were acts of violence again Tutsi in places like Kibilira in March, December, 1992 and in January 1993.  And in communes including Mukingo, Kinigi, Gaseke, Giciye, that's G-I-C-I-Y-E, Kurago (phonetic) and Mutura, in January and February 1991, and in Bugesera in March 1992, and in some communes of Kibuye in August of 1992; and, again, in the northwest of Rwanda in December 1992 and January of 1993.  Were you aware of such attacks against Tutsi and, if so, can you tell us who was responsible for them or why they occurred in your opinion, or to your knowledge? 
A.	As far as I know, after the RPF attack in October 1990, in many areas in the country, to the left or the right, there were reactions.  Perhaps this was the work of people behind the scenes, but there was a sort of civil war at local level whereby people considered the Tutsi as supporters of the RPF given that initially the RPF was almost exclusively composed of Tutsis.  And every time -- or, very often, there was a need to quickly quell the situation by making use of President Habyarimana's charismatic speeches.  I know that in Kibilira the bourgmestre was arrested, many people were jailed.  The sous préfet of that sous préfecture was arrested and, I believe, even died in jail in Gisenyi.  

	Gendarmes or members of the gendarmerie were sent all over the place to quell the violence directed at the Tutsis who were wrongly targeted, who were targeted even though they had nothing to do with the conflict.  To be specific, in 1992, to cite the case of Bugesera in the Kibuye préfecture all this was always the result of speeches between opposition parties and the MRND.  I know that investigations were constantly conducted.  And every time the result was that it is because the MRND is very strong, because the MRND has administrators in various areas.  It is unfortunate the language was used, but it is true that some people were attacked as a result. 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe participate in any of the attacks against Tutsi that I have mentioned? 
A.	Not to my knowledge.  And, as a matter of fact, when I answer you about the Interahamwe, I am referring to the Interahamwe za MRND in Kigali, because that is the movement that I know best, that whether there was fighting between members of youth wings, as we saw in opposition parties, that were challenging the RPF's enemy's language, these were all indistinctly labelled the Interahamwe.  Especially in Kibuye, most of the investigations conducted there ascertained that it was actually the MDR that was behind the steering of the trouble, or unrest.  Once again, I apologise -- I am giving here -- and I must warn that I am giving personal opinions of a person who was -- or, is a former MRND member.  And these are also observations that were made by more than one neutral observer.  Of course, the legal records must still be in Kigali. 
Q.	And did the attacks of the MDR against the Interahamwe continue through the end of 1992? 
A.	Until the end of 1992 -- but I must mention there was a period of calm that would, from time to time, occur, especially in Byumba.  In June, we noticed something that someone from the MDR noticed but, essentially, throughout the -- 1992 there was a lot of conflict with the Interahamwe and the opposition parties.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the witness can now be shown my document number 7.  It was contained in my letter of 24 May 2006.  It is a letter from Mathieu Ngirumpatse to the prime minister, dated the 21st of December 1992.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. Robinson, can you please indicate whether it is in the Prosecution Exhibit, or tab what, or what so that I can identify the document, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Hometowu.  It is a new exhibit.  It was -- a copy of it was attached to the letter of the 24th of May 2006 that was faxed to you.  And it is number 7, the very first number in that packet. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you.  I have provided it to the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness T, did you have an opportunity to take a look at this letter over the weekend? 
A.	That would be saying too much because the conditions under which I am detained do not allow me to take note in two days.  It was quite a very voluminous document.  However, I can say I have an idea, a fairly specific idea given that these are events I did experience after all. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, I'm going to ask you if the contents of this letter describe attacks against the Interahamwe by the MDR in the communes of Shyrongi -- S-H-I-O-R-O-N-G-I (sic) -- and Muhura, M-U-H-U-R-A, and Rubungo R-U-B-N-G-O (sic), and then if the letter accurately reflects the events that occurred in those communes.  And you can take as much time as you need to read the letter before answering? 
A.	There is a situation described in the letter dated 21 December 1992 and signed by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, MRND national secretary.  In fact, this is a situation describing the daily lives of the youth wings throughout the year 1992, and it describes the violence which corresponded to the policy of provocation because the Kubohoza attacks of MRND -- on attacks of MRND members, and I believe that this is merely an example of what was going on everywhere, especially in the Gitarama préfecture which is or is not mentioned here, but it is the expression of the daily situation obtaining in 1992.  I believe that even today some MDR party members or former members of the MDR are in a position to confirm the testimony or what is borne out by this letter. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ118. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ118 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now turning to 1993, can you tell us what was the effect on the Rwandan population on the 8 February attack by the RPF?
A.	The attack of the 8th of February of 1993 on the city of Ruhengeri did, in fact, demonstrate the true face, the true intentions of the RPF.  Some people who were not convinced of the real aims of the RPF finally understood that the RPF did not want to negotiate, did not want the hostilities to cease, because almost every time a part or an aspect of the Arusha Accords was concluded, or was about to be concluded, they did something to prove that they were militarily superior.  And the Ruhengeri attack that spilled out onto the streets displacing people with their property, opened the eyes of many people who did not want to believe that the RPF was seeking to take power by force.  

	I think this is one of the first or earliest stages that manifested the fact that the RPF did not believe in the Arusha Accords.  Now, the RPF was launching attacks to make people sit up and notice that they were in a position to take Kigali.  I know because the consequences of such an attack made it more difficult for me to carry out my work.  So I know what I am talking about.  This -- I'm not being emotional here.  I know what happened in Nyacyonga.  And in the other areas there was a sort of desolation, the children -- people who were comfortable in their own country.  This was intolerable.  So the attack was an eye opener for many people to the strength to the RPF.  And it was understood that perhaps one should respond to such strength with similar force. 
Q.	Can you tell me approximately how many people were displaced by the RPF attack of February 1993, and where they were relocated to, and what was the effect of that on the rest of the Rwanda government -- population? 
A.	As a matter of fact, Counsel, there were displaced persons' camps all over the place.  I did visit Nkumba, personally.  I also visited Biryogo.  But the bulk of the population was cramped into Nyacyonga, which was a few kilometres from Kigali.  

And there I know a minister, a foreign minister, the French foreign minister, I do not want to cite him by name.  I know a Bishop who represented the Pope, that they went to visit this camp and shed tears when they witnessed the situation.  So, the statistics cited more than 900,000 displaced with their goods.  I will spare you the description and gruesome detail.  But, yes, they were mostly put into this camp 15 kilometres from Kigali.  It was a pitiful sight to see them around midday looking for food.  And very nastily the opposition party would say to them, "Go and report your situation to Habyarimana, see what he will do for you."  Rwanda was completely transformed.  

I never understood that war which was fermented mostly within the interior and did not understand the RPF.  The RPF in its policy of targeting people in the interior, most of them people are now outside in exile, really I do not understand. 
Q.	In addition to displacing people during the attack of February 1993, did the RPF also kill civilians?  And how did that reflect on the attitudes of the displaced persons when they were -- found themselves just outside of Kigali? 
A.	As a matter of fact I am not a military specialist.  When the guerrilla replaces traditional warfare and the policy of deliberate bombing of the population is practiced in order to dislodge the population, preferably along ethnic lines, well the consequences were that the RPF is only attacking Hutus.  So you can imagine how an innocent person, an innocent citizen, at least innocent in politics, someone who has nothing to do and has nothing to do with the strength of the RPF, there they were.  They would have attacked -- or they should have attacked Habyarimana, his ministers, but the population, women, children, the elderly.  You will understand the kind of tension it would have created socially, Hutu-Tutsi tension, especially since the RPF at the time discriminated so as to fuel this social ethnic hatred.  At least that is what I observed.  And there is no other explanation for it.  It was a deliberate policy.  It was obvious. 
Q.	Now, we have heard a lot about RPF infiltrators.  Was that some fiction that was created by the Habyarimana government to mobilise people against the RPF, or was it a fact?  
A.	Don't be angry with me if I answer your question with a question.  How can you win guerrilla -- a guerrilla war if you do not infiltrate?  Thank you. 
Q.	So, from what you observed can you tell us what was the extent of RPF infiltration into the Rwanda population in 1993 and early 1994? 
A.	Well, in fact, in order to maintain security, one of the means of controlling the population in Kigali was the resident permit.  In certain cases, movement of people from a rural area to Kigali was sometimes justified by the local authority issuing a laissez-passer.  And the arrival of Nsengiyaremye to the position of prime minister against the advice of the entire population -- or to the surprise, at any rate, of anyone, he did away with the issuing of residents' permits in Kigali and other means of knowing who is who, why they are going from here to there.  And that phenomenon favoured, and was intended to favour infiltration. 

	That is one of the criteria I can propose.  And people would openly (unitelligible) as of one moment in time they would freely go to Mulindi or other areas controlled by the RPF, and openly boasted that they were supporting the enemy; that they had gone and come back, that they had made a contribution.  And in the face of the misery that afflicted part of the population, such arrogance was a provocation.  That is how I witnessed these unheard of events regarding security in Kigali.  

The political parties preached that it wasn't possible, then informed the population.  So you can't even say that it was a matter of intelligence services or secret services of the state.  This was -- the public was informed of this.  And the public was asking what the parties intend to do to ensure their security, because the government appeared at one point of having abandoned its job, because they were speaking the RPF language through the meetings -- coordinated meetings, such as the Brussels meeting or openly taking position, vis-à-vis, the Arusha Accords.  

I remember when the minister of foreign affairs had been very correctly -- remonstrated with him, whether it was the government negotiating with the RPF or whether they were negotiating with the opposition parties, and in -- very arrogantly he challenged Habyarimana to a public debate.  And there were unbelievable things happening, completely unbelievable.  When you betray the nation, there should be safeguards.  So the country appeared to have been handed over to the enemy through its internal contacts and who were at the very heart of government.  

I am not telling stories.  I'm talking of things that I experienced, I lived through, that all Rwandans experienced whether Hutu or Tutsi? 
Q.	Now, in May of 1993 a leader of the PSD party, Emmanuel Gapyisi, G-A-P-Y-I-S-I, was assassinated.  Did the Interahamwe have any involvement in that assassination? 
A.	Let me correct you.  Emmanuel Gapyisi was not PSD.  He was an eminent member of the MDR.  And at one point he established a thing called a Forum for Peace and Democracy.  And then we realised that the RPF was not playing the democratic game, as it claimed.  And he denounced the RPF conduct and invited intellectuals to join that club, Forum for Peace and Democracy.  And there were great internal rivalries after June of the preceding year, precisely on that point.  And Gapyisi was assassinated.  

I can tell you that I personally went to his funeral.  And his family -- and his family in Gikongoro, because he was someone who I had known for a long time -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We have lost the link.  I'm sorry, Mr. President, it has gone on the blink.  The picture wasn't moving either.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a technical problem which is being addressed.  And I just got a suggestion that we should probably take the break, take our mid-morning recess now. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President.  I am actually seeing the -- I was seeing the witness on my -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is back now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
We can take the break now if you would like anyway. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, if it is back we can go on.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
It was to facilitate the technical problem. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness T, we did not receive the complete answer.  So we had lost the connection at the time when you said that you had gone to the funeral of Mr. Gapyisi; and if you could continue with your answer and specifically whether the Interahamwe was involved in that killing? 
A.	When, in fact, I was saying that in view of my personal relations with Gapyisi, I went to his funeral.  And his family in Gikongoro -- and there was clearly tension, and it was encouraged by the opposition party that it would have been death squads, Interahamwe that murdered Gapyisi.  So there was very clearly tension in Gikongoro.  And had it not been for the speech his eldest sister made, who was representing the family, she said, "Listen, don't look any further, it wasn't the Interahamwe who killed Gapyisi.  Don't spill blood for nothing, in fighting.  We know who killed our brother."  That speech was delivered in the parish church in Kigeme.  I was there, inside.  I heard.  And the same speech was made at the family gathering.  

And had it not been for that speech by his sister there would have been bloody, unprecedented fighting between the youth of the opposition parties who had been led to believe that it was the Interahamwe, the MRND that had assassinated.  I was a witness to that.  I was present.  And she played a very peaceful role; otherwise, a civil war would have ensued between Gikongoro where there were many MRND party members who would have been killed or would have fled from the massacres that should have taken place.  

That was a calculation of the one who killed Gapyisi, which was exactly what happened when Gatabazi and Bucyana were assassinated.  It was a sort of rehearsal of a piece of theatre.  That is what I can tell you by way of an answer.  His own family concluded that the Interahamwe had nothing to do with it.  And, henceforth, the speculation followed his brother-in-law, Twagiramungu, the suspicion fell on Faustin Twagiramungu that he allegedly would have been at the origin or would have betrayed in the assassination of Emmanuel Gapyisi. 
Q.	Now, recently there has been evidence from a former RPF soldier by the name of Abdul Joshua Ruzibiza that it was the RPF who assassinated Emmanuel Gapyisi to shift the blame to the MRND.  Was that consistent with the information and beliefs that you had at the time? 
A.	Well, Counsel, let's analyse the matter, see who benefits from the crime, who profits from the murder?  And if Gapyisi was killed by the Interahamwe, why didn't they do it before?  Why did they wait for him to establish that club, Forum for Peace and Democracy, which most of us wanted to join because it was not incompatible with the objectives of the MRND, the objectives of the MDR, the PSD, but who refused to allow the RPF to take power by arms.  We must be objective in analysing events.  

I am not an expert.  My analysis is based on what I experienced.  I was, after all, 38, 39 years old.  It was 12 years ago those who took power had taken it.  We must be objective in our analysis, even if it be only for the history books.  
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse or any member of the MRND executive committee ever order the Interahamwe to assassinate anyone? 
A.	Counsel, let me repeat, if you had followed the first part of my testimony, it is true that Mathieu followed the creation, accompanied, but did Mr. Mathieu ask his troops, which included Tutsi, to go and assassinate Tutsi?  And let us reason further; I ask you, was that logical?  Were the Interahamwe really specialised in assassination?  No, I tell you, no.  I said what I said, what I saw, but I can't add.            Mr. Mathieu is a leader whom I respect -- whom I respected, but Mr. Mathieu, no.  He blamed those Interahamwe who were ill disciplined.  He threatened to exclude certain groups who went on their knees at the Wednesday meetings to beg forgiveness.  Those who say that, maybe can prove what they are saying.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness T.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I am about to go into another subject.  Would you like to take our break at this time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short recess, our mid-morning break. 
(Court recessed at 1100H)
(Pages 1 to 14 by Donna M. Lewis)
















(Court resumed at 1132H) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, can you hear me there?  
A.	Yes, I hear you, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I want to ask you some questions about the financing of the Interahamwe.  Can you tell us where the Interahamwe received its funds?  
A.	Most came from contributions of members, people who were richer than others, donations by certain businessmen.  The funding was not really funding in the strict sense of the term, but contributions came from various quarters.  Some people could avail -- for instance, in a meeting that was scheduled, they could provide vehicles, could ferry certain members, depending on the size of their vehicle.  They could intercede to seek employment, paid employment, for certain members in companies.  There was a fund-raising evening at Rebero, where formal funding was discussed.  Contributions came from various quarters from the members.  In broad terms, that is how I would describe the situation as regards funding of the Interahamwe.  But this funding is not really that which we understand in terms of economics and financing. 
Q.	And did the other parties' youth wings get their money from contributions by its parties' members as well? 
A.	I think it is a similar channel, especially in the context that prevailed.  If it had been another context perhaps whereby some funding or -- was to be realised by various youth wings, yes, you could have talked about a financial structure for contributions to be channeled to the youth wing in the same way. 
Q.	Now, was there anything clandestine about people who gave financial support to the Interahamwe?  Was it a shame to do that or was it something that the members of the MRND were proud to do? 
A.	They were actually very proud to do so, proud to do so.  At any rate, there is no shame in doing it, nor need to be clandestine, on the contrary.  
Q.	And when the persons contributed to the Interahamwe, was there any expectation that these funds would be used to exterminate the Tutsis? 
A.	Counsel, no, not to my knowledge.  In any event, how could you assess whatever fund was established to exterminate the Tutsis?  It is not a question I'm putting to you, but I'm just thinking aloud, to show that there is no sense in that.  Please forgive me for using the term. 
Q.	No, thank you very much.  I want to now ask you about some matters that Professor Guichaoua has raised, I believe in our case and also in your case, in which he alleges that funds were channeled to the Interahamwe by loans or advances of product by a parastatal corporation called SORWAL, S-O-R-W-A-L, and another one called CIMERWA, C-I-M-E-R-W-A.  Are those allegations true? 
A.	I was fortunate enough to receive Guichaoua's work.  He himself sent it to me.  But when I read the attempt to sustain his theory, I felt that it ends like a fish's tail.  And he begins to say that the Kigali bankers who had promised documents from the archives to justify various claims, that they were involved in clandestine transfers.  And then he sent me the book, asking me for my opinion.  I could not make sense of Mr. Guichaoua's method.  Perhaps I will have occasion to meet him, though, when he will come to support his theories at my trial.  

However, I conclude that it is shameful for a professor who is worthy of the name.  I have no personal knowledge or acquaintance with him.  I have nothing against him, but for him to come up with a conclusion based on a theory that does not hold up, in the end asking for the opinion of persons one is accusing.  

I understand that someone should accuse me, but then for him to ask for my opinion, well, I am saying this because he wrote publicly to me requesting information so as to support his theory that there was financing and embezzlement of funds because he says he is supposed to testify in the case of Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Nzirorera.  

My official answer to him was that the entirety of my testimony is reserved for the Court, and that I cannot reverse the roles in the testimony.  I would be happy to meet with him one day and discuss how economically one can sustain or maintain things that cannot actually be maintained.  He devoted a chapter to the financing of the Interahamwe, but it goes pear-shaped when referring to the banking sector. 

I must again say that I must refrain from discussing something that may be dealt with in the proceedings in my trial.  However, that, I believe, is an answer.  I can furnish an answer to your question. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I find myself on my feet.  I'm very uneasy about the pitch of the question in respect of the Guichaoua report for this reason:  My learned friend began his enquiry of the witness by identifying that the professor had suggested that finances had moved from two parastatal organisations to the benefit of the Interahamwe.  And Your Honours will recall that this witness is not someone who was responsible for Interahamwe finances.  

What was interesting about that long reply was that it consisted of a series of opinions being expressed on the work of an expert.  Your Honours will have noticed that there was never an answer to the question whether the witness knew or did not know whether any finances had made their way from any parastatal organisations.  We never found out what the witness's state of actual knowledge about the factual circumstance was.  And the witness has been, as it were, encouraged to offer a series of opinions without any factual matrix to justify those opinions about what it is the professor has written.  
Now, the difficulty here is, therefore, Your Honours, first of all, don't get an answer to the question, which was a specific factual question, or should have been, do you know whether there's been any financing by any parastatal organisations?  Would you have known?  Would you have been in a position to know?  And, secondly, Your Honours have had an opinion expressed without factual foundation on the work of a professor, a series of observations, which doesn't have at its root specific facts offered by the witness to contradict what the professor has said.  So one ends up with a series of opinions without foundation, that's the problem.  

So, what I would invite Your Honours to say is that when my learned friend begins to ask questions about what other experts have written who have collated material from the four corners of Rwanda, that we identify a clear distinction between eliciting an opinion and eliciting a fact.  In that answer just now, we haven't had a single fact.  We've had a series of opinions. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I can follow up and remedy that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, among the allegations made by Professor Guichaoua is that members of the Interahamwe national committee, particularly numbers 2, 3, and 10, received advances of product of matches, that's M-A-T-C-H-E-S, from the SORWAL parastatal company, and were able to sell those matches and not have to pay back the SORWAL company, but instead diverted those funds to the national Interahamwe committee.  Now, from your knowledge, is that allegation correct?  
A.	It is no more -- it is not exact or correct because those persons were businessmen, and because of that they could conduct their business with anyone and in any manner.  I do not think that those funds fueled or funded the provisional national committee; it was on a personal basis.  In my profession, one cannot make any conclusions.  Those people had lines of credit, could obtain credit on a personal basis.  Did the profits or losses that could result from those losses -- credits, could they be to the advantage or disadvantage of the national committee?  The answer is no.  One should not conflate the personal affairs of members of the provisional national committee, on one hand, who were just doing their business -- or conducting of business in a personal capacity.  And that is what I find deplorable in these assertions.  So the person who made those assertions sent me his book, and there is confusion.  

The Interahamwe had their own business dealings, but not in the name of the provisional national committee, and that is a distinction that should always be made to avoid confusing the issues. 
Q.	And did the Interahamwe national committee ever receive substantial contributions of money from numbers 2, 3, or 10?  
A.	No, because, as a matter of fact, I have just explained if this had happened, there is no way I would not have known about it.  
Q.	Now, Professor Guichaoua has also said with respect to number 9 on Exhibit P. 9 that this person ensured that funds were transferred for the benefit of the Interahamwe, particularly as a result of his relationship with Seraphin Bararengana, B-A-R-A-R-E-N-G-A-N-A, who was the junior brother of the president.  To your knowledge, is that true? 
A.	It is highly ridiculous.  I will tell you it is untrue as far as number 9 is concerned.  It is a complete fabrication.  It is a hodgepodge relating to circumstantial facts which are patched up into some sort of theory that does not really hold up.  No, at least as far as number 9 is concerned, and he will have to back up the assertion he makes, which is tantamount to defamation. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, hold on a second.    
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we are concerned about the methodology of rebutting the information that you are doing.  The principle -- the principle that we have accepted is that the witness should not usurp the Court's function of assessing the credibility or reliability of another witness.  So there's a grave discomfort with asking the witness questions which invites commentary on the truthfulness of another witness.  We think that you are entitled to rebut the factual content.  So the problem that has caused our concern is that the way the questions are being framed, they are -- it seems that the witness has been invited to comment on the credibility or accuracy of somebody who is going to be a witness in this trial.  That's the discomfort that we have at the moment.  

We are not preventing you from challenging the factual content of the report, but that's the ruling that we wanted to advance at this stage.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  I think I can work within those guidelines, so thank you very much.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, we're now going to go on to talk about some political events that took place in the period of July and August of 1993.  First of all, around the 3rd and 4th of July 1993, there was a congress of the MRND, a national congress.  And is it true that you did not attend that congress?  
A.	That is correct, I did not attend the congress. 
Q.	And also in July, on the 16th of July 1993, there was a change in the prime minister from Mr. Nsengiyaremye to Agathe Uwilingiyimana; is that correct? 
A.	That is quite correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And she was also a member of the MDR party; correct?  
A.	Yes, she was in the management committee of the MDR party. 
Q.	And shortly after she became prime minister, was there an extraordinary congress held by the MDR party that took some action with respect to that post?  
A.	That is quite correct.  Part of the decisions led to some people ending up on the streets. 
Q.	Can you tell us what you mean by that?  
A.	I mean that the congress of the MDR was very controversial, centred on the fact that Ms. Uwilingiyimana was forced to resign by her party from the MDR, to resign from her position as prime minister.  And at the close of the congress, it was said by some that she had agreed -- that there was a radio communiqué contradicting the decision of the congress, and ended up on the street.  There was a lot of controversy in the media and on the street, and that is what I mean by "the street". 
Q.	And who was the person who was put forward by the MDR extraordinary congress who they wanted to be the prime minister representing the MDR party at that time?  
A.	Mr. Jean Kambanda was picked to -- was earmarked by the congress.  But let us not forget that in the meantime factions within the MDR had excluded Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu from the presidency and so Ms. Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who replaced or succeeded Mr. Nsengiyaremye as prime minister, was denounced.  There was protest when she took over the post; and Jean Kambanda, it was suggested by that congress, should take over.
Q.	However, it -- in fact, Agathe Uwilingiyimana remained the prime minister of Rwanda through the 7th of April 1994, correct? 
A.	Some actions (sic). 
MR. ROBINSON:
	The English translation didn't seem to comply with my very rudimentary knowledge of French.  I thought he said "c'est exact".  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction, "That is correct".  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, in August of 1993, were the final Arusha Accords signed by the Rwandan government?  
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And despite the concessions that were made in those accords, did the MRND and President Habyarimana support them?  
A.	Yes, the MRND party and Habyarimana supported the accords because they'd signed them, so they must have. 
Q.	And those accords contemplated the arrival of a United Nations force that became known as UNAMIR; is that correct? 
A.	Quite, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, in July or August of 1993, did a radio station known as RTLM begin broadcasting in Rwanda?  
A.	Absolutely, Counsel. 
Q.	And can you tell us how RTLM came to be formed? 
A.	RTLM was a limited liability company.  Its main purpose was radio and television broadcasting.  Its motivation was to contribute to the collection of news and contribute to the debate in the context, especially, of freedom of the press -- freeing of the press.  And that is why RTLM was established and the company's statutes, in general terms, consecrate that objective.  It was a limited liability company.  Shares were issued.  And its main purpose was to contribute to the debate via that media, which was a free radio and television station.  I don't know all the details of the creation of that company, but that's what I do know of it. 
Q.	And when the radio station began being formed, was there a steering committee that led the formation of that radio station which included the following persons:  Felicien Kabuga, K-A-B-U-G-A; Charles Nzabagerageza, N-Z-A-B-A-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-A; Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, B-A-R-A-Y-A-G-W-I-Z-A; Ferdinand Nahimana, N-A-H-I-M-A-N-A; Ephrem Nkezabera, N-K-E-Z-A-B-E-R-A; and Joseph Serugendo, S-E-R-U-G-E-N-D-O?  
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  So that board, those people, was called a comité d'initiative de mise en place, something like "promotional committee".  Before the comité d'initiative de mise en place -- okay, it's enough to say the promotional committee for the establishment of RTLM before the official organs were established. 
Q.	And then did that committee proceed to invite private individuals to become shareholders of the RTLM? 
A.	Yes, shareholders were private individuals, essentially.  But I think the statute also provides for moral entities, legal entities, to subscribe to shares. 
Q.	And did a large number of people, including Mr. Nzirorera, purchase shares in the RTLM?  
A.	Yes, inter alia. 
Q.	And during the time that the RTLM was formed, was there any suggestion that it would be used to advocate the extermination of Tutsi? 
A.	Well, if you refer to the statutes that were made official in 1993 by a solicitor, that was not a stated purpose, but with what ensued and the drift in relation to the initial purpose, especially after the 6th of April, well, to answer your question succinctly, no, that was never the declared purpose of that firm or of that radio station at the outset. 
Q.	And did you have any intention that RTLM be used for the extermination of the Tutsi when you participated in that organisation?  
A.	No, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, at the time that RTLM was formed and began broadcasting, what other radio stations could be heard within Rwanda?  
A.	The national broadcaster, Radio Rwanda; there was the RPF's pirate radio, which was Muhabura, Radio Muhabura, which could be heard over the full extent of the territory of Rwanda.  But other radio stations could also be received in Rwanda, foreign radio stations such as -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, end of answer.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Radio Rwanda, was that under the ministry of information?  
A.	Yes, it was the government radio station, or national radio station that fell under the minister of information, at least, after the sharing of power between the various parties. 
Q.	And what party did the minister of information belong to?  
A.	In the sharing out of portfolio -- ministerial portfolios, it was the MDR that obtained the portfolio -- ministerial portfolio of information. 
Q.	And what kinds of things were being broadcast over Radio Muhabura during 1993 and 1994?  
A.	In general terms, it was the RPF propaganda they broadcasted.  It was the RPF's radio station. 
Q.	And was it part of the motivation for the forming of RTLM radio that those who supported President Habyarimana should have a voice on the airwaves as well?  
A.	I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?  
Q.	Was it part of the motivation for the forming of RTLM that those who supported President Habyarimana should have their voice heard on the radio as well?  
A.	Yes, quite.  That was quite correct.  In the background there was that avowed desire. 
Q.	And was RTLM primarily a commercial operation in which the investors hoped to realise a profit? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, I would like to draw your attention to the events after the assassination of President Ndadaye in October 1993.  After that assassination, was there an influx of refugees into Rwanda from Burundi? 
A.	And many refugees from Burundi were quartered in Butare and Gikongoro préfectures.  The -- nearly 400,000.  At any rate, more than 300,000 after the assassination of President Ndadaye.  
Q.	And were there still almost a million people who were displaced from the RPF attack of February 1993? 
A.	In fact, those refugees came in addition to the displaced persons whom the status -- statisticians had evaluated -- assessed at being a million or at least between 900,000 and a million, and there were Burundian refugees who had been in Rwanda for a long time.  I think it was they came across in '72, 1972.  That's what I have to say on that topic.  
Q.	Now, did you attend the rally at Nyamirambo stadium on the 23rd of October 1993, at which Froduald Karamira made a speech?  
MR. ROBINSON:
	I think there may be a translation error in French -- I said 23rd -- 
THE WITNESS
.	No, Counsel. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Now, did the executive committee of the Interahamwe plan a manifestation for after the death of President Ndadaye in late October? 
A.	That is correct.  After that assassination, a march was organised to show support, organised by the Interahamwe and the MRND party. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, if the witness could be shown document number 8, which is a new exhibit which was attached to my letter of 24 May 2006.  That was faxed to Mr. Hometowu.  It's a two-page excerpt from RTLM broadcast on the 25th of October 1993, and the first page bears K-number K0139780.  
THE WITNESS:
I have the document before me, Counsel. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And the document is in the Kinyarwanda language.  Can you tell us whether or not within this document is a communiqué from the Interahamwe, and can you summarise what it says?  
A.	This communiqué:  "On the basis of the speech by the head of state, the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe informs all Interahamwe residing in Kigali urban préfecture and vicinity that a march in support will take place on Sunday, 31st October, 8 a.m.  This demonstration of support is organised to support our Burundian brethren.  The march will start at the roundabout and will end with a speech, a message, from our top national leaders of the MRND party at Nyamirambo stadium.  The Interahamwe who had planned a demonstration for that day are -- have to postpone it because of national mourning because of -- the national mourning which has been declared."  

That is how I might translate that announcement, communiqué, from Kinyarwanda into French. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this communiqué as Exhibit D. NZ119. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet at this point.  I don't object to the exhibit going in, but I'm just wondering whether or not we have translations of it.  My learned friend has put in the Kinyarwanda version, and it may be that he's aware that there are translations in French and in English, and perhaps those should go in as well.  If I'm wrong about that, then I apologise.  But if there are translations, it would be of assistance, I'm sure, to everybody to have the relevant pages translated; otherwise, we don't really know what's on the document which is exhibited. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I'm not aware of any translations of this particular broadcast, but if I'm wrong about that and the Prosecution has some, then I'd be happy to have them also admitted as exhibits.  So -- 
MR. MORLEY:
It may be of assistance if my learned friend could tell me from where he got the document:  Is it general disclosure, or is it from the EDS, or is it from the tabs?  Where does it come from?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, it comes from CD-ROMs of broadcasts of RTLM that were provided to us in disclosure. 
MR. MORLEY:
That's very helpful.  And there was no translation of the document; is that right?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct, at least as far as we've been able to find. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  We'll look into that, Your Honour.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ119 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness T, if you could be shown document number 10 from my same bundle of exhibits contained in the letter of 24 May 2006.  This is a single page dated the 28th of October 1993, bearing K-number K0223924.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, could you make that reference again?  I didn't catch it the first time around. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  This is also a broadcast from RTLM and it's K0223924 from the 28th of October.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, do you have that document?  
A.	I have the document before me, Counsel.  
Q.	And is it a fact that the MRND and the Interahamwe cancelled that demonstration that had been scheduled for the 31st of October? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And does this document contain a communiqué from Mr. Ngirumpatse and Robert Kajuga which announces the cancellation of that demonstration?  
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer Exhibit D. NZ120 at this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ120 admitted)
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I find myself on my feet.  The same point arises.  We've just had a Kinyarwanda one which has been served on us.  We'll do our best to find out whether there are translations.  We're a bit puzzled because most of this stuff was translated into French or English, or both, but we'll see what we can find.
 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'd appreciate -- if they are able to locate the French and the English, it would obviously be easier for all of us, so I'd appreciate any efforts that the Prosecution can make to do that.  But from the resources and material available to me, I was unable to find French and English.  And I would assure the Trial Chamber that if I did find those, I would be working in those languages.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness T, do you know why the MRND and Interahamwe cancelled the demonstration that was scheduled for the 31st of October 1993? 
A.	That march in solidarity in the face of the events that had befallen Burundi, the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye who had just been assassinated, after having been elected in June or July of '93. 
Q.	I didn't really understand.  Maybe the question and the answer was not clear, but why was it that the demonstration was cancelled?  

Maybe I should start over again.  I think we're having some communication difficulty.  Witness T, my question is:  Why did the MRND and the Interahamwe cancelled -- cancel the scheduled demonstration on the 31st of October? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, do we still have the video link, the audio?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not sure.  Mr. Hometowu, can you hear me?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President, we hear you very well, very clearly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I heard you as well.  

Mr. Robinson, could you try again?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, can you tell us why the demonstration for the 31st of October was cancelled?  
A.	I will repeat that.  In view of the official mourning declared and the precariousness of public safety was also invoked -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I only got half of what -- 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know if I've correctly understood your question.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
But that was very broken, Mr. President.  I'm not sure we got the entire answer, either.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, we're having difficulties with the audio.  So, I'm sorry, but I have to ask you to repeat that answer again.  
A.	I repeat that it is because of the national mourning that had been decreed after the decision to undertake that march in support, and as a backdrop I think there was the question of the precariousness of public safety in respect of that demonstration that had been pre-planned.  
Q.	And were the MRND and Interahamwe concerned not to inflame further the population which was already upset about the assassination of the president of Burundi?  
A.	That was an omnipresent concern, all the more so as President Habyarimana's speech in respect of that death, that assassination, had sensitised the population, called upon the population to not give way to anger.  So it was in the chief of state's speech, calling upon the population as a whole to show self-restraint and not to indulge in excessive -- in gestures of excess.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And if the witness can be shown document number 9 of my packet of materials from the fax of 24th of May of 2006.  This is a broadcast of the speech of President Habyarimana on the 25th -- or, 27th of October 1993.  It has K-number K0139783 all the way through page K0139786.  So if this could be placed before the witness.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
I have the document before me, Counsel.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And is this, in fact, the broadcast of the speech that President Habyarimana made after the death of the president of Burundi?  
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer this as Exhibit D. NZ121. 
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend is welcome to put in these pieces of paper, but at the moment, evidentially, the difficulty with them is when Your Honours come to read them and consider them you can't read them because they're in a different language, and unless Your Honours in the past few months have become proficient at Kinyarwanda, the difficulty is that these are simply pieces of paper with a different language on them.  

I've noticed that there is quite a lot of Kinyarwanda material which is being offered in, in due course, by my learned friend.  I'm a little uneasy about this.  It seems to me that where there is a tranche of something said by someone on the radio or in any document, it is of value to Your Honours to be able to see the context and the full import of what it is that's being said.  The difficulty we are in at the moment is that my learned friend is selecting portions from a document in a foreign language and the witness is reading those, effectively in French so that they get translated to Your Honour, but there's no context.  

Now, in short, we're going to go looking for more translations.  We've found one already in relation to document 10.  It does exist, apparently.  And I hope to talk to my learned friend a little bit further when we rise at lunch.  But it's, perhaps to Your Honours' minds, unsatisfactory to be putting in documents in Kinyarwandan without there being any translation of any sort.  It may be that my learned friend might have been able to produce translations.  We could have had the usual argument about whether they're accurate or not, but at least we would have had translations.  But to lead documents in this way is evidentially useless.  What my learned friend could do is put the document under the witness's nose, get him to read the section that he is interested in, and then that is the evidence.  But to simply put in these pieces of paper is perhaps unhelpful. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, it's my understanding that all of these exhibits are going to be translated so that, before you issue your judgement, you have the content of these exhibits. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Translated by whom?  
MR. ROBINSON:
By the language section.  In fact, if that's not already a standing order, I will make a formal motion that that be done because you obviously cannot take cognizance of exhibits in languages that you don't understand, even including documents which are in French.  So, it seems to me that it's -- just as a matter of your own work that it's necessary that all documents be translated before -- once they're admitted into evidence.  

We don't have the ability to have the language section do our translations before exhibits are admitted into evidence.  So if, unlike OTP -- so what we have is a situation where the Prosecution has disclosed to us the original broadcasts in the original language and they have made the selection of which speeches, which broadcasts, are of interest to them that should be translated into French and English.  And to the extent that we have those, we produce them, and to the extent that we can find them, we use them.  But there's many that are very helpful to the Defence that have not been translated, at least to our knowledge, or disclosed to us in a language other than the original Kinyarwanda.  

Now, the question arises, how do we proceed in light of that situation?  And, for example, the speech we are dealing with now, President Habyarimana's speech upon the death of the president of Burundi, is a wonderful speech, and I would love for you to hear it read in its entirety.  And if you would like me to do that, I'll simply ask the witness to read the document and we can have a translation here in court.  I wasn't planning on doing that because of the time involved.  

I was planning on having the witness, who hopefully has already read the document over the weekend and give the Trial Chamber the summary of what is contained in this, and then later the document is translated and you can have a full appreciation of it.  So, if you would like me to proceed in any other manner than that, let me know and I'll be happy to have the witness read the entire document.  You'll have a full translation, and we won't have any problem that Mr. Morley has raised.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I recall a meeting with the Trial Chamber coordinator where we raised the issue of prioritising translations for the Defence, and I'm not aware that the Defence cannot request translations from the language section.  I understand that to be a body of the registry that is accessible to both parties.  

My recollection is that the Trial Chamber coordinator invited the Defence to make submissions of items for translation that would be important for their case so that those could be translated in time to be presented to the Trial Chamber.  So, I think this is an administrative issue that we should be able to resolve.  Beyond that, I'll rely on Mr. Morley's submission. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Webster, Mr. Morley suggested that the translations already exist and that, if that is the case, wouldn't the Prosecutor be in a position to assist in identifying the existing translations?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Of course, Your Honour, but that's not something we can do with -- from here in the courtroom.  We'd have to go back and go through our records.  It's going to take, I would think, at least a day or so to do that.  But I think it would be helpful -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If that is the case, right -- I think there are two different issues:  One, where the translation already exists, we could admit the Kinyarwanda document now and when the translations are retrieved, we could then adjust the exhibit to include them.  

Now, with regard to the situations where there is no existing translation, Mr. Robinson, you see, I don't necessarily think that the Court wants to undertake the task of assisting either side to that extent.  I think that it is up to the party to try to take what steps are required.  I think that the issue of getting a translation is a purely administrative activity.  

Our Trial Chamber coordinator has offered to provide support, in communications with the language section, for matters of this nature.  So we would prefer that you undertake to get the translations, if necessary, with the good offices of our coordinator, rather than to rely on the Chamber itself to 
initiate -- to select and initiate communications with the language section.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  Mr. President, I myself have been advised that the language section will not translate any Defence documents until they're admitted into evidence.  I've tried to get translations in the past.  So now that it -- once you do admit it into evidence, I will certainly work with your Trial Chamber coordinator to see that the documents are translated for you, but I am not able to do that until that occurs.  

So, may this speech be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ121?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ121 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, Mr. President -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Before we move on to another issue, this brings us back to the whole issue of coordination between the parties to advance the proceedings.  When I look at Mr. Robinson's reciprocal disclosure, what I notice is that every document listed there originated somehow from the Office of the Prosecutor because they all bear a K-number.  Nothing in this collection of documents seems secret to me.  

Now, if we had at the beginning of the trial, or weeks ago, made a list of all of these things that we all are going to see during the course of the examination of this witness, then the issue of translation would have been resolved because we would have been able to find translations if they exist, or order them if they didn't.  And I think if the Court could assist in this regard, in the future, if Mr. Robinson has documents that are coming from the Prosecution, we can deal with this issuing long before it becomes an issue with the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think this is an effort to find out which documents I'm going to use with the witness before the direct examination, which I don't want to engage in.  But, in any event, I think we're spending time on administrative matters that need not concern the Trial Chamber at this point, and we'll do our best to work with the Prosecution and your Trial Chamber coordinator.  But I know we are about to take our break, but I think it would be important just to discuss for a moment how you would like us to proceed with familiarising you with the contents of this speech.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have a general aversion to the idea of having documentary evidence just read into the transcript.  Now, obviously, we cannot read the document in its present form.  But if it's going to be translated and put on the record, we don't think it's necessary to have it read, unless there's some other purpose for that.  But just as a means of providing us with knowledge of the content, we don't think that's sufficient or desirable. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  So if the witness can be asked during our break to just -- if he hasn't already had an opportunity to read this particular speech, if he could take a look at it and then I'll ask him to give us a summary of it when we return.  Thank you.  And would you like to take the break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can take the break now.  
(Court recessed from 1257H to 1440H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, before I start questioning the witness, I wanted to ask a few things, management-type issues.  

First of all, I want to inform you that things are going well, timing-wise, and that I'm on track with some -- right now, some margin of comfort to finish my own examination within the time that I've estimated, but -- which is by the end of this week.  So -- and I think that will also leave enough time for my colleagues and the Prosecution to finish their re-direct and cross-examination before the 9th of June, when we can no longer have -- so, we are in good shape so far.  

So, thinking ahead, we have the issue of the two missing PVs, and I was, of course, going to need those before I can complete my cross-examination.  And I was wondering if we can take the opportunity of having a link with the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) and also the presence of the Prosecution.  

Sorry about that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name of the country is redacted. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If we can perhaps take advantage of the presence of the representatives of the state and the Prosecution to enquire what is the status of that.  

Secondly, I would like to call your attention to our motion for reconsideration of the withholding of materials hijacked by the Prosecution from the state under Rule 66(C), and I would like to have a ruling on that before my cross-examination of Witness T concludes.  

Thirdly, the motion for the disclosure of Serugendo materials, I feel, also is necessary for my cross-examination to be concluded.  And just while I have this opportunity, looking forward to next week, there's a motion for disclosure of payments by WVSS to Witness ZF that is pending, as well as my motion to meet with Witness XBM.  So I know it's difficult because the Trial Chamber is here from nine to six, but I would ask that you consider trying to resolve those issues.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
If I can assist with the PVs issue, I've had a text a moment ago -- literally, a moment ago.  It may be that Mr. Robinson heard my text machine go on my phone.  At the moment, one of the missing PVs seems to have been located.  We're waiting for it to come through on the fax machine.  That was the one Your Honours may recall was recorded on the 1st of September, but doesn't seem to have made its way into the dossier which was handed over to OTP in the week of the 5th of September.  And it may be that subsequently, when that PV was typed up, it was thought because of its date, it pre-dating the receipt of the dossier by the OTP, it must be in the dossier when, in fact, it fell between two stools.  So we should have that shortly.  And we understand that it may not be of any interest to anyone.  

The other PV, Your Honours may recall, I was concerned might be a typo, if I can use that expression, and it does look as if it is.  At the moment the information is that of the state can't find this PV either.  So, that's the moment at the moment.  It's in hand; it's coming.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  With regard to the motions, we are still considering them.  We expect that we will have resolution shortly, and certainly we expect that we will be able to deal with them before your examination is concluded. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness T, are you able to hear me?  Witness T, can you hear me?  
A.	Yes, I can hear you now, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, turning your attention to the speech of President Habyarimana on Exhibit D. NZ121, could you tell us, in summary, what it was that President Habyarimana said to the nation when he addressed them concerning the assassination of the president of Burundi?  
A.	I will attempt to provide a summary.  President Habyarimana's speech focused on the assassination or murder of President Ndadaye and his close senior collaborators, as a consequence of which violence broke out and there was a massive exit of Burundian refugees towards Rwanda.  He availed himself of that opportunity to remind Rwandans that the murderers were among some soldiers of the Burundi army who did not uphold the results of the elections, namely, when the Sarwanya FRODEBU won the elections; that is, the president and his party.  

He underscored the fact that the government of Rwanda was concerned by the onset of violence and that it did vehemently condemn such violence and, therefore, declared that the entire Rwandan people were in support of the Burundi people in this time of mourning.  And practical steps were taken to that effect, such that seven days of mourning were declared in Rwanda.  He also recalled that President Ndadaye and his party FRODEBU had won 65 per cent of the vote during the elections.  He went on to say that although President Ndadaye was at liberty to exercise power without sharing, he, however, had opted to be the president of all Burundians and therefore called on all parties, including those which had lost the elections, to govern along with him, and to that effect he appointed a prime minister who ordinarily would have been chosen or selected from his own party.  

He went on to say that the murder had sparked off violence, but that the people of Rwanda should learn from that experience so as to abstain from heeding any temptation to undertake any acts of violence in Rwanda.  

He also mentions or underscores that Rwanda had opted for multiparty democracy and that following the Arusha Accords the government had undertaken to avoid any -- or, rather, the government had undertaken to do everything possible to put an end to the war, and that in that connection Rwandans had to do everything to maintain peace and security and abstain from any acts of provocation based on ethnic or regional intolerance, in order to break the vicious circle of war which had characterised Rwanda so far.  

He again goes on to remind Rwandans that only peace, and not war, can contribute to unity, peace and development.  He recalls that peace is invaluable -- or, rather, could be compared in his own words, that is, peace could be compared to the situation in countries which have oil -- even though Rwanda does not have -- because peace would be the only oil that Rwanda needs to use or that Rwanda could use in order to develop.  

These, in broad strokes, are the ideas put forth in that speech, but I also note that he calls on political parties, the print media, radio, be it public or private radio stations, were called upon to do everything to ensure public security and to abstain from any language or the use of any language that may spark violence within the Rwandan community.  He underscored the need to maintain security.  He highlighted unity of all Rwandans.  He talked about development and multiparty democracy, as well as condemn war in all its forms.  

He went on to congratulate or commend the Rwandan armed forces for their determination to maintain peace, particularly on the 26th of October, which would be the Armed Forces Day, that is, the day of the Rwandan armed forces.  
I hope that this has been a faithful summary of this document, this text.  That is all I can say in respect of that document.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness T.  That was an excellent summary, and I think you've given the Judges a very clear idea of what the president said on that occasion.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, if the witness could be shown Exhibit No. 11 in my packet of documents which were faxed to Mr. Hometowu on the 24th of May.  It is also part of a broadcast on RTLM for the 30th of October 1993.  It's K-number K0211171 through 73.  
THE WITNESS:
I have the document before me, Counsel.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And is this a broadcast from a communiqué from the MRND party, signed by Mr. Nzirorera, concerning the death of the president of Burundi?  
A.	Yes, I see it was done at Kigali on the 29th of October, signed by the secretary general of the MRND, Joseph Nzirorera. 
Q.	And I'd like to turn your attention to the second page of this communiqué, which ends in "7-2" and it also has a page 9 listed there, and at the very end of the first paragraph there, at the last three lines, it starts with the bureau politique of MRND, and continues with the word "irisaba", and I'm wondering if you could read those three lines to us, either in Kinyarwanda or in French, so that we may learn the contents of that communiqué.  
A.	Very well.  Please give me a moment.  

"The MRND politburo requests or firmly desires that the international community should do all in its power to ensure that the authorities from popular democracy should be established as soon as possible and that the following should be put in place."  
Q.	And then if you can read to yourself the remainder of the communiqué and give us a summary, if you can, of what the MRND communiqué says.  
A.	So the message deals with appreciation shown by the politburo of the MRND to the various countries, international organisations that were rescuing the Burundian refugees -- 
MR. MORLEY:
May I -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- to not -- 
MR. MORLEY:
May I offer a thought, Your Honour?  My learned friend, Mr. Webster, and I have just been quietly conferring, and this is perhaps a persistent problem with the use of documents in this sort of case.  My learned friend is putting the document in front of the witness, inviting the witness to read through the document.  The document, of itself, speaks to the witness and gives evidence or information to the witness which my learned friend then seeks to get the witness to articulate before the Court and evidentially adopt.  But the difficulty which arises here, technically and procedurally and quite properly, is we don't know whether this witness had any idea of the contents of the document before it was put in front of him.  In other words, he's being asked to offer information to Your Honours based on what he's learning from the document, but not based on what he knows of his own knowledge.  
And it may be that the more appropriate way of dealing with this is that the witness is asked, "Are you aware of a communiqué from the MRND concerning the following?"  If the answer is no, then it is of little evidential value to put the document in front of the witness and have him simply read out its contents and then invite him to comment on whether such a document had been created and what it might have meant on the part of the MRND.  I hope the point is well taken.  

It's a difficulty which is persistent with the use of documents here, but the short point is this witness is being told what to say through being shown the document, and it is material which he's offering in evidence, not necessarily based on his own knowledge.  And that would, of course, not be proper evidence.  Does that help?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President -- well, first of all, I remind everyone that this is cross-examination, so I'm entitled to put propositions to a witness and have him comment on those propositions that are part of our case.  Among those propositions is the fact that the MRND, after the death of President Ndadaye, took a position of reconciliation rather than a position of inciting violence, which is what the Prosecution has put forward as its theory based on the Hutu Power rally of the 23rd of October held by the MDR party.  So I believe I'm entitled to ask the witness to give his comments on this.  

I'm happy to ask the witness first whether he has independent recollection of the contents of the communiqué, but if he doesn't, I don't see any reason why I can't put the communiqué in front of him and have him comment on it.  
MR. MORLEY:
The only thought I have in response to that, my learned friend is right, he's conducting a cross-examination, but what is taking place is tantamount to a witness being in the witness box in a case of murder, the witness not having seen the murder; the witness being shown a witness statement by somebody who did see the murder; the witness being asked to read the witness statement by the person who saw the murder and then give evidence that the murder was seen by the witness.  And that, of course, would not be allowed under the usual rules of cross-examination.  

What my learned friend is entitled to do is put propositions, but what he's not entitled to do, I respectfully submit, is put evidence into the court through the mouth of this witness which originates effectively through the mouth of another.  

Now, in the case of the document, the evidence would emerge effectively either of its own existence in the sense that it speaks of itself, or through the presentation of the person who wrote the document.  My learned friend is entitled to put propositions, certainly, but not get one witness to give the -- to give into Court not through his own knowledge evidence arising from another and written and encapsulated in a document not seen by the witness before.  

I hope the point is shortly stated and the distinction between cross-examination proper and this line of questioning is made.  
(Pages 15 to 34 by Karen Holm)



























1508H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the first -- our first question is, is the purpose of this cross-examination to provide information of the content of the document?
MR. ROBINSON:
That's one aspect.  That is preliminary to my ultimate purpose, which is to get the witness's testimony.  But before I can get the witness's testimony, I want to give you knowledge of the content of the document.  

It seems to me that I have to proceed basically in three steps here:  Number one, to have the document admitted; number two, to have you learn the contents of the document, since it's not in your language or mine; and, number three, to ask the witness questions about the document.  So that's basically how I'm trying to proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Well, one of the problems we have with that is that, if the witness is going to be asked about the document, shouldn't you establish his knowledge of the document first? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I can do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because if that's the point, if the witness is going to comment on the document rather than on factual issues, we have a concern about him proceeding in this way unless the witness has prior knowledge of the document.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I can do that.  I can do that.  I think that, for me, it's preferable if the witness gives his recollection without the benefit of the document as to what the MRND said.  It seems preferable to proceed than simply having him look at the document and tell us what it says rather -- you get more accurate information that way.  But if we want to do it the other way, we can do it that way also.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  What you have just proposed wasn't what you were doing.  We prefer your proposition, and it probably would save time as well. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Let me try first -- let me -- I neglected to offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ122, so I would like to first do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ122 admitted) 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, again, it's still only -- it's in what language? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Kinyarwanda. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness T, during the late October of 1993, were you aware of a communiqué that was issued by the MRND party concerning the death of President Ndadaye? 
A.	Yes, of course, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, would it be more accurate for you to give us your own recollection of this communiqué of 11 -- or, 13 years ago or for you to have the communiqué in front of you and give us your recollection of that communiqué after having seen the transcript of its broadcast?  
A.	Counsel, I cannot claim -- Counsel, if I have knowledge of the events that occurred in Rwanda, I cannot claim to support this with a given communiqué on such a date, that was broadcast on such a radio.  I am not in a position to do this.  However, in broad terms, I have general knowledge of the events that unfolded, but I cannot cite the communiqués, their authorship.  I can only relate the position of the party I was a member of, and my knowledge of this is general. 
Q.	So turning to Exhibit 122 -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, what I would like to do now is have a small portion of this communiqué made -- translated into our languages so that you can understand this portion of the communiqué.  The exhibit is in evidence.  I can have my legal assistant read the three lines, or I could have the witness do it.  Is -- to me, it seems like it makes no practical difference, but if it's technically insists (sic) that I don't do this with the witness, I can do it with my legal assistant.  So how would you like me to proceed?
MR. PRESIDENT:
It doesn't matter who reads the document. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  I'll have my legal assistant read those three lines.  

But maybe if I could just take the liberty of making one comment, particularly to Judge Short.  I know, Judge Short -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Why -- why do you want to make a comment to me?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
No, it's okay.  Let him make his comment. 

MR. ROBINSON:
No.  I know, Judge Short, that you know the rules of evidence very well and the rules of procedure and you know how to try a case.  The problem I'm having right now is different -- what we encounter in our own legal system is that the -- the exhibit is in a language that we don't understand.  Otherwise, there would be no need to read it.  We could all -- once it's admitted, we could all look at it, and we could have the witness questioned about it.  So the problem that front -- confronted with during this examination and others is to make this transition between a piece of paper that is -- is incomprehensible to us and the questions I want to ask the witness about it.  

So I just want to explain to you, at least from my point of view, why I'm doing what I'm doing.  So thank you for listening to that.  

And if we can have the -- my legal assistant read from page 0211173, the third full paragraph. 

And the speaker will be Leopold Nsengiyumva.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
(No interpretation) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I apologise.  The English booth had not gotten the relay.  Would it be possible to start the reading again?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  Could you also remind me of where you're reading from, please.
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
I'm reading from K-0211173, third paragraph.  I repeat:  "The bureau politique of the MRND invites all Rwandans and members of the MRND to remain vigilant and see to the provision of security so that the problems in Burundi should not compromise peace in Rwanda."  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness T, now turning to you, was it your understanding that the position of the MRND was that the events that had happened in Burundi should not be the cause of violence in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, of course, especially since Burundi had -- had almost gone to war about what the ANMN (phonetic) represented for events in Burundi.  It was felt that Rwanda wanted to interfere in Burundi's internal affairs.  There were a number of countries and -- surrounding Burundi, and these neighbours had had a meeting -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is not clear at all for the interpreter.  Half of that sentence was lost.  
THE WITNESS:
And especially through RTLM, from that moment on, RTLM decided to enter the political debate.  So this issue followed, especially, complaints by Burundian officers on Rwandan interference.  So this was an extract from a general speech that had been made by President Habyarimana on that occasion.  

I made reference to that event when I spoke of the government in exile, and also to a meeting at subregional level that took resolutions to the effect that peace should be restored as quickly as possible to Burundi by reinstalling the authorities of the party that had won the election. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, we see that this communiqué is signed on the 27th of October 1993, and I want to call your attention to an allegation in our indictment.  It's paragraph 25.2, in which it says that "On or about the 27th of October 1993, Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse --" 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  I may be quibbling over form, but I have repeatedly objected anytime Mr. Robinson has read the indictment into the record, and I'm objecting now because there's a way to ask a question to get the answer he wants without doing that.  So I'm objecting to the form of the question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm trying to make a link for you for an allegation in the indictment, and I'm going to ask the witness about this particular allegation.  It seems to me that it's useful to have the record show that the particular issue that's being now addressed relates to a particular paragraph of the indictment.  I don't see why Mr. Webster should be afraid to find out whether the allegations in his indictment are accurate or not.  If there -- it would seem to be to assist everyone that there be some reference if I'm going to ask a witness about a particular meeting that's alleged in the indictment.  So I don't understand, really, why there's an objection to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, could you clarify why that's -- there's something wrong with that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
With this particular question, Mr. Robinson is referring us to a specific -- specific incident that was pleaded in the indictment.  I have no problem with that.  The issue that I take is when whole paragraphs of the indictment are read into the record and a witness is asked to comment.  

With this particular paragraph we're only talking about one incident, but in other paragraphs of the indictment, sometimes a proposition is made in the indictment that has several different strains to it and relies upon several different sources of information to establish.  So my objection at this point is not to bringing a specific incident to the attention of the witness, but just the habit of reading whole paragraphs into the indictment (sic) and asking the witness to comment.  

My suggestion to the Court is that it's inappropriate, and I'd like to maintain that objection.  With this particular question, it's not much of an issue because we're talking about one particular incident, but I do not want to get into the habit of reading the indictment into the record and then having the witness comment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What you are saying, if I may use -- if I may use my language, you're saying that you don't object to him putting a simple proposition to the witness if he wants to provide evidence in rebuttal to it -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- but your objection is to him putting multiple propositions at the same time -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Multiple propositions -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- and reading directly from the indictment into his questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why should reading from the indictment be a problem?  If what he does, would it be a more accurate way of putting the proposition that he wants to have unrebutted?  I -- I could take the point of reading a paragraph in the indictment which contains multiple propositions and multiple ideas.  I -- I think it is -- it is obvious that there's a problem with the witness being asked to comment on multiple propositions at the same time.  There could not be an accurate answer, an accurate answer in terms of evidentiary response to that.  I don't understand the problem with regard to one proposition.  
MR. WEBSTER:
In this particular instance, we're talking about one incident -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah. 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- so this is a unique paragraph in this indictment.  Most of the paragraphs that Mr. Robinson has tried to read into the indictment were conclusory paragraphs.  They -- they were multiple -- multiple propositions -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I've -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping) so -- so I'm making a distinction between the two --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah. 

MR. WEBSTER:
-- and I'm simply insisting on making an objection of form here with respect to this particular question because I do not want to get into the habit of allowing something like that to pass.  I would prefer that we refrain from reading portions of the indictment into a question.  If Mr. Robinson wants to ask the witness, "Directing your attention to the 27th of October 1993, does -- did such-and-such an event happen," or, "Were you present," or, "Does that represent -- is that a contradiction," that's one thing.  But I do not support the idea of reading a whole paragraph from the indictment and then asking the witness to comment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I can do this in -- in a different -- slightly different way if it's of any -- of any consequence.  So I'm just going to -- I've already directed the Trial Chamber, for its own information in following these proceedings, to paragraph 25.2 of the indictment.  And I'll put to the witness the following question:  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, it's claimed that, on or about the 27th of October 1993, Mr. Karemera, Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, along with Colonel Bagosora, Augustin Ngirabatware -- that's N-G-I-R-A-B-A-T-W-A-R-E -- among other high-level officials of the MRND, participated in a rally with thousands of persons in attendance at the Umuganda stadium in Gisenyi.  

My first question to you is whether or not you have ever heard of such a rally being held on the 
27th of October 1993 during the period of mourning for President Ndadaye.  
A.	But during that period of mourning, the seven days that were officially proclaimed by the president of the republic, besides, some officers, if my memory serves me right, had gone to Bujumbura to the funeral.  

But, in answer to your question, I am not aware of such a meeting. 
Q.	And are you -- you have attended many, many meetings of the MRND, as you've testified to.  Are you ever aware of an occasion in which Colonel Bagosora addressed an MRND rally? 
A.	I have no recollection of Colonel Bagosora speaking in MRND rallies, at least the ones I attended.  It would come as a surprise to me. 
Q.	Now, turning your attention to this period of October, November, and December of 1993, are you ever aware of an occasion in which the MRND préfectoral committee of Kigali-ville préfecture issued a communiqué, critical of the Interahamwe after a rally had led to violence? 
A.	Are you referring to the period from October to December '93?  
Q.	That's correct.  And, in particular, we've had some evidence that there was a rally in Kibungo, an MRND rally, and that after that rally there was some violence that spread into Kigali, and that, in reaction to that, according to Witness UB, the MRND at Kigali-ville préfecture level issued a communiqué, criticising the Interahamwe, and, as a result of that communiqué, according to Witness UB -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, I think the Chamber has already indicated that it would be better if you do not refer to testimony of other witnesses and invite comment from the witness.  You can put the proposition to the witness without referring to -- or, without stating that this is the testimony of a particular witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Very well. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Can't you do that?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I can. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So let me start my question over, Witness T.  Are you aware of an occasion in which there had been a rally of the MRND in Kibungo préfecture; there had been some violence after the rally that had spilled into Kigali-ville; that, thereupon, the préfectoral committee of Kigali-ville MRND had issued a communiqué, critical of the Interahamwe; and that the president of the Kigali-ville préfectoral committee had, thereupon, been criticised by the MRND executive bureau at the national level for issuing such a communiqué? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness is supposed to answer that with a "yes" or "no" answer, that he is aware of all that? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Maybe I should ask does any of that ring a bell. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I object to the form of the question.  Not that it hurts the Prosecution, but we want a record that's clear.  Ask the witness if -- if there was a rally in Kibungo and then go on.  But, I mean, we have a statement with -- with -- with at least six or seven different parts to it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I can try to simplify the question, Mr. President.  I realise it's not a very good question.  I'm really trying to see -- give as much information to the witness to try to see if, yes or no, he recalls.  But -- 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were you aware of any -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Robinson, there's one other problem.  The speed of communication is causing a problem to the recording process.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were you aware of an occasion in which the MRND at the Kigali-ville préfectoral level had issued a communiqué, critical of the Interahamwe?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  We don't get the sound in the interpreters' booth.  We can see the witness is speaking, but there's no sound.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hometowu, can you hear me?
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Yes, I am online, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
So, Counsel, what I was saying was that I am aware of a communiqué relating to the events -- or, to the Interahamwe.  I am not aware that there was any such communiqué between October and December 1993.  I am aware, instead, of a communiqué relating to the Interahamwe, but outside of that period or that time frame.  And I participated in that communiqué, but the -- the one that you are referring to from MRND officials in Kigali town, I am not aware of that communiqué. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness T.  And I'm going to get to the communiqué I believe you're referring to when we discuss the events of the first of February 1994.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Meanwhile, the Judges are conferring, so I'm going to be quiet for a minute.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you may continue.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness T, now I would like to ask you, turning your attention to November of 1993, whether elections were held in the demilitarised zone occupied by the -- in the area occupied by the RPF.  
A.	Counsel, I did not get your question.  
Q.	I'm asking you whether, in November of 1993, elections were held in the area occupied by the RPF in Rwanda.  
A.	Yes, indeed.  Well, maybe the -- oh, I'm sorry. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you tell us what the results were of that election? 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I'm under the impression the witness didn't quite answer the question.  

This is from the interpreters.  

There was some interference.  
THE WITNESS:
The RPF did organise elections in the areas it occupied, and I believe that some consultations had taken place before coming to that decision, which, by the way, was endorsed by the MRND, with a view to giving the RPF an opportunity to assess its strength on the ground in terms of elections so that, subsequently, they could be able to participate in the upcoming elections.  

So the RPF lost the elections.  And opposition parties, such as the MDR, particularly the MDR, and the PL, also lost.  In fact, the elections were -- were won clearly by the -- the -- the MRND candidates.  And that would lead to murders of some of the MRND members who failed to comply with the desiderata of the RPF.  And that was the onset of the assassinations or murders that were reported to the UNAMIR.  And UNAMIR promised to conduct investigations, but the investigations never took place.  And that is why UNAMIR was considered to have turned a deaf ear to the activities of the -- of the RPF. 

So I am aware of those things that may have happened at about that time. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And in December of 1993, did the RPF battalion arrive in Kigali pursuant to the provisions of the Arusha Peace Accord? 
A.	Yes, I think it was towards the end of December, the very last days of the month of December.  It is at that time that this event was made known to all Rwandans.  And may I say that it did compound further the problems of security in Kigali town.  It was aggravating the problems because some were opposed to the arrival of the RPF, and they were to be housed in a building set aside for parliament.  So it was an event that received significant media coverage.  
Q.	And a few days after the arrival of the RPF battalion, was there a ceremony where President Habyarimana was sworn in as the president of the republic under the broad-based transitional government? 
A.	It must have been on the 5th or the 6th of January, if my recollection is correct, that the institutions under the Arusha accord were supposed to be set up.  The president took the oath of office in the morning, and I believe that in the afternoon the government was supposed to be sworn in and, subsequently, the assembly as well.  

Well, things didn't work out.  Some members did not show up, and things began to get rather complicated that afternoon.  And I do recall that some journalists put questions to 
Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the then prime minister, who answered in a rather jittery manner.  

So, indeed, the president was sworn in to office, but neither the government nor the parliament did take office.  And that, I may say, was the main obstacle to the Arusha Accords.  Yes, indeed, President Habyarimana had taken office in the morning, I think. 
Q.	And was it the Interahamwe who had prevented the other members of the government from taking their oaths of office? 
A.	I do not quite understand how the Interahamwe could have blocked or stopped a swearing-in ceremony when the UNAMIR is part of the event, when government is in place and all state institutions are in place.  I do not understand how that could have happened, and I do not believe it could have happened.  All I know, simply, is that the Interahamwe were there to support the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  So that's what I had said.  

I mean, it is said anything that went wrong is blamed on the Interahamwe.  Anything that goes on is blamed on the Interahamwe.  That could not have been the case all the time.  That is probably what led to the speech of the 19th of January, by way of protest, because everything was blamed on the Interahamwe.  You see, people were being called upon to be serious, somewhat.  You see, the Interahamwe were not the gendarmes.  They were not a police force, and they could not be everywhere and doing everything.  So let me state very clearly and categorically that this is not a reflection of what reality was. 
Q.	And had the Interahamwe committee received any instructions from anyone in the MRND that they should prevent members of the government from taking the oaths of office? 
A.	I do not quite see how the MRND, which, as it best could, supported the accords, and under circumstances where their candidate had taken the oath of office, I don't see how you could want one thing and its opposite at the same time.  

You see, the complications, the obstacles that arose must be found elsewhere, that is, within the parties that were pitted one against the other.  And I cannot ascribe this to the Interahamwe. 
Q.	In connection with the swearing-in ceremonies, did the Interahamwe instigate any violence with the intent to provoke a confrontation with the Belgian UNAMIR soldiers so that they would force their withdrawal from Rwanda? 
A.	Again, all that which went wrong and which was not acceptable was blamed on the Interahamwe.  No, but who are the Interahamwe?  They were the youth wing of the MRND only.  Rwanda had in place a gendarmerie, and the -- well, I -- I -- I don't -- the institutions were in place to discharge their duties, and I think this is not possible.  This is unbelievable for anybody who knew and who went through that experience.  This -- this is -- this is unbelievable. 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe committee receive any instructions from anyone in the MRND to provoke a confrontation with the Belgian UNAMIR soldiers? 
A.	No such directives or instructions from the MRND or from anybody whosoever.  On what strength would such be issued?  How would you come against the UNAMIR soldiers with their terms of reference endorsed by government and supported by President Habyarimana?  Well, if there had been any confrontations, I -- I would have said something else.  But any such instructions from an official, I -- I don't know.  

I am referring to the context in which UNAMIR was being blamed for their own very behaviour because they had gone to provoke people in their homes as if they were occupying the country.  And there are things that are not acceptable under such -- such circumstances.  

A specific answer to your question would be that I am not aware of any specific directives in that regard.  However, the committees were instructed to meet such-and-such a committee, as need be, in order to address one problem or the other.  But if any -- if there were any such instructions as you referred to, I am not aware of that.  
Q.	After the failure to swear in the transitional government, did UNAMIR issue a press release in which they blamed the Interahamwe for that failure? 
A.	At that time the weakest party got the blame.  Anything that went wrong was blamed on the Interahamwe, so much so that a press organ and UNAMIR did put out a communiqué, which, to my mind, were simply a vicious circle of various statements that had been broadcast by Radio Muhabura.  

So what is important is to note that there was no instruction from the MRND to the Interahamwe to react.  But, again, let me say that the UNAMIR had just arrived about a month ago, and they had not been able to conduct any investigations into the murders in areas conducted -- or -- or, controlled by the RPF.  

But, again, one could wonder on what grounds such statements were -- were being made.  And it is within that context that the letter of the 19th of January did put the question very clearly as to the neutrality of UNAMIR in view of their mandate. 

You see, it was clearly visible that the UNAMIR had taken a position in support of the RPF, and everybody all over knows that this is the -- the truth.  Even General Dallaire has confirmed this truism in his -- in his book.  So at that time there were many things that happened, and we -- as far as I know, the Interahamwe had nothing to do with it.  I wasn't personally aware of those demonstrations because it was, indeed, the opportunity to highlight professional commitments and -- and what have you.  

But how many Interahamwe were there during those demonstrations?  There were some indeed, but I do not believe that they had the capacity, nor the ability, to prohibit any such significant event.  
Q.	Witness, we're going to next -- I'm going to next ask you to discuss the letter that was written by the Interahamwe committee to Mr. Booh-Booh on the 19th of January 1994.  That's Exhibit P. 13.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, perhaps while that can be searched for in the state, perhaps this would be a good time to take a break.  And if the witness could be asked to look at the document at the break, and I'll ask him questions about it when we return.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we take the mid-afternoon break now.  
(Court recessed from 1559H to 1629H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, turning your attention to Exhibit P. 13, the letter sent by the national committee of the Interahamwe to Mr. Booh-Booh, can you give us a short summary of what the contents of this letter are? 
A.	The essential point in this document is an invitation to UNAMIR to greater neutrality in order to be able to discharge their mandate and enjoy greater credibility within the Rwandan community.  

Secondly, a call for greater moderation in statements which should be made following a prior investigation into the facts.  

Thirdly, against the backdrop of some acts of indiscipline and trouble with UNAMIR, there is a -- a call for calm and order within the ranks of the various troops that were exercising these acts of indiscipline. 

Thirdly (sic), the Interahamwe committee offers UNAMIR an opportunity to explain its position and offer its collaboration towards a positive contribution to the substance of the UNAMIR mission. 

So, in fact, the committee was asking -- or, was seeking audience with UNAMIR.  I believe those are the main points that flow from that letter, which, may I say, also indicated that all the accusations levelled against Interahamwe are not necessarily true because it has been accused right from the beginning, and throughout, for acts that may be grounded in truth or not in truth. 

That is my summary of the crux of the matters dealt with in that letter from the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Now, directing your attention, particularly to the Belgian contingent of UNAMIR, back in 1993, had you signed a letter to King Baudouin of Belgium, asking Belgium not to contribute troops to UNAMIR? 
A.	I did sign that letter in my own hand, and several others, not only members of the committee, but Rwandans from all walks of life.  Of course, those who supported the RPF didn't see things in that light.  So this, indeed, was a petition to the Belgian king when it was determined that Belgian soldiers would be included in UNAMIR, whereas, previously the RPF and its supporters had required that the French leave as a prior condition.  

I was a signatory to this petition.  I do not recall the date, but it was shortly before the arrival of that force.  And the point was being made that it would be extremely difficult for a former colonial master to act in all neutrality in a situation which calls for action within a former colony. 

So that basically was the thrust of that petition, which highlighted the dangers and the risks, as well as the weaknesses, that would arise in case of such an involvement. 
Q.	Unfortunately, we've never been able to find a copy of that letter, but I'm wondering if you could tell me whether or not, as part of the objections to the Belgians' contributing troops to UNAMIR, there was any concern relating to the Belgians' refusal to deliver weapons after the RPF attack of October 1990.  
A.	The concerns raised in that petition indicated -- or, included, among other things, a review of an incident that had occurred previously and which had been the subject of diplomatic consultations between the senior officials of both countries.  It was recalled that, even at the very beginning of this war, as launched by the RPF, the Belgian government had not supplied the arms and munitions that had been ordered and paid for in advance.  And this was, again, quite alive in the -- in the minds of Rwandans, who put forth that petition with a view to expressing their ideas to the highest authorities of the Belgian king -- kingdom. 
Q.	And after the Belgian troops did arrive as part of UNAMIR, were there instances where they attacked authorities in Rwanda and family members of authorities in Rwanda? 
A.	There is the well-known case of Bagosora -- rather, Barayagwiza, Jean-Bosco, who was attacked by some Belgian UNAMIR troops dressed in civilian attire.  I think a number of letters were written in that connection.  

And if my mind doesn't -- my recollection doesn't fail me, General Dallaire took a very open position when he explained that these were independent acts of indiscipline.  But the damage had already been done, and this case was carried extensively in the media, particularly -- particularly by RTLM.  

Again, the UNAMIR had promised to do this and that, but whenever an issue arose concerning the RPF, nothing seemed to have been done.  And in other cases, they were very quick to condemn the MRND and the Interahamwe.  So they had taken sides; particularly, the head of that force had personal relations with senior officials of the opposition.  And it was clear.  He was open.  They had clearly and visibly taken sides and demonstrated it openly.  I would say that some of the UNAMIR troops displayed that position openly.  

And today, General Dallaire, may I say, basically recognises his failure in his book, whereas, if you look at the letter of the 19th from the national committee, it contained some measure of premonition when it referred to the credibility of UNAMIR and the depletion of that credibility if UNAMIR were not to change its attitude. 
Q.	Now, turning to the fax sent by General Dallaire, allegedly on the 11th of January 1994, which is Exhibit D. NZ15 -- if that could be placed in front of you.  
A.	Yes, I do have the document before me, and I have the French version.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  

Now, this is a fax in which, in the first paragraph, it's referred to that the force commander, who is General Dallaire, was put in contact with an informant by a very, very important government politician.  And the informant is a top-level trainer in the cadre of the Interahamwe armed militia of the MRND.  

Now, there's been evidence that the informant referred to in this fax was Jean-Pierre Turatsinze, or Abubacar Turatsinze, and I want to ask you, first of all, was Mr. Turatsinze, in January -- in the middle of January 1994, still working for the MRND, as far as you know? 
A.	As far as I know, in the month of January, Turatsinze, whose first name I didn't know as Jean-Pierre, but I knew him as Abubacar, at that time he was still among the ranks of the Interahamwe.  
Q.	And was he having some difficulty at that time accounting for weapons which had been issued to him? 
A.	I did, personally, experience a situation where Mr. Turatsinze raised some concerns with me to the effect that he was purportedly being suspected of having sold part of the weapons and that they were not fully distributed, as the case should have been. 
Q.	Now, the very, very important government politician that's referred to in paragraph one has been identified as Faustin Twagiramungu, the president of the MDR.  Now, were you aware that Mr. Turatsinze had gone to the president of the MDR with information about the Interahamwe? 
A.	I am not aware of that, and I would be surprised, in view of the relations between that opposition figure, that figure who did everything to denigrate and to -- should I say, to soil the -- the -- the image of the Interahamwe.  

Well, let me say that, regardless of the -- or, without neglecting the -- the availability of intelligence, I would be surprised that Mr. Twagiramungu, Faustin, such a distinguished figure, would have (unintelligible) Turatsinze, with all possible results being expressed by the witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
Before my learned friend continues, may I address Your Honours on a matter which may be an oversensitivity on my part, borne of my own experiences in my home jurisdiction?  

My learned friend, in the course of his last two questions, has suggested the identity of the informants to General Dallaire, and he has mentioned two names.  And he has indicated that, to put it bluntly, it appears to be a matter of evidence, or record.  

Speaking for my own part, I'm not sure that it's ever been a matter of evidence that the identity of the informants has been categorically specified.  But, secondly, one of those two people mentioned a moment ago is known to be alive and locatable, and I have a sensitivity, as I mentioned at the outset, borne of my own home jurisdiction, toward the identification of informants.  And what I would invite Your Honours to consider is that, before my learned friend starts announcing, with or possibly without good reason, the names of people who have discussed matters with UNAMIR -- and Your Honour knows the sensitivity of the fax of the 11th of January of 1994.  It is a document of substantial importance in Rwanda.  I would invite that Your Honour makes it clear to my learned friends that, if they're going to attempt to identify informants, they should first address Your Honour in closed session as to the propriety of doing so.  It's a very dangerous thing to do, potentially.  And, therefore, I find myself on my feet.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I -- I think the objection is borne of some unfamiliarity with the records of -- of the Tribunal.  For example, General Dallaire, in the Bagosora case, gave testimony in open session in which he identified these two people.  He has written -- identified them in his book.  
Faustin Twagiramungu testified publicly in front of the Belgian senate that he was the person who gave the information to General Dallaire, and we've already had testimony in this trial from Witness G and, I believe, from Mr. Mbonyunkiza that Mr. Turatsinze was believed to be the person who had contacted UNAMIR and was the informant referred to in this fax.  

So while in his home jurisdiction it may very well be that there's sensitivity to these issues, under the facts of this matter, there shouldn't be any problem with repeating things that are notorious in the public domain at this time.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I say, I'm grateful for my learned friend's brief summary of the origins of his assertions.  What Your Honours may feel is that, before one ever announced the name of an informant, that is precisely the sort of thing my learned friend should address Your Honours about in closed session, to explain why it is he's about to announce the name of someone.  

For my own part, I don't recall Mbonyunkiza or G identifying a certain person as the informant in relation to that fax, and they certainly weren't able to specify the name with any certainty.  As for the other matters my learned friend has mentioned, somebody speaking at the Belgian senate and open testimony from General Dallaire in a different case, those are good reasons for Your Honours to allow my learned friend to question in open session.  

But what I'm doing, if I may, is fire a shot across my learned friend's bows in respect of simply blithely walking into the identification of informants.  As a matter of policy, one must tread carefully, and it should be done in a different way, with a little bit of forewarning to Your Honours as to why it's about to happen.  

I hope I haven't spoken out of turn. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't have anything further to say, Mr. President, unless -- I'm prepared to continue unless you wish to -- something else. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I was not going to stop you.  I was going to thank Mr. Morley for his -- the comments he made.  I'm not sure exactly how to respond to them, and so I don't at the moment. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I'm not even sure if they're well placed in this jurisdiction.  It's just a sensitivity I've developed over a number of years elsewhere.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness T, we've now discussed the first paragraph of this fax, and I want to turn to the second paragraph in which it is stated that Mr. Turatsinze, or the informant, was in charge of a demonstration which had occurred the previous Saturday; and the aim of those demonstrations were to target deputies of the opposition parties coming to ceremonies and target the Belgian soldiers; and that they hoped to provoke the RPF battalion to engage the demonstrators and provoke a civil war; and that deputies were to be assassinated upon entry or exit from parliament; and Belgian troops were to be provoked; and if the Belgian soldiers resorted to force, a number of them were to be killed and, thus, guarantee Belgian withdrawal from Rwanda.  

Is the information about the aims of the Interahamwe as related in paragraph two correct or false? 
A.	Regarding the assertion purported to be -- to have been made by Turatsinze, in which he implicates the Interahamwe in the ceremonies, I have nothing to say.  It is possible, indeed, probable.  As for the rest, I can very precisely give you my point of view.  It seems to me that this fax was inspired by events following the 6th of April, or that it was phrased in such a way as to predate suggestions to the effect of events that actually occurred.  

Now, regarding the information, the contents, what do they inspire in the person who received them with regard to the materiality of the fax?  As per the references given, I do not think it is for me to give an assessment because it is, in my opinion, too good to be true.  And I, therefore, do not really believe it.  With all due respect to the Court, it seems to me that it is too flagrant to be credible.  This fax does not appear between the 11th and the outbreak -- or, onset of the unfortunate events, and it is strange, given the sensitive nature of events that occurred subsequently.  
Q.	So -- 
A.	Why was this information not used?  
Q.	Based on your -- based on your knowledge of the events in Rwanda in around this period of 
	January 1994, is it your opinion that this fax was a document which was created after the 6th of April and backdated to the 11th of January? 
A.	That would be my conclusion from appearances.  But, first of all, I wonder about the authenticity of the document.  Is it -- 
Q.	Well -- 
A.	Why bring out this information which was of no use in preventing such a tragedy?  What is its relevance?  That is a question I ask myself. 
Q.	Well, the authenticity of this fax will be the subject of other evidence during the course of the case, but, in the meantime, I want to ask you about its content and whether or not, particularly with respect to paragraph two, there were any instructions to the Interahamwe to assassinate deputies upon their entry or exit from parliament and to provoke and, therefore -- and, therefore, kill Belgian soldiers.  
A.	I am taking cognizance of the fax and do not understand how viable that would be.  Can one have somebody assassinated simply because one wishes them to be killed, to have persons who were well known internationally, persons who were somehow protected by organisations such as UNAMIR?  
Q.	Well, did the Interahamwe committee receive any instructions to assassinate members of parliament as they exited or entered the building? 
A.	I have no knowledge of that fact, Counsel.  Was there a need to murder all the members?  Are names of members who were to be murdered given?  These are questions I ask myself as you put the questions to me.  I could be made to believe it, but I would have to be convinced.  
Q.	And was the committee of the Interahamwe ever given any instructions that Belgian troops were to be provoked and, if they resorted to force, a number of them were to be killed? 
A.	I would like to make a distinction in my remarks for various reasons, some of which are difficult to understand.

The young members might have had conflicts with some UNAMIR elements as well as Interahamwe elements, but I do not think it could have taken on such major characteristics, certainly not result in a plan to commit -- to -- to assassinate.  The reason there is talk of murdering a soldier sent into a country by an organisation like the United Nations, I, frankly, believe there is some element of despising what are normally referred to as banana republics.  How could such a plan be devised?  How could somebody conceive such a plan?  It seems incredible to me. 
Q.	Now, turning to the fourth paragraph, where the informant describes his own background and qualifications, it says that the informant is a former security member of the president.  To your knowledge, was Mr. Turatsinze ever a security member of the president? 
A.	Not to my knowledge.  And I do not believe I ever heard anyone talk about that.  One thing is true:  I know that that boy was a driver for a top leader in the security or intelligence service.  I know nothing more about him.  I do not know if he ever was a soldier, and certainly not if he was in the presidential security detail.  
Q.	It goes on to say that he is paid 150,000 Rwandan francs per month by the MRND party to train Interahamwe.  Was that true? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. Robinson, could you repeat the question, please?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	It also states that he is paid 150,000 Rwandan francs per month by the MRND party to train Interahamwe.  Was that true? 
A.	I'd like to give you some background on the salary scale that was officially applied in Rwanda.  I can talk about this with some certainty because I have knowledgeable sources.  I -- and I know exactly what President Habyarimana's salary was.  And the net salary was hundred (sic) and fifty thousand Rwandan francs.  It's very easy to go through the archives, and I wonder whether such a salary, given that Mr. Ngirumpatse earned a salary -- I do not know whether the party would have been in a position to pay him hundred (sic) and fifty thousand Rwandan francs.  

I earned a generous salary because of my functions, but such a salary, anyone can tell you that very few Rwandans, very few, could claim to earn such a salary.  You could count them on the fingers of your hand.  So anyone in a position to receive such privileged amounts, I certainly wonder what he would have been earning such money for, unless this man's lifestyle did not justify such remuneration. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Part of the sentence was lost.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, given what you know about the salaries in Rwanda at the time and what you know about Mr. Turatsinze, is there any possibility whatsoever that he was receiving a salary of a hundred and fifty thousand Rwandan francs per month from the MRND? 
A.	Actually, that is what I have just said, Counsel.  Such a salary at the time would correspond to more than 1,000 dollars, this even after devaluation.  But before, it was close to 1,800 American dollars of the time.  In one word, I do not believe that such a salary -- and I do not know, given the lifestyle or the life led by Turatsinze, it is not possible.  
Q.	I'd like to turn your attention to paragraph six of this fax, in which it states that the principal aim of the Interahamwe in the past was to protect Kigali from RPF.  Since UNAMIR mandate, he has been ordered to register all Tutsi in Kigali.  He suspects it is for their extermination.  The example he gave was that in 20 minutes his personnel could kill up to 1,000 Tutsis. 

Now, to your knowledge, was there any order to the Interahamwe or to Mr. Turatsinze to register all Tutsi in Kigali? 
A.	I do not believe. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says witness.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And as of the 11th of January 1994, did you have any suspicion that anyone in the MRND wanted the Tutsis to be exterminated? 
A.	In fact, the message here states that in the past the main objective of the Interahamwes was to protect the city from the RPF.  This objective of self-defence never changed, especially since when the RPF initially arrived and had its quarters operating officially from Kigali.  So they mention -- or, there is mention of the arrival of UNAMIR.  I am not aware of particular instructions except that people were asked to be careful to ensure that they were not caught with weapons.  

So as for extermination of Tutsis -- of a thousand Tutsis in the space of 20 minutes, it is something I do not understand, personally.  Who gave such an order?  Why, and why not before?  I do not believe it.  How can one deal with such a statement provided by an informant and not really be overwhelmed by it, provided it is true?  
(Pages 35 to 53 by Ann Burum)









1715H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, it's noted at the last sentence of paragraph 8 that the informant had requested that he and his family be placed under protection, and then in paragraph 10, it was recommended that the informant be granted protection and evacuated out of Rwanda.  Now, given the situation with Mr. Turatsinze that existed at the time concerning his suspicious -- or, being suspected of selling weapons, do you believe that Mr. Turatsinze had a motive to provide UNAMIR with sensational information to extricate himself from personal problems at the time?  
A.	The Mr. Turatsinze I know, at one point, from January to February -- or, between those two months, expressed his concerns in the way I explained; otherwise, I have no knowledge.  I do not want to venture into speculation on something that seems to me incredible.  How -- in view of such information, if one is a responsible leader, someone working with a mission, a humanitarian mission like UNAMIR, how does one do nothing in the face of such a statement and only report the matter after the fact?  Because I do not think that the fax was discussed prior to the 6th of April or much later than that.  Now, as you ask me questions, I myself have questions as to the credibility of the text I have before me.
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, during this period after the failure to swear in the remainder of the transitional government, was there a statement made by President Kagame on Radio Muhabura to the effect of what the RPF would do if the Arusha Accords were not implemented?
A.	I did not personally hear a speech on that radio station, which, by the way, I did not ever listen to.  However, those who listened to the radio station would report what they heard, and there were some newspapers that would give transcripts.  However, the information would sometimes mention a resumption of the war, and the two belligerents were preparing to resume war, both of them.  And this was a well-known fact.  However, the RPF was threatening to resume the war if the Arusha Accords were not put in place quickly, when there was deadlock in the implementation of the Arusha Accords -- that is why they sent or did not send -- they did not send their deputies to the investiture ceremony.  That is what I know, that -- the deputies of the RPF and Lando's PL wing, who were setting up some sort of alliance, I do not think they attended because of the deadlock in implementation of the Arusha Accords.  And one cannot swear in somebody who is absent, who has actually stated that they have no intention of coming to the investiture ceremony. 
Q.	Now, I would like you to look at Exhibit D. NZ17, which is a communiqué issued by the national committee of the Interahamwe "in relation to the crucial problems our country is facing".
A.	I have the document before me, Counsel.
Q.	Could you explain -- could you explain to the Trial Chamber what were the events which led up -- could you explain to the Trial Chamber what were the events which led up to the issuance of this communiqué?
A.	Actually, with the arrival of the RPF battalion and, also, following the peril in the security situation for various reasons, tension rose with the arrival of the Kigali-based RPF battalion, and, coupled with the deadlock in the installation of the institutions and statements given by various parties, violence resumed and much more virulently in Kigali.  Kigali was marked by grenade explosions, shooting.  There were, and had been, incidents between members of the RPF on sorties and UNAMIR elements who were exiting the CND, who were seen to be shooting -- demonstrating crowds.  So I can talk about open acts of provocation in front of UNAMIR, the gendarmerie, so that Kigali was marked by such violence, and the opposition parties, as always, blamed the MRND for starting this off, because they felt the Interahamwe were at the root of all the violence.  And so, as a matter of urgency, on the 1st of February 1994, we were called by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse to focus on the issue so as to brainstorm on the accusations that had been levelled at the Interahamwe.  Different views led to a message, which is contained in the communiqué, to resolve the problem which was being lumped on the Interahamwe.

As a matter of fact, it did have an effect, because the violence diminished because Interahamwe members were forbidden from wearing uniform such as that worn by those sparking the violence and who were claiming it was the Interahamwe -- responsible in the ensuing days.  
Q.	And was there a particular violence that occurred in an area called Gishushu, G-I-S-H-U-S-H-U, which led to the issuance of this particular communiqué?
A.	Actually, the Gishushu area is close to the CND building.  It was in that area, and that is the area where most of the violence was noted, so that is why that locality is mentioned, in particular, in the communiqué.
Q.	And was the violence committed by people who were wearing the kitenge worn normally by Interahamwe?
A.	That is correct, Counsel, and that is why the discussions of committee members found that there should be a prohibition of -- people should be prohibited from wearing the uniform, and others were to be fined for wearing the uniform -- uniform, and the fine was -- it amounted to 200,000 francs.  This measure was, in a way, a way of recognising that this issue had led to trouble, been fomented, and that is how it featured in the communiqué. 
Q.	Now, in addition to this particular communiqué and the problems that led to its being issued, were there other occasions where people who were Interahamwe from certain areas, such as Gikondo or Remera, had committed acts of violence which the national committee of the Interahamwe and the MRND condemned?
A.	There was a rumour that disturbed -- sorry, there was a noise that disturbed my hearing of your question.  Would you please repeat it?
Q.	Yes.  Apart from the incidents that led to the issuance of this communiqué, were there other occasions when it came to the attention of the national committee for the Interahamwe and Mr. Ngirumpatse that certain Interahamwe in areas, such as Gikondo and Remera, had committed acts of violence which were condemned?
A.	Correct, Counsel.  In fact, during that period, murders took place, in particular, one Katimba, who was a CDR member.  There was open hostility among the youth wings in all areas, peripheral areas, such Gikongoro or Remera.  So there were people who were convicted by Mr. Mathieu.  You may recall that I told you of a period, although I do not remember exactly when, but, yes, there was a time when a number of Interahamwe, who were identified in the fighting, had to be expelled by Mr. Ngirumpatse, and they had to ask for forgiveness by explaining that they had been provoked.  I know that that sort of thing happened, at least as far as the Interahamwe in Remera and a group in Gikondo or Magerwa.
Q.	Now, in February of 1994, was there an occasion when the Interahamwe chairman in Gitega was murdered?
A.	No, I'm not aware of it.
Q.	Okay.  If you could be shown document number 12 that's attached to my letter of 24 May 2006.  It's a report of Mark Nees.  It has K-number K0102138.  It's dated the 10th of February 1994, and on the top it says, "Neesmar" --  that's N-E-E-S-M-A-R -- 25.  And, Witness T, this is in English so it's going to be, really, a document that I have to read to you, but what it is, is an intelligence report from a UNAMIR officer from the Belgian battalion, named Mark Nees.  So let me know when you have the document.
A.	I have the document before me, Counsel. 
Q.	I'm just going to read to you paragraph 4.  It says that, "Last night four grenades exploded in the sector between Gitega and Nyamirambo at approximately 2130 hours.  This was further to the murder of Emmanuel Turatsingwe," -- that's spelled T-U-R-A-T-S-I-N-G-W-E -- "Interahamwe chairman in Gitega neighbourhood in Kigali.  It is said that he was doing the rounds of this neighbourhood with two others when one man then jumped on Turatsingwe and killed him by stabbing him with a bayonet.  The perpetrator managed to lose the two others by throwing four grenades.  Someone was arrested today.  It is said that he is an MDR supporter."

Do you know anything about this incident?
A.	No, I never took cognizance of the incident.  Moreover, I know the president of the Interahamwe in Gitega, and that was not the name.  Up to July 1994, this person was still alive.
Q.	Okay.  Now, in February of 1994 was an individual named Gatabazi assassinated?
A.	Yes, in February, I think on the 21st, 22nd or the 23rd, though, I think it is the 21st or 22nd, it was announced that Felicien Gatabazi had been assassinated. 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe have anything to do with that assassination?
A.	I do not think so, and I do not know whether investigations took place and concluded that the Interahamwe had had a hand in the killing.  Of course, immediately after learning of the death, it was widely thought that it was the Interahamwe behind the killing of Gatabazi, but, personally, together with another member of the provisional committee, we sought to go to Butare to attend the late Gatabazi's funeral, who was a very good friend of mine and that other person's.  The president of the PSD Abakozi youth wing, who was a former schoolmate, advised us not to go because of the tension amongst the Abakozi youth, who were whipped up against the Interahamwe, so that we did not attend that person's funeral.  Besides that, it was -- I had a lot of respect for the late Gatabazi, Felicien.
MR. MORLEY:
May it please, Your Honour, I'm on my feet -- I rise, to some extent, to see if we are all still awake.  The difficulty with that sort of answer is -- in fact, in response to the question which my learned friend put,  the answer was, "I don't know."  There is a tendency, a danger, and I've noticed it creeping in as we have proceeded through various questions about events in Rwanda leading up to April of 1994, for the witness to start expressing opinions as to what he thinks happened, without actually having knowledge of what it is that happened.

And in respect of the direct question, whether the Interahamwe were responsible for the death of the person referred to, he has said, "I don't think so, but lots of people thought so", to summarise the position.  And that's not an answer that is admissible in evidence.  The answer (sic) is, does he know.  And on the face of it, he doesn't know whether the Interahamwe were, or were not, and after that, it just becomes an expression of opinion.  And although it's late in the afternoon, I do invite Your Honours to keep an eye on this blurring between factual answers and the witness becoming almost an expert as to what it is that may or may not have been happening in Rwanda.  I hope the point is clear.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I can ask the question more precisely, and I think I can get an answer that is more clear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think you have to go over the question again.  The problem wasn't exactly a question.
MR. MORLEY:
Exactly, Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
On this occasion, the witness did answer the question and then went on to offer opinions, and he's not an expert.
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I understand that.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, did anyone from the MRND instruct the Interahamwe to assassinate Felicien Gatabazi?
A.	Not to my knowledge, Counsel.
Q.	And, recently, there has been testimony at this Tribunal from a former RPF soldier named Ruzibiza that it was the RPF who assassinated Gatabazi, and blamed it on the MRND.  Given your knowledge of the events of this time period, is it likely that that is, in fact, what occurred? 
MR. MORLEY:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That is --

MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have to say anything else, Mr. Morley.

Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
May I ask the witness if that's consistent with his knowledge of the events at that time?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness said he doesn't know.  You asked him for an opinion.  You asked him to say what is probable.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, after the assassination of Felicien Gatabazi, was an individual by the name of Martin Bucyana assassinated?  And that's B-U-C-Y-A-N-A.
A.	Yes, Mr. Bucyana, Martin, CDR president, was assassinated, I believe, the day after, if my recollections are correct.  Shortly before or shortly after Gatabazi's burial, he was assassinated in Mbazi commune.
Q.	Was the Interahamwe ever instructed to assassinate Mr. Bucyana and, to your knowledge, did the Interahamwe have anything to do with the assassination of Mr. Bucyana?  
A.	I have no knowledge of such an implication or directive by anyone.
Q.	Now, with respect to the CDR party, as the month of April -- excuse me, the months of February and March of 1994 went on, was there a debate about whether the CDR party should be allowed to have a seat in the parliament in the transitional government?
A.	I know that one of the causes for the deadlock in implementing the Arusha Accord centred on the exclusion of the CDR party from the power sharing, if I may use the term.  The RPF was opposed to this.
Q.	And did the MRND take the view that the CDR should be represented in the parliament once it had agreed to abide by the code of conduct of the broad-based transitional government?
A.	That is correct, yes.  The candidature of the CDR was supported by -- or, sponsored by the MRND.
Q.	And were you aware that on the 28th of March of 1994, the special representative of the secretary general, Mr. Booh-Booh, and the members of the diplomatic corps of Rwanda, led by the papal nuncio issued a press release in which they came out in favour of the admission of the CDR to the transitional national assembly?
A.	Yes, I am aware of that step.  As a matter of fact, people would say finally the international community is doing something to unblock this issue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have two exhibits which have actually not yet been distributed, and I would like to have them distributed at this time.  They are in English so I am not -- I didn't send them to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover), but I would like to have them distributed and I will seek to have them admitted.  So may the registry come and retrieve these documents, distribute them, and then I will ask that they be admitted and pose a question to the witness, if they are.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the name of a town is redacted. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are these being admitted by consent?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President.  I'm just going to offer them right now.  If I could just go through them one by one.  First of all -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Can we just pause for a second?  Do I understand it correctly that these are documents not in front of the witness?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct. 
MR. MORLEY:
So, on the face of it, we're looking at documents which my learned friend wishes to have admitted of themselves, as it were; they speak as a tranche of evidence of themselves.  Can we just have a moment to look at them, because we haven't seen them?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought that he was asking you for your consent.
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, I haven't seen them yet.  So if I can just have a moment to read through them, now that I understand what we're doing, then we might be able to help Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  I appreciate that.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour may have seen that these are United Nations documents.  So the question which arises is:  Whilst they have a certain character, what is their relevance?  And I'd invite my learned friend to tell us what their relevance is before we then agree to their admission.  I just don't see what their relevance is at the moment. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, in the events leading up to the assassination of President Habyarimana at the end of March, the international community had now come around to admitting -- urging the admission of the CDR into the transitional national assembly, thus removing the last impasse that existed for the swearing-in of this government, and some would say the last excuse of the RPF not to proceed with the swearing-in.  Of course, we know that six days later, the president was assassinated and the massacres and the war began.  So we believe that these documents are relevant to show the context in which the bloodbath began.  

I was inspired by this technique of offering exhibits in this manner by the decision in the Bagosora Chamber of the 25th of May 2006, entitled "Decision on Request to Admit United Nations Documents into Evidence under Rule 89(C)."  And in that decision the Trial Chamber ruled that documents which reflect the views of United Nations officials as to the military and political context of Rwanda in 1995 are relevant to the charges against the Accused and can be admitted without the necessity of having a foundation witness.  So I would ask that these two documents be admitted.  
MR. MORLEY:
And Your Honour may recall that I mentioned that these have a certain character to them.  I don't disagree with my learned friend's assessment as to the admissibility of themselves, subject to relevance.  And the only issue is relevance, and it's a matter for Your Honour's judgement as to whether these are relevant.  Insofar as they demonstrate that the CDR is allowed to become part of the transitional government, then there it is.  If it's their only purpose, one wonders why that can't simply be put forward as a proposition to the witness and the witness agrees with it.  There's quite a lot of paperwork already in this case.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think -- since we are just dealing with the relevance, I think we've established the relevance of these documents, and when you compare them to the relevance of events in 1991 and 1992 that have been admitted on behalf of the Prosecutor, I don't think it can be seriously disputed that these are relevant documents.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we admit them.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The first document which I would like to have admitted as D. NZ123 is the outgoing code cable from Mr. Booh-Booh to Kofi Annan dated the 28th of March 1994, and the second document as Exhibit D. NZ124 is the cover letter to President Habyarimana dated the 28th of March 1994, to which is attached the press release of the diplomatic corps and the signatures of those members of the diplomatic corps who signed the press release.  So D. NZ123 and 124 would be the two documents.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ123 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. NZ124 admitted)

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And now, Witness T, my question to you is that as of the beginning of April of 1994, did it appear that the obstacles for setting up the transitional institutions were being overcome? 
A.	At any point in time after there was a request for the transitional institutions to be set up, with the consent of the RPF, of course.  
Q.	And were you aware that President Habyarimana had travelled to Dar es Salaam, and was returning on the 6th of April of 1994 to announce that the transitional government would be immediately sworn in, in Rwanda?  
A.	I wasn't personally aware of that.  I was not aware of that event. 
Q.	Now, on the 6th of April 1994, you've told us that you were having a drink with some other people when you learned of the crash of the president's plane; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And who did you believe was responsible for that crash? 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, the same problem:  Leaving aside the question of relevance as to who shot down the plane, which is a nice question in itself, what is the value of simply asking a witness, "Who do you think did it?"  I don't know of any criminal court in my home jurisdiction which would mount a trial on the basis of everybody coming into the room and saying, "Well, I think it was so and so."  It has to be based on knowledge, surely.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think it explains why the witness did the things that he did, and it's part of the information - or, belief upon which he was acting in the subsequent events.  So I believe it's relevant for that reason, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're saying it was the truth as to the witness's state of mind -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and not for the truth of his belief?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  I'll stipulate that he has no personal knowledge as to who it was that shot down the plane, but I think that his belief and the belief of the Rwandan population as to who was responsible had some bearing on the activities that followed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But he can't speak of the belief of Rwandans.  He can speak about his belief, but not about the belief of others.
  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, for now, I'm just asking him about his belief, so - 
MR. MORLEY:
Put in that way, the question is unobjectionable.  But one has to be alive to the fact that one strays into it possibly being perceived as a statement of opinion as to who really shot down the plane.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, you are asking him for an opinion as to who shot down the plane.  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I'm asking him to state the fact as to what he believed at the time as to who had shot the plane down.  
JUDGE SHORT:
What he believes -- what do you mean by what he believes?  
MR. ROBINSON:
What he believed at the time.  In other words, for example, this witness went ahead and -- over the next days and observed things and did things, and I'm wondering what was his state of mind as to who had shot down the plane as he observed and did those things.  It's not a very big thing.  If it's a -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
I just don't understand the question.  You are not asking him whether he knows.  You say you know he doesn't know. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Right. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You're not asking for his opinion either, but you're asking him for what he believes.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  But I'm going to withdraw the question because I think it's so controversial and is of so little value to my case that it's better to just move on.  But, Mr. President, I'm about to go into the events of the 6th of April and beyond and perhaps this would be a good time to break for the day and pick that up tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, we take the adjournment now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I interrupt for one second, Your Honour?  I've been in contact with the state authorities in regard to Mr. Robinson's request for two statements, and earlier this morning when we had received a telephone message, I thought we had localised these two statements in question, but the last message I got, which was just 10 minutes ago, the authorities of the state still don't know what they're looking for because the numbers that they received don't correspond to anything that relates to a statement from the witness in question.  So, Mr. Robinson can go back and revisit his notes and be a bit more precise about what he's looking for, but the numbers themselves are not an indication for the state authorities.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's in relation to both documents, or only one?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  There were four documents that were requested.  We resolved the issue with respect to two of them.  One of them we had and was not -- we are not obligated to disclose.  The other one, I think the Chamber had told us not -- had indicated it was not amenable to disclosure, and the remaining two is what we were looking for.  And the most recent communication that I received is that they have not been able to locate them based on their numbers, and the one document that seems to exist as a document does not relate to this witness.  So as far as they're concerned, they don't quite understand what we're looking for.  

So, if Mr. Robinson can revisit his notes and perhaps give us a bit of background and more context for exactly what he's seeking to obtain, and I will forward that to the authorities and see if that generates some more responsive communication.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
What I did receive, I've already copied the Trial Chamber coordinator so she can perhaps be a bit more expansive on the communication.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, while the authorities from the state are in the room, I would just like to be very explicit about what the basis for my information is so that we can clear this up as soon as possible.  There was, among the material disclosed to us, an interview of Witness T, and in the course of that interview, at page K0358353, it indicated that on September 1st, 2005, Witness T had made an earlier statement to the authorities of the state in a PV that was numbered 219735/05.  So, based on the reference that I saw in the material that was disclosed to me, it appeared to me that this PV was in existence and contained a statement of the witness.  Similarly, in the material that was disclosed me, which was an interview of the 22nd of February, at page K0366948 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
22nd of February of what year?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Of 2006.  At page K0366948, it indicated that on the 26th of October 2004 Witness T had been interviewed, and it gave the PV number as 223311/04, which was what led me to believe that that document existed and had not been disclosed to us.  So that's the information I had for those two and that's my references that I've given to the Prosecutor. 
MR. MORLEY:
Can I just add something?  Last number, sadly, slightly inaccurate.  It's 223331/04 -- I think 04, but there are three 3s, not two 3s.  That is what appears on the K-number which my learned friend refers to.  

Notwithstanding that, it's still my expectation that's a typo within that K-number, but I may be wrong.  And as for the other document, we are still dealing with that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If it would assist, I can simply read the content of the email on to the record and then Mr. Robinson can have a clear idea of what the concern is.  It's only two sentences.  It says -- and I'll be reading in French."  Dear Mr. Webster, I have contacted the registry for two copies of the records requested, but these have not been located."  .../05, which is the second one that we listed, it's the fourth document in our records.  "The second does not tally with witness statement or interview.  Would there not be an error in the numbers that have been indicated to us?"
(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal):
Mr. President, this is the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover)who is speaking.  The last information we have received is correct with regard to PV.  Indeed, the first reference was incorrect and the number 3 was mistakenly given as 1.  As far as the other PV is concerned, it is clear that this PV does not contain any witness statement.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster -- Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I would ask that the authorities from the state send the PVs that have been requested to the extent that they could find them, and the Trial Chamber can review and determine whether it should be disclosed to us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we don't think it's appropriate to re-evaluate the factual statement of the judicial authority from the state.  This is not a matter of opinion, it's a factual statement that no statement was contained, and we don't think it appropriate to investigate such a statement.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1804H)
