         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the registry tell us the case coming before the 

         4        Trial Chamber.  And we are also sorry that we are late.  

         5        One of us was caught up in a traffic jam. 

         6   MR. KIYEYEU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 

         7        the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed 

         8        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston 

         9        Churchill Matanzima Maqutu, and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, 

        10        is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 7th 

        11        of October 2002, for the continuation of the Defence 

        12        case in the matter of the Prosecutor v. 

        13        Juvenal Kajelijeli, case No. ICTR-98-44A-T. 

        14        

        15        I am most obliged, Mr. President.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registry.  

        17        

        18        May we have the appearance, of the parties for the 

        19        record, please.

        20   MR. FLEMING: If the Court pleases.  I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        21        trial attorney.  I appear with Ms. Ojemeni, trial 

        22        attorney.  Thank you.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can we also have the appearance of the 

        24        Defence, please, for the record?

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Good morning, Your Honours.  Lennox Hinds 

        26        representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by 

        27        Professor Bompaka and Mr. Emilien Dusabe, translator. 

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Yes,  

        29        Professor Hinds, how do we stand today?

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS:  We have good and bad news, Your Honour.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes -- oh!

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: The good news is that we have one witness.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: One?

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: One.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Only.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.  We had put only just one witness.  The 

         7        two witnesses came and we are putting in only one.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS:  The bad news is that the four detained 

        10        witnesses still are not here.  The latest information we 

        11        got on Saturday is that they are trying to get the 

        12        witnesses here, and the earliest they gave us -- this 

        13        was Saturday -- is for them to arrive on Wednesday 

        14        night.  Now, I don't know if they will come on Wednesday 

        15        night, but that is the earliest that they told us they 

        16        could  have those witnesses here.  I don't know all of 

        17        the details; I think they were trying to get some 

        18        documents.  From what I understand, there are no 

        19        impediments as such from the Rwandan authorities; that 

        20        is what I understand.  I understand they have got all of 

        21        the approvals, it is just a matter of them getting 

        22        transport and so on.  That is what I understood as of 

        23        Saturday.  So, we have one witness.  Those four 

        24        witnesses we have indicated to the Prosecutor that they 

        25        are remaining our priority witnesses, whenever they 

        26        come, we will put them on in an order that we have 

        27        informed them.  

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, it is a --

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS:  It has been an ongoing concern to us from 

        30        the time we opened the session, and we have been

         1        alerting the Court almost on a daily basis of this 

         2        particular problem. 

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes. Okay.  When are we likely to get some 

         4        sort of affirmative indication from the -- in the course 

         5        of today, perhaps, Professor Hinds?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, Your Honour.  We have been contacting 

         7        Kigali ourselves twice a day, and we are talking to the 

         8        people -- the witness and victims support unit here in 

         9        Arusha at the same time.  In other words, we speak to 

        10        them here, the coordinators here and then we call their 

        11        staff in Kigali directly.  So, we will inform the Court 

        12        during the course of the day exactly where things are.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS:  One other matter, Your Honour.  We are in a 

        15        position to indicate the witnesses we do not intend to 

        16        call.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT:  Oh, okay.  Then we shall do that either in 

        18        the course of the day, or maybe we can even take it up 

        19        at the close of the session.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.  All right.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  That would be very good.  I don't think the 

        22        Prosecution have any comments with regard to the 

        23        position of the witnesses, as we stand now for the time 

        24        being.

        25   MR. FLEMING:  No, Your Honours, we have great sympathy for 

        26        them. 

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We understand.  

        28        All right, then, we will go to the next witness, and in 

        29        case we don't run the risk of forgetting, we remember we 

        30        carried forward the question of the documents the

         1        Prosecution wanted to tender.  Maybe we can come back to 

         2        it maybe in the course of the day.  I hope you will have 

         3        been able to exchange views on that.  

         4        

         5        Okay.  Can we have the next witness?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS:  The Defence calls RHU29. 

         7   MR. PRESIDENT:  Ask the witness to make his declaration.

         8        (Declaration made by Witness RHU29 in Kinyarwanda)

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  Witness RHU29, you have just made a solemn 

        10        declaration. In case you are not familiar as to how your 

        11        evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few 

        12        essential elements.  You will be led in your 

        13        evidence-in-chief by the Defence, who are seated on this 

        14        side of the courtroom.  Thereafter, questions will be 

        15        put to you in cross-examination by the Prosecution, who 

        16        are seated on this side of the courtroom.  The Judges 

        17        sitting in front of you may also put questions to you to 

        18        clarify your evidence if they have such questions to ask 

        19        you.  If a question put to you is not clear or you do 

        20        not understand it, please say so and such a question 

        21        will be repeated or explained.  These are the few 

        22        essential things we want to bring to your attention 

        23        before you begin your evidence.  

        24        

        25        Professor Hinds, please.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Thank you, Your Honour.

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Good morning, RHU29.  How are you this morning? 

         4   A.   Good morning, Counsel.  I am fine. 

         5   Q.   Witness, I am going to present you with a document and 

         6        I'd like you to examine the document and see if the 

         7        signature at the bottom and the date is your signature, 

         8        and date attesting to the accuracy of the information on 

         9        this document. 

        10   A.   The information in this document is correct.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we will tender this document as 

        12        Defendant's Exhibit 26.  

        13   MR. FLEMING: No objection, Your Honours.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  No Objection.  So let the document containing 

        15        the personal particulars of Witness RHU29 be admitted as 

        16        Defence Exhibit No. 26, and the same shall be kept under 

        17        seal as it contains the personal particulars of this 

        18        witness, who is a protected witness.  

        19   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lord.  

        20        (Exhibit No. 26 was admitted)

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel.  

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        23   Q.   Witness, are you *******? 

        24   A.   Yes, *******.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we are going to go into some 

        26        specific information concerning the personal details of 

        27        this witness, and we would respectfully request that we 

        28        go into closed session to protect his identity.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Okay.  We will go into closed session 

        30        to enable counsel to raise questions, even those which

         3        necessary procedure that has got to be adopted for the

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  We will now go into open session.   

         2        Interpreter, could you please tell Witness RHU29 so that 

         3        he should be careful not to mention names of places and 

         4        people who have a bearing to his identity.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness, I draw your attention to April of 1994.  Can 

         7        you tell this Chamber when and under what circumstances 

         8        you learnt of the president's plane crash? 

         9   A.   I learnt of the death of the president of the republic 

        10        while I was at home at 8:30 in the evening. 

        11   Q.   What day -- what was that date, sir, if you recall? 

        12   A.   It was in the night of 6th April 1994. 

        13   Q.   And can you tell the Chamber what you recall -- 

        14        withdrawn.  Could you tell the Chamber how you learnt of 

        15        the news of the president's death? 

        16   A.   I learnt of it from the radio. 

        17   Q.   And could you recall if anything was said on the radio 

        18        concerning the president's death? 

        19   A.   From what I recall, it was said that the president was 

        20        coming back from a meeting, and that once he got back to 

        21        Rwanda, some people shot down his aircraft. 

        22   Q.   How did you feel when you learnt -- when you heard this 

        23        sad news? 

        24   A.   Personally, when I learnt of this news, I felt pain.  I 

        25        felt discouraged but I had nothing to do; I continued to 

        26        suffer at home.

        27   Q.   Did you do anything -- you or your family do anything 

        28        that evening after you learnt of the president's death? 

        29   A.   We didn't do anything. 

        30   Q.   Could you tell the Chamber, what if anything you did the

         1        next day?  What time did you get up? 

         2   A.   The following day, I woke up at six in the morning.  I 

         3        remained at home together with my family; in other 

         4        words, my children and my wife, since an announcement 

         5        had been put out on radio which prohibited people from 

         6        leaving their houses. 

         7   Q.   After you got up, sir, there on that morning, did you 

         8        see any civilians, or any military personnel around your 

         9        home? 

        10   A.   At a certain point in time, I saw some soldiers in the 

        11        company of some civilians who were going towards Busogo 

        12        church. 

        13   Q.   How did you know, sir, that these were soldiers?  Could 

        14        you describe what they were wearing and, what if any 

        15        weapons they had in their possession? 

        16   A.   I knew that some of these individuals were soldiers 

        17        because they were wearing military clothing; they were 

        18        carrying guns.  As for the civilians, they were in 

        19        various clothing, and they were carrying spears and 

        20        clubs. 

        21   Q.   Were these civilians wearing any uniforms or distinctive 

        22        clothing of any kind? 

        23   A.   No, the civilians were not wearing any uniform, they 

        24        were in different types of clothing.  As for the 

        25        soldiers, they would be distinguished from the civilians 

        26        because they were in military clothing. 

        27   Q.   Were you able to recognise -- withdrawn.  How far were 

        28        you from the civilians and soldiers when you made your 

        29        observation? 

        30   A.   When I saw these civilians from where I was and where

         1        they were, there was about -- a distance of about a 

         2        100 metres. 

         3   Q.   Were you able to identify anyone among the civilians as 

         4        soldiers that morning? 

         5   A.   I didn't recognise any of the civilians but I recognised 

         6        one of the soldiers who was in the company of the 

         7        civilians. 

         8   Q.   And do you know the name of that soldier? 

         9   A.   Yes, I know the name of that soldier.  He was known as 

        10        Rashele. 

        11   Q.   How were you able to identify the soldier from a 

        12        100 metres? 

        13   A.   For someone whom you know very well, even at a distance 

        14        of 300 metres, you can identify that person.  Therefore, 

        15        I recognised Rashele because this was someone whom I 

        16        knew from the time he was born and when he became a 

        17        soldier, I still knew him.  I knew his behaviour and I 

        18        knew what his attitude to life was. 

        19   Q.   Now, did you see the civilians and soldiers doing or 

        20        saying anything when you say you saw them from a 

        21        100 metres? 

        22   A.   While these soldiers and civilians were walking, I 

        23        didn't see them doing anything, but I realised that they 

        24        were going towards Busogo church.  Once they got to the 

        25        church, I heard gunshots, I heard people shouting and, 

        26        subsequently, rumour had it that these civilians and 

        27        soldiers had gone to attack the refugees who were at the 

        28        Busogo church.

         1        1030H

         2   Q.   Now, when you observed the civilians and soldiers, did 

         3        you see any vehicle accompanying them that morning?

         4   A.   The civilians and soldiers were on foot, they didn't 

         5        have any vehicles.

         6   Q.   Did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli that morning among them?

         7   A.   At that specific time, I did not see Juvénal Kajelijeli 

         8        with them.  And, furthermore, throughout that day, I did 

         9        not see him.

        10   Q.   Do you know in April of 1994 what type of vehicle 

        11        Kajelijeli drove?

        12   A.   Yes, I know the kind of vehicle that Juvénal Kajelijeli 

        13        drove.

        14   Q.   Could you describe that vehicle to the Chamber, please?

        15   A.   The vehicle that Juvénal Kajelijeli drove was a red 

        16        Toyota bearing the writing ESTB.  This is because 

        17        Juvénal Kajelijeli was a member of an association which 

        18        had set up a school known as ESTB.  And, furthermore, he 

        19        was chairman of that school.  And that is the reason why 

        20        he had the right to drive the vehicle belonging to that 

        21        establishment.

        22   Q.   Now, sir, did you see that vehicle that morning at 

        23        Munyemvano's compound?

        24   A.   That vehicle did not go to Munyemvano's home.  

        25        Furthermore, Kajelijeli did not go to Munyemvano's home 

        26        either.

        27   Q.   That morning, were there any people at Munyemvano's 

        28        compound?

        29   A.   At around six in the morning that same 7th of April, 

        30        everyone who was in Munyemvano's home sought refuge at

         1        the Busogo church.  No one remained at Munyemvano's 

         2        home, given the fact that they had all gone to seek 

         3        refuge.

         4   Q.   At that time, when they were seeking refuge, did you see 

         5        Kajelijeli's vehicle at Munyemvano's compound?

         6   A.   No, I didn't see Juvénal Kajelijeli's vehicle.

         7   Q.   Sir, were you -- withdrawn.  Do you know how long the 

         8        shootings and the explosions took place?

         9   A.   The gunfire and people's cries lasted about an hour.

        10   Q.   Did there come a time when you saw the bourgmestre?

        11   MR. President's: Of which commune?

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I would prefer to have the witness 

        13        tell us, but if you want me to lead him to that point, 

        14        I --

        15   MR. President's: No, let him go on.  Let him give his answer 

        16        and we see how we move from there.

        17   THE WITNESS: Yes, at a given point in time, I saw Bourgmestre 

        18        Harera at about nine in the morning.

        19   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        20   Q.   And do you know who he was with, if anyone?

        21   A.   The bourgmestre was in the company of his driver who was 

        22        driving him.

        23   Q.   And do you know the name of that driver?

        24   A.   The driver was known as Muhunde, spelt M-U-H-U-N-D-E, 

        25        Muhunde.

        26   Q.   Did you go to the parish yourself that day, sir?

        27   A.   No, on that day I didn't go to the church.

        28   Q.   Do you know what Bourgmestre Harera did at the parish, 

        29        if anything?

        30   A.   From what I heard since I wasn't present on-site,

         1        Bourgmestre Harera allegedly asked one conseiller of the 

         2        secteur at which these people had been killed to exhume 

         3        the bodies of the victims -- I do beg your pardon, to 

         4        bury the victims who had been killed.

         5   Q.   Sir, did you see the civilians and military leave the 

         6        vicinity of the Busogo parish that morning?

         7   A.   After killing the refugees, the civilians and the 

         8        soldiers left immediately.  And, furthermore, when the 

         9        bourgmestre came there, he didn't find them there.

        10   Q.   Did you -- did you see the individuals leaving that 

        11        vicinity yourself?

        12   A.   I saw them leave the church as I had seen them go to the 

        13        church.

        14   Q.   And at the point where you saw them leaving, did you see 

        15        Juvénal Kajelijeli among them or his vehicle?

        16   A.   I didn't see Kajelijeli nor his vehicle.

        17   Q.   Now, did Munyemvano's compound have a fence around it?

        18   A.   Munyemvano's compound had a fence, but it wasn't very 

        19        high.

        20   Q.   Was there a gate to his compound?

        21   A.   Yes, the compound had a gate to it.

        22   Q.   Were there any killings that took place that morning at 

        23        Munyemvano's compound?

        24   A.   No one was killed at Munyemvano's place.

        25   Q.   Now, are you a member of -- in April of 1994, were you a 

        26        member of the MRND?

        27   A.   I was never a member of the MRND.  Furthermore, I wasn't 

        28        ever any -- a member of any party whatsoever.

        29   Q.   Do you know -- in April of 1994, did you know 

        30        Gateyiteyi?

         1   A.   In April 1994, I knew Gateyiteyi.

         2   Q.   Did you see Gateyiteyi on April 7th of 1994?

         3   A.   On 7th April, I did not see Gateyiteyi because he was 

         4        one of the refugees himself.

         5   Q.   Now, on the 8th, were there any activities -- did you 

         6        see any activities around the parish?

         7   A.   Since I didn't go to the church, I didn't see anything.

         8   Q.   Do you know whether or not the bourgmestre was there in 

         9        that vicinity on the 8th, that is, the 8th of April 

        10        1994?

        11   A.   Since the bourgmestre was the officer for the commune, 

        12        and amongst his responsibility featured the people's 

        13        security.  I cannot say whether he went to the parish or 

        14        not.

        15   MR. President's: Yes.

        16   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        17   Q.   Did you, during the 7th and 8th, hear any explosions or 

        18        gunfire other than what you heard coming from the Busogo 

        19        parish?

        20   A.   One could hear gunshots here and there; for instance, in 

        21        the area of Nkuli, Kinigi and Butaro.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I am just going to check with 

        23        my client to see if he --

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, please. 

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: No further questions.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: No further questions.  Thank you, 

        27        Learned Counsel.

         2        break.

         3   MR. FLEMING: I could take the five minutes on issues that 

         4        aren't in closed session, Your Honour.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Yes.  Please, get -- you can start,

         9               CROSS-EXAMINATION

        10   BY MR. FLEMING:

        11   Q.   Witness, you are of the view, aren't you, that 

        12        Mr. Kajelijeli is an innocent man?

        13   A.   As far as I am concerned, Kajelijeli is innocent.

        14   Q.   And you are here to help him, aren't you?

        15   A.   Indeed, I came to testify here before the Judges in 

        16        order to say that Kajelijeli did nothing wrong during 

        17        this period of time.

        18   Q.   Now, Witness, on the morning of the 8th -- of 7th of 

        19        April at about 8 a.m., you've told this Court you saw 

        20        soldiers and civilians heading towards Busogo parish, 

        21        haven't you?

        22   A.   Yes.

        23   Q.   Thank you.  Sorry.  Witness, you've also told us today 

        24        that the military had weapons, but that the civilians 

        25        were carrying spears and clubs.  Is that your evidence?

        26   A.   That is what I said.

        27   Q.   You've also told us, haven't you, that Busogo parish was 

        28        some 700 metres away from you as the crow flies?

        29   A.   Yes, indeed, that was my testimony.

        30   Q.   Did you see soldiers shooting from where you were?

         1   A.   I didn't see the soldiers shoot, but I heard the 

         2        gunfire, and this was coming from the Busogo church.

         3   Q.   Did you see the civilians shooting from where you were?

         4   A.   The civilians were not shooting at the refugees, rather, 

         5        they would catch anyone and would attack them using 

         6        their spears or clubs and thereby kill them.

         7   Q.   Witness, the question was:  Did you see them shooting or 

         8        doing that?

         9   A.   I didn't see the civilians kill people with my own eyes, 

        10        but I saw them as they were going towards the Busogo 

        11        church to attack the refugees.  And that was done, 

        12        because immediately after they passed by we heard 

        13        gunshots and shouts or cries coming from people.

        14   Q.   So the short answer is that you neither saw soldiers 

        15        shooting nor civilians killing in the Busogo parish, did 

        16        you?

        17   A.   I did not see with my own eyes the soldiers shooting or 

        18        the civilians attacking the refugees with spears, but I 

        19        saw the various weapons that these people were carrying, 

        20        and it is these weapons which led to the catastrophe.

        21   Q.   Who are the Interahamwe?

        22   A.   The Interahamwe were -- was a group affiliated to the 

        23        MRND, and their responsibility was to carry out orders 

        24        issued by that party.

        25   Q.   Did you see Interahamwe on the 7th of April 1994 at 

        26        8 o'clock?

        27   A.   I have testified that some of the people who were in the 

        28        company of the soldiers were part of the Interahamwe.

        29   Q.   I'm sorry, I don't recall you saying that in your 

        30        evidence-in-chief.  When have you testified that some of

         1        the people were Interahamwe?

         2   A.   It is, in fact, a moment ago that I said that some of 

         3        the people accompanying the soldiers were Interahamwe, 

         4        because you have asked me a question as to who were the 

         5        Interahamwe.  As for Defence counsel, I told him that I 

         6        saw soldiers who were accompanied by civilians.  And I 

         7        also told you that the Interahamwe were responsible for 

         8        having decisions made by the MRND party respected or 

         9        complied with.

        10   MR. FLEMING: I'm sorry, Your Honours, I have brought you over 

        11        a little --

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Can you take note of that answer, and 

        13        we'll stop here.  We'll take a 15 minutes break and come 

        14        back at twenty past eleven to continue the evidence of 

        15        this witness.  

        16        

        17        So until then, these proceedings stand adjourned. 

        18        (Court recessed from 1105H to 1125H)

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  The proceedings are resumed.  We 

        20        continue with the testimony of the Witness RHU29, 

        21        cross-examination.  

        22        

        23        Mr. Fleming, could you, please, continue?

        24   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        25   BY MR. FLEMING:

        26   Q.   So, Witness, I want to know a little more about the 

        27        Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe, you've told us, were 

        28        responsible for carrying out the directions of the MRND.  

        29        That's what you told just a few moment ago, wasn't it?

        30   A.   Yes, that is my testimony.

         1   Q.   And the Interahamwe were recruited from young men in 

         2        different regions, were they?

         3   A.   That is correct.

         4   Q.   The Interahamwe were then given some basic training,  

         5        weren't they?

         6   A.   I would like to request you to put to me questions on 

         7        Kajelijeli and not on the Interahamwe, because I was 

         8        never a member of any party; I was never a member of the 

         9        Interahamwe.  So, I would request that you put to me 

        10        questions -- that you do not put to me questions on 

        11        those issues because I cannot give you -- I do not know 

        12        the purpose, the objectives of that group.  I would, 

        13        therefore, request you to put questions to me on 

        14        Kajelijeli.

        15   Q.   I'm sorry, I won't comply with your request.  Now, 

        16        Witness, the Interahamwe received some basic training, 

        17        didn't they?

        18   A.   I do not know anything about that.

        19   Q.   The Interahamwe were given training in respect of 

        20        weapons handling, weren't they?

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  The witness said he 

        22        knows nothing about any training.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  He can answer that question. 

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, the first question is subsumed in the 

        25        second.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Well.  Well, I think that question can be 

        27        answered.  If he doesn't know, he would say he doesn't 

        28        know, there would be no harm to that.  The witness, I 

        29        think, is in a position to answer that answer, whether 

        30        he doesn't know.  That's all.  Can he answer that

         1        question?

         2   THE WITNESS: I have told you that I am not in a position to 

         3        know that.

         4   BY MR. FLEMING:

         5   Q.   Witness, what Interahamwe did you recognise at 8 o'clock 

         6        on the morning of 7th of April 1994?

         7   A.   In that group I knew a soldier from the north called 

         8        Rashele, and I have already stated that.  I saw young 

         9        people coming from all over the place and other 

        10        soldiers.

        11   Q.   Witness, just before the break you told us that you saw 

        12        some Interahamwe in that group.  Now, who were those 

        13        Interahamwe?

        14   A.   I referred to them as Interahamwe because their 

        15        behaviour was different from that of the soldiers.

        16   Q.   Tell me how their behaviour is different then that you 

        17        identified them as Interahamwe?

        18   A.   I did say that they behaved differently from the 

        19        soldiers because the soldiers had guns and they were 

        20        wearing military uniforms, but these young people had 

        21        spears, they carried traditional weapons and they were 

        22        wearing civilians clothes.  When I saw them I thought 

        23        these young men were the Interahamwe, because it was 

        24        said that the Interahamwe existed at the time.

        25   Q.   Why did you think that the Interahamwe would be moving 

        26        off to kill people in Busogo parish?

        27   A.   The fact is that I saw these people moving towards the 

        28        parish and those who knew them said they were the 

        29        Interahamwe.  And that is why I am also asserting that 

        30        they were the Interahamwe.

         1   Q.   You saw them moving off to Busogo parish and those who 

         2        knew them told you that they are Interahamwe.  Who was 

         3        it who told you on that morning that they are 

         4        Interahamwe?

         5   A.   I got to know it from one of the neighbours who lived in 

         6        the neighbourhood, but who came from the Nkumba and 

         7        Butaro communes.  This was during the war.  These people 

         8        had taken refuge in our locality.  And after the 

         9        incident, these people were saying that the soldiers 

        10        came to accompany the Interahamwe.

        11   Q.   Some had clubs, others had spears and few had guns.  

        12        That was the situation, wasn't it?

        13   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        14   Q.   Some of the Interahamwe had guns; didn't they?

        15   A.   The Interahamwe had no guns.  Those that I saw with guns 

        16        were people in uniform.  So, if there were Interahamwe 

        17        in military uniform and who carried guns, I cannot 

        18        assert that.

        19   Q.   So, if you refer to a few, you mean more than two, don't 

        20        you; you mean a No. Of people who might have guns?

        21   A.   Yes, there were more than two persons carrying guns.

        22   Q.   So, there were more than two persons in uniforms, were 

        23        there?

        24   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        25   Q.   How many people were in uniforms and carrying guns?

        26   A.   I was not able to count them because they were hurrying 

        27        up.

        28   Q.   Were there numerous people with guns?

        29   A.   Yes, there were many carrying guns.

        30   Q.   How many people were there all together, if you count

         1        the soldiers and the Interahamwe?

         2   A.   Unless I give you an estimate, I must say that I did not 

         3        take a count because you normally would take a count 

         4        when a payment is being made.  You do not count people 

         5        who are going to commit massacres.

         6   Q.   Please, make an estimate.

         7   A.   There should be approximately 20 persons.

         8   Q.   You said you recognised Rashele, and you said you knew 

         9        what his attitude to life was.  What was his attitude to 

        10        life?

        11   A.   I knew Rashele because he was a man who always ran to 

        12        places where there is an event.  He liked to be places 

        13        where people were gathering, and when people were 

        14        gathering, he likes to be part of that group.  I've also 

        15        known him in discussion groups, discussions bringing 

        16        together a lot of people.  Simply put, he is a very 

        17        turbulent person.

        18   Q.   Witness, a moment ago you told us that you don't count 

        19        people who were on their way to commit a massacre.  You 

        20        knew, didn't you, these people were going to Busogo 

        21        parish to kill people?

        22   A.   I learnt that they were going to kill when they got 

        23        there.  Because after they went by, I heard a lot of 

        24        noise and gunshots and people were crying.  And that is 

        25        when I got to know that they were going to the parish to 

        26        commit massacres.

        27   Q.   Witness, you knew that Tutsi had gone to the parish for 

        28        refuge, didn't you, by 8 o'clock on the morning of the 

        29        7th of April 1994?

        30   A.   Yes, I knew it.

         1   Q.   And you knew Rashele, he was the turbulent person that 

         2        you spoke of a moment ago, he was armed with other 

         3        soldiers and with civilians all armed and they were 

         4        heading towards the Busogo parish.  You knew all of 

         5        that, didn't you?

         6   A.   Yes, that is correct.  I saw them carrying weapons and 

         7        moving towards the Busogo parish.

         8   Q.   What do you think they were going to do to the Tutsis 

         9        there?

        10   A.   I think it is obvious, and you yourself have understood, 

        11        they were going there to kill them, and I have stated 

        12        that already.

        13   Q.   Witness, it was obvious to you at 8 o'clock on the 

        14        morning of the 7th of April 1994 that that group was 

        15        going to Busogo parish to kill people, wasn't it?

        16   A.   Can you please repeat the question?

        17   Q.   Witness, you knew at 8 o'clock on the morning of the 

        18        7th of April 1994 that that group of soldiers and 

        19        Interahamwe were going to the parish to kill Tutsi, 

        20        didn't you? 

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  That has been asked 

        22        and answered.  He asked the question before and the 

        23        witness said he learnt that they were going to kill when 

        24        they went to the parish.  I mean, the same question was 

        25        asked, the witness answered it.  Now he is repeating the 

        26        same question again.  The witness says -- that the 

        27        witness learnt that they were going to kill when they 

        28        went to the parish.  That was the answer that was given 

        29        before.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  In fact, Mr. Fleming, unless you have a

         1        follow-up question to that, in a subsequent question to 

         2        that, he said, when he said you should know, "it was 

         3        obvious", he used the word "obvious" that they were 

         4        going to kill the Tutsi.

         5   MR. FLEMING: Yes, I'm not concerned with my knowledge, 

         6        Your Honour, I am concerned with his knowledge.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, he has already answered --

         8   MR. FLEMING: It was obvious to him that they would go there 

         9        to kill as well.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, I think that one has been answered.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        13   BY MR. FLEMING:

        14   Q.   Witness, you know a man called Joseph Nzirorera, don't 

        15        you?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  Where is he going 

        17        with this?

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Mr. Fleming, where do you go from there 

        19        with Mr. Nzirorera?

        20   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, I am entitled to probe this case.  

        21        I'm entitled to probe his knowledge of the Interahamwe; 

        22        I'm entitled to probe his knowledge of the MRND.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: I think he has given his -- according to his 

        24        evidence so far, which we have on record about his 

        25        knowledge -- his information about the Interahamwe, I 

        26        think that one has been clearly given, you know, 

        27        according to his evidence as he has given so far.

        28   MR. FLEMING: So now, I am going to the MRND, Your Honour. 

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the witness has already stated 

        30        what his knowledge is of the MRND, and I have no real

         1        objection to him probing.  I do have an objection for 

         2        him asking questions about Joseph Nzirorera, who is not 

         3        on trial here, and it has nothing to do with direct 

         4        examination.  And if he is even remotely talking about 

         5        credibility, it is quite a stretch.  What does this 

         6        witness's knowledge about Joseph Nzirorera have to do 

         7        with any question of credibility?

         8   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, may I respond?

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        10   MR. FLEMING: Thank you.  

        11        

        12        Joseph Nzirorera is in this indictment as a person with 

        13        whom Kajelijeli conspired.  So he is, in fact, well and 

        14        truly in this -- in this trial.  This man has given his 

        15        credentials and qualifications; I won't mention them now 

        16        because we are in open Court.  He has been -- he's told 

        17        us how long he has been in that particular location for.  

        18        And I am entitled, with the greatest respect, to ask him 

        19        how much he knows, and his answers will, in fact, go to 

        20        his credit. 

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: No foundation has been laid, even for one 

        22        scintilla of evidence in this regard.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Well, from the evidence of this witness 

        24        so far, and his testimony with regard to some of the 

        25        issues, like political parties, we have it on record.  

        26        It is our view that there is no foundation that has been 

        27        raised that would justify the moving on straight to 

        28        Nzirorera, as the question has been put.

        29   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours, you said 

        30        the evidence -- I'm sorry.

         1   BY MR. FLEMING:

         2   Q.   Witness, you do know, don't you, about the MRND?

         3   A.   Yes, I have heard about the MRND.

         4   Q.   In fact, you were a member of the MRND by virtue of 

         5        birth before multipartism, weren't you?

         6   A.   That is not true.

         7   Q.   You were a person -- I'm sorry.

         8   A.   That is not true, in spite of the fact that I lived in 

         9        the country, I did not join any party, and my position 

        10        did not allow me to join any political party.

        11   Q.   Witness, you did participate, didn't you, in the affairs 

        12        of the community?

        13   A.   Apart from following instructions of the authorities, I 

        14        had no responsibility in the matters of the community.

        15   Q.   Witness, you participated in debating matters in the 

        16        community, didn't you?

        17   A.   No.

        18   Q.   Witness, you told us about a few moments ago that you 

        19        knew Rashele from some occasions when there had been 

        20        discussions about public matters, didn't you?

        21   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        22   Q.   So, you did discuss matters from time to time of a 

        23        public nature, didn't you, in the community?  

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  I don't know how he 

        25        makes that lead.  The witness has testified with respect 

        26        to how he knows Rashele, and that Rashele is the person 

        27        who gravitates towards groups and so on.  But this 

        28        witness has never indicated and he has denied that he 

        29        was involved in any debates.  Now, the Prosecutor is 

        30        again pushing forward and assuming certain facts that

         1        are simply not in evidence here either through this 

         2        witness's statement or anything so far in the record.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  That is what he is trying to find out 

         4        from the witness. 

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: But you know facts from which he can even 

         6        pursue that from this witness.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: The witness has given an answer to the 

         8        previous question about discussion with issues of 

         9        community, which we have it on record.  And counsel, I 

        10        think, is entitled to ask the question with regard to 

        11        the answer he gave and maybe the reason why he gave in 

        12        that way with regard to Rashele.

        13   THE WITNESS: No, personally, I was not participating in 

        14        public discussions.  I referred to Rashele because I 

        15        have known Rashele since his birth.

        16   BY MR. FLEMING:

        17   Q.   Witness, you know that Kajelijeli was removed as 

        18        bourgmestre before what you described as the war.  When 

        19        was he removed as bourgmestre?

        20   A.   I do not recall the date.  I only know that at one point 

        21        in time, he was removed from his position as 

        22        bourgmestre.

        23   Q.   Why was he removed from his position as bourgmestre?

        24   A.   I am unable to tell you the reason, but I think if you 

        25        check you will find out that at that stage he was no 

        26        longer following the instructions of the authorities in 

        27        the country.

        28   Q.   In what way wasn't he following the instructions of the 

        29        authorities in the country?

        30   A.   Well, I am saying so because I do know he was a

         1        bourgmestre; he was an authority among others.  However, 

         2        at one stage, he was removed from that position.

         3   Q.   What instructions of the authorities wasn't he following 

         4        to be removed?

         5   A.   Sorry, please, would you allow me to put the question to 

         6        you?  Somebody who does his work well and instead of 

         7        thanking him, is it normal that he is removed from that 

         8        post?

         9   Q.   Thank you for your logic.  Now, would you answer the 

        10        question, please, why was he removed from his post?  

        11        What instructions was he not following?

        12   A.   I have so stated just to answer.  However, personally, I 

        13        am not aware of any instructions that he did not follow, 

        14        and I believe it is his superiors, I mean, his superior 

        15        in the hierarchy who would be able to say so.

        16   Q.   During 1992 and 1993, Tutsi disappeared from Ruhengeri 

        17        préfecture, didn't they?

        18   A.   That is correct.

        19   Q.   That is at a time, wasn't it, when Kajelijeli was 

        20        préfect of Mukingo?

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  Objection, 

        22        Your Honour.  That is just factually incorrect.  There 

        23        are no such facts in this case.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        25   MR. FLEMING: Oh, bourgmestre.  I'm sorry.  Bourgmestre, I'm 

        26        sorry.

        27   BY MR. FLEMING:

        28   Q.   This is a during a time when Kajelijeli was bourgmestre 

        29        of Mukingo, wasn't it?

        30   A.   Yes, that's correct, sir.

          KAJELIJELI                                        7 OCTOBER 2002



         1   Q.   You personally were aware, weren't you, that Tutsi had 

         2        simply disappeared during 1992 and 1993?

         3   A.   Yes.  I mean, I was aware.

         4   Q.   And the fact that people just disappeared surely was 

         5        something that would have been against the law, wouldn't 

         6        it?

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, again, I am not quite sure 

         8        where Mr. Fleming is going.  He is aware of the law of 

         9        this case in terms of the temporal jurisdiction with 

        10        respect to any allegations attributable to 

        11        Mr. Kajelijeli.  Where he is going; what he is 

        12        attempting to do; is he going in by a back door instead 

        13        of a front door?  I'm not quite sure where he is going, 

        14        but I'm objecting to this whole line of questioning, 

        15        because it is irrelevant, immaterial and does not, in 

        16        fact, address any issue that may remotely be an issue of 

        17        competency of this Tribunal, perhaps conspiracy or 

        18        something like that.  Whatever occurred in 1992 and 1993 

        19        is not within the competency of this Tribunal except in 

        20        a very limited -- since this Court has already ruled 

        21        throughout the Prosecution case, and I think the law 

        22        still is maintained during the Defence case.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Mr. Fleming.

        24   MR. FLEMING: Yes, I'm astonished that my learned friend 

        25        raised it then in evidence-in-chief.  He went back there 

        26        and he discussed Mr. Kajelijeli's background and I am 

        27        entitled equally to cross-examine in respect of 

        28        Mr. Kajelijeli's background, and I am also entitled to 

        29        cross-examine this witness going to credit.  The fact 

        30        that I might be coming through a side door, a back door

         1        or whatever door, it is something that my learned friend 

         2        would just have to put up with.  But the fact is, I am 

         3        entitled to cross-examine this witness on (a), the 

         4        issues that my learned friend raised, and (b), the 

         5        issues going to this man's credit. 

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the issue is not my tolerance 

         7        at all.  The issue is what is the law of this particular 

         8        case.  Certainly, me asking the witness any background 

         9        information in terms of how he knew Mr. Kajelijeli, not 

        10        in the remotest way, opens the door for any questions 

        11        about disappearance of witnesses.  I mean, what is the 

        12        logic asking the witness, "do you know if people 

        13        disappeared?  Was it during Mr. Kajelijeli's tenure as 

        14        bourgmestre"?  I mean, what is the basis of this?  He 

        15        knows what he is doing and he knows it's wrong.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I think the parameters of this case, I 

        17        think, have been ventilated in a No. Of ways, even in 

        18        decisions.  So, we can't go beyond what is supposed to 

        19        be covered with regard to the temporal jurisdiction, 

        20        except, of course, that the decisions have spelt out 

        21        aspects that come within the scope of conspiracy with 

        22        specific aspects.  We don't think you can go that far, 

        23        Mr. Fleming, by the mere fact that some elements were 

        24        attached in the background of this witness and go that 

        25        far only for the sake of credit. 

        26   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, can we go into closed court, 

        27        because I want to ask this witness a series of questions 

        28        about his own background, background that my learned 

        29        friend spent a lot of time on.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel.

         2   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour.

         3   BY MR. FLEMING:  Witness, you were interviewed by Defence 

         4        Counsel on the 23rd of September 2001, weren't you?

         5   A.   That is correct.

         6   Q.   And as a result of that interview, you provided a 

         7        statement which you signed as being correct, didn't you?

         8   A.   That is correct.

         9   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honours, I call for the original of that 

        10        statement.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Defence?  Registry?

        12   BY MR. FLEMING:

        13   Q.   Now, Witness, would you look at the last page, please?  

        14        Your signature appears there, doesn't it?

        15   A.   Yes, I can see my signature.

        16   Q.   And, Witness, the last two lines of that statement says 

        17        this, doesn't it, on the same page of your signature:  

        18        "I swear that all that I have said today is the truth"?

        19   A.   Correct.

        20   Q.   Please go to the second page of the statement and to the 

        21        second paragraph.  It reads this, doesn't it?  "From the 

        22        place where I was standing, I saw Interahamwe and 

        23        soldiers shooting at the location where refugees were 

        24        hiding".  It says that, doesn't it?

        25   A.   That is correct.

        26   Q.   But you didn't see anything, you told us, except the 

        27        young men and soldiers walking to the place.  You saw no 

        28        shooting or killing?

        29   A.   But I have told you that I saw these people pass by, and 

        30        after they had gone by, I heard gunshots and I heard

         1        persons screaming.  I didn't see anyone load a gun with 

         2        bullet or throw a spear at anyone, but I saw these 

         3        people go by and later on, I heard screaming.

         4   Q.   Witness, you said, didn't you:  "I saw Interahamwe and 

         5        soldiers shooting."  That is what you said in your 

         6        statement; didn't you?

         7   A.   MR. PRESIDENT, Your Honours, I wish to tell you that if 

         8        the person who took down my statement said or wrote down 

         9        that I saw the Interahamwe and soldiers kill people, the 

        10        person must have been referring to the fact that I told 

        11        him that these individuals were passing by and were 

        12        carrying weapons.  Subsequently, I heard gunshots and 

        13        cries from people.  If you see someone pass by and the 

        14        person is armed, and later on you hear someone 

        15        screaming, the conclusion you are going to draw is that 

        16        the armed person who passed by is the one who killed the 

        17        one crying out -- this is why I am saying, the person 

        18        who took down my statement wrote that I saw what I saw, 

        19        in view of what I had told him.  I think that this is 

        20        quite clear.

        21   Q.   So, Witness, the logic is simply this; if the person was 

        22        armed when you saw them, you and the person taking the 

        23        notes assumed that they were doing the shooting; is that 

        24        your logic?

        25   A.   As far as I am concerned, the statement which I have 

        26        here before me does not contain any mistakes.

        27   Q.   So, let me follow your logic through.  You and the 

        28        person writing the statement assumed that, because they 

        29        saw the Interahamwe armed, that is why they would say in 

        30        the statement:  "I saw Interahamwe and soldiers shooting

         1        at the location where the refugees were hiding."  Is 

         2        that this logic?

         3   A.   It's all the same thing for me.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel.  We take note of the witness's 

         5        answer.  You can move on.

         6   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour.  I was going to get to 

         7        another topic.  Shall I start that before lunch?  There 

         8        are a couple of minutes to go.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, I think we will stop here and resume our 

        10        work as usual at 2:30 in the afternoon.

        11   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Until then, these proceedings stand 

        13        adjourned.

        14        (Court recessed from 1300H to 1430H)

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, the proceedings are resumed, and we are 

        16        still in open session.  

        17        

        18        Could you please tell Witness RHU29, so he should 

        19        continue to be cautious about mentioning names that 

        20        could have a bearing on his identity.

        21        

        22        Yes, Mr. Fleming, please.

        23   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour.

        24   BY MR. FLEMING:

        25   Q.   You still have the statement there, Witness?

        26   A.   Yes, I have.

        27   Q.   On the first page of the statement, and the last 

        28        paragraph of that statement, it starts:  "At 

        29        approximately 8 a.m on April 7th."  You see that 

        30        paragraph?

         1   A.   Yes, I can see the paragraph and what was written 

         2        therein is correct.

         3   Q.   Yes, thank you.  Your next paragraph, that is the first 

         4        paragraph on the second page, starts with the words, "at 

         5        that time I was able to clearly see the Munyemvano's 

         6        compound.  You see that paragraph?

         7   A.   Yes, I can see the paragraph.

         8   Q.   All right.  The words "at that time," mean at 8 a.m. on 

         9        the 7th of April; don't they?

        10   A.   Yes, you are right.

        11   Q.   So, at approximately 8 a.m, on April the 7th, you were 

        12        able to clearly see the Munyemvano compound, and there 

        13        were no persons gathered there.  That is what that first 

        14        sentence means, doesn't it?

        15   A.   On that day, there was no one in Munyemvano's house.

        16   Q.   Witness, listen carefully to what I am saying.  What you 

        17        mean by that sentence when you say "at that time", is 

        18        that on April the 7th at 8 a.m., you were able to 

        19        clearly see the Munyemvano compound and there were no 

        20        persons gathered there.  That's what you mean by that 

        21        sentence, isn't it?

        22   A.   That is true.  I could see clearly there and there was 

        23        no one there.

        24   Q.   So, at 8 o'clock on April the 7th, you could see clearly 

        25        the Munyemvano's compound and there was nobody gathered 

        26        there.  That's what it means, isn't it?

        27   A.   Yes.  That is right.

        28   Q.   Yes.  Can we go to the next paragraph, please.  It 

        29        starts from:  "From the place where I was standing, I 

        30        saw Interahamwe soldiers shooting at the location where

         1        refugees were hiding.  How did you know refugees were 

         2        hiding there?

         3   A.   I was at home, and I can tell you that people came from 

         4        different areas and found refugees at the Busogo church 

         5        because this was a difficult time.

         6   Q.   When did you first know that there people hiding in the 

         7        Busogo parish?

         8   A.   Earlier on there had been people who came from various 

         9        communes seeking refuge at the church.  But, 

        10        subsequently, the Munyemvano's family as well as their 

        11        brothers who came from elsewhere, also went in turn to 

        12        seek refuge at the church.

        13   Q.   How do you know the Munyemvano family went to seek 

        14        refuge in the church?

        15   A.   I was at my house very early in the morning and I saw 

        16        them all go the church in order to seek refuge there.

        17   Q.   So, you cannot see the church from your house.  How did 

        18        you know that they went to the church?

        19   A.   I must have known because but all those who sought 

        20        refuge there went along towards the parish, and all 

        21        these persons found that the church was their only haven 

        22        of salvation.

        23   Q.   How do you know that?  How do you know that the 

        24        Munyemvano family went to the church?

        25   A.   It is because I saw them leave.

        26   Q.   But you didn't see where they were going to, did you?

        27   A.   I am saying this because people were saying that, since 

        28        there were white men at the parish and that it was a 

        29        place of worship, no one could attack them while they  

        30        were there, and we ourselves believed the same.

         1   Q.   Witness, I am suggesting to you, in fact, people were 

         2        killed at Munyemvano's compound that morning and before 

         3        8 o'clock?

         4   A.   I didn't see those people and I don't know them.

         5   Q.   Second, I suggest to you that Kajelijeli, in fact, was 

         6        at Busogo parish on the morning of the 7th of April.

         7   A.   What I am saying is that Kajelijeli did not set foot on 

         8        Busogo church on the 7th April in the morning.  I didn't 

         9        see anyone who would have told me that he had seen 

        10        Kajelijeli at the parish on that day.

        11   Q.   Nor could you see Busogo parish, could you?

        12   A.   Even if I couldn't see the church, I am telling you that 

        13        Kajelijeli was not there.  And even after the events, I 

        14        was in contact with some refugees who had been at the 

        15        church, among them none of them told me that they had 

        16        seen Kajelijeli there.

        17   Q.   Nor were you watching the road to Busogo parish 

        18        constantly; were you?

        19   A.   I am telling you that I wasn't responsible for keeping 

        20        an eye on the road.  Furthermore, there were people 

        21        moving about, and none of those displaced persons told 

        22        me anything about Kajelijeli.  So, if Kajelijeli was at 

        23        the church on that day, people would have seen him and 

        24        they would have told me.  And this is why I am 

        25        confirming that Kajelijeli was not at the parish on that 

        26        day.

        27   Q.   Do you know a lady by the name of Nyirabushashi?

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  What name, Mr. Fleming?

        29   MR. FLEMING:  Nyirabushashi, N-Y-I-R-A-B-U-S-H-A-S-H-I.

         1   THE WITNESS:  Yes, I knew Nyirabushashi.

         2   BY MR. FLEMING:

         3   Q.   She was one person, I suggest to you, who was killed at 

         4        Munyemvano's compound that morning, the 7th of 

         5        April l994?

         6   A.   I am telling you what I know.  I took a solemn 

         7        declaration in order to speak the truth.  I cannot tell 

         8        lies.  And given my age, I didn't come here to tell 

         9        lies.  I know Nyirabushashi, she was Munyemvano's 

        10        daughter.  She was not killed in Munyemvano's compound.  

        11        To the contrary, she and all the members of Munyemvano 

        12        family were killed at the parish -- died at the parish.

        13   Q.   And all the people who died at the parish were Tutsi, 

        14        weren't they?

        15   A.   That is true.

        16   Q.   And you are Hutu, aren't you?

        17   A.   That's true.

        18   Q.   Witness, Rwankeri and Busogo cellules are neighbouring 

        19        cellules, aren't they, with only a road dividing them?

        20   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:  Can the name please be spelt?

        21   MR. FLEMING:  R-W-A-N-K-E-R-I and Busogo, B-U-S-O-G-O.

        22   THE WITNESS:  Rwinzovu and Busogo cellules neighbour one 

        23        another.

        24   MR. FLEMING:  I am sorry, Rwankeri and Busogo.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Rwankeri, okay.

        26   THE WITNESS:  Rwankeri is part of Busogo.

        27   BY MR. FLEMING:

        28   Q.   Rwankeri and Busogo cellules neighbour each other with 

        29        only a road between them; isn't that right?

        30   A.   Yes, you are right.

         1   Q.   Thank you.  Now, in which secteur is Kabyaza cellule.  

         2        K-A-B-Y-A-Z-A?

         3   A.   In Busogo there is a cellule known as Kabyaza.

         4   Q.   And how far is that from Busogo parish?

         5   A.   The distance between Busogo parish and Kabyaza cellule 

         6        is approximately 100 meters.

         7   Q.   Witness, in May, or maybe a little later, June or July, 

         8        who was cultivating the Munyemvano land?

         9   A.   In May or June there is Dakwaya who was the son of 

        10        Munyemvano who came back from exile.  He came back from 

        11        the Congo where he had sought refuge, and he was able to  

        12        recover the land which belonged to his father, and up 

        13        until now, he is the one who occupies that land.

        14   Q.   Perhaps, I wasn't very clear.  In May or June or July 

        15        of 1994 after the Munyemvano family had been killed, who 

        16        was cultivating their land?

        17   A.   At the time in May and June, for us, that is not the 

        18        time when the fields are worked upon; no one cultivates 

        19        the fields.  But in July, people begin to cultivate.   

        20        And I will tell you that in July 1994, I was unable to 

        21        tell who was cultivating Munyemvano's land because at 

        22        that time we had to flee to exile.

        23   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour, that is the 

        24        cross-examination of this witness.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Yes, any 

        26        re-examination?

         1             RE-EXAMINATION 

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Witness, drawing your attention to the morning of April 

         4        7th 1994; did you see any person at Munyemvano's 

         5        compound, any time prior to 8 a.m?

         6   A.   On that day and before 8 o'clock, I saw people coming 

         7        out of Munyemvano's compound going towards the parish.

         8   Q.   From were you were, sir, the morning of April 7th, did 

         9        you see any killings at Munyemvano's compound?

        10   A.   There was no massacre in Munyemvano's compound.

        11   Q.   Did you see, the morning of April the 7th, Juvénal 

        12        Kajelijeli among the civilians and soldiers you say you 

        13        saw going towards the church?

        14   A.   I did not.

        15   Q.   Did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli or his truck at 

        16        the Munyemvano's compound any time in the morning of 

        17        April 7th?

        18   A.   I didn't see Kajelijeli or his vehicle at that time in 

        19        Munyemvano's compound.

        20   Q.   Sir, do you know whether or not in Nkuli commune, is 

        21        there a place called Kabyaza, K-A-B-Y-A-Z-A?

        22   A.   Kabyaza is in Busogo secteur but a little further up.

        23   Q.   Perhaps, you didn't get my question fully.  The question 

        24        I am asking you, sir, is whether or not you know a place 

        25        called Kabyaza in Nkuli commune?

        26   A.   Kabyaza is half and half -- half in Nkuli and half in 

        27        Mukingo commune.  The part in Mukingo is in Busogo 

        28        secteur.

        29   Q.   Sir, could you tell this Tribunal why you call the 

        30        civilians you saw on the morning of April the 7th

         1        Interahamwe?

         2   A.   I think I explained why.  I said that the Interahamwe 

         3        were MRND supporters and had certain purposes.  And the 

         4        Interahamwe were with the military, and when I saw those 

         5        people in the company of the military, I told myself it 

         6        can't be anyone else or any other groups, but the 

         7        Interahamwe as we called them.

         8   Q.   Now, when you said, sir, you saw the civilians and the 

         9        military going towards the parish around 8 a.m., at that 

        10        time did you know what was their intention, that is, the 

        11        military and the civilians?

        12   A.   Yes, I had an idea, because we had just been informed 

        13        that the president's had been killed, that his plane had 

        14        been shot down by some people.  So, when I saw those 

        15        groups of people, I thought to myself, maybe they are on 

        16        their way to kill those who might be -- who had some 

        17        relationship with the people who shot down the plane.

        18   Q.   And how did you feel about that at that time?

        19   A.   I was saddened because I was a civil servant and I was 

        20        unemployed -- like an orphan, because I was told that we 

        21        had just lost our president's and we didn't know if we 

        22        could get another president's of that stature.

        23   Q.   Did you have any friends who had taken refuge at the 

        24        parish?

        25   A.   Yes, several of my friends had sought refuge at the 

        26        parish.  They came from Butaro and others from Gumva, 

        27        and those people were in a hazardous place of refuge at 

        28        the parish.

        29   Q.   Do you know if they lost their lives at the parish?

        30   A.   Some of those refugees died, especially Tutsi.  But the

         1        Hutus weren't disturbed.

         2   Q.   How did you feel, sir, about the death of your friends 

         3        who were Tutsis?

         4   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honours, it doesn't arise out of 

         5        cross-examination, and second, he hasn't said he had 

         6        Tutsi friends there, he said he had friends and his 

         7        subsequent answer was to the effect that Hutus who were 

         8        there were left undisturbed.  He hasn't actually 

         9        identified that some of these friends were Tutsi.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, I beg to differ, but the fact 

        11        of the matter is, questions were put to this witness as 

        12        to whether or not, he, while he was there knew that 

        13        people were being, either were going to be killed and 

        14        what did he do about it.  And it is important that we 

        15        have completeness of the record with respect to how this 

        16        witness who was looking at these events unfolded.  What 

        17        was his reaction to it.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, that is quite true and that is what you 

        19        can follow up if you so wish.  But there was no specific  

        20        as to whether the people who were there were some 

        21        relatives or friends of his arising from the 

        22        cross-examination.  But a general aspect can be raised.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Thank you, Your Honour.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT:  But certainly, whether he had any friends at 

        25        that place, the way it has been put does not really 

        26        arise from cross-examination.  As to the general 

        27        disposition, yes, you can ask those questions -- 

        28        arising.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, thank you.

        30   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:  Witness, did you have any friends who

         1        had taken refuge who were Tutsis?

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  That doesn't arise, Counsel.  And he has 

         3        already answered anyway.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, but I must lay a foundation that leads 

         5        to the other questions.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:  No, but where does it start from?  I mean the 

         7        question as to the category of people who were there.  

         8        We have known they were Tutsis, and what relationship 

         9        they had with him, that does not arise from the 

        10        questions put by Counsel in cross-examination.

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Witness, did you have any friends who were killed at the 

        13        parish?

        14   A.   I already answered by saying that some of my friends 

        15        were killed at the parish.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS:  No further questions of the witness.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS.  I don't want to misspeak, let me check with 

        19        my client.  I don't have any further questions.  No 

        20        further questions for the witness, Your Honour.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Counsel.  Judge Ramaroson has 

        22        questions to ask the witness, please.

        23   Judge RAMAROSON:  Thank you, MR. PRESIDENT.

        24        

        25        Witness, why did the Munyemvano family go early on the 

        26        morning of the 7th of April to seek refuge at the 

        27        parish?

        28   THE WITNESS:  The reason is that the members of that family 

        29        had just heard that the president's plane had been shot 

        30        down, and they were not sure about security since the

         1        father of the nation had just been killed.

         2   Judge RAMAROSON:  You said you contacted the refugees to 

         3        check if they had seen Kajelijeli.  When did you speak 

         4        to the refugees?

         5   THE WITNESS:  I did not contact the refugees during the war.  

         6        It is after the war that I contacted them when no one  

         7        was running away.

         8   Judge RAMAROSON:  After the war, you mean in what year?

         9   THE WITNESS:  In Rwanda, first there were troubles -- trouble 

        10        times.  I consider them also as being a war.  And after 

        11        those troubled times, there was a war that the whole 

        12        country was caught up in and drove Rwandans into exile.  

        13        I did not see the refugees during that time, but when 

        14        things calmed down, I was able to talk with those 

        15        refugees in May or June.

        16   Judge RAMAROSON:  Of what year, please?

        17   THE WITNESS:  In 1994.

        18   Judge RAMAROSON:  Because -- in May 1994, was Kajelijeli 

        19        already suspected of having participated in those 

        20        killings?

        21   THE WITNESS:  No one spoke of Kajelijeli's participation in 

        22        the massacres, and I confirm that he did not participate 

        23        in the massacres.

        24   Judge RAMAROSON:  But why did you investigate, why did you 

        25        ask when Kajelijeli wasn't at all suspected?  Why in 

        26        May 1994 did you ask the questions -- contact the 

        27        refugees to know whether any of them had seen 

        28        Kajelijeli?

        29   THE WITNESS:  I didn't say that I went to investigate on what 

        30        Kajelijeli's role could have been.  I meant to say that

         1        the people with whom I spoke at that time never 

         2        mentioned to me that Kajelijeli had played any role in 

         3        the massacres, and I myself knew that he hadn't played 

         4        any role in those massacres.

         5   Judge RAMAROSON:  How many refugees were at Busogo parish, 

         6        approximately?

         7   THE WITNESS:  At the parish there were many refugees.  Some 

         8        from Cyeru commune, C-Y-E-R-U.  Some from Butaro, others 

         9        from Kidaho, others from Nkumba commune and others from 

        10        Kinigi.  Some were under the tents, others were 

        11        scattered here and there in the parish, houses belonging 

        12        to the parish.

        13   Judge RAMAROSON:  About how many?  A thousand, more than a 

        14        thousand, two thousand?

        15   THE WITNESS:  MR. PRESIDENT, Honourable Judges, please 

        16        forgive me.  I am not able to give you the precise 

        17        figure.  I can't say whether it was thousand or two 

        18        thousand refugees, but I did note that there were many, 

        19        very many refugees.  But my job was not to start 

        20        counting those refugees.

        21   Judge RAMAROSON:  And you also don't know how many people 

        22        were killed -- that were killed?

        23   THE WITNESS:  I don't know how many people were killed.

        24   Judge RAMAROSON:  Thank you.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Judge Maqutu has some questions to ask the

        29        You said you lost many Tutsi friends from all over; from

         1        friends did you lose at the church?

         2   THE WITNESS:  Munyemvano's family were my friends, my 

         3        father's friends, the children were my friends, and they 

         4        all died at the parish.  I had other friends from Kinigi  

         5        commune who also died at Busogo parish, and I met those 

         6        friends in Kinigi when I was working there.  If I had to 

         7        make an estimate, I would say that my friends who died 

         8        at the parish there were at least ten of them.

         9   Judge MAQUTU:  And some of them as you say, they were not 

        10        part of the Munyemvano family, they came from other 

        11        areas?

        12   THE WITNESS:  That is right.

         2   BY JUDGE MAQUTU: And apart from those friends of yours, were 

         3        there other Tutsi, as far as you know, who died at the 

         4        parish? 

         5   THE WITNESS: The Tutsis who died at the Busogo parish came 

         6        from various places.  Some of them came from Kinyangadi, 

         7        which is a locality on the Mukingo boundary, 

         8        Mukingo/Nkuli boundary.  There were other Tutsis who 

         9        came from Ruhengeri which is in the Busogo secteur.  In 

        10        short, at the Busogo parish Tutsis from various places 

        11        died.  I spell "Kinyangadi" - K-I-N-Y-A-N-G-A-D-I.

        12   JUDGE MAQUTU: Another thing that cropped up during this case, 

        13        which you might or might not know about, is that the 

        14        Munyemvano's compound was utterly destroyed, no 

        15        buildings were left standing, and that land was 

        16        allocated to other people.  Would you know whether the 

        17        buildings were completely destroyed and everything 

        18        flattened?

        19   THE WITNESS: All the houses in the Munyemvano compound were 

        20        completely destroyed.  But regarding those persons to 

        21        whom Mr. Munyemvano's land was attributed, I would say I 

        22        do not know those persons.

        23   JUDGE MAQUTU: Was allocated, you mean? 

        24   THE WITNESS: I did say that Munyemvano's lands are now 

        25        cultivated by his son, but I do not know those other 

        26        persons to whom the lands were allocated immediately 

        27        following the death of the Munyemvano family.

         1        destroyed those houses?  Did you see?  That is, the 

         2        houses of Munyemvano. 

         3   THE WITNESS: I did not see those who destroyed the houses 

         4        within the Munyemvano compound.

         5   JUDGE MAQUTU: Thank you, judge. 

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Only one small little question, 

         7        Witness RHU-29, maybe for geography.  What is the status 

         8        of the crops in your region, and in particular your 

         9        location, during the month of March, April? 

        10   THE WITNESS: In March and April there is no farm work in our 

        11        region, because during those months that we harvest the 

        12        produce -- it's rather in May and June that we start 

        13        preparing our farms to plant sorgho.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Sorry, if I may follow it up, I just want to 

        15        understand.  So in March and April the farms may not be 

        16        worked on, but the crops are still there being 

        17        harvested.  Is that what you are saying?  Being 

        18        harvested; is that what you are saying? 

        19   THE WITNESS: Yes.  March and April back home are months 

        20        during which the farms are fallowing, in fallow, and 

        21        waiting for the lawn to be prepared.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Would you expect to have plants on them, 

        23        or what, is what I want to understand.

        24   THE WITNESS: Yes.  The farms are empty in March and April, 

        25        but when you have so many plots of land you can still 

        26        crop on some of the plots of land.  You could crop 

        27        potatoes, but these are crops which do not grow very 

        28        tall.  But crops, such as maize and sorgho, are not seen 

        29        on farms in the months of March and April.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you.  Yes, Witness RHU-29, this marks

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Professor Hinds, Learned Counsel for the 

         2        Defence.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour.  During the break we 

         4        contacted the head of witness support services, witness 

         5        and victim, and he contacted Kigali.  My understanding 

         6        is that they have no indication that the detained 

         7        witnesses would be transferred prior to Wednesday, and 

         8        what I am told is that it looks highly unlikely that 

         9        they would be here for the session.  

        10        

        11        What I asked the head of witness and victim protection 

        12        to do would be to have the witnesses brought here 

        13        forthwith as soon as they are able to transfer the 

        14        witnesses, and to notify us so that they would be here.  

        15        He said that he would be proceeding along those lines.  

        16        But when I spoke to him at lunchtime, they had no 

        17        assurances that the witnesses would be here prior to 

        18        Wednesday.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Of course, Wednesday we will have at most 

        20        maybe a day and a half, because certainly during the 

        21        coming week we are moving on to another case.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well the problem is, Your Honour -- excuse 

        23        me.  Even if the witnesses came, let's say Wednesday 

        24        evening, and for us to prepare any of them, it is 

        25        unlikely, if they only come here Wednesday evening.  We 

        26        would not have enough time to put any of them on on 

        27        Thursday.  So that is the reality of it.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: So are you planning to keep on consulting 

        29        today and tomorrow?

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: I certainly intend to do that, Your Honour.

         1        In fact, at the break we contacted both Kigali, and we 

         2        also contacted head of witness and victim protection 

         3        programme, who himself called Kigali and was speaking to 

         4        them.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: So what do you propose we do?  Do you --

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: I am proposing, Your Honour, that we adjourn 

         7        until Wednesday, at which point I could then inform the 

         8        Court of any new developments. 

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Fleming?  What do you say to that?  

        10   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, we have to say we are opposed to 

        11        any adjournment and any delay of the trial.  I suppose 

        12        our anxiety is only second to your anxiety to get the 

        13        matters through.  We are very anxious that these matters 

        14        should be pushed through to the conclusion as quickly as 

        15        they can.  We have great sympathy for our learned 

        16        friend's position.  We have been there.  However, we 

        17        haven't always escaped as generously as he has, Your 

        18        Honours. 

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the record here is very clear.  

        20        The Prosecution, over a six-month period, had situations 

        21        where they did not have witnesses.  I made no comments  

        22        in any respect with respect to their dilemma.  We 

        23        graciously accepted any adjournments that were had until 

        24        the next session.  

        25        

        26        At this particular time, we, from the very beginning, 

        27        put the Court on notice of the problems that we were 

        28        having.  We had presented today 11 witnesses.  We had 

        29        planned to present 14 witnesses during this session.  

        30        The four detained witnesses, we kept shifting around

         1        until we at this point are trying to see whether or not 

         2        they would be here.  

         3        

         4        As I indicated previously, we are in a position, in 

         5        terms of planning purposes, to indicate to the Tribunal 

         6        what witnesses we will not be calling, at least calling 

         7        as witnesses on the Defence.  There are some witnesses 

         8        whom we intend to offer affidavits, pursuant to Rule 

         9        92bis.  These are witnesses that we do not believe that 

        10        we need to take the time to put them on.  But as to 

        11        others, I am prepared to share with the Tribunal the 

        12        witnesses we do not intend to call.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Counsel. 

        14             

        15        Yes.  We will adjourn these proceedings formally later, 

        16        in a few minutes, to come to Wednesday.  But we would 

        17        request the Defence, in consultation with the registry, 

        18        and certainly with the witness protection unit, to keep 

        19        the Chamber and all the other parties informed as to 

        20        what is taking place on the ground.  There should be 

        21        close follow-up, and keep the Trial Chamber and all the 

        22        other parties informed of the progress and any useful 

        23        report with regard to the availability of the witnesses, 

        24        so that by Wednesday when we meet the situation is 

        25        clearly known by all the concerned parties as to how 

        26        things stand on the ground with regard to the 

        27        availability of the witnesses. 

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: In the meantime -- yes, Mr. Fleming? 

        30   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, RHU-24 was one of the witnesses to

         1        be called.  Our learned friends are no longer calling 

         2        him.  He is here.  I take it, therefore, that he is no 

         3        longer a witness, or a potential witness, and, 

         4        therefore, is no longer covered by witness protection 

         5        order.  I am saying this, because we would like to 

         6        interview him, and I take it that our learned friends 

         7        wouldn't have that objection, and indeed they couldn't 

         8        have that objection any longer, because he is no longer 

         9        a witness or a potential witness.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, what do you say to that? 

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we obviously object to the 

        12        Prosecution reaching out to any of our witnesses, 

        13        whether or not they have testified or have not 

        14        testified.  That is improper for them to do that, and we 

        15        are, of course, objecting to this attempt by the 

        16        Prosecutor to reach across our shoulders, so to speak, 

        17        and to interview any of our witnesses under these 

        18        circumstances.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, but their position is that you are not 

        20        calling Witness RHU-24.  I think that is what the 

        21        Defence indicated this morning.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is correct, Your Honour.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: We will not make any ruling with regard to 

        24        what -- there is no formal request here as to what 

        25        witnesses of the other party can -- you know, it can 

        26        happen to them with regard to either contact, and what 

        27        have you.  So on the information we have, and we will 

        28        not make any further comment on that.  But we take note, 

        29        certainly, on the indications and information given by 

        30        the Defence that you do not intend to call

         1        Witness RHU-24.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour, and we have sent a letter.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes that's -- I was coming to that.  We have 

         4        seen some communication this afternoon with regard to 

         5        other witnesses that you don't intend to call.  Is that 

         6        correct, Counsel?

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour.  We sent a communique 

         8        addressed to Mr. Fleming and carbon copy to the trial 

         9        coordinator in which we have included RHU-24, RHU-32, 

        10        RHU-33, KJ-26, KJ-38, MBA, MNLR, MBMA, BAM.  With 

        11        respect to MNEK and CB, those are detained witnesses 

        12        here in Arusha, and we intend to submit affidavits 

        13        pursuant to Rule 92bis with respect to those witnesses.  

        14        But we do not intend to call them as witnesses in our 

        15        case. 

        16             

        17        We have indicated that we are applying to the Chamber 

        18        and we are filing an extremely urgent motion for an 

        19        order to call GDD as a hostile witness in our case.  So 

        20        we are serving notice on the Prosecutor that there will 

        21        be such an application, since we now have documents 

        22        which reflect prior statements made by GDD. 

        23             

        24        So that is, in substance, the communication that was 

        25        communicated to Mr. Fleming earlier today.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Yes, Mr. Fleming.

        27   MR. FLEMING: We obviously don't have that yet, but can I ask 

        28        this question: Does my learned friend, in respect of the 

        29        witnesses that he intends to present pursuant to Section 

        30        92bis, does he intend to make them available for 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        72



          KAJELIJELI                                        7 OCTOBER 2002



         1        cross-examination? 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think the intent of the Rule is very 

         3        clear, and to the extent that the Prosecutor has any 

         4        questions about the legislative intent, he may want 

         5        to -- she may want to refer to the record.  But we know 

         6        that the Rule exists.  The fact is in favour of 

         7        admitting such evidence is set forth in the Rules, and 

         8        we feel that the circumstances with respect to these 

         9        three witnesses meet squarely those factors.  

        10        

        11        So we are proceeding pursuant to those provisions, and 

        12        the issue of cross-examination of the witnesses are not 

        13        addressed in the Rule, and I think for precisely the 

        14        purpose of why the Rule was set up, and it is for some 

        15        expediency of time.  We are saying that we intend to 

        16        take advantage of the Rule with respect to 

        17        Witnesses MNEK and CB. 

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Well you --

        19   MR. FLEMING: I take it he is saying no, they are not making 

        20        them available for cross-examination.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Well what we can do, the Trial Chamber can 

        22        note is, it is the intention of the Defence to move on 

        23        the provisions of Rule 92bis with regard to some of the 

        24        witnesses.  As to what happens subsequently when the 

        25        Trial Chamber, when seized with the motion and the 

        26        parties are being heard, can always make a 

        27        determination.

        28             

        29        But what we want to get clear from the Defence, 

        30        Professor Hinds, is that the listed witnesses that you 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        have just read out, the Defence does not intend to call 

         2        them? 

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is correct, Your Honour, we do not 

         4        intend to put them on the stand.  That is correct.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Then you have those two or three --

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Three.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: -- that you want to proceed with them in a 

         8        different way?

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: By affidavit, that is correct.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  We take note of that.  You have 

        11        spelled them out into the record, I suppose, because I 

        12        have seen that communication today, this afternoon.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: I have just put it on the record, because I 

        14        want it to be very clear in the record.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  And if we go by way of 

        16        mathematics, how many witnesses remain that the Defence 

        17        intends to call? 

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: There are 17 or 18.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  If you take out 11.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Three -- in terms of fact witnesses, they 

        21        are including -- excluding Mr. Kajelijeli, excluding 

        22        him.  There are 16 fact witnesses and two experts that 

        23        we intend to call .

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: So if you take out those ones, how many 

        25        remain?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: The experts?  Sixteen, sixteen fact 

        27        witnesses.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: I thought there were 30 originally? 

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well -- well, no.  There were about 41, and 

        30        we said that we will call about 30.  We have put in so

         1        far 11. 

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: And so the balance that we have at this 

         4        point is there are 16 fact witnesses and without 

         5        Mr. Kajelijeli and two expert witnesses.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay, we will come to that later.  Okay, you 

         7        wanted to say something, Mr. Fleming? 

         8   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, it was the last issue we wanted to 

         9        raise, and that was the statements of the witnesses.  We 

        10        provided our highlighting to our learned friends last 

        11        Wednesday.  We haven't heard back yet from them, so that 

        12        is an issue we will have to clear up.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Can we have that completed?  Have you sent it, 

        14        Professor Hinds? 

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: We have seen it.  We have a No. Of 

        16        objections, and Professor Bompaka is prepared to address 

        17        those.

        18   MR. FLEMING: I understand that Professor Bompaka was going to 

        19        have a conversation with Ms. Ojemeni.  So it may be that 

        20        we can resolve it without taking up Your Honour's time, 

        21        and if not, if not, we can come back to it on Wednesday 

        22        for a short time.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: I thought those were the extracts that were 

        24        read out into the record from cross-examination.  I 

        25        suppose that is the --

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think there are statements with respect to 

        27        three witnesses that the Prosecution has highlighted.  

        28        They handed them to us, we have gone over them, and we 

        29        have sent in objections.  I don't know if Professor 

        30        Bompaka have shared them, our objection with

         1        Ms. Ojemeni, but I am not opposed to the process of them 

         2        having consultations and seeing where they could be 

         3        resolved, without us taking up the Court's time.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Let the consultation be made so that at least 

         5        by Wednesday we should be able to finalize this matter.  

         6        We are almost getting to the end of this session, so we 

         7        cannot carry it beyond the time frame of this session.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: There is one further matter, Your Honour, 

         9        and that relates to a motion that we filed, and it's a 

        10        motion that we filed in limine and we were given what I 

        11        called a scheduling order with respect to the time frame 

        12        under which the responses were to be made.  I think 

        13        there were some sort of a three-day rule. To date, we 

        14        have not received notice that there has been a response, 

        15        and so we believe that the Prosecution is time barred 

        16        with respect to this particular matter.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Which motion is that? 

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: It's a motion in limine.  There was a 

        19        three-day rule by which the Prosecution -- we were 

        20        notified and the Prosecution was notified on the 27th 

        21        that they had three days within which to respond, which 

        22        would have made it the 30th.  There has been no 

        23        response -- that is September 30.  There has been no 

        24        response as of today, October 7th, and we, of course, 

        25        are prepared to move formally, but I thought that I may 

        26        as well just put it on the record that the Prosecution 

        27        is time barred.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: What is the subject matter of that? 

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: It's a motion in limine and the Court said 

        30        they were going to proceed on the papers.

         1        Pursuant to Rule 73 on this particular matter concerning 

         2        the motion on Nzirorera, whether or not Nzirorera, when 

         3        and if he takes the stand, would the Prosecution be able 

         4        to examine him beyond the area of direct.  We intend to 

         5        put Mr. Nzirorera on the stand when his lawyer is 

         6        available during the next session.  But the Court was, 

         7        as I understood it, prepared to rule pursuant to 

         8        Rule 73, just on the papers, and there was a scheduling 

         9        order that we received on the 27th indicating that the 

        10        Prosecution had three days within which to respond and 

        11        then the Defence had three days after that.  That was 

        12        the 27th. 

        13   MR. FLEMING: Our understanding is that that was going to be 

        14        argued in court, Your Honour.  I am not aware of such a 

        15        direction.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: I don't know, whether perhaps the 

        17        communication may have been a problem after the hearing 

        18        was postponed for that motion, and the Counsel was not 

        19        available.  It's true the coordinator was instructed to 

        20        give, to inform the parties to deal with this matter by 

        21        way of written briefs, and that we invited the parties, 

        22        the Prosecution to respond to the motion of the Defence 

        23        within time frame so that the matter could be worked out 

        24        even before the witness is made available some time next 

        25        session.  So you haven't had the --

        26   MR. FLEMING: I wasn't aware of that, Your Honour, so I am 

        27        quite happy to be put on a time limit as of today, but I 

        28        certainly wasn't aware of it.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I have before me a communique 

        30        that was from the CMS coordinator, Mr. Fleming,

         1        Ms. Ojemeni.  I am not the author of this document.  We 

         2        received it, and I think that according to the 

         3        procedures whatever is good for this side of the Chamber 

         4        has to apply equally on the other side.  And so, 

         5        therefore, I think that the registry should be able to 

         6        determine how they, in fact, served this information.  I 

         7        think they have some sort of a process of people signing 

         8        for these documents.  I don't know what they did, but I 

         9        know that I am operating based upon what we received.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: It is true that the time frames were given.  

        11        But since the real purpose of this matter is not to hold 

        12        up until the parties are heard orally when we next meet, 

        13        rather than -- but rather to have the pleadings 

        14        completed, and the Trial Chamber can deal with the 

        15        matter on written briefs and have this matter 

        16        determined.  

        17        

        18        I think that is the essence of the matter, that is the 

        19        most important thing.  And we can, and we do have the -- 

        20        it is the Trial Chamber that give the time frames, we 

        21        can give the time frame.  We can extend it for a day or 

        22        two to have that done, if you are not informed.  I hope 

        23        that is the position.

        24   MR. KIYEYEU: My Lord, on behalf of the registry, at the 

        25        moment I didn't know that, but at least we have -- 

        26        normally we serve them and they sign on the sheet, so I 

        27        really cannot give an answer right now.  Maybe if I can 

        28        check, but I am sure if the Defence received, the 

        29        Prosecutor should have received.  Maybe it is laying 

        30        somewhere with the secretaries, that I can assure you,

         1        My Lord.

         2   MR. FLEMING: My Lord, can we assume the worst: that it is 

         3        somewhere in our system and hasn't been brought to our 

         4        attention, and might I then ask for an extension of two 

         5        days within which to file the document? 

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: You know, I could be gracious.  But 

         7        Mr. Kajelijeli filed a notice of appeal challenging the 

         8        jurisdiction of this Court.  We were thrown out on our 

         9        heads because we missed the deadline.  Mr. Fleming was 

        10        leading the charge stating that since we did not file on 

        11        time, we were time barred.  All right, I will be 

        12        gracious.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Let the document there -- please go and find 

        14        out, whoever it is.  Can we have the response by 

        15        Wednesday? 

        16   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Yes.  So we request that the parties 

        18        finalize the consultation with regard to the highlighted 

        19        parts of the statement so we are in a position to 

        20        complete this process by the end of this session.  We 

        21        don't need to carry these matters forward to the next 

        22        session.  They must be completed during this session. 

        23             

        24        So that --

        25   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, can I ask one other matter, and 

        26        perhaps Your Honour can give some thought to it before 

        27        we meet again.  We have four weeks in November and 

        28        December in respect of this matter.  It would appear on 

        29        the present progress that we won't complete the evidence 

        30        in that four weeks.  Have Your Honours yet thought about

         1        the program for next year, and if so perhaps we can 

         2        discuss it next time we meet? 

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We can do that.

         4   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, I shudder to think of next 

         6        year; I was hoping that we would finish this year.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: It's our hope that we should be able to finish 

         8        the evidence for the Defence during the forthcoming 

         9        session.  But at the same time things do happen 

        10        differently.  We must start thinking about next year and 

        11        we have already started, actually, in some cases.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: We really want to see this case and the other 

        14        case completed as soon as possible.  So we cannot avoid 

        15        having some thoughts to some time frames earlier next 

        16        year.

        17             

        18        Okay then.  We will adjourn these proceedings to 

        19        Wednesday at nine in the morning and, of course, we will 

        20        be awaiting to hear any information, reports concerning 

        21        the availability of witnesses in the course of the day 

        22        tomorrow, the whole day tomorrow.  Until then, these 

        23        proceedings stand adjourned.
