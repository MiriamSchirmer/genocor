P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. DIALLO:
 Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Francis Emile Short (sic) and Judge Gustave Kam is sitting today, Friday, 26th of May 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutors versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, my legal assistant, Leopold Nsengiumva, has arrived from Malawi where he was taking his exams, and has now joined our team and is present today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the announcement, and welcome to the proceedings.  

Mr. Robinson, I gather that there has been some movement on the issues that you raised.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  Yesterday we were communicating by email, and I think we have reduced the number of PVs that are not yet disclosed from four to two.  And I think the situation, as Mr. Morley explained it to me, was of the four PVs that were missing, one had in fact been included in a CD that was disclosed to us.  And I verified that, and I apologise because that was my mistake.  I didn't think I had it, but I did.  

The second one, he represents, was contained in a CD that was ordered not disclosed by the Trial Chamber, so I don't have any way of verifying that but I accept that it's true.  So those -- that takes care of two, and then there's two that apparently have not yet been located.  So, we would at least reduce the number of missing disclosures.  

Mr. President, I do want to raise one issue about what we did -- the material we did receive, the 25 pages.  Yesterday I went over that with Mr. Nzirorera and my team, and it was translated to me.  I understand what it is and I have some concerns about it.  The 25 pages were basically retyped documents which were basic -- were PVs that were retyped.  
I see that Mr. Morley is standing, but I haven't finished my presentation yet.  
MR. MORLEY:
I was simply going to try to assist by handing up to Your Honours copies of the document in question, in combination with the arguments which were filed and the decision which was made.  

With Mr. Issa's assistance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, what does this represent?  
MR. MORLEY:
The document to which Mr. Robinson is referring, the argument which was filed, and the decision of the Chamber, as I mentioned a moment ago.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Does Mr. Morley have a copy for the Defence?  
MR. MORLEY:
I do have copies.  The only difficulty is, is that part of the bundle I've got includes the ex parte argument which was filed.  I know my learned friend has copies of the document because he's been working with it yesterday.  But if people actually on the other side of the Court need copies of the summary, I can make arrangements for that to be arranged now.  

Realistically, is that necessary?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That isn't necessary, but in my opinion whenever documents are handed to the Court, they should at least be shown to the other side.  But I understand that that's not possible since what's been handed to the Court includes ex parte material. 
MR. MORLEY:
Simply the ex parte argument which was filed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, you know how much I appreciate ex parte arguments.  In fact, that's the subject of a pending motion that was filed back in December.  But putting that aside, the problem is that what has been given to us, apparently, there is a collection of statements of Witness T taken by the state over a period of 2004 through 2005, or perhaps 2006.  And what the Prosecution did is essentially redact those statements.  But, instead of blacking out portions of it, they retyped the portions that they thought we should have and presented them to us in this 25-page typed document.  So that means, to me, that there are other statements of this witness that are -- have not been disclosed to us.  

And I see that in the order of the Trial Chamber, in paragraph 21, the Trial Chamber approved the Prosecutor's providing us with redacted copies of the statements of the witness.  But I -- and I have made a motion on Wednesday for you to reconsider your ruling under Rule 66(C), and I have to question what -- what the Trial Chamber had in mind, or whether the Trial Chamber was aware at the time that what was not being disclosed to us was actually statements of the witness, Rule 66(A)(ii) material, and I don't understand how witness statements can be withheld from the Defence up and through the time that the witness testifies.  I understand that there may be other material, what other people have said about this witness, that the Trial Chamber had concerns that if we were to learn of it, we could go out and talk to those people and somehow prejudice the case of this witness.  But I don't understand how the witness -- disclosure of the witness's own statements could prejudice his case, and it certainly hampers the case of the Accused.  

The topics of these statements that were disclosed to us yesterday include admissions by the witness that he and his wife lied to two -- authorities of two different states in their immigration and asylum claims about the events in Rwanda, and stark contradictions between the testimony of this witness and General Dallaire, also a Prosecution witness in this case.  So the material clearly falls under Rule 68 as well as Rule 66(A)(ii).  

Now, if the situation isn't corrected, it seems clear that we're going to be in a situation where this witness will have to be recalled after his trial.  And, in fact, it would be our position that our trial could not be completed until the examination of Witness T was concluded, which would include examination on all of his prior statements.  

And so I would ask you to consider, at this time, now that we know that what has been withheld from us includes statements of this witness, now that we know the witness's own situation concerning both the timing and the degree to which he's contesting his own trial, that you go back and look at what has been withheld from us and reconsider that and, especially as to the witness's own statements, order that they be disclosed.  Thank you.
MR. MORLEY:  
Dealing first of all with the missing PVs:  We found two.  The remaining two, of one of those it seems clear we've never had it, and that seems to be as a result of its timing.  The PV appears to have been recorded on the 1st of September of last year, and would then have had to have been typed up.  The (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under separate cover) dossier, Your Honours will remember --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we are in open court.  The name of the country is redacted. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  The dossier which was provided to the OTP was provided in the week beginning the       5th of September.  And what appears to have happened is that that PV is something which has never been sent to us.  On the face of it, the state must have thought that we had the PV because it predated our receipt of the dossier, but in fact it hadn't been typed up and put in the dossier until after we received the dossier.  So we've never had it to disclose.  That's the first point.  

The second PV, on the face of it -- and Your Honours may appreciate that I went through all the material yesterday a number of times, and Your Honours will remember just how much material there is, it would appear -- and I may be wrong about this -- but the typing in a PV of that PV number may be mistaken, which is why we haven't been able to locate it.  It may be we never received it.  But it's more likely it was a typographical error with regard to the numbering itself.  And, therefore, when Mr. Robinson asked for a PV of a certain number, that number, in all probability, doesn't exist.  But we wait to hear from the state as to whether or not that analysis is right, or whether it's simply a document which has never been given to us.  Now, I hope that helps with regard to the situation relating to those two documents.  

Turning now to the PV summary of the witness's statements, Your Honours will recall the arguments which were filed, and Your Honour will recall that the principal point was that witnesses who had been spoken to by the state, who made observations and some allegations against the witness, their identities, the Chamber felt, should be protected, which is why the Chamber agreed with the Prosecution suggestion of presenting a redacted form of what the witness had been saying in respect of enquiries which had been conducted independently by the state.  
And that is how the document, first of all, came to be created and, secondly, it was felt appropriate, should be disclosed.  

Your Honours may recall that, in fact, in the argument which was filed, it is plain at paragraph 17 of the argument that it had been my understanding that the redaction document, the summary document, was included in CD number 1, which was disclosed to my learned friends.  It transpires that the summary document had been in CD 2B, where it had been put in a folder with the PVs of this witness, representing a summary and redactions of the witness's PVs.  Now, I don't know how that happened.  It was certainly contrary to my instructions.  

What is peculiar is that Your Honour's order of the 15th of February of 2006 makes the observation that the material in CD number 2 should not be disclosed.  So, by an oversight on the part of the Chamber, as well as on my own part, no one seems to have picked up that the summary document was in fact still in CD number 2 and, by a peculiarity, ended up being ordered not disclosed, when -- and I make it plain -- it had always been my understanding it had been in CD number 1 and was disclosed and, in fact, in my argument had been described as such.  So that's the history of the unhappy circumstance of its late disclosure.  I only found out about the difficulty when I was discussing matters with Mr. Robinson recently.  It came as a surprise to me.  

The document itself, looking at it, is a series of items of interest to the Defence which are collateral to indictment issues.  They are issues which go to the credibility of the witness and are not on the substantive question of what the witness says about these three defendants.  It is right to say that my learned friend can cross-examine the witness by suggesting that he has made admissions during the course of his being enquired of by the state, which may be inconsistent with things that he has said previously, and those questions may go to his credibility.  But I stress what is in the document, as I read it -- and Mr. Robinson may read it differently -- relates to collateral issues; specifically, suggestions of inconsistency on the part of the witness with regard to his own behaviour after the genocide began on the 6th of April 1994, and does not touch on the three defendants.  

Insofar as my learned friends invite a complete review of the disclosability of the entirety of CD 2B -- and Your Honours will recall that the material which gave rise to the enquiries of the witness in CD 2B arose out of the contents of CD 2A -- it's my respectful submission that there is no obviously good reason for Your Honours to review the decision of the Court to protect the identities of the witnesses as decided in the Chamber's decision.  There's no obviously good reason for that.  And Your Honours will recall the arguments which were filed, and they appear in the ex parte document which I have handed up to Your Honours so that Your Honours are reminded of the arguments, as to the sensitivity relating to the identification of witnesses in an enquiry by a different jurisdiction into a defendant not before this Tribunal.  

So I respectfully submit there's no obvious reason to unseat Your Honour's decision of the 15th of February of 2006.  I do understand my learned friend's frustrations, but Your Honour will remember the competing interests of the interests of justice and the interests of the defendants, and the decision was taken that it would not be appropriate to reveal the identities of the witnesses.  And that's why the statements of the witness before Your Honour ended up being produced in redacted form in order to remove reference to the identification of -- from where allegations were coming.  

Insofar as we proceed today, it's my respectful submission that all the material which is before Mr. Robinson and Your Honours is material which able counsel, and I hope my learned friend takes this as a compliment -- Mr. Robinson is plainly an able counsel.  He will be able to muster and manage, if not already today, by Monday.  And the material relates to collateral matters, so it's questionable, but we wait to see how it plays out, to what extent any of this material is going to be pivotal to the testimony.  Mr. Robinson may take a different view, but it is right to say that it's material that is of interest to him, and I'm pleased that he's had an opportunity to go through it and, that on the face of it, he has a familiarity with it as we approach the moment of cross-examination.  
Now I don't know if I can assist further at this stage.  In short:  Two PVs outstanding, still waiting to hear from the (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under separate cover) order, we've never had them, one seems to be a typographical error.  The summary, peculiarly, was ordered not disclosed in the Chamber's decision because the summary ended up in CD 2B, when in the argument I thought, and plainly said, it was in CD 1.  It's now before Mr. Robinson, and it's on collateral matters.  

Can I assist further at the moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't have any questions, Mr. Morley.  Thank you very much for that very clear description of what has transpired.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just be heard very briefly in reply.  First of all, with respect to one of the missing CD PVs, which apparently was dated the 1st of September 2005, and Mr. Morley is representing that the Prosecutor received the documents on the 5th of September, so it was possible that this was not included.  I just want to bring to your attention something which Mr. Morley already knows, and that is that on the 14th of March I contacted Mr. Rapp, who was responsible for this witness at the time, copied to Mr. Webster, and I asked him to go to the state and make sure that -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If counsel could slow down, please.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I asked them to re-contact the state and to make sure that they have all of the updated PVs since the time that they collected them from the state.  And Mr. Rapp responded to me and assured me that they would do that.  So the fact that we don't have this PV from the 1st of September 2005 is not a very good thing, if that, in fact, was the case, as Mr. Morley indicates, that it wasn't among the material first collected by the OTP.  

I take issue with Mr. Morley's characterisation as this material -- to this material as collateral material.  You can see for yourself that it includes descriptions of the events of the 12th of April, distribution of weapons, in which he's implicated directly Mr. Nzirorera, as well as meetings he had with Mr. Dallaire in his capacity as a member of the committee listed on P. 9.  The other thing that I find incongruous is that dealing with these shadow arguments that Mr. Morley has made to the Trial Chamber that we can't see, there seems to be an interest in protecting the identity of those who have made accusations against Witness T.  But in the Trial Chamber's own decision on our motion to compel inspection and disclosure, you ordered the identities of 14 witnesses who had accused Witness T of different wrongdoing in statements to OTP be disclosed to us.  And you further ordered that the witness and victim section was to make these witnesses availability to us for interview so that we could have exercise of our full rights of defence to these allegations.  And we, in fact, went and talked to many of those witnesses.  And so I don't understand why material would be withheld from us from the state on the very same grounds for which the Trial Chamber also ruled that this exculpatory material had to be disclosed to us, including the identities of those making accusations against Witness T.  So I think that that alone is a sufficient reason for the Trial Chamber to go back and look at the material that's been withheld from us and decide, really, if it's necessary that this be withheld and consider what are the implications, given the timing of Witness T's own case, for the completion of this trial and for the management of this trial by continuing to withhold this information.  

I just want to finally point out that this is what happens, these problems, when the Prosecution takes upon itself the role of hiding information from the Accused, and that's the only way that I could put this.  This was the material that was requested from the state, and it was the obligation of the state to produce the material and to make any objections that it felt were warranted to protect its own interests and that of the witness.  And so the Prosecutor took it on itself to do that, to withhold materials which the state may very well not have withheld from us.  And any problems relating to that lack of disclosure is all of their own making because they usurp the role of the state and put themselves and the Trial Chamber in a position where material that is relevant to cross-examination and necessary to a fair trial is now not in our hands.  So, I thank you for listening to me, and I ask you to reconsider your ruling of Rule 66(C).  Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to make two points of clarification.  First of all, our learned colleague Morley has the frequent tendency of thinking that the Defence is limited to Peter Robinson.  And in the correspondences we have realised that quite often he communicates, initially -- or, first of all with Peter Robinson, and it is only afterwards that we receive the correspondences.  I would like to know what justifies that, because the PVs that we were given yesterday were disclosed to Peter Robinson long before that.  I think that we also represent accused persons and that we should be treated in the same manner.  

Secondly, I do not understand what they mean by summary PVs.  These are not summaries.  These are excerpts from PVs, and that is different.  And when you take out an excerpt, it is a part of the PV.  This leads to misunderstanding in the reading of the PVs.  I will give you examples, Mr. President.  When you read the PVs, at one point they say, first of all number 1, and then they move to point 3; so where is point 2?  Either we are given the documents in accordance with the rules, specifically given that in this particular issue it was Mr. Peter Robinson who made the request based on what is -- the Prosecutor playing the role of the Court.  The provisions of Rule 68 and 68 -- 66 states that if the Court feels that the security of a state is at risk, the Court has to take the decision.  

Furthermore, Peter Robinson has said something that is important.  The state which sent that document did not make any reservations to the effect that such-and-such a part of the document should not be made available to the parties.  So I believe that Mr. Morley has committed an error, and he should be called to order.  Once again, that should not continue.  

And we are asking the Court, which is the only one with the authority to take possession of the documents, should decide which documents should be put at our disposal.  It should not be overlooked.  That is a fact, it should not be overlooked, and that it is our Accused who are suffering.  They are at great risk and the accusations against them are very serious.  And, personally, when I read excerpts of the statements of the witness, I thought that was very, very serious.  We move from one state to another and we have the impression that it is the witness who is being manipulated, and this has a serious effect on the credibility of the witness.  As an accused party, we have the right to have these documents and to defend ourselves in the context of a fair trial.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, very briefly, I will give you my observations following this incident.  Since I am the last to speak amongst the Defence parties, I will not dwell on what has already been said on the disclosure of documents to the Defence.  We received the PVs, that is the Defence of Mr. Ngirumpatse, yesterday in the early afternoon.  The term of redaction was used to refer to the documents that were not made available to us.  A summary is not equivalent to redaction.  So, we have the impression that there is a great manipulation here.  Of course, we have information that can be used, but we need to know the logic behind the questions that were put for the -- by the examining magistrate.  So this is not fair on the part of the Prosecution.  And we realise that things are being arranged in such a way that exculpatory materials are not made available to us as per the rules and legal instruments.  So we feel ill at ease in our efforts to organise our questions for the cross-examination.  And this seems to be trial by ambush by the Prosecution, which at the last minute makes available to the Defence important materials that could have been used, but which are not being used.  It is not because the Defence cannot do this, but the simple reason is that they are important materials which we should have had in the appropriate time, is given to us at an inappropriate moment.  

You have referred to redacted materials, but let us receive those redacted materials and not the excerpts based on the judgement of the Prosecution.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very briefly, I take my learned friend Mr. Sow's point; the word "summary" is perhaps inaccurate, "excerpts" is a better way of putting it.  With regard to the argument, there's been no representations made about the sensitivity of disclosing material, representations made by those with an interest in the proceedings in the foreign state.  Your Honours recall that there were representations made by T's lawyer, and Your Honours recall those.  
Insofar as there this is a suggestion that one should approach the witnesses in respect of the state's investigation in the same way as one approaches the witnesses who have been approached by the offices of the OTP, the point is, they are not OTP witnesses.  And that was a consideration which Your Honours had in mind when deciding not to reveal their identities.  They are witnesses who have been approached by a foreign state.  

In short, therefore, I would invite that we proceed.  There's no reason to unseat Your Honour's original decision.  And there's only one other thing to say, if I may; I just remembered.  My apologies to my learned friends across the room whose sensitivities are that somehow I simply communicate with Mr. Robinson.  Not so.  But what actually happened was when I sent Mr. Robinson an electronic copy of the excerpts document, I had been expecting him to be able to say to me that he had that.  I sent it to him as a matter of clarity because he had been saying to me he wasn't sure what I was referring to.  And it was only when I walked into court on Wednesday morning that I realised there was going to be a problem.  So yesterday I sent my learned friends who co-defend with him, copies of the document.  I'm sorry for the delay.  But it's not as if I'm having a private conversation in exclusion of my learned friends who co-defend with Mr. Robinson.  It was simply a matter of clarity which lead to that communication directly with him.  I hope that that assists.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we think that in view of everything that has been said this morning, there is food for us to think about.  We think, however, that in the meantime, the evidence should continue.  It's already ten to 10:00.  And we'll let you know if there is anything that we have concluded when we've had a chance to consider what has been said.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may, Your Honour, there's one housekeeping matter I'd like to take up independent of Witness T's testimony.  This concerns ZF.  Usually, at the end of the day, I go through the draft transcripts, and I did so with respect to the transcripts of the 23rd of May and I noticed one particular question from Mr. Robinson that should be redacted or should be treated as being asked in closed session.  It made a reference to the proceeding that Witness ZF participated in that was independent of the OTP.  And we had agreed previously that there would be no reference to that proceeding, or identifying that proceeding in open court.  

I've mentioned that to the stenographers.  And I believe they may have contacted you through your Trial Chamber coordinator, so I'm sure the Court knows what I'm talking about.  But I'm asking that the Court order a redaction of that particular portion of the transcript of the 23rd of May.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it will be sufficiently clearly if I simply said the redaction order is made.  

Mr. Registrar, do we have the link with the other location?  

Good morning to Mr. Hometowu and to everyone gathered in the other location.  We've been sitting here for some time, hearing legal arguments.  We have completed with that process now, and we are ready to recommence hearing the testimony of the witness.  I take it that the appearances in your location are the same.  

Mr. Hometowu, are you hearing me?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I had greeted you and everyone gathered in your location. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I indicated that we have been sitting here for some time hearing legal arguments.  And now that that process has been completed, we are ready to recommence hearing the testimony of the witness.  And I requested confirmation that the appearances in your location are the same.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I hereby confirm that the appearances are not changed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I must say there is a lot of noise coming over the headsets.  I don't know where it originates from or what is causing it, but we will proceed and see if it does not interfere with our communication.  

Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning to you, too.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, your testimony will continue.  I remind you that you remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  And Mr. Morley will continue his examination of you.  


WITNESS T,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  Can you hear me?  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I can hear you loud and clear.  
Q.	We had got to a point in time where you left Kigali to join your family on the 17th of April of 1994.  Did you return to Kigali and, if so, when?  
A.	I returned to Kigali in the evening of the 17th, but I was not able to reach Kigali because there was so much fighting that at the level of Nyabarongo river, I took the direction of Gitarama.  And as from the 18th I resumed my professional activities.  And between the 19th and the 24th of April, I usually made trips between Gitarama and Kigali.  I shuttled between Gitarama and Kigali. 
Q.	Did you at any stage go to Gitarama and see the location at the -- at Murambi of the government?  
A.	As from the 18th, I went to Murambi practically every day.  And I'm referring here to the period between the 18th and the 24th of April.  I went frequently to Murambi for professional reasons. 
Q.	When you went to Murambi -- 
MR. MORLEY:
And I just pause for a moment to remind Your Honours, Murambi is a complex of buildings quite close to Gitarama.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When you went to Murambi, can you tell us whether at any point you saw Ngirumpatse, Karemera or Nzirorera present? 
A.	Yes, I saw Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I saw Mr. Joseph Nzirorera.  And I also saw Mr. Édouard Karemera. 
Q.	Can you help us with when that was?  
A.	I saw Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Mr. Nzirorera between the 18th and the 20th, but I'm much more certain about the date of the 19th.  So this means that I saw Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse and I gave him my regards, and the same applies for Mr. Nzirorera.  As concerns Mr. Karemera, I met him in Gitarama outside of Murambi, but I believe this was two or three days later. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
Comment for their Honours, Your Honours will have observed that the video link seems to have frozen.  We can hear the witness, but we can`t see him speaking.  We have a still image from the scene.  And I'm just wondering if that can be corrected.  Do Your Honours see the point?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we see the point.  

Mr. Registrar, can you make an enquiry from the technicians?  
MR. MORLEY:
If I may, Your Honour, I'm not sure who is doing what to assist us or whether the state authorities are aware of the problem.  I'm just wondering whether, if I look across the room to the audio-visual booth, whether somebody might indicate if the problem is at our end or at the state's end. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that's where the registrar went. 
MR. MORLEY:
I see that now.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar has reported that the technicians informed him that there's nothing they can do from this end.  

So, Mr. Hometowu, can I enquire, are you hearing me?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
I hear you well, Mr. President.  The technicians are looking into it, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Should we wait a while?  It's quite clear that the -- from our end -- I don't know if you are getting the same image on your screens, but the image seems to be frozen and we're getting a still picture.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
We have the same image, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could the technicians give an idea of how much time they need to rectify the situation?  

Yes, Mr. Hometowu, are you able to give us an idea of what's wrong and how much time is required to have it corrected?  
MR. MORLEY:
My instinct, Your Honour, is that we've lost the signal over in the state.  I don't know if I'm right about that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  The registrar has gone to make an enquiry.  

Mr. Morley, you are correct.  The registrar has reported that the sound has been lost.  We think we are going to need to rise for a while to see if the situation can be corrected.  So, we will just rise for a few minutes and allow the technicians to investigate the situation, and we will await their report. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, thank you. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court will rise for a short while.  
(Court recessed from 1007H to 1042H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness T, can you hear me, please? 
A.	I can hear you well, Counsel. 
Q.	You've told us about seeing Karemera, Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse where the government was in Murambi.  What about Bagosora?  Did you come across Bagosora after the 17th of April?  
A.	Yes, I did come across Colonel Bagosora after the 17th of April, in fact, on more than one occasion. 
Q.	Did you have any dealings with Colonel Bagosora and, if so, what did they consist of, please? 
A.	Essentially, we dealt with issues relating to a mission which I had to carry out outside of Rwanda in connection with the discharge of my profession.  The other occasion was during a meeting    organised -- bringing together the Interahamwe and General Dallaire.  In a nutshell, this is what we dealt with, with Colonel Bagosora. 
Q.	I'd like to ask you about the meeting with General Dallaire.  Approximately when was that, why was that, and who else was present, please?  
A.	As far as I can remember, that meeting took place on the 24th of April 1994.  It was a meeting organised with General Dallaire, who had requested -- or, I would say recommended that the Interahamwe dismantle the roadblocks, allow for free movement of people, and also the meeting reviewed the circumstances surrounding certain people who could not move freely, especially the Tutsis who were held up at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  There were also other issues raised by the Interahamwe concerning the Hutu population who were at the Amahoro stadium in Remera and were being killed there by the RPF.  So the discussions hinged on the circumstances, the lifting of roadblocks, allowing for movement of people and exchange of hostages.  In a nutshell, those were the issues discussed at that meeting between General Dallaire and the Interahamwe.  

Now, you want to know those who were present.  The following were present: from the members of the national provisional committee, number 1, number 5, number 6, number 8, number 9, as well as other Interahamwe officials who were members of the neighbourhood committees in Kigali. 
Q.	Was any decision taken to dismantle the roadblocks?  
A.	There was a deadlock at that level, indeed, because the Interahamwes had imposed a number of conditions, and the decision to dismantle the roadblocks fell through because the Interahamwe were of the opinion that it would be tantamount to exposing themselves to all types of risks definitely linked to the RPF and its infiltrators.  So the only way of putting that to check was to maintain the roadblocks.  I do not even think that in the subsequent meetings there was any decision taken to dismantle the roadblocks. 
Q.	If a decision to dismantle the roadblocks had been taken, would it have been possible for those members of the Interahamwe committee and those representatives from the different Interahamwe groups to have brought about the dismantling of the roadblocks?  Did the Interahamwe people present with General Dallaire have control over whether the roadblocks stayed or went?  
A.	Counsel, if I construed you correctly, I would say that, in any case, the members of the national provisional committee did not have the power to order that the roadblocks be dismantled.  And, as I just told you, the objections raised could not go along those lines insofar as fighting was still on, insofar as the hostilities were still going on in Kigali.  But to answer your question, the members of the national committee could not order the dismantling of the roadblocks, especially because they were not the ones who had ordered that the roadblocks be set up in the first place.  
Q.	Who did have control over whether the roadblocks would be dismantled? 
A.	It is obvious that a government had been set up.  That government gave instructions and guidelines to the general population through communiqués and announcements which were broadcast.  So the conduct of affairs in the country and the responsibility for measures to be taken by the population were within the purview of the government which had been set up, sworn in, and duly introduced to the general population. 
MR. MORLEY:
If I could ask for the assistance of Mr. Lahaie, D. NZ38, please, which is document 23.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you have D. NZ38, which is a series of transcripts of a radio broadcast of the 18th of May of 1994, in front of you?  
A.	Yes, I have the document on which is marked D. NZ38.  
Q.	Now, I'm not going to ask you to read it at this stage because I propose to deal with the document in a particular way.  
MR. MORLEY:
And for Your Honours' assistance, Your Honours may recall that this is a broadcast by Ngirumpatse in respect of the Hôtel des Mille Collines, and I am looking at K-number K0344602, and over the page to K0344603. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And what I propose to do, with Their Honour's leave, Witness, I'm going to read you some sections of what Ngirumpatse is recorded as saying and then I'll ask you some questions.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse is introduced by the minister for education, mister -- I'm sorry, information, Mr. Niyitegeka, and says, "Thank you, Minister."  And goes on, and listen carefully to what it is that I read.  And if I read it incorrectly, no doubt Mr. Robinson will correct me.  He says the following:  

"The MRND party has indeed welcomed the government decision to allow the people who are stranded at the place just mentioned to leave, especially at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  I would like to urge our members, especially the youths, I urge them from this moment to let go of those personalities who are stranded at Hôtel des Mille Collines and elsewhere.  As long as they claim to support the government, they must comply with the government decisions.  The MRND party is represented in the government and any decision by the government is also an MRND decision.  I would like, once again, to ask our members to let those people go the moment they hear this message."  

Now, do you understand what I have said?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I followed you well. 
Q.	We have there Mr. Ngirumpatse appealing to the MRND youths at the roadblocks to let people at the Mille Collines pass on the 18th of May of 1994.  Do you know whether that order was effective?  
A.	The outcome of all the negotiations on this issue, if I remember correctly, was that around the       23rd -- or, 21st of May, there was an exchange facilitated by UNAMIR of people stranded in the various people -- in the various places, that is, the Tutsis in the Hôtel des Mille Collines and the Hutus who were stranded in the Amahoro stadium.  So it was at the end of these negotiations and correspondences that that exchange was able to take place. 
Q.	After Ngirumpatse's broadcast, were the Tutsi at the Hôtel des Mille Collines able to pass through the roadblocks? 
A.	Yes, that exchange was successfully carried out.  So my answer is yes.  
Q.	What was the Petit Kigali? 
A.	Petit Kigali was a restaurant in the Kiyovu neighbourhood prior to the 6th of April.  After the 6th of April, and specifically as from the 14th of April, that premises gradually became a fief of the Interahamwes.  Some meetings took place there, some Tutsis were saved there, and some Interahamwe leaders met UNAMIR representatives and some officers of the Rwandan Armed Forces at that location.  That, in summary, is what that place was.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I've been waiting for a while, and I wanted to make a comment on the previous question, that is, concerning the excerpt of the speech by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I have the French translation before me, and the French booth did not have that French translation, so they did a free translation.  There was an important part of the sentence that was not translated, so I would like that to be placed in context because it is important.  

And the French official translation reads as follows:  "I would like to make a strong appeal that, as from now, as from today, as from after this message, our members, and particularly the youths who are called into question, which is not necessarily true, but I am calling on them now to allow those people stranded in the Hôtel des Mille Collines to leave."  The part of the sentence that was not translated, but which is important, is:  "And it is not necessarily true."  I believe that has to be placed in context as part of this message.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, and, Mr. President, since Mr. Morley said that I would correct him if he read it incorrectly, I noted as I was -- as he was reading it that he skipped those words, and that's why they were not translated.  So he did not read faithfully the excerpt from the document.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
No, I did not read out the entire section.  I simply went to those sentences which may have been of interest in presenting the Prosecution case.  And my learned friends, no doubt, are very welcome to perform an extensive cross-examination if there's any context different from the Prosecution suggestion that that broadcast shows clearly Ngirumpatse exercising control over the Interahamwe.  

If I may continue with the Petit Kigali.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, please, may I ask you this question:  Did you ever go to the Petit Kigali yourself?  
A.	Yes, many times, Counsel. 
Q.	We're going to try to show you a very short excerpt from the video which Their Honours have seen, which was created at the Petit Kigali, and then I will ask you a question.  
MR. MORLEY:
With the assistance of Mr. Tzendze, please, and I hope that we have everything technically ready.  It's from tab 229, second video, at approximately 16 minutes.  

And I'm looking across at the audio-visual booth, which seems alarmingly empty.  Can we push the appropriate switch, please, so that we can have a feed on to the television monitors of a video excerpt?
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	May I enquire whether the witness, Witness T, is able to see a video on his television screen where he is?  
A.	Yes, but the images are not very clear.  
Q.	We're going to play the video and it may be you can identify someone on it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Tzendze, if you might just press play.  

And for Your Honours' assistance, we're dealing with about a minute into the video.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's correct.
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Witness, you can see somebody talking to two people.  He's got papers in his hands.  Are you able to tell us who that is?  
A.	Yes, I can recognise him, Counsel.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) 
Q.	And what have (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley -- 
THE WITNESS:
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) I 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- could you stop for a minute?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Do you want me to stop the video?  Stop the testimony?  
THE WITNESS:
-- normally referred to as an Uzi -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)  
THE WITNESS:
-- and this was part of a consignment (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under separate cover ) had received on the 12th of April. 
MR. MORLEY:
I see the point, Your Honour.  The thought occurs to me that -- Your Honour is entirely right about that.  

May I ask that the reference to be redacted, and I can ask the question a different way?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the reference is redacted.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, can you give us the number of the person who is seen on the video who is carrying a Uzi gun off his right shoulder? 
A.	It is number 9.  
Q.	All right, that's all I wanted to establish.  Perhaps if of the video might now be switched off, we will come back to you.
  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just mention, for Your Honour's assistance, that, notwithstanding Your Honour's very helpful observation, I observed that the television screens were not showing that video.  So that in terms of the public gallery, nobody has been able to see it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, just for clarification, what we think should be redacted is the -- the exhibit is not under seal and the witness's statement is capable of -- could be capable of revealing an identity.  So we are redacting the section of the transcript where the pronouns were used, so that your question with regard to the number then becomes the testimony on the public record. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm grateful.  It does occur to me, whilst I'm on my feet, and my learned friend Mr. Webster has been helpful, it may be that that video ought to be under seal, not simply for reasons relating to this witness's testimony; Your Honour will recall that there was another witness who testified in respect to that video.  And it occurs to me that it may be Your Honours feel it's not a video which should be available to the public, given the testimony we've had, not simply from this witness, but from another one.  It may be, however, that it's a point that can be raised at a later time after a little bit further consideration.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We wondered about that ourselves, but it's not quite obvious as yet to us.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  And if I may say, it's not entirely obvious to me yet.  I'd like a little more time to reflect on it.  It's just a thought that has leapt to mind as a result of other testimony as well. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	All right, Witness, are you back on line, please?  And the video screen is now clear.  
A.	Yes, I am back on line, Counsel. 
MR. MORLEY: 
And may I just ask those assisting us in the audio-visual booth to see whether we can have a picture of the witness.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	At the Petit Kigali, were there Tutsi women who stayed there all the time? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I would like to confirm what I just said.  At that location some Tutsi friends had been saved, some Tutsi acquaintances, women and girls, who stayed there right up until when we could transfer them to other secure locations such as those for which UNAMIR or the Red Cross were responsible.  
Q.	As part of their being saved and looked after at the Petit Kigali, did those engage in some sexual activity with members of the Interahamwe and others?  
A.	Listen, Counsel, that could have happened, and that happened, but I should like to point out that those relationships were consensual, particularly since they were between people who had known each other for a long time.  So it was quite normal.  
Q.	If they -- if they had been thrown out of the Petit Kigali, what do you think might have happened to them on the streets of Kigali?  
A.	The fact is that those people were protected in Petit Kigali so that they should escape the massacres.  So if they were not there at the Petit Kigali, there would have been a high risk of them becoming victims. 
Q.	Did you yourself at any point at the Petit Kigali have sexual relations with any of those women? 
A.	Quite naturally, yes.  As I have just told you, most of those women were long-term friends, so I -- it is no secret and I will not hide it from you that I continued having my sexual activities even during the war.  
Q.	As part of the massacres taking place in Kigali, are you aware whether rape took place? 
A.	Counsel, during the period of three months when the war was raging, there were killings and rapes practically everywhere.  This happens throughout the world whenever there was war.  I cannot tell you that there were rapes at this particular place or that particular place.  Of course, there were rapes, but I cannot tell you exactly where these rapes were perpetrated.  But what I can tell you for sure is that there were no rapes at the Petit Kigali.  There was -- there were no forcible relationships with the ladies that we were protecting.  But there were rapes practically everywhere else in Kigali, both in the parts of the city controlled by the government and those controlled by the RPF.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
I turn to Your Honours.  In relation to the Petit Kigali, the video, my understanding is that that video is not in evidence, and it's my respectful submission, there having been two witnesses who have been able to talk of that being a video which shows the Petit Kigali location, that at this stage the video can go into evidence as Prosecution exhibit -- I think 28.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  I look to Your Honours' ever-helpful staff to make sure I've got the number right.  28?  Mr. Issa nods.  Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. P. 28 admitted) 
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	What was the civil defence movement, please?
A.	The civil defence movement, which was also known as civil self-defence, was set up following a decision of the interim government.  This movement concerned not only the entire population but specifically the youth wings of the various parties and particularly the MRND youth wing Interahamwes, the MDR youth wing, the JDR, the PSD and the PL parties.  That is what I understood. 
Q.	Can you recall approximately when it was the government implemented a civil defence movement, which month?  
A.	I cannot tell you the precise date on which this was institutionalised, but in mid-May I personally attended a civil defence meeting, so that movement at that time had just been created.  So I believe that that meeting of the civil defence took place around the 15th or 16th of May, which means that the decision had been taken some time before.  
Q.	Who was it that you met at the government level, please?  
A.	Well, during a meeting bringing together the youth wings that I've just talked to you about, there was Colonel Gasake, who was a retired officer and who had been appointed to be responsible for civil defence operations in Kigali-ville and Kigali-rural préfectures.  So this is the person who brought us together in that civil defence meeting in Kigali.  
Q.	Were there any members of the Interahamwe national committee at that meeting, and if so, what were their numbers, please?  
A.	It was possible that there were others in the meeting that I attended.  Number 1 was present.  So was number 5, number 6, number 8, and number 9.  I'm referring here to a meeting which I attended.  It is possible that there were others.  
(Pages 1 to 20 by Karen Holm)























1130H 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	By mid-May of 1994, what had been happening to the Tutsi people in Rwanda? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, sir. 
Q.	By mid-May of 1994, what had been happening to the Tutsi in Rwanda? 
A.	But Tutsis had been massacred, as we had seen from the beginning, Counsel.  
Q.	What role had the Interahamwe been playing in the massacre of the Tutsi? 
A.	They played an active role in the massacres, Counsel.  

However, allow me to perhaps underscore that.  Talking about Interahamwe, I'd rather we make a distinction between the Interahamwes MRND assisted by the militia of the other parties, and also referred to in a confusing manner as "Interahamwe."  But that does not detract from the active role played by the Interahamwes MRND.  But the term "Interahamwe," after April 6th, was used actually negatively in reference to Interahamwe of the MRND.  But they were also a part thereof.  

I simply wanted to make this clarification. 
Q.	You -- you told us that the aim of the civil defence movement, when you attended the meeting in mid-May with Colonel Gasake, was to incorporate the Interahamwe and other youth movements into the civil defence programme.  To your mind, what was the effect with regard to the massacres of Tutsi that incorporating these organisations, which had massacred the Tutsi, into a civil defence programme had?  What was the effect, to your mind, of using those organisations as part of the civil defence? 
A.	Actually, it is my opinion that perhaps that decision came late in the day if its aim was to save lives.  But it seemed to me that the decision sort of legalised what had been occurring since the 6th of April, such that certain people said that, since the civil self-defence has been legalised and we had acted by way of self-defence, it was as if they were of the opinion that the massacres, or what had just been going on, had been legalised.  This is a personal opinion, of course. 
Q.	What were the Hutu 10 commandments? 
A.	Counsel, against the backdrop of this print media, which, you know, snowballed in Rwanda after the multiparty system and the freedom of expression, which was really misunderstood by those pseudo newspaper publishers, a newspaper like Kangura, within the framework of ethnic differences, said that a Tutsi woman, who is an enemy woman, should not be married to a Hutu because she would always be a traitor.  And there was a series of obscenities, really illogical obscenities, in the area of marriage.  It was not advisable to get married to a Tutsi lady.  She should not occupy any position.  No Hutu should have maintained relationships with a Tutsi.  

It was a whole series of, you know, things.  I really do not know how to refer to them.  I will not refer to them as commandments, but that is how the editor of that newspaper wanted to refer to them, as such.  But I cannot state that they were the commandments of the Hutu because human relations would prove the contrary.  But against the backdrop of the ethnic hatred, which came in with the multiparty system and which -- pseudo newspapers, there is one newspaper who took it upon itself to dictate those 10 commandments, which I will definitely not refer to as such.  But, in a nutshell, that is what happened. 
Q.	And was the newspaper Kangura? 
A.	Yes, indeed, it was the Kangura newspaper.
MR. MORLEY:
I wonder, with Mr. Lahaie's assistance, do we have the 10 commandments as a document?  If it may be put in front of the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Witness, do you have a document in front of you which lists the 10 commandments as printed in Kangura? 
A.	I have the document in front of me, sir. 
Q.	May I ask, is the document in French or in Kinyarwanda? 
A.	What I see on the cover page is something written in Kinyarwanda and also something written in French. 
Q.	Are the 10 commandments written in French on that document, or are they written in Kinyarwanda? 
A.	I can see a text in French, "Call for the Conscience of the Bahutu."  It is in French.  It is in French. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	It is in French and Kinyarwanda. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you.  

Now, paying attention to what I say, please, I'd like you to look at the French version and just take a moment to read over it and tell me, are those the 10 commandments you remember being printed in Kangura? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	Now, it's a matter of record they were printed first in December of 1990.  What I'd like you to do, please, is take the first one, and can you read that in French to us, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
And then Your Honours will see why I'm treading carefully, and I may have a document for Your Honours. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I was just wondering where is it a matter of record that they were printed in December 1990?  I don't recall any of that testimony in the case. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, my learned friend knows that the -- the magazine exists, and that's where the -- the commandments first appear.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, you know, we have to deal with evidence in this case.  Mr. Morley can't refer to something that's not in evidence in the case and claim it's a matter of record.  So I believe that's improper for him to do that. 
MR. MORLEY:
There's a distinction between a matter of record and a matter of evidence. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I would ask that Mr. Morley's testimony as to when that document was published be stricken from the record.  He's not under oath. 
MR. MORLEY:
Insofar as my learned friend raises a technical point by what he knows to exist as a publication in Rwanda from 1990, then so be it.  But I would have thought that there is no dispute that these commandments were first printed in December 1990.  My learned friend is simply fencing with rules. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I -- as I've stated many times in this trial, we don't stipulate to anything in this trial.  Everything has to be proven, and it's not proven by evidence given by Mr. Morley unless he wants to take the stand and testify.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, this is a criminal trial.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  We'll strike the date, but let's have the commandments.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can you please read out the first one.  
A.	Here are the 10 commandments:  "Number one, every Umuhutu must know that an Umututsi kazi, wherever she is, will be working for the -- for the Tutsi.  Consequently, any Umuhutu who marries an Umututsi kazi, who decides to take an Umututsi kazi as his concubine, secretary, or protege --" 
MR. MORLEY:
Just a moment.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I'm not sure if I had the full translation there.  What is the consequence of taking a Tutsi wife?  What does a Hutu become, according to the first commandment you read out?  I don't think it was fully translated.  
A.	Let me repeat, and I think this time around much slowly (sic):  "Every Umuhutu must know that an Umututsi kazi, wherever she is, will be working for her Tutsi ethnic group.  Consequently, any Umuhutu who takes an Umututsi wife or who takes an Umututsi as his concubine, secretary, or protege would be considered a traitor."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, for the record, there is an official translation of this 10 commandments which the interpreters don't have.  
MR. MORLEY:
No, you don't.  And the reason why I'm doing it this way is for reasons which you don't need to know about at the moment.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Second commandment, please.  Can you read that.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, from the interpreters, we prefer to have the English translation.  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
"Each Umuhutu must know that the Bahutu are more conscientious as women and family heads.  They are more gentle.  They are kinder, better secretaries, and more honest."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Free translation.  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't want to get into a row with the translators, but there is a reason why I am doing it this way.  So if we might just procede. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Third commandment, please, as you read it there in French.  
A.	"Bahutu kazi, you must be vigilant and try to bring your husbands, brothers, and sons back to reason."
Q.	Fourth commandment, please.  
A.	"Tumuhutu (sic) must know that the Tumututsi (sic) are dishonest in business, or what they want to do seeks the survival of their ethnic group.  Accordingly, any Umuhutu who forms a business partnership with a Batutsi, who invests his money or state money in a Tutsi undertaking, who lends to or borrows money from a Tutsi, who grants business favours to Batutsi," and in parentheses, "the grant of operation licenses, bank loans, pieces of land, public contracts," suspension mark and end of parentheses, "will be considered a traitor."  
Q.	Fifth commandment.  
A.	"Strategic, political, administrative, economic, military, and security positions must be assigned to the Bahutu." 
Q.	(Microphone not activated) sixth commandment.  Sixth commandment.  
A.	"The area of education," and then we open the brackets, "students and teachers," we close the brackets, "must comprise a Hutu in the majority." 
Q.	Seventh commandment.  
A.	"The Rwandan armed forces must be exclusively composed of Hutu.  The experience of the war of October 1990 is a great lesson for us.  No soldier should marry and (sic) Umututsi kazi."  
Q.	Eighth commandment, please.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The sound was not clear enough for the interpreters.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, can you repeat the interesting eighth commandment, please.  
A.	"The Bahutu must stop having any pity on the Batutsi." 
Q.	Ninth commandment, please.  
A.	"Wherever they are, the Bahutu must be united and must be concerned with the fate of their Bahutu brethren.  Bahutu who are within and without Rwanda must constantly seek friends and allies in the Hutu cause, starting with your Bantu brethren.  They must constantly counter the Tutsi propaganda.  The Bahutu must be firm and vigilant against their common Tutsi enemy."  
Q.	And, finally, the tenth commandment, please.  
A.	"The 1959 social revolution, the referendum --" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters did not get the year.  
THE WITNESS:
"-- and the Hutu ideals must be taught to all Umuhutu at all levels.  All Umuhutu must widely disseminate this ideology --"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Once again, the interpreters miss out on something.  Accordingly, the interpreters cannot make sense out of the remainder of the sentence.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, the translators couldn't keep up with you.  Can we go back to the tenth commandment?  If you could read that again slowly, please.  
A.	"The 1959 social revolution, the 1961 referendum, and the Hutu ideology must be taught to all Umuhutu and at all levels.  All Umuhutus must widely disseminate this ideology.  Any Umuhutu who shall persecute his Umuhutu brother for having read, disseminated, and taught these ideologies would be considered a traitor." 
MR. MORLEY:
I'd like to thank the translators for a splendid job.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, can I ask you, how widely known were the 10 commandments throughout Rwanda? 
A.	Personally, before the notorious 10 commandments were broadcast, I had never heard any such thing. 
Q.	That doesn't quite answer the question.  You told us they were broadcast.  They were broadcast on what? 
A.	I do not understand you, Counsel, because I do not remember saying that they were broadcast through any channel.  I believe I said that the 10 commandments were disseminated amongst the public, and they were spread amongst various groups of people.  But I did not say that they were actually broadcast, as such. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours will recall what may have been a translation slip. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So how widely known were these 10 commandments which were disseminated?  
MR. MORLEY:
It may be that the question I asked has not gone through to the state. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you, Counsel. 
Q.	About the 10 commandments, how widely known were they in Rwanda by April of 1994? 
A.	Clearly, what happened in April 1994 just simply reflects what was contained in the 10 commandments.  I cannot tell you the contrary.  
Q.	Can you remember when it was the 10 commandments first appeared? 
A.	If I refer to the date of publication of the newspaper, it was in December 1990.  In any case, as far as I can remember, the 10 commandments were published by the Kangura newspaper after the RPF attack of October 1990.  That is what is clear in my mind.  

And, furthermore, I can say that those 10 commandments were denounced by the public opinion to such an extent that the editor of the newspaper was even jailed.  I do not know whether this was because of those particular commandments only, but I know that he was jailed. 

Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	And -- but by the time of April 1994, and what then happened to the Tutsi, to what extent is it your assessment that the 10 commandments had become something that people agreed with? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, but it seems that you understood the contrary of what I said.  I repeat:  This newspaper which published the 10 commandments was condemned by the public opinion to such an extent that, if I remember correctly, the editor in-chief, Mr. Hassan Ngeze, was arrested and imprisoned.  I am not sure whether it was only because of those 10 commandments or because of something else.  But what I am saying is that the 10 commandments raised a lot of controversy in public opinion.  These were things that people could be thinking about privately, but despite the existence of press freedom, it was not appropriate for them to be published.  

Thank you. 
Q.	It may be you did not understand my question.  You have told us that the commandments were published in Kangura in December 1990, and you have told us that they were disapproved of by the authorities.  However, you have also told us that, after April of 1994, there was a massacre of Tutsis.  So my question is, by the time of April 1994, what was your assessment of to what extent the 10 commandments had become a thought shared by many Hutu? 
A.	That is what I told you in my answer when I said that it looked as if, through the massacres of the Tutsis in 1994, it seemed as if the 10 commandments had been followed to the letter. 
Q.	Thank you.  Are you aware of whether or not the 10 commandments were ever broadcast on any radio station? 
A.	I do not believe so.  In any case, I did not hear the 10 commandments broadcast over any radio station.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, I don't know whether the -- I don't know whether this is a translation error, but in one of the answers, he said that "what I said that it looked as if, through the massacres of the Hutus in 1994, it seemed as if the 10 commandments had been followed to the letter."  Is that what he said?  
MR. MORLEY:
I thought he said "Tutsi." 
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, that's what I see on the record, is the "through the massacres of the Hutus in 1994." 
MR. MORLEY:
Maybe I wasn't paying attention.  Your Honour's more eagle-eared than I am, but -- 

You want to just give me a moment? 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, there seems to be a -- a small translation question, which turns everything on its head.  Who was it who was being massacred from April of 1994, apparently in keeping to the letter to the 10 commandments?  Was it the Hutu or the Tutsi? 
A.	Let me repeat once again:  I said that the massacres targeting the Tutsis, in fact, what happened gave the impression that the contents of those top 10 commandments had been followed to the letter. 
Q.	Well, what was the role of the MRND in the massacre of the Tutsis? 
A.	You are talking about the role of the MRND in the massacres of the Tutsis?  I believe that this is reflected by what the members of the party did, the members of the Interahamwe did during those massacres.  I believe that is simply what I can say about that. 
Q.	Who were the people in the MRND most responsible for the Interahamwe during the massacres? 
A.	I will repeat:  The Interahamwes have always been under the moral authority and supervision of the MRND, and this is true also of the militias of the other parties.  

I hope I have answered your question.  
Q.	Could the MRND leadership stop the Interahamwe from committing massacres? 
A.	As an organisation represented in the government, the MRND could have done better than what was requested of the national committee by deploying government forces and deploying other means which were subsequently deployed.  So the MRND, together with the other parties in the government, which, in fact, had assigned itself the mandate of restoring security, they could have put an end to the massacres.  They could have contained those massacres.  That is my point of view. 
Q.	And, finally, this question:  Name the people, please, within the MRND who exercised the moral authority and supervision of the Interahamwe during the massacres.  Their names, please.  
A.	I will begin with the late President Habyarimana; Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse and his two assistants, the first and second vice-presidents; Mr. Ferdinand Kabagema; Mr. Édouard Karemera; and 
	Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, who were part of the steering committee and have de facto and de jure a supervision over Interahamwe activities.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour may be pleased to hear that that completes my direct examination.  And within the kitty, I think I've taken one hour short of two days, and I promised two days.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. Morley.  

Mr. Witness, you have completed the first part of your testimony, as the Prosecutor has finished examining you.  But you are going to have to answer some other questions from the lawyers who are representing the accused persons in this trial.  And the first person who will be examining you in that capacity is Mr. Robinson, who represents Mr. Nzirorera.  

Mr. Robinson, are you ready?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, every time you ask me that question, of course, I have to say no because of the outstanding disclosure that we haven't received.  But given that you've ruled that I am ordered to commence my examination notwithstanding the lack of disclosure, then I'm ready. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry for putting it that way.  It wasn't intended as a provocation. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm not provoked.  But I did -- for the record, did not want to say that I was ready and have it argued on appeal that I've waived my rights to these issues.  

So with that out of the way, I would like to greet Witness T. 


CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon from Arusha.  I think you know who I am.  

Witness T, can you -- 
A.	(Microphones overlapping) yes, I know who you are, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness T, I want to, first of all, thank you for your testimony that you've given over the past few days.  I think that this has probably been the most accurate testimony that we've heard during this trial.  And while we have some differences of recollection and perhaps some differences of opinion, we find your testimony to be very truthful, and I want to thank you for that.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  And I should say that I'm very flattered.  
Q.	I also want to tell you that our Defence team has undertaken an investigation in Rwanda of allegations made against you, people who say you were in Butare and Gitarama killing people, and we found those allegations to be completely untrue.  And, in fact, some people who we've spoken to who made those allegations have recanted them, and I wanted you to know that before I start my questioning of you.  

Now, my first question to you, we'll get right at it, prior to the assassination of President Habyarimana, was there a plan to commit genocide in Rwanda? 
A.	Could you kindly repeat, Counsel?  I did not hear you very well because the sound quality was not very good.  
Q.	Prior to the assassination of President Habyarimana, was there a plan to commit genocide in Rwanda? 
A.	Let me answer you directly, Counsel:  If such a plan existed, then I was not aware of it. 
Q.	When the MRND formed their youth wing, the Interahamwe, was it for the intention of exterminating Tutsis? 
A.	The youth wing Interahamwes MRND, which I joined, had as its objective to make its contribution by mooting ideas that could correct the mistakes made by the MRND party.  Its aim was to bring new blood into a party which had been a single party before and which was now within the context of a multiparty system.  

That is my answer. 
Q.	And when the Interahamwe was formed, was there any intention that this organisation be used to exterminate Tutsis? 
A.	My answer is a categoric no. 
Q.	And when the Interahamwe recruited members, youth from all préfectures and all segments of society, was that recruitment done with the intention to form an army who would exterminate the Tutsis? 
A.	Absolutely no, because, when you look at developments based on the context in Rwanda and the distortions that happened after the events, you will see that this was neither the intention of the Interahamwes MRND nor that of the other youth wings that joined them.  And it was not also the intention of the Rwandan people in general.  That is why I made a point of describing the context within this -- within which this youth wing deviated from its objectives and how, because of the war, the youth wing transformed itself into a militia as we know it. 
Q.	And when the Interahamwe were given military training, was that with the intention that it would exterminate Tutsis? 
A.	Absolutely no.  This was a self-defence group set up within the context of the RPF activities and the activities of all those who supported the RPF.  And this was perceived as people attacking the Rwandan population.  
Q.	And when firearms were distributed to the Interahamwe, was that done with the intention that they would exterminate the Tutsis? 
A.	The intention was not to exterminate the Tutsis, as such, because if this had been the case, then I would have told you that there was a plan, which I dispute to date.  
Q.	And in all of the rallies that you attended in which Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Karemera, and Mr. Nzirorera spoke, did you ever hear any of them call for the extermination of the Tutsi, either directly or indirectly? 
A.	No, absolutely not in their speeches, when it comes to the extermination of Tutsis. 
Q.	And, in fact, the MRND was a party which included Tutsis, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, I want to take you back to the beginning of my chronology and ask you, who was the president of the MRND when the Interahamwe was formed? 
A.	I didn't catch it -- the whole question, Counsel. 
Q.	Who was the president -- who was the president of the MRND when the Interahamwe was formed? 
A.	Mr. Juvénal Habyarimana was the president of the MRND party when the Interahamwe was formed. 
Q.	And you've had occasion to personally meet with President Habyarimana over the course of the years 1990 through 1994; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And did you also hear his speeches and addresses to the nation during that period? 
A.	Yes, and also because I had always been a member of President Habyarimana's party.  So I listened to his speeches to the nation several times, and specifically those concerning the war. 
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber, what was President Habyarimana's attitude towards the Tutsi and towards ethnic groups living in peace together? 
A.	Peaceful coexistence between the Hutus and the Tutsis during the historic period of Habyarimana's regime is deemed by many people, beginning with the Tutsis, as having been a regime that protected and advanced the cause of the Tutsis, as well as having advocated the objectives of peace and national unity.  

And when you talk about national unity, I should point out that it refers to the peaceful coexistence of the three components of the Rwandan population, that is, the Hutus, the Tutsis, and the Twas. 
Q.	And did that attitude by President Habyarimana continue throughout his life? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid there is a bit of a situation that we have to address now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're going to need a short break, and we will resume in a few minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1234H to 1238H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid that there were some developments of which I had not been previously aware which required us to adjourn at approximately 12:30.  I don't know if you could come to a convenient time.  What we will do, take an adjournment as soon as we can and resume at 2:30. 
MR. ROBINSON:
We can stop right now.  It's no problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, can you hear me? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  There were situations which required that we took an early adjournment today at 12:30, and I had not previously been aware of them.  We are going to take our adjournment now and resume at 2:30 this afternoon.  I remind you, as I've done on each occasion before, that you're not to discuss your testimony or the case during this or any other adjournment.  

We adjourn now and resume at 2:30.  
(Court recessed from 1238H to 1441H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

As we were about to indicate -- so I saw a lot of concerned expressions on the faces -- there was really a staff meeting at the Tribunal which the court office staff had to attend, and I did not know about it in advance.  And that was the reason for the early adjournment.  

Mr. Robinson, you can continue.  Do we have a link now?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think so.  We were just chatting with our colleagues a few minutes ago. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And I've asked the registry to distribute my exhibits in -- here in Arusha, so that's now being done.  And Mr. Hometowu should know that it's now okay for him to release my exhibits to the representative of the Prosecution in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), if he's inclined to do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the name of the place is stricken from the record. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Okay.  Sorry about that.

Mr. President, while the exhibits are being distributed, is it okay if I go ahead and start my examination? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would think so. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness T, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	When we broke, I had asked you to describe the attitude of President Habyarimana towards the Tutsis and ethnic harmony in Rwanda, and you had answered that question.  And my next question is whether that attitude continued -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could counsel repeat because there's too much background noise; the interpreters in the French booth could not hear.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, no problem.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I'm going to repeat the question:  In the morning, when we broke, I had asked you to describe the attitude of President Habyarimana towards the Tutsis and ethnic harmony in Rwanda, and you had answered that question.  And my next question to you is whether or not that attitude continued all the way up to the time of his death on 6th April 1994.  
A.	That attitude continued.  And, given the prospect of war, he actually appealed for reconciliation, that is, in the face of the danger represented by the war.  
Q.	And did President Habyarimana make many concessions during the period 1990 to 1994 to achieve peace in Rwanda? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, the decisions concerning the Interahamwe, such as to expand them to the préfectures, to provide military training, and to distribute weapons, could any of those decisions have been made without the approval of the head of state, President Habyarimana? 
A.	I do not believe that such a decision could have been taken without the approval of President Habyarimana. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can the witness repeat the last part of his answer?  There was a burble there. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you please repeat the last part of your answer, as it didn't come through clearly here in Arusha. 
A.	I was saying that it seems to me that such a decision could not have been taken without the approval of President Habyarimana, especially since he was also the president of the MRND party up to a certain time and fully supported the Interahamwes MRND. 
Q.	Do you believe that, if President Habyarimana had not been assassinated on the 6th of April 1994, the massacres would never have occurred? 
A.	Personally, I believe no, and I would say at least not at -- at that scope.  
Q.	And would you agree that those persons responsible for the assassination of President Habyarimana bear a great deal of responsibility for the events that followed? 
A.	From my point of view, they have a great share of responsibility in all the tragic events that happened after his assassination. 
Q.	And, to your knowledge, was anyone from the Interahamwe or the MRND involved in the assassination of President Habyarimana? 
A.	It would be at least nonsense.  It would be pointless to assassinate someone who is in your camp.  So I believe that President Habyarimana was assassinated by his enemies and not by his friends, who were the Interahamwes and the members of the MRND.  
Q.	Now, turning to the Hutu 10 commandments, were any of them ever the policy of the Rwandan government under President Habyarimana? 
A.	No -- no.  The publication of those commandments was the initiative of the editor of a newspaper.  And, as I have said before, the newspaper publisher was arrested and jailed, if my memory serves me correctly. 
Q.	Now, you can find racist literature published in any free country in the Western world.  You can find anti-Semitic literature published in any free country in the world.  Was the publication of the 10 commandments more a reflection of democracy in Rwanda than genocide? 
A.	I did not quite understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	I mean that, simply because somebody in a country publishes some racist literature, is that more evidence that there is democracy in that country than there is a plan by the government for genocide? 
A.	And that means -- or, it proves that at least there is freedom of expression.  
Q.	And in Rwanda, from 1990 through 1994, were there many, many publications that severely criticised President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes.  As from the time that the press laws were liberalised, there were criticisms against Habyarimana and criticisms against the regime.  And I believe that this liberalisation took place shortly before the attack of the RPF on the first of October, and it increased in the years that followed. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us what the word "Interahamwe" means? 
A.	In a way, "Interahamwe" is a compound word.  "Hamwe" means "with" or "together."  "Interahamwe" means people who together pursue the same objective.  That is how I can translate that word "Interahamwe."  

And this word can apply to various circumstances, but it means that people are gathered together to pursue the same objective, people who are together and who have the same aim.  
Q.	And before the Interahamwes MRND was created, was the word "Interahamwe" associated with a choir? 
A.	Yes.  During the first republic, there was a choir known as Interahamwe Abanyuramatwi, I believe.  And this terminology can be found in expressions in the Kinyarwanda language, so it was a word that was used before it was adopted by the youth -- youth wing known as Interahamwes MRND.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we get some spelling assistance?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I -- first of all, do we still have video from (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)?  I noticed that the -- okay.  We do.  I noticed that we didn't show the witness when he was answering. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I am not sure of the word we're looking to be spelled -- 
A.	Yes, I am online, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to redact the name of the place where the video's coming from.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think my client has given me a spelling of a word that was used, and I'm going to spell it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness T, you can tell me if this is correct:  A-B-A-N-Y-U-R-A-M-A-T-W-I.  
A.	Yes, it has been correctly spelled, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.
Now, Witness T, did the word "Interahamwe" mean a group of people who attacked together? 
A.	No, not at all.  This is a distorted interpretation because, if you look at this word as a caricature, you can interpret it that way, but that was not really what the title meant for that youth wing.  

And to better answer your question, let me point out that the youth wing of the MDR, or even of the RPF, could have been named Interahamwes MRND, or even Interahamwes RPF.  So this way of interpreting things was deliberately distorted so as to tarnish the image of the youth wing, and specifically the MRND youth wing. 
Q.	Now, on the insignia, or the emblem, of the MRND party, were there pictures of certain implements? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And what were those implements and what did they mean? 
A.	I believe that there was a hoe, a sort of bow and arrows, and others.  In any case, this was a representation of insignia that had always featured in the coat of arms of the Rwandan republic ever since its beginning.  And so parts of that insignia was used to represent the MRND youth wing, the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And did that have anything to do with any intention to use those implements to attack people? 
A.	Just like before, when this insignia had not been used to attack anyone.  I would say, in fact, it is a symbol of working implements.  It is also a symbol of national defence.  So this was a sort of continuity that did not have any malicious intentions, contrary to the oversimplification that was later made and which, curiously, had not been subject to such criticisms during the first republic and during the single-party regime.  So my answer is no, there was no malicious intent.  
Q.	Is it true that in Rwanda, as -- even as early as 1990 or way before that, that every family had a machete? 
A.	It is so true that, even today, and it has been 12 years since I left Rwanda, those implements are traditional implements in all Rwandan families. 
Q.	Did every Tutsi also have a machete? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  This is a socioeconomic implement that is owned by people, irrespective of ethnicity, irrespective of their social status.  It's like when you have an American or European farmer who owns a sickle, and that is absolutely normal.  And these implements were available to Hutus, Tutsis, and Twas alike. 
Q.	And if someone wanted to arm the population to exterminate Tutsis, was it necessary to import machetes, or did every Rwandan family already have one? 
A.	Machetes had always been imported, and they had always been used for community labour in Rwanda.  So I do not believe so, so my answer to your question is no. 
Q.	And do you know of any discussion among the Interahamwe or the MRND in which it was decided to import machetes between 1990 and 1994 in Rwanda? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	And did the -- did the Interahamwe distribute machetes to anyone? 
A.	Not to my knowledge. 
Q.	Now, turning to the national committee of the Interahamwe, were these officers named before or after the meeting with President Habyarimana? 
A.	The committee, composed of the first five names, had been designated prior to the meeting with President Habyarimana.  The advisers were designated shortly afterwards.  And so, amongst the members, there was a distinction between the national committee and the -- the -- later the broader committees.  So there were five members of the committee before the meeting with the president, and after that meeting, that number increased to 11.  
Q.	And were these people elected or appointed for a fixed term, or were they to hold office provisionally until elections could be organised? 
A.	As the movement evolved, elections were supposed to be held at the national level so that representatives from throughout the national territory would have the possibility of representing the MRND youth wing.  And in anticipation of that, I believe that a statute had been drafted by some members of the national committee at the behest of some leaders of the party.  That draft was never adopted because of developments inside the country.  But that was the final purpose of that initiative. 
Q.	And is that why you have referred to this committee as the provisional national committee, because its members were to serve until such time as elections could be organised? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, we see on Exhibit P. 9 that, next to the names 6 through 11, there is a commission associated with each of those persons.  Can you tell us what that was intended for and, in practice, what that actually meant? 
A.	This organ was based on the structures of the MRND party itself.  The people who chaired the various committees, that is, in the Interahamwe movement, worked hand in hand with the committee of 
	five members.  That is the other six people who were chairing the commissions.  

But I have to point out that those commissions were never really operational, as such.  But it was planned that that was what would happen after elections at the national level with the representatives of youths from all over the country.  These titles were adopted, but the commissions were never operational. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  That was very clear. 

Now, during the period from the time the Interahamwe committee was formed, while the MRND maintained its offices at the building of the Vedaste Rubangura -- that's R-U-B-A-N-G-U-R-A -- did you, yourself, attend the Wednesday evening meetings on a regular basis? 
A.	Depending on my availability and time constraints, I can say yes, I attended the Wednesday afternoon meetings quite regularly. 
Q.	Now, do you know a person by the name of Ahmed Mbonyunkiza? 
A.	Can you kindly repeat, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes.  First name Ahmed, A-H-M-E-D, and second name Mbonyunkiza, M-B-O-N-U-N-K-I-Z-A (sic).  
A.	No, that name doesn't ring a bell at all.  I do not know that person, either inside the committee or out of it. 
Q.	That individual has been a witness at this trial, and I'm going to ask you about some things he has testified to and see if you can tell me if that's correct or not.  

Mr. Mbonyunkiza has testified that in February of 1992 he attended three of the regular Wednesday meetings held at the Rubangura building.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm -- I'm on my feet, although there's an ice cream van in the background.  

I think the ice cream van has left the -- the building in the foreign state. 

I'm objecting to the manner in which the witness is being questioned.  My concern is that it's not for the witness to comment on the truthfulness of another witness's testimony.  That's a matter for Your Honours' consideration.  It is available to my learned friend to ask questions containing the suggestions made by a previous witness to see whether this witness agrees with him, but what I would respectfully submit he cannot do is say, "Here is previous testimony," effectively, "is it true or false?"  And that is what we are engaged in at the moment.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There's too much noise in The Hague (sic), Mr. President, far too much.  It's very difficult for the interpreters to follow.  Maybe they could organise a microphone that switches on and off for the next interview.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were your comments transmitted to The Hague (sic)?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I -- I hope they can hear us, because we can surely hear them, the slightest noise.  

The French booth is confident they did manage to get the gist of Mr. Morley's submission. 
MR. MORLEY:
So Your Honour has the ball. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Mr. -- Mr. President, I can rephrase the question.  I -- I was concerned that the witness would be very puzzled by my next series of questions.  I wanted to give him some frame of reference, but I think I have done that, so I can go on and ask the questions a different way.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, in February of 1992, at the regular Wednesday meetings of the Interahamwe, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse ever say that the Tutsis needed to be pursued and killed? 
A.	Well, I can say categorically that I never heard that sort of speech -- that sort of talk from Mr. Ngirumpatse, and I don't think he could have said anything like that in February 1992.  
Q.	And was there ever an occasion in February 1992 at an Interahamwe meeting where a businessman named Gaspard Ukwizagira -- that's spelled U-K-W-I-Z-A-G-I-R-A -- displayed axes for the Interahamwe to purchase and distribute for the purpose of exterminating the Tutsi? 
A.	Forgive me, but not only do I not know that person, I must again say, but also I think it is fabulation.  To act thus in public meetings would be to -- to fantasise. 
Q.	And at any meetings of the Interahamwe in February 1992, did Simon Bikindi and an individual known as Sukari introduce a song that they had composed about exterminating the Tutsis? 

And "Sukari" is S-U-K-A-R-I.  
A.	We never saw Simon Bikindi, whom I know well, in any Wednesday meeting.  As to Sukari, whom I also know, who was a singer and a famous animator, political cheerleader, he regularly came to our meetings.  But I never saw anything such as you have described.  He was part of the political cheerleading groups when the MRND would go around, but never in any of our meetings or in any of the political cheerleading in the préfectures.  I never -- and also I should add that in 1992 that sort of discourse was never heard. 
Q.	And in February of 1992, was it necessary to undergo military training before one could join the Interahamwe? 
A.	No, Counsel, not in 1992. 
Q.	In February of 1992, did a person by the name of Augustin Ngirabatware -- that's N-G-I-R-A-B-A-T-W-A-R-E -- become the honourary president of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Was that Augustin Ngirabatware, whom I know, who was at that time minister of planning?  Is that your -- if that's the person you're talking about, I do not think that he was elected or appointed honourary president of the Interahamwe in February 1992. 
Q.	And that is the person that I'm talking about.  And was he ever appointed honourary president of the Interahamwe at any time? 
A.	Not to my knowledge, Counsel. 
Q.	And, finally, did the Interahamwe have a plot to kill Ahmed Mbonyunkiza, as far as you ever heard? 
A.	Well, I told you before that I don't know that person.  I know nothing about that person. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm not going to take your time with this now, but on Monday morning you're going to have a written motion from me to investigate Ahmed Mbonyunkiza for perjury, based on not only this witness but at least two other witnesses that you've heard.  But I won't take up your time with that now. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness T.  We're going to now turn to the period early 1992, and I'm going to ask you whether or not in January of 1992 there was a demonstration against the government of Prime Minister Sylvestre Nsanzimana.  That's spelled N-S-A-N-Z-I-M-A-N-A.  
A.	In January 1992 there were two demonstrations against the Nsanzimana government, on the 8th and 15th of January.  They were demonstrations -- unauthorised demonstrations -- demonstration (sic) never seen before by the Rwandan people, demonstrations that destroyed everything where they passed, and especially everything that belonged to MRND supporters.

One of the examples of demonstrations that gave rise to counter-demonstrations, as occurred.  

I don't know if I've answered you. 
Q.	Yes, you've answered me well.  Can you tell us who it was who was doing this demonstrating and why.  
A.	Those demonstrations were organised by the MDR, PL, and PSD parties to show that they did not agree with the government that Habyarimana had just instituted at the end of December 1991, which they had refused to join, considering that a coalition government was necessary, that was led by a prime minister from one of the -- those three opposition parties.  At least that's what was their official purpose.  
Q.	And did this demonstration result in what Mr. Morley described as "villes mortes"? 
A.	Precisely.  And that is why it was something that the Rwandan people had never seen before.  They destroyed everything that they passed.  People were attacked.  Vehicles were burned.  Public transport buses were attacked.  Health centres were attacked.  It was something without precedent in Rwandan society, and all that was to oblige President Habyarimana to meet their demands to have a prime minister from one of those three parties. 
Q.	Now, also in early 1992, was there a meeting in Gikongoro in which Justin Mugenzi spoke about the Interahamwe? 
A.	It must have been in May 1992.  I remember it as though it was yesterday because it's something (sic) astonished me personally, to hear the leader of a party declare that henceforth his party and his allies and its allies should suspend their party's programme so as to enter into combat with the Interahamwe.  That is practically word for word what I heard.  And all that added to the conflagration between the youth wings of the parties. 
Q.	Now, turning your attention to the events in Bugesera in March of 1992, to your knowledge, were the Interahamwe involved in those massacres? 
A.	My personal belief, conviction, is categorically no, because they had -- Interahamwe had only been developing over the previous fine (sic) months in Kigali, and I don't see how they could have played any role.  But as the opposition parties had decided to discredit, as far as possible, the MRND that was now getting its second wind, contrary to all expectations, any discredit that could, would be put on the -- on Interahamwe.  Investigations were undertaken, and they concluded that on the contrary.

1530H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now Mr. Morley has pointed out that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the minister of justice during the period, did it make any difference who was the minister of justice if, in fact, the Interahamwe were not involved in the massacres in Bugesera? 
A.	Could you repeat the question please, Counsel, I did not understand. 
Q.	Actually it wasn't a very good question.  The implication is because Mr. Ngirumpatse was the minister of justice that somehow the investigation was white washed and the Interahamwe who were responsible for the massacres in Bugesera were in fact cleared because of Mr. Ngirumpatse; is that true? 
A.	I would not like to give a subject to -- or, to answer.   What I can tell you is that judicials -- the judiciary undertook investigations that found that there was no case for the Interahamwe to answer.  So it isn't because the minister of one party or another -- it isn't because the minister is from one party or another that the judiciary should adjust its investigation.  So I don't want to give a subjective or tendencious answer because I may also be accused then of giving an answer, such-and-such an answer because I belong to such-and-such a party.  I refuse to play that game. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  Point well taken.  Now, a so-called expert by the name of                   Alison Des Forges, and I'm quoting from page 13 of her report in this case, "that beginning with the March 1992 attacks in Bugesera, Interahamwe militia began to play an important role in the violence, the skills they had developed for attacks on political opponents were now put in the service of attacking victims chosen on basis of ethnicity."  
MR. MORLEY:
Before my learned friend goes any further, what intrigues me about this line of questioning is he is trying to turn a factual witness into an expert, and it may be that it is not an appropriate line of questioning.  Because what my learned friend is trying to do is to get the witness to flatly contradict the expert, or to use Mr. Robinson's expression, the so-called expert.  And I respectfully submit that that is inappropriate.  He, the witness, has already said that he does not believe the Interahamwe were involved in Bugesera.  And it would follow, therefore, that this line of questioning is otiose in the factual context of what the witness has given evidence on.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, the question goes beyond Bugesera.  And this witness has personal knowledge of the role the Interahamwe played.  And the -- he can tell us whether or not this statement accurately reflects the reality and I believe that that is proper for him to do so.  And the fact that the statement happens to be made by an expert, or so-called expert, for the Prosecution it is simply for your benefit to understand the context in which this testimony is offered so you can later evaluate the testimony that you might hear from other witnesses. 
MR. MORLEY:
It may be a question of form, but there is an important point behind it because it comes back to an earlier observation with which Your Honours and, indeed, Mr. Robinson agreed; namely, it is not for the witness to tell Your Honours what testimony to accept and not accept.  And what my learned friend,   Mr. Robinson, is doing is he is getting the witness to tell Your Honours whether to accept the testimony of another witness, in this case Alison Des Forges.  What my learned friend can certainly do is he can put the suggestion the Interahamwe were not involved in Bugesera, they were not involved in killing subsequently, so that the stage is set for the later comment, which no doubt he will make, when dealing with Alison Des Forges who is an expert and to whom various sections of previous witness testimony can be put.  He can put those tranches of factual witness testimony and invite her comment, and then Your Honours are reminded of how the factual witnesses are contradicting the expert.  But it is the wrong way around to get a factual expert to contradict an -- a factual witness to contradict an expert.  

I am just listening to the sirens in the background.  It may be that the ice cream van has committed an offence.  I am just waiting for that to stop.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Anyhow Your Honours have the point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I thought you had accepted the point the last time it was made. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  There is a distinction and that being that this is -- I'm not quoting testimony; I'm quoting from some material that is out of court.  And so I'm not asking the witness to comment on testimony of a witness, but I'm asking him to comment on factual material put forth by another person. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it is still roughly the same point.  As Mr. Morley said, it is not a point of substance, but a point of form.  But to ask the witness to say whether somebody else is correct or not is really usurping our role. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I can rephrase the question then Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, would it be correct to say that the Interahamwe began attacking victims chosen on the basis of ethnicity after the attacks in Bugesera? 
A.	No.  I have told you I personally have no involvement of the Interahamwe.  The investigation concluded to the contrary in a letter on that subject sent to the -- Mr. Twagiramungu, or as representing a reflection group of those opposition parties.  The Interahamwe invited them to a debate on the radio, on the people ascribing responsibility and involvement of the Interahamwe in the Bugesera killings and they turned it down.  The result is very clear.  So my answer is in the negative. 
Q.	And I want to turn to that letter that was sent to Faustin Twagiramungu on the 25th of March 1992.  You have seen it before, it is D. NZ5.  I don't need to have it shown to you, but I want to simply ask you:  After Mr. Twagiramungu had accused the Interahamwe of being behind the events in Bugesera, the members of the committee reacted by sending this letter.  Are the contents of this letter true? 
A.	Yes, that is the truthful tenure thereof. 
Q.	Now, turning to the month of April 1992, it is true, is it not, that prime -- a man name                     Dismas Nsengiyareyme became the prime minister?  And that is NC -- excuse me, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-Y-M-E? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Mr. Nsengiyareyme became prime minister in April, perhaps the 16th of April, representing a coalition of five parties; MDR, PL, PSD, the PDC and the MRND.  The first multiparty government that succeeded to the Nsenzimana, Sylvester, government. 
Q.	What party was this prime minister representing? 
A.	Mr. Dismas Nsengiyareyme was one of the leaders of the MDR. 
Q.	And once he became prime minister, did he advocate a policy of Kubohoza? 
A.	Mr. Nsengiyareyme is the initiator and defender of the Kubohoza policy.  That is well known. 
Q.	And what was the result on the ground of this Kubohoza policy?  What happened to people? 
A.	That Kubohoza policy threw oil on the fire, aggravated the internal violence between parties, violence that led to expropriation, even to loss of life.  And I would add, since it comes to mind, it also laid the foundation for regionalism between the members of various parties because in one préfecture or another, where one or the other of the parties was strongest, they wouldn't tolerate the Kubohoza and they wouldn't let a member of another party or, especially, an MRND party member --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mister --
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a problem with the audio, Witness, stop please.  Could the witness stop, please?

Yes, Mr. Witness, your last answer has not been heard properly at this end at all.  And I'm wondering if it would be possible for you to repeat it.  In fact, I am asking you to repeat it.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the technicians in charge of the video link hear me because this link is very poor?  And, please, get a microphone that you can switch off when the witness is talking -- or, witness is not talking.
THE WITNESS:
In addition to my first answer, I should like to add that that Kubohoza policy laid the basis for a resurgence of regional dissension and regionalisms, because the policy did not tolerate, more particularly, cohabitation in certain MDR strongholds, or the forces -- among the democratic forces for change did not tolerate cohabitation and MRND party member.  They actually wanted to liberate that party member, that is, within the meaning of the word Kubohoza.  So, all Kubohoza is based on the regionist connotation, and it only led to aggravation of violence which characterised that year 1992. 
Q.	Thank you, we heard you well.  Did Kubohoza mean that a person who had joined the MRND was required to leave the party and join an opposition party by force or threats of force?
A.	Yes, it was all a bust.  Either the person accepted, or he was expropriated and had to go elsewhere.  And we saw many people leaving their property, most of them going to Kigali. 
Q.	And was it also a part of the Kubohoza tactic to take an MRND office holder, who had been duly appointed or elected to his position, and forcibly replace that office holder with a member of the opposition party?
A.	That is correction, Counsel. 
Q.	Now did the MRND or Interahamwe employ Kubohoza tactics? 
A.	Well, yes, they were very vigorous, spontaneous reactions, it was a tit-for-tat response.  And it became a cycle of violence, not only between the youth wings but also between members, party members among the population in general.  Maybe it was in response to the -- or the RPF's discourse who, in attacking the country, was only aiming at the MRND.  It would seem that that operation was consecrated by an operation to destabilise the Interahamwe, and I did not see any documents attesting to that approach, but the truth of the matter is that those three parties were advancing the RPF's purposes in attacking Rwanda on the 1st of October. 
Q.	And when the MRND used Kubohoza tactis in 1992, or the Interahamwe used those tactics, were they used against an ethnic group or was it Hutu against Hutu in the opposition?
A.	There was no ethnic dimension to that, it was a partisan dimension from what I saw, from what I observed.  And that Kubohoza generated, or led to resurgence, unearthed the regional dissension, because the RPF, for example, its head stronghold was in Gitarama and surrounding areas.  And they would not tolerate any MRND member, because MRND was known as Habyarimana's party and was a party essentially from the north of the country.  So, rather than the ethnic connotation, it was a regionist one.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't know if the witness said RPF or MDR, excuse me, regarding Gitarama. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, can you clarify something that didn't come through correctly, or come through at all on the translation.  And that is, when you spoke of Gitarama, were you speaking of the stronghold of the MDR or the RPF? 
A.	I was speaking of the bastion of the fiefdom [] practically exclusively, or who wanted to be exclusively MDR.  Not the RPF, the MDR. 
Q.	And historically was Gitarama préfecture the home of the MDR PARMEHUTU party, which ruled during the first republic? 
A.	Yes, that is a historical fact, because the MDR PARMEHUTU was the party founded by the first president of Rwanda, Grégoire Kayibanda, because he was from Gitarama.  So historically the Gitarama region was the fiefdom, the stronghold of the MDR which had been banned when Habyarimana came to power and the second republic was founded.  President Habyarimana prohibited the previous political parties and they were replaced by the single -- the new party that had come on the scene, the single party, the MRND. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And Kayibanda is K-A-Y-I-B-A-N-D-A. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, speaking of Gitarama, did you know a person by the name of Claver Kamana; C-L-A-V-E-R, K-A-M-A-N-A?  

Witness you look like maybe you didn't hear my question.  I will ask it again.  Did you know a person from Gitarama named Claver Kamana, K-A-M-A-N-A? 
A.	I know him very well, I know Kamana -- Claver Kamana very well.  He was, moreover, a member of Gitarama political bureau who was a victim of that Kubohoza policy, Nsengiyareyme's Kubohoza policy.  He had to leave his area, which was in Gitarama préfecture, and he had to move to Kigali and abandon some of his activities as an entrepreneur, because he refused, he resisted -- he refused Nsengiyareyme's advances, which were -- practically became a personal issue. 
Q.	And did the Interahamwe come to his assistance? 
A.	Yes, the Interahamwe, in strength, came to his rescue in order to reinstate him and his rights, and that led to engendered violence between youth wings, MDR and its allies, and the Interahamwe, who came to give lessons to -- very muscular lessons to the youth wings that were against -- who showed they were against Mr. Claver Kamana. 
Q.	And what was the ethnicity of Claver Kamana? 
A.	Counsel, that was a very controversial question.  Some would say that he was Tutsi; others would say that he was Hutu.  He, himself, says he is Hutu.  That is all I can tell you on that point.  But personally I'm convinced that Kamana is Hutu, if we take the patriarchal definition of that sociological term.  If the father is Hutu, the child is Hutu, according to Rwandan tradition.  And that person himself stated what his ethnicity was; he knows what his own ethnicity should be.  He is a refugee since 1994, as many Hutu are, and some Tutsi, but I don't know any more about that. 
Q.	And did it matter to the Interahamwe what ethnicity he was if he was a member of MRND who was under attack? 
A.	If a member of the MRND who was attacked, especially if he was a Tutsi, would be strongly defended by the Interahamwes.  You could even attack a Hutu member of the MRND, but not a Tutsi member, especially someone the status of Mr. Kamana who had served the MRND very well, in difficult conditions, in Gitarama préfecture. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take a break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our mid-afternoon recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1602H to 1623H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is the link activated?  

Mr. Robinson, you may continue.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, before I continue my questioning, I want to try to resolve an administrative matter because we will probably get late into the day and no one will want to stay around any longer, so if we can take care of that now.  And that is:  I would like to request that the witness be given my exhibits and, if he is willing, to read them over the weekend so that when we start going through them we can do so more rapidly.  So if you may -- either you enquire if the witness is willing to do that, or could you order that the witness be provided with those exhibits. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I got the impression that the witness had agreed to accept them yesterday afternoon. 

Mr. Hometowu, could you give us any information on this? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, the witness has no objection.  The documents are here with us and, if you so direct, we can give him the documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The direction is made now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you, Witness T.  I know it is tiring to be questioned five days a week and then have homework over the weekend but to the extent you can review that material over the weekend, I would appreciate it and it will make our work easier next week.
Witness T, I now want to ask you about the MRND congress in April of 1992.  And it is true, is it not, that at that congress Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who had previously been the president at the MRND at the level of the Kigali-ville préfecture, was elected national secretary of the MRND; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And in his capacity as the president of the MRND in Kigali préfecture he had been the person who had been the MRND representative encouraging the formation and establishment of the Interahamwe; correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, we know that at the congress of April 1992, a resolution was passed encouraging the Interahamwe to be expanded to the other préfectures besides Kigali-ville.  And I wonder if you can tell me, whether or not, prior to this congress any efforts had been made to do that? 
A.	Yes.  In any case, that decision or recommendation formulated during that congress had, in fact, been reflected upon prior to that congress.  As a result of that, a delegation of at least three people was sent to Gisenyi and they launched the activities of Interahamwe's MRND in Gisenyi préfecture.  And this was, in fact, the only occasion in which such -- in which that movement was officially launched by the delegation from Kigali.  So this was a couple of months before that congress. 
Q.	And when the Interahamwe went to Gisenyi to launch the Interahamwe there, was any member of the MRND executive committee present? 
A.	No, not to my knowledge.  The meeting to launch the Interahamwe actually took place in the MRND headquarters building in Gisenyi, but there was no one from the executive committee of the party present there. 
Q.	Who were the people from Gisenyi who attended that meeting? 
A.	Are you referring to those who were from Gisenyi or those who actually went to launch the movement in Gisenyi?  
Q.	I'm actually referring to the people who were living in Gisenyi at the time who received the members of the national committee for Interahamwe? 
A.	I specifically remember one person who was designated by his peers in Gisenyi.  In that meeting, a certain Mr. Bernard Munyagishari.  There were a lot of young people during that meeting, young men and -- young men and women.  Munyagishari, Bernard, actually struck me as one person who was active there.  I do not know who the others specifically were, but I remember that person. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And that name is spelt, M-U-N-Y-A-G-A-S-H-A-R-I (sic).  Now, were the members of the MRND préfectoral committee from Gisenyi present at that meeting, such as Banzi Wellars as president? 
A.	I know Mr. Banzi Wellars, but I can say that he was not in that meeting.  However, the members of the movement in Gisenyi were told that since they worked for the MRND, they had to act in consultation or in consultation with the party leadership -- the MRND party leadership in Gisenyi, just like what was happening in Kigali.  But I can confirm that Mr. Banzi Wellars was not present at that meeting.

1635H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And were officers elected from Gisenyi to be president, and vice-president, secretary-general of the Interahamwe for that préfecture?  
A.	As far as I can remember, during that launching meeting, the president was designated, and the officers of the -- the remaining officers of the bureau had to be designated.  But, I believe that had to be done later.  I remember that the president was designated, but the rest of the bureau -- secretary, treasurer -- I really do not remember.  But, the president was designated by his colleagues, by his peers, in the course of that meeting.  I can remember that.  
Q.	And was the person who was designated as president Bernard Munyagishari?  
A.	Yes, that is the person indeed, Counsel.  And he stayed in that position right up to the end of the events, that is, right up to July 1994.  
Q.	To your knowledge, was Omar Serushago ever an officer of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi? 
A.	No, I do not know him.  I heard about Serushago in June, around June 1994 when I travelled to Gisenyi.  I had not known him, and I didn't get to know him well.  The only person that I knew who had a national status was Mr. Munyagishari, and he was a national football referee.  So, right up to June, I had not heard of Omari Serushago as part of the Gisenyi Interahamwes.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that the Interahamwe that were formed in the préfectures fell under the supervision of the MRND committee for that préfecture, and not under the national committee of the Interahamwe.  And, can you tell us when that decision was taken, by whom, and why?  
A.	I'm not sure that I have fully understood your question.  But, what I can say is that, at the time of the launching, the message that was conveyed -- and I was present there -- was the recommendation that unsupervised initiatives should be prevented, and that -- that the youth wing should come under the authority of the party for which they were working.  

	I do not know whether I understood your entire question, because I didn't catch some sentences.  
Q.	Yes, I think you've answered the question.  And who was it who decided, or recommended, that the Interahamwe in the préfectures should be under the MRND préfectoral committee, rather than the national committee of the Interahamwe?  
A.	I was informed -- even though I did not see the documents myself, but I learned that that recommendation had been made during the congress of July 1993.  And this was in the normal order of things.  A formal decision, such as the recommendation that was made in April 1992, just like that recommendation, I learnt that this other one was made during the congress of July 1993. 
Q.	And, on the ground, as a reali -- matter of reality, did in fact the Interahamwe in each préfecture report to the MRND préfectoral committee?  
A.	Report -- report on what, Counsel?  
Q.	Well, what I meant was, during the period from the formation of the Interahamwe and the préfectures through at least the 6th of April 1994, did in fact the Interahamwe in each préfecture, were they supervised or responsible to the MRND committee for that préfecture?  
A.	I have just told you that this was in the normal order of things, because the provisional committee in Kigali did not really have any authority beyond Kigali town.  So, based on the structures -- or, rather, with regard to the structures, we were still waiting for the elections.  At the request of Mr. Mathieu, the committee prepared a draft statute which was submitted, and we did not have any follow-up to that, given the situation that was prevailing in the country.  So, I really cannot talk about reporting to who and what.  But, what happened in the other préfectures in Kigali was similar to what was happening to the movement in Kigali.  
Q.	Now, do you know a person by the name of Anastase Gasana, and if so, what was his relationship with the MRND and the Interahamwe in 1992? 
A.	There was a person named Anastase Gasana who was an adviser in the MRND towards the end of the one-party system, and at about the time of the introduction of the multiparty system, that is, in 1991.  But, if I remember correctly, I believe that Anastase -- Anastase Gasana left the MRND in early 1992.  I believe that he became a member of the opposition, because apparently he had asked the president of the party, Mr. Habyarimana, to appoint him to an important position, and he was only appointed secretary-general, I believe, in the ministry of transport.  So, he felt that his chances would be better elsewhere.  I believe that in 1992 he had already left the MRND, but I do not know the exact time at which he did so.  
Q.	Prior to his leaving the MRND, what involvement, if any, did he have with the Interahamwe?  
A.	I know that as an adviser in the MRND, Mr. Gasana had proposed an approach, or a line of conduct, to be followed by the MRND party within the context of the multiparty system.  So, he proposed a strategy that had to be adopted by the MRND in order to face up to the other political parties in the country.  And, amongst other things, this strategy involved the creation of a youth wing similar to that of the other parties, because right up to that time the MRND had not set up a youth wing.  And they did that quite some time after the creation of the opposition parties.  So, the MRND was the last to set up a youth wing after the others had already done so in 1991.  

But, to be more specific, I never saw Mr. Gasana, be it during the time of the creation of the Interahamwes, or after that.  As far as I know, he had left the MRND.  But, that idea, at the beginning, had been his suggestion.  
Q.	So, would it follow that, as far as you can recall, Mr. Gasana never attended any of the Wednesday meetings of the Interahamwe?  
A.	Yes, I absolutely confirm that.  I never saw him, at least in the meetings that I attended, and no one ever informed me of the presence of Mr. Gasana in any of those meetings. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the witness could now be shown what is tab 53 of the Prosecution's exhibits.  It's a document entitled "Movement Democratic Republican," or MDR, "dossier, Interahamwe za Muvoma."  Or, in English, "The MRND (sic) party hardliners."
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is it in the documents that you have sent to Mr. Hometowu? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, it's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's in the bundle, yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, it's not in the bundle itself, but it's listed in the cover letter as one of the exhibits that he was to take with him from here.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, do you have that document?  

Excuse me, Witness T, can you confirm if the document has been placed before you?  
A.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, the sound did not come through.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, I'm sorry, we did not hear your answer.  Could you answer me again as to whether or not the document is before you?  
A.	I do not yet have the document before me, Counsel.  The registry representative is still looking for it.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	I have the document before me now, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness T.  Now, Witness T, what has been placed before you is a document written by Mr. Gasana, dated on the 14th of May 1992, after he had left the MRND for the MDR party.  And I'm just going to ask -- I'm going to call your attention to a few sections of this document and ask if what is being said in this document is true.  The first part is on the first page of the document after the cover sheet, and it's at the last paragraph under item 1.1, which is "La dimension historique".  And I'd like you to read that paragraph to yourself.  And when you're finished, let me know, and I want to ask you a question about it.  
A.	"La dimension historique --" 
Q.	Yes, excuse me, you can just read it silently to yourself.  What I would like you to do is just read the last paragraph of that section, beginning with the word "aujourd'hui", and just read it silently to yourself so you can comprehend it.  Because we have the document here in front of us, it's translated into English already, so I -- I just want you to read the last -- that paragraph, beginning with the word "aujourd'hui", under 1.1, and then I'll ask you a question about it.  
A.	Yes, I have read that paragraph, Counsel.  
Q.	And is it true that the MRND had formed the Interahamwe in order to intimidate the people, commit armed robbery, and create a state of insecurity in the country?  
A.	Counsel, it is the exact contrary.  I spoke briefly about the way most of the youths, who did not want to be forcibly recruited by other parties, they actually joined massively, which means the MRND actually became very popular, whereas the opposition parties had believed that they had kicked out the MRND.  So, the version that is given here is exactly the contrary.  So, as some specialists say, this is a contrary accusation.  

It is said in this document that the MRND tried to forcibly recruit people, it did not succeed, and so that accusation is extended to the Interahamwes.  At that time the MRND was referred to as a movement, but it meant the MRND (sic).  We were in the month of May, and we had talked about the activities against the MRND on the 8th and the 15th, and the accusations of the 25th of March in the Bugesera, but despite everything, the new MRND became popular after the congress of April.  

And you will allow me to underscore this point, which irritated the opposition parties, when Habyarimana proclaimed himself (Kinyarwanda spoken), because the popularity of Habyarimana and the MRND had just equalled what it had been during the single-party system.  This is why I believe that this accusation is a reflection of the popularity of the MRND that is faced with the after -- the failure of the opposition parties led by the MDR.  

I learned about their existence -- the existence of this document later, but the content really surprises me, and the comparison of it surprises me.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness T, and I just want to call your attention to one more part of this document.  It's page 6 of the French version.  It's the title "Number 4, the mission conferred on the Interahamwe."  And at the very bottom of page 4 (sic)...

At the very bottom of page 6 in the French, and page 11 in the English, I would like you to read that to yourself, beginning with the word (French spoken), and continuing up until the next page before it says "partial conclusion".  
A.	(Microphone not activated)... Counsel, I'd like you to repeat, please, because it's only now the document has been given to me; I have it before me.  Could you repeat the landmarks you were indicating?  
Q.	Yes, in the French version -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, there's a bit of a problem.  I can see the witness speaking on the screen, but I don't hear anything.  Have we lost -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have we lost the sound?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
No, I hear him.  And I said -- sorry, perhaps my microphone wasn't on.  He was asking Counsel Robinson to repeat the places he wanted him to look at, because he'd just now obtained the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness T, directing your attention to page 46, and there's the title under number 4 near the bottom, "The mission confirmed (sic) on the Interahamwe" -- "conferred on the Interahamwe".  And what I would like you to -- 
A.	I've found it, Counsel. 
Q.	And if you could read the paragraph -- the second paragraph under number 4, beginning (French spoken), and continue until page 5, "The partial conclusion."  Page 7, I'm sorry, "The partial conclusion."  
A.	I have just read the document up to "partial conclusion". 
Q.	Thank you, Witness T.  And, the author, Mr. Gasana, claims that their investigations have revealed that the mission of the Interahamwe is to commit crimes, assassinations, and terrorise the people, to create insecurity, to psychologically prepare Rwandan public opinion for acts of murder planned for the future, and to carry out criminal and terrorist acts against opposition political parties.  Was that true?  
A.	I must tell you, Counsel, when I read this document -- it was a long time after the events -- I understood exactly what a mirror image accusation is.  How can one be aware of such a diabolical plan and not announce it within a government that is led by someone from the ranks of the MDR?  I also heard that this plan was kept secret in small -- very small -- within a very small group among the steering committee of the MDR.  I think it was a plan inspired by, or in response to, the operation to destabilise the Interahamwe.  That is what clearly emerges from such assertions.  And that is what Gasana contributed to the MDR to obtain the position that he obtained -- the ministerial post he was after, I mean.  
Q.	Now, this document has been relied upon by Alison Des Forges in describing the intentions and activities of the Interahamwe during the period of 1992.  Do you believe that this document accurately describes the true intentions and activities of the Interahamwe?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Sorry, before the witness answers that question, please, the difficulty with the question is that, realistically, the witness would need to read the entire document, digest it, consider it, and then embark upon an analysis of what he agrees with and what he doesn't.  I mean, for example, within the document there's various aspects of it referring to the defendants, Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera, and their pivotal roles in the formation of the Interahamwe; the document being written in May 1992.  

So, for my learned friend to simply read out two small sections of the document and invite a factual witness to provide an expert opinion on the reliability of an entire document, framed by a political opposition member, on nothing more than those two small sections is, I respectfully submit, evidentially irrelevant. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, that's really not a problem, I will just ask this witness to review the document in its entirety over the weekend, and we will get back to that question when he returns on Monday, after he's reviewed the entire document.  I, frankly, don't think his answer will be any different.  But, in any event, he is certainly entitled to review the entire document, and I will ask him to do so.  

In the meantime, I will offer the document as Exhibit D. NZ117A for the French, and 117B for the English.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ117A and D. NZ117B admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And I will point out that I tried to have the witness review these documents yesterday, but it is because of the Prosecutor's objection that he wasn't able to do that.  But we can move on and speak about some events that occurred in May 1992.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness T, you've already told us that there was a speech in May 1992 in Gikongoro by Justin Mugenzi concerning the mission of the PL party versus the Interahamwe.  Was that followed up by violence committed by the youth wing of the PL against the Interahamwe?  
A.	Absolutely.  In fact, Mugenzi's speech practically finalised the opposition's plans for the MRND youth.  I don't think I'm only -- the only witness of the violent acts that followed.  It was a declaration of social war translated into fact by the Kubohoza policy, et cetera.  

So, Mugenzi showed their colours in full daylight, revealed in broad daylight their plans to combat the Interahamwe.  Rather than combatting with ideas, ideologically -- but we have to know what we mean by "to combat" -- with all their strength the Interahamwe.  Which was -- and I think I must say this -- was espousing Faustin Twagiramungu's discourse, the president of the MDR, his discourse since the beginning on the subject of the Interahamwe.  In his talks with the youth of the MRD, he said every time -- and it became a popular slogan -- "Well, the Interahamwe, we are going to oppose them, we are going to oppress them."  So, that's just a logical follow-up in fact translated into acts -- what was said in the speech, which was violent acts, as ensued in 1992.  
Q.	And we've seen as Exhibit P. 10 the letter from the Interahamwe committee on the 27th of May 1992 to the prime minister, condemning acts of violence by the youth wing of the PL party.  Were the contents of that letter true?  
A.	Quite, and it can be contrarily verified by the document you've just shown me, and by the speech which was made public, which was broadcast over the radio in Gikongoro in 1992, and the complaint    made -- I don't know whether the people that were singled out in it made any objection, and I take the Rwandan community as a whole as my witness.  It was all out in the open to the extent that the public was wondering if that is really democracy, and which is why most of them came back to the bosom of the MRND, whereas in fact they might have joined the opposition parties had they really had a more dem -- had they -- the discourse been more democratic and been perceived by the public as being more democratic, rather than indulging in physical violence.  

And this was verified, in fact, when the RPF attacked, and that that attack was defended by the highest leaders in the MDR, who were in cahoots, and the people understood all that.  And that is why, at one point, the people revealed, in broad daylight, their attitude towards the violence, which was merely playing the RPF's game on the internal front.  
Q.	Now, did the MRND schedule a rally for the Pentecost weekend at the end of May 1992?  
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And did they have permission to hold such a rally from the préfet of Kigali? 
A.	Yes, it was a meeting that was legally authorised by the préfet of Kigali town. 
Q.	And, can you tell the Trial Chamber what happened at that meeting, and afterwards? 
A.	I personally attended this rally, which took place in Kimihurura, opposite the prime minister's office.  At that time that place was the headquarters of the MRND party.  I remember that Mr. Ngirumpatse took the floor and addressed those present.  He denounced a meeting which was ongoing between the senior leadership of the opposition parties, which were represented in the coalition government that had just been set up two months before, on the 16th of April.  This was an announcement to the members that these parties had gone and met with the RPF in Brussels without the knowledge of the MRND and PDC parties, which themselves were part of the government coalition.  

Mr. Mathieu said that the conclusions of that meeting would never be binding on the MRND party, which had been ignored, and that, furthermore, the representatives of those parties were behaving as traitors to the detriment of the nation.  So, that, in a nutshell, was the message that was given by Mathieu Ngirumpatse on that occasion.  
Q.	And was there any violence in connection with this meeting on that day, or the leaving or attending the meeting, both to and from? 
A.	Can you kindly repeat, Counsel?  I did not quite grasp your question.  
Q.	Yes, it wasn't a very clear question.  Was there any violence that day in connection with this meeting?  
A.	Yes, there were some very violent skirmishes at the end of the meeting between the youth wings of the parties. 
Q.	And do you know what initiated these skirmishes? 
A.	With your permission, let me elaborate a little bit.  At one point during that meeting I saw some senior officers of the national gendarmerie, two colonels, come and speak with Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And for a short time his speech was interrupted.  And after speaking with them, Mr. Ngirumpatse told the meeting that he had just learned from the senior officers of the gendarmerie responsible for security that, according to their information, the youth wings of the opposition parties, probably infiltrated by RPF members, had decided to expel the members of the MRND from Kigali, and that violence had started in the town.  

Everybody was flabbergasted, and it was now said that each member had the right to defend himself by all means.  In fact, the meeting simply petered out, and the youth wing members went into the Biryogo and Nyamirambo neighbourhoods, where the violence had effectively started.  People said that it was the JDR and the Abakozi specifically who started off that violence.  And, in part of the town, around the intersection, it was said that some youth wingers of the PL had attacked MRND members, and so the Interahamwes counterattacked, and the events ended at about 7 p.m. to 8 p.m., with very bloody skirmishes.  And this is something I had never seen in Kigali.  

Of course, the gendarmes intervened, and this is how people understood that there was a link between this meeting being held in Brussels with the members of the RPF.  And the confirmation came later when, despite the signing of an agreement between the RPF and those parties, the RPF attacked Byumba, in spite of the ceasefire.  And Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu declared over the radio -- and there was even a televised debate, which I saw later -- Mr. Twagiramungu said that even if Byumba had been attacked and occupied, there was no problem because these were Rwandans actually coming to occupy their own territory.  So, this was more or less what he said.  I am not inventing everything, and this is publicly known.  

As far as I can remember, it was from that moment that some members of the MDR youth wing understood that some of their leaders were in cahoots with the RPF, and they did not accept that.  I believe that the vice-president and other leaders, such as Karemera and Murego, distanced themselves from the attitude of Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu, which they said was not part of the -- the mission that he had assigned to him.  That was the beginning of the split within the MDR, and that is what we experienced during that rally chaired by Mr. Ngirumpatse during the Pentecost weekend.  As from that time, it was clear that the opposition parties were doing the RPF's bidding, and that intensified the violence between the various youth wings of the political parties.

1730H
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	The attack by the RPF on Byumba, did that result in the displacement of people? 
A.	I have said, and will repeat, that a member of the national committee went to Byumba in the course of his duties to preserve certain economic activities -- economic activities that had been vandalised by the RPF at the time of the attack which had practically led to the closure to cessation of socio-economic activities.  Part of the population was displaced, but I think that certain attacks were contained or repulsed by the Rwandan Armed Forces, but the population was displaced in even greater numbers at the time of the RPF attack in Byumba.  
Q.	Did the attack of the RPF and the perception that opposition parties were colluding with the RPF result in an increase in the popularity of the MRND and the numbers of people joining the Interahamwe?
A.	On the part of the opposition parties, I did say -- some of the members of the opposition parties said to the Interahamwe, "You're right.  They are supporting the enemy."  So there was a, sort of, self Kubohoza movement.  So there was a lot of desertion.  Many deserted us at that time.  And so the number of the Interahamwes MRND progressively increased.  
Q.	Now, I want to ask you some questions about the development of the Interahamwe in the other préfectures following the congress of April 1992.  Can you tell us which préfecture was the first to begin in Interahamwe after Gisenyi?
A.	Well, in fact, the youth wings, formally speaking, Gisenyi -- Ruhango -- I could mention Ruhango.  Or -- after the creation of the Interahamwe in Kigali, there was a young man who was highly active, a very vigorous supporter of the Interahamwe's MRND.  At one point, on his own initiative, went to Ruhango, where he was from and then, later on, I think, at a meeting in Nyamirambo on the 7th of November.  Well, that young man came with a group of Interahamwe to Kigali and presented his troop, his group as being from Ruhango.  And we understood that he had taken the initiative to go himself and create that movement -- was elsewhere in other préfectures jointly the youth of the party, just like the members of the party, were all called Interahamwe.  In fact, all members of the MRND were called "Interahamwe", but it was really only in Kigali that it had any meaning, or at meetings which younger people or groups of political cheerleaders came to warm things up at the stadium, or other places where they held meetings in the préfectures.  I don't know if I have completely answered your question, but there is lots of subtleties associated with the term, so practically anyone who was a member of the MRND could be called an Interahamwe.  There was a very extensive concept of the term.  
Q.	And Ruhango is spelt, R-U-H-A-N-G-O.  And was that a sub-préfecture in Gitarama?
A.	Yes, Ruhango was a sub-préfecture.  It was a very large town in Gitarama préfecture.  It is a place between Gitarama and Nyabisindu, Nyanza as it's called now days. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time when members of the national Interahamwe committee went to other préfectures to assist in the establishment of Interahamwe in those préfectures?
A.	No, I only know of one case where some members went to Butare préfecture, but that was rather to carry a message to certain members of the MRND, among the students, so as not to join the PSD youth wing which was in the majority -- clearly in the majority in Butare préfecture.  But we can't really speak of launching Interahamwe.  But it was a way of encouraging students, still faithful to the MRND, not to cross over or let themselves be intimidated by the youth wing of the PSD that was in the clear majority in the préfecture. 
Q.	Did members of the Interahamwe committee attend any rallies in other préfectures in support of the Interahamwe there?
A.	Well, of course.  Any time there was a large rally in the various préfectural towns or sub-préfectural towns, the Interahamwe accompanied the highest ranking leaders of the MRND which was what, in fact, all the youth wings of all the parties did, and that is how and why perhaps the phenomenon -- the Interahamwe phenomenon gained in strength.  Here and there people were proud to be called Interahamwe, were proud to be members of the MRND.
Q.	Do you know who it was who established the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri?
A.	I don't know, counsel.  
Q.	And do you know who the president of the Interahamwe was in Ruhengeri?
A.	No, counsel. 
Q.	To your knowledge, was an Interahamwe group ever formed in Mukingo commune in Ruhengeri?
A.	I would repeat that the generally accepted term applied to -- was used to apply to members of the MRND but, in fact, things worked in such a way that the Interahamwe's MRND was structured in Kigali with a committee in town and then a committee in the districts.  I only know of that structure in Kigali.  The only other such representative I know was in Gisenyi, but in all the other places, préfectures, they were -- the Interahamwe were the youth of the party, but it wasn't structured and didn't function as it did in Kigali. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, I want to ask you some questions about the function and structure of the national committee in Kigali around the period of June 1992.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I'm getting some vibes.  Maybe it would be possible to take a break, or finish early, or something?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  How are you doing in terms of percentage wise?  In fact, we are thinking of stopping now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm doing very well in terms of percentage wise.  I may be at about 15 to 20 per cent of what I expect to be an examination that will take the entire week next week.  That's within the estimates that we've -- that you've set for us as a Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And that's -- you've agreed with your colleagues the way in which the time should be distributed?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, we haven't.  So we don't have any agreement because we're each defending our individual client, but in terms of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
In terms of time allocation, there's been no agreement about that?
MR. ROBINSON:
No, there's been no agreement.  But we're trying to work within the perimeters of past practice and past witnesses.  And, I figure, if I take five days that that will be within the way we've allocated proportionately our time, but I can't ask them to make any representations about how much time they would take.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, I think we'll take the adjournment now.  We'll resume on Monday morning.  I think we can resume at 9:30.  We start at 9:30 on Monday morning.  

Mr. Witness, we adjourn now.  I remind you, as I've done, it's probably a bit repetitious and maybe unnecessary by now, but I will just remind you of your obligation not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody during this or any other adjournment.  We adjourn now.  
THE WITNESS:
I have taken good note.
