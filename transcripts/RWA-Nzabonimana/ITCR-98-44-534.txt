MATTHIEU NGIRUMPATSE,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, yesterday in the morning we stopped at -- or when we were dealing with the second aspect of a question I had started asking.  Perhaps to refresh your memory, we were addressing what you described as a continuing war waged by the RPF from 1990 to 1994, first in Kinshasa and right up until to date.  
You also stated that in 1990 the RPF had failed in conventional warfare and that subsequently it chose other methods, namely, guerilla warfare.  Perhaps you may want to revisit that issue and mention the various forms which this guerilla warfare used and the impact that that type of warfare had on the Rwandan population.  
A.	Thank you.  Mr. President, yesterday I said that after the RPF failed in conventional warfare, this movement chose to wage a guerilla war.  The guerilla war consisted of hiding bombs and mines under bridges, on roads, in buildings, in markets, in parks, car parks, and a huge number of people lost their lives in this war. 

The second consequence was that in the guerilla warfare, they attacked the population.  So we had to cope with the huge number of people who were displaced.  I pointed this out yesterday.  Right up to a million displaced persons -- or right up to a million people were displaced within Rwandan borders. 

The guerilla war also took the form of infiltration, infiltration by RPF elements throughout the country.  The RPF recruited young fighters whom they trained in Uganda and who were sent back amongst the population.  Those young people were armed, and their role was a triple role.  

They had to recruit other members and other combatants for the RPF.  They had to commit murders as well as other crimes and attribute those crimes to the MRND, in particular, the Interahamwe.  And their third mission was to infiltrate the youth movements of political parties so as to encourage them to perpetrate acts of violence.  

In some events we saw these young recruits -- or these young infiltrators from the RPF -- we saw them cause disturbances and disappear thereafter.  So these are the forms that were -- this type of 
guerilla warfare adopted or took on. 

In fact, the war in general caused general discontent among the war-displaced population but also discontent amongst people who were compelled to deal with these huge numbers of people who had been displaced, who had no food, who had nothing to eat and who had abandoned everything. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did these acts contribute to -- did it contribute to weakening -- or, rather, increasing harmony amongst the people living on the hills or amongst political parties? 
A.	No.  On the contrary, the situation worsened as time went on.  Those young people were known.  They went -- or they would go for training and return.  Their parents were known.  And sometimes you had cases of provocation.  

The parents of these young combatants told their neighbours that in a few days, when their children will return, their neighbours will have a taste of the iron fist that was going to discend on them.  And that is how the feeling of frustration, the feeling -- an anti-RPF feeling increased among the local population. 

So the operation was totally negative as concerns social harmony in the country. 
Q.	Personally, did you have the opportunity of going to areas that suffered RPF attacks?  And if yes, what did you notice? 
A.	In Ruhengeri town, yes, I went there.  I did not go to Byumba town, but I was in Ruhengeri.  There there were many places of unwarranted destruction, destruction caused or carried out without justification, objectives that were not military objectives that were attacked.  And above all, a huge number of 
	civil servants were translated (sic) into Ruhengeri town, in particular magistrates of the court of appeal who were assassinated without cause.  

So that was the only place I visited and where I was able to take stock of the damage, of the harm that had been caused. 
Q.	Did you have the opportunity of visiting camps of displaced persons and to meet displaced persons? 
A.	I would have loved to do so, but I did not for a very simple reason.  Displaced people were under the responsibility of the ministry of labour and social affairs and also under the responsibility of the 
	ministry of interior.  So I wanted to avoid a situation where the party would be intervening in government matters and also to avoid criticisms that would arise from the fact that I went there.  And these were the main reasons that prevented me from going there.  

I did not want to disturb the government activities or the initiative of a member of government.  And I think this is easy to understand.  

If people claimed that we gave instructions to our ministers, what would they have said if they had seen us interfering in matters that came under the purview of those ministers, especially as the 
ministry of social affairs came under the opposition parties?  In fact, this may have been considered as a sabotage of government activities. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, do you have any idea as to the ethnicity of those who were displaced? 
A.	The RPF did not choose.  Sometimes when they targeted someone or a family, they would come and abduct that person or family at night.  But for -- in other cases they would just shoot indiscriminately.  

So you also had Tutsis who were displaced, not to the same extent -- not in the same proportion as Hutus, of course, taking into consideration the proportion of the Tutsis among the general population, that is, taking into consideration the ethnic composition of the Rwandan population. 

But as I said, the RPF did not choose.  They pushed everybody forward.  Everybody in front of them was driven forward. 
Q.	Were there periods of a lull, periods of calm, periods of ceasefire?  And if yes, were -- did the RPF take advantage of those periods of calm in order to contribute to peace? 
A.	No.  On the contrary, the first ceasefire signed in Zaire -- I believe that was on the 
	27th of October 1990 -- did not last.  That ceasefire did not last.  The RPF attacked once more.  

The attack of the night of the 4th to the 5th of June 1992, which I have already mentioned, was a violation of a ceasefire.  The attack of the 8th of February 1993 was another violation of a ceasefire. 

The attack of a health centre in Byumba préfet and of commune offices as well as schools, all these were violations of ceasefires.  Therefore, I do not see how the RPF took advantage of any calm or lull to contribute to peace. 

On the contrary, they took advantage of the truce or ceasefire to consolidate their positions further, to advance and conquer more territory, or sometimes to put pressure on Rwandan negotiators so as to obtain concessions.  

I think that yesterday or perhaps the day before yesterday or maybe on Monday, I highlighted this aspect of the matter. 
Q.	What would you say about their intervention in the media and the links that they may have had, that is, the RPF? 
A.	First of all, the RPF had a radio, the Muhabura radio.  I believe this term is well known in this Court.  Radio Muhabura started broadcasting -- if my memory serves me right, they started broadcasting in 1991. 

But they also had a series of newspapers and magazines for internal circulation.  These newspapers and magazines defended their cause.  And those newspapers and magazines in general were against the government.  And sometimes, so as not to exaggerate -- in fact, they were against the republic itself.  

The RPF also had a series of radio stations and foreign television stations as well as foreign newspapers which came purportedly to carry out investigations.  But they never went to areas occupied by the RPF.  And those foreign media never said anything about the crimes committed by the RPF. 

As a matter of fact, it was after the war when trials started that people became aware of what actually happened.  And I think in this regard the setting up of the Tribunal has been very useful.  It has been very useful because it offers the opportunity to know what the RPF did.  Even the committees of investigation -- commissions of investigation, that came to Rwanda. 

For example, the famous commission of investigation which drafted the well-known report spent only two hours in the RPF zone; whereas, throughout their mission they spent their time in the area under government control. 

So they also had the support of the media.  I often had the opportunity of receiving correspondences from BBC.  A BBC journalist would leave from Kampala in vehicles escorted by the RPF.  And at the border between Rwanda and Uganda, they would take another -- they would use other means to come to Kigali.  I met them quite often, but that was -- and I was often surprised that they did not mention anything about our discussions. 

I gave a long interview in Brussels to a Belgian journalist who spent three hours talking, but that journalist published nothing of our discussion.  And when the journalist was asked why she did not publish anything, her answer was as follows:  "It was too reasonable for it to have come from the MRND."  That was her answer.  That was the answer that the journalist gave, namely, "too reasonable for that to have been done by the MRND."   

So from the moment that it was constructive and reasonable, it was never published.  It was of no interest to everyone.  So that is what I can say on this point. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I thank you.  What were the means deployed by successive governments?  I think in this regard I would like to focus on the period of 1993, the means deployed by various governments to contain RPF attacks and to protect the population.  
A.	Not much.  The means were not considerable.  A lot of people talked of the well-known 
	civil defence programme.  I believe that was in the context of means deployed by the government.  But I will try to summarise because this point may lead to very lengthy discussions.  But I will try to summarise and point out the various activities carried out by various governments. 

In 1992 -- rather, perhaps 1991, the RPF attacked civilians in Byumba préfecture and also in Ruhengeri préfecture.  Now, these préfectures asked for bourgmestres.  Even the préfets asked -- or the bourgmestres and the préfets asked for -- asked to be given the opportunity to carry out 
night patrols.  The government, therefore, distributed weapons to the people of that commune or those communes, but those arms were used only at night during patrols.  And in the morning the arms would be returned to the commune offices.  The arms would be preserved there. 
But that operation caused a lot of noise, even though no one was killed.  The RPF talked a great deal about it.  So did others -- some other opposition political parties, as well as the media.  In fact, so much so that the government was compelled to retract and to withdraw those weapons or arms. 

After the attack of 8th February 1993, there were many demands for the government to defend the population.  Personally, after a working session of the political bureau, I wrote to the president.  Well, this was one of the conclusions of the political bureau meetings.  I asked the government that -- well, I told the government that young people were being trained without distinction to contain RPF advance because it had been established that at the time referred to the RPF wanted to seize or conquer Kigali. 

After my letter, political parties in Rwanda -- and at that time we had 17 of them -- held a meeting.  In the final communiqué of that meeting, they requested that young people be trained under the context -- or in the civil defence programme and to contain the RPF.  Our embassy in Kampala had sent an alarming message drawing government's attention, that is, the attention of the 
Rwandan government, to the RPF determination to take power, to seize power by force.  And in this exercise the RPF was encouraged by donors -- the donors did not see any advantage in implementing the Arusha Accords, because the donors told the RPF, "You will never be able to pay what we are giving you if you do not seize power totally.  Your partners would never accept -- will not accept to give you arms which -- because if you take those arms on credit, you will not be able to pay for them."  This is what we found out. 

But on the 7th of March 1993, Prime Minister Dismas Nsengiyaremye -- I believe I have already spelt that name -- went to meet the RPF president, who was Alexis Kanyarengwe.  That is also a name that is known by this Court.  And they issued a communiqué that suggested the opposite of what the political parties were asking for.  In other words, they prohibited the import of weapons, the distribution of weapons to the population, everything that was related to the civil defence of the population. 

Therefore, if I may summarise what I was saying on this point, you have political parties alerting the government.  There is the head of government who suggests the contrary of what political parties were asking for.  So that phase was never implemented.  That was the end because the person who had to take -- or was responsible for that phase was of an opposite view. 

Third attempt.  On the 30th of March 1994, the number of infiltrators having become huge, the chief of staff started becoming worried, and that is why the chief of staff, General Nsabimana -- Nsabimana is N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A -- summoned the préfet of Kigali town as well as the 
area commander, a sort of military governor of Kigali town, in order to study with them how to protect the population of Kigali. 
He asked them to give him a list of reservists because at the time -- and even soldiers, because at that time they did not live in camps, and also a list of people who were in a position to fight.  He added in his letter that, "In view of the shortage of weapons -- the number of weapons was not enough -- that it was necessary for people to train using traditional weapons if need be."  This is to show you the confusion in which they found themselves.  But we all knew that General Nsabimana was assassinated alongside the president of the republic on the 6th of April 1994.  Therefore, this phase also was not implemented. 

Fourth attempt is the famous civil defence programme by Kambanda which he attempted to set up through a directive of 25th May.  But we all know that by that time it was too late.  The embargo was in place, and it was all over.  That in summary is what people attempted to do in that connection. 
Q.	I want to thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, and I would like to say that we will revisit that second phase in subsequent parts of our examination-in-chief. 

However, allow me to revisit one specific point which is at the centre of the Prosecution case, namely, your letter to the president of the republic in relation to the attack of 8th February 1993.  Do you think it is necessary to place that document before you again, or are you familiar enough with it?  I believe it is Exhibit P. 17 -- Mr. Webster, confirming.  Do you think that you are familiar enough with that letter to make any comments without looking at the document itself? 
A.	Well, I think I could. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I apologise for interrupting.  Before we go on to P. 17, it's not clear to me whether the witness's discussion of the efforts made by Nsabimana on 30th of March 1994 were based on what he knew at that time or is a reconstruction based on the documentation that has entered the trial record during this trial.  So if Mr. Weyl could bring that out, I would appreciate it because it would make going over this issue in cross-examination much more direct. 
MR. WEYL:
Sorry, Mr. President.  I did not quite grasp the question, but maybe Mr. Ngirumpatse himself can deal with that issue during cross-examination.  

As for myself, I think the letter of the 8th of February 1993 was in Mr. Ngirumpatse's hands and he is familiar with it.  So maybe he can now address the Court on what he knew in relation to the time he was drafting that letter and in relation to the subject of the letter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a copy to hand out?  We would like to look at it. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Issa, please, I am referring to a Prosecution exhibit, a handwritten letter, Exhibit No. P. 17. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
From your build-up, I thought you had copies that you could have distributed, Mr. Weyl.  Don't you have a copy to save some time?  
MR. WEYL:
Not before me, Mr. President, and I am really sorry about that.  However, Mr. Ngirumpatse has told the Court that the subject matter of the letter is still fresh on his memory and that he is willing and able to make his comments. 

Mr. President, once again, I am sorry.  The reference should have been P. 27, not P. 17.  My apologies. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I take it that you remember the content of that letter and are in a position to make your comment and remarks.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to start by saying that I understood Mr. Webster's question.  It appears that he was asking me to tell the Court whether I was aware of the letter from General Nsabimana prior to coming to this Tribunal and in relation to the defence of Kigali town.  My answer to that question is, no, I only became aware of that letter after reading my indictment, but I was not aware of that attempt prior to that time. 

Secondly, I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to an issue in the English translation.  I am not English speaking, but it would appear to me that the English translation does not faithfully reflect the handwritten original document, and that is why we need to be cautious in using the English version of the letter.  And ultimately, it might be necessary to review the translation to determine whether it is a faithful translation of the French original. 

Now, as for the letter itself, the political bureau had requested that youth be trained with a view to checking the RPF and stopping it from capturing power by force.  But all of that was within the military context and not within the context of the civil defence movement.  

The second comment I would like to make is that the political bureau, of course -- and this was the answer I had provided earlier on -- requested that this initiative be implemented discreetly or, should it be said, secretly.  You see, our experience from '91 to '92 called for great caution, and we did not want the RPF to bring further pressure to bear either through a number of embassies or the media in order to stop these initiatives geared for or geared towards the defence of the people.  So that was the reason for the caution that needed to be exercised. 

You see, many thought that those youth would be -- or were the youth of the MRND Interahamwe.  But we need to be reasonable.  My letter was handwritten, and the addressee was the president of the republic.  There was no intermediary between myself and the president.  If I had wanted to write to the Interahamwe, I would have done so directly. 

So in this case I knew that there would be no third party, and I knew that the letter would not fall into the hands of any third party.  So I wrote to the president because I knew that the defence of the people was neither the business of the MRND as a party or of any individual or of the Interahamwe.  But I knew that it was a statement, a matter for the entire country, and that is why I felt that the entire country ought to have been involved in this civil defence initiative. 

Secondly, I would like to say that I made the recommendation for the issue to be discussed with the president of Burundi, Buyoya.  You see, it was not an ethnic issue because Buyoya was a Tutsi from Burundi.  A recommendation to discuss the matter with Buyoya had no ethnic overtones.  

My simple reasoning was that Buyoya had agreed for democratic elections to be held in his country, contrary to other views.  And I, therefore, recommended that this issue be discussed with him in good faith.  I also recommended that the matter be discussed with the United States, Belgium and France in order to stop the RPF and to stop this plague of attempting to capture power by force of arms. 

Then I went on to add that it was the unbridled quest for conquest that actually was at stake here, and history proved me right.  The RPF did not only destroy the social fabric of their country, but they also killed four million Zaireans on the other side.  And the United Nations' report even talks about actions that may amount to genocide, not only against the Rwandan Hutus but against the Congolese population.  

So these were the concerns -- were all the concerns of the political bureau which I brought to the attention of the president of the republic highlighting the attack of the 8th of February 1993.  And that, to my mind, was the turning point in the war to the extent that it enabled or made it possible for the RPF to make military gains on the ground and to take control over vast areas which it no longer ceded up until the time of the assassination of the president of the republic on the 6th of April. 

These in broad strokes are the general remarks I can make.  But if you were to put more specific questions to me, I would be ready and willing to field them.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  You have referred to the territorial conquest by the RPF.  Can you be more specific and tell us or tell the Court the territory that was so conquered and what happened to it and what was the fate of the people of that area after the 8th of February 1993.  
A.	This is the zone that was referred to as the demilitarised zone.  In fact, it was an area that should have been under UNAMIR control, although the UNAMIR never really had control over it.  The RPF collected taxes and was in charge of law and order and even called for local elections in that area but lost the elections.  And this was probably in the second semester of 1993 after the signature of the Arusha Accords. 

You see, the MRND actually won those local elections.  But the elected local officials were all killed on the 18th of November 1993, and the RPF made it impossible for any investigations to be conducted, and no findings have ever been published in that connection; whereas, this area was supposed to be under UNAMIR control as a demilitarised area which ordinarily should have been under the control of the UNAMIR.  But the UNAMIR was never able to control that area because the RPF was in charge of that entire territory, and that was up until they moved into Kigali and actually channelled significant quantities of weapons to the suburbs of Kigali, the weapons and arms which they used from the 6th of April 1994. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, just one small detail which I would like to highlight with you.  Now, when you say close to Kigali, very close to Kigali -- the demilitarised zone, you said it was close to Kigali, how far from Kigali was it, approximately? 
A.	Well, officially it was up to about 40 kilometres, as the crow flies, but it could have been less.  However, because of the infiltrations, the area actually expanded to about 25 kilometres from Kigali.  And it is in that area that they stockpiled some weapons which they brought into Kigali in the night of the 6th and then linked up with the other troops from Mulindi to continue their actions. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  You also referred to the Arusha Accords, and I am sure that you want to talk about this crucial matter.  

Now, before I ask you what the position of the MRND was, that is, your position relating to the Arusha Accords and its implementations, I would like to ask you, before doing that, to tell us about the genesis of the Arusha Accords; how were they initiated, and how did the negotiations proceed.  I know that this might be a very broad question.  I could break it down to the following:  How did the Arusha Accords come about?  What was the genesis of the accords, and how were the accords organised? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, you are right.  It is a very broad issue, broad problem, because negotiations were to involve a broad spectrum of stakeholders.  And, you know, the discussion started in Zaire with Marshal Mobutu, who subsequently became the facilitator, and initial negotiations took place leading up to contacts between the French government and the RPF.  And then there was the formation of Dr. Nsengiyaremye's government set up on the 16th of April 1992, and he is the one who started the negotiations. 

The head of delegation for Rwanda was Boniface Ngurinzira, who was minister of foreign affairs and of the MDR party.  I think that name is well known but allow me to spell it.  It is spelled N-G-U-R-I-N-Z-I-R-A.  Ngurinzira, Boniface.  

Let me specify that the Rwandan delegation was not made up of political party representatives.  It was a government delegation.  Therefore, no member of the delegation was to be seen to belong to a political party. 

Now, even for the MRND, those who were part of the delegation were only so because of their administrative positions and not because of their political party leanings. 

I also want to add that foreign powers were significantly involved in these negotiations such as United States, Belgium, France and Great Britain from a distance, and also Tanzania acting as facilitator.  The negotiations ran from 1992 to 1993, in August '93, culminating in the signature of the accords. 

The first person to be part of the Arusha Accords negotiations in their capacity as member of a political party was myself because at the time of signing of the code of ethics, I was present in my capacity as a political party member.  And that code of ethics was in relation to political party involvement in the implementation of the Arusha Accords, and that is how I signed the code of ethnics on behalf of the MRND.  Otherwise, all the negotiations were conducted in the context I have described.  And I am willing and ready to answer any further questions you may want to put to me. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, what were the highlights or the main points of the accords that were negotiated and ultimately signed?  And please be brief.  
A.	I am very happy that you asked me to be brief because the document is big and huge, a voluminous document containing a number of protocols.  But we can highlight the most significant aspects of that -- of the accords.  One, the state of law; two, power-sharing; three, the fate of the armed forces of the 
	two groups of combatants or the armed forces; three (sic), the transitional period; and then five, the elections that would follow the transitional period.  

So the determination was made as to how the RPF and political parties will share power, how the national assembly would function, and how the armed forces will be merged.  That in broad strokes is what I can say is the main focus or the main focus of the accords. 

But the sticking points were the power-sharing provisions and the sharing of ministerial portfolio, as well as the provisions relating to the merger of the armies. 
Q.	You have said, Mr. Ngirumpatse, that the sticking point would be what you have mentioned, but I have some semantic problems with what you have just referred to because maybe the issue of sharing, or partage in French -- sharing which can have a double meaning in French, which may not be very obvious in English.  I hope that the interpreters can capture the nuance in the word "share" or "sharing". 

Sharing could relate to a distribution, on the one hand, and sharing could also refer to coming together.  So I now would like to ask you whether "sharing" under the Arusha Accords was a matter of pulling together, or was it a matter of distributing, as in sharing and giving each party's due?  

The solution proposed by the accords, did it lead to sharing that would ultimately be a source of confrontation, or was it not likely to lead to a pulling of the resources? 
A.	To my mind, the text itself does not make that provision.  If people had acted in good faith and sincerely on the text or the letter of the document, then things would have been different because the sharing was simply in relation to who would be prime minister, who would be minister in such 
	ministerial portfolio over a specific time frame of 22 months, thereafter, elections would take place as the transitional measures were implemented.  So this was not actually a joining or pulling of resources.  It was truly a division or distribution of power. 

So the state of mind in which the RPF and government signed the accords was clearly defined at the time.  But when the human factor came in, the spirit of the letter of the agreement changed, and the arithmetic and dynamics also changed, and this is what I was referring to in my previous testimony to the extent that when the time came for ministerial portfolios to be shared, people abandoned their ideals and, therefore, lost track of the ideals that they stood for.  And it is this mathematical quest for power that caused people to divert from the initial concept of the accords.  And then this was all compounded by the assassination of the president of the republic. 

In any event, all matters were still negotiable.  There were a number of problems during the negotiations.  And it is true that during negotiations parties come to the negotiating table with their points of view, and when consensus is found, the agreement can be signed.  And so, thereafter, such accords should be upheld and respected. 

It is true that the RPF signed but was not able to control the behaviour of the human beings or the men who ultimately will be called upon to share power under the said agreements and accords.

1000H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Is it then your understanding that, after the signing of the Arusha Accords, the RPF sought to act in good faith in implementing the said accords? 
A.	Clearly, no.  No.  Not at all.  And for several reasons -- and there is evidence to substantiate that, evidence that is now available.  First of all, the RPF was absent from several planned sessions for the swearing-in of members of parliament.  It is true that there were problems in the number of parties, including the liberal party, in particular, and the RPF ensured that a solution to the PL problem would not be found.  And that is how the Tanzanian minister, Rwegasira -- R-W-G-A-S-I-R-I (sic) -- denounced in a statement in Kigali this issue, after a meeting in Kigali, questioning the good faith of the RPF in seeking a solution to the PL problems.  

I -- I think that the minister's name may be checked in a document or an exhibit which, I believe, is in evidence and which points to the RPF's responsibility in this matter.  

I have al -- I was always present whenever the swearing-in of members of parliament and ministers had been scheduled.  I was an eyewitness to all these matters, and I never saw the RPF at any of these ceremonies, except the first one at which the president of the republic took the oath of office.  Otherwise, they were always absent.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, what was the position, as far as you know, of President Habyarimana regarding the Arusha negotiations and the Arusha Accords?  Was the president opposed to those accords and negotiations?  Did he support them?  What was his position? 
A.	Let us begin with the position of the MRND, which is not different of -- from that of the president, but I'm going to get to the president's position.  On the 28th of April in the famous resolution -- or resolutions -- you would see that there is one of the resolutions in which the MRND supports the Arusha negotiations.  That was as early as 28th April 1992.  And the president of the republic repeated that position in his Ruhengeri speech given on the 15th of November 1992.  

The president gave other speeches to the nation supporting the negotiations, and after the signing of the accords, supporting the accords -- the fact that he himself came to sign the accords was an indication of goodwill because, from a protocol point of view, there was no head of state on the other side.  So he could have delegated the prime minister or someone else, just like the RPF had delegated Colonel Karangwa.  So that -- the fact that the president himself came to sign those accords was an indication of his goodwill.  

And there were many speeches that the president made.  In fact, we cannot count them.  There are many of them that have already been filed in this case.  Others have yet to be filed.  But the president made many speeches supporting the Arusha Accords and requesting that they be implemented.  He even made a special address or sent a special message to the armed forces requesting them to support the Arusha Accords and to implement them.  

As you know, the Arusha Accords comprised a phase of merging the two armies -- or the various armies, and this entailed the demobilisation and dismissal of several or many soldiers.  So he especially asked the soldiers to support the Arusha Accords.  

Now, that was the position of the MRND.  I myself, in Ruhengeri -- I supported the Arusha Accords.  In my speech of January -- that speech focused mainly on the support of the accords.  I said that the MRND has accepted and supports the implementation of the Arusha Accords so that the people should have peace.  Therefore, the MRND's position, as well as Habyarimana's position, on those accords suffers no ambiguity.  In fact, we supported the agreement even before the beginning of the negotiations, and that was as early as 28th of April 1992.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  To be more precise and regarding the Ruhengeri speech of November 1992, witnesses before this Court gave views contrary to yours.  We mentioned Witness GOB who said before this Court that, during that meeting or rally, President Habyarimana described the Arusha Accords -- or, rather, the Arusha negotiations as worthless paper.  This argument or evidence has been repeated often before this Court.  Can you give us your view on this term, quote/unquote, worthless paper.  
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  Since you're talking about the testimony of a witness, I believe there are also opposition witnesses who came here and said how this manoeuvre was built-up simply to put the president in a difficult situation.  When a witness makes allegations on the basis of someone's speech, the verification exercise is very simple.  You take the witness's statement or evidence and compare it against the speech.  

In this regard, I will not be lengthy.  You should simply take the speech and the evidence of GOB, add to that the evidence given by members of opposition witnesses who came here to testify to the contrary, and you will discover the truth immediately.  The president never used that term, quote/unquote, worthless paper.  Never.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, the same witness, GOB, stated that you, yourself, said during the Ruhengeri rally that the MRND will never accept the negotiations and Arusha Accords.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I will repeat my comments.  I said that I was here before professional judges.  During their assessment of the evidence, they would look at the speech in question and the evidence of that witness and they would realise that it's a pure lie.  It's not very complicated.  It's as simple as that.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, certainly because of this difficulty, the Prosecution case has slightly evolved over time.  It has changed.  After the Prosecution argued that the MRND was opposed to the Arusha Accords and having been challenged in that theory, the Prosecution attempted to argue that, after decrying the Arusha Accords, the government party -- or, rather, the Habyarimana clan, that is, the MRND, did everything in a bid to call into question the equilibrium that had been found in the Arusha Accords.  In one way or another, did the MRND question what had been agreed on and signed in Arusha? 
A.	The answer is no.  First of all, I am surprised by the fact that the Prosecution talks of, quote/unquote, the grand or the big Habyarimana.  Everything that concerns the implementation of the Arusha Accords was discussed in the political bureau.  

I have always stated that, when we are dealing with a political party, we should not be talking of clans.  It is a matter of political representatives who are elected to positions of decision-making, and this is what happened.  That allegation is wrong for the good reason that we did not have a problem of ministries.  

Yesterday I explained lengthily what we did to avoid conflicts.  First of all, we left -- we gave out the good beneficial -- or posts, good positions, and then we asked the opposition to designate people they thought were in a position to defend the interests of the population in that transition government.  We did not have any problem.  Those who torpedoed the transition process were those who fought for prominent positions or other material advantages.  

And it was not the MRND which did that.  We presented a list of our members of parliament, the list of our ministers as well, and I told you that Twagiramungu, whom I went to see to present to him the MRND list, was surprised and even impressed by the uprightness in which this exercise was carried out in the MRND.  Therefore, this allegation is completely false.  
Q.	Nevertheless, I will come back to that allegation because it is at the heart of the cross-examination carried out by the Prosecution -- the cross-examination of many Defence witnesses.  In fact, if my memory serves me right, the Prosecution wanted to obtain from witnesses -- witnesses, which would lend credence to the idea that the war broke out in 1994, following the instigation -- the instigation of Hutu extremists so as to compel a renegotiation of the Arusha Accords.  Do you have any comments on that suggestion -- on that analysis made by the Prosecution? 
A.	There is a weakness in the Prosecution reasoning.  On the one hand, I heard the Prosecution say that the Rwandan armed forces, that is, the FAR, were so weak that they thought they would lose the war.  The presidential camp -- the FAR, if they knew that they would lose the war, why would they provoke a war?  

So there's a weakness in that reasoning.  You cannot say that the FAR knew they would lose the war -- that the government knew that the government forces were weak, that they would lose the war.  If that were the case, why would they provoke a war?  Negotiating what, if they lose the war?  No one was ready to go back to war.  No one wished that war should resume.  People needed to rest.  People needed peace, and it is in that context that we worked in the MRND.  

What is often referred to as the presidential clan -- well, let us look at the reality.  As I told the Court, all these decisions were taken within the political bureau.  Can the Prosecution give us an example of who was a member of the president's clan in the political bureau of the MRND?  I'm not aware of any such person.  I do not know anyone who would have taken the risk to provoke or cause a war, which we knew that we were going to lose, in order to renegotiate the agreement.  I think there is a weakness in that reasoning.  It does not reflect the reality.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I will come back to what Prosecution witnesses said.  When Witness UB alleged that the MRND signed the agreement and the protocol to share power but that subsequently it rejected the idea of having the same number of positions as the M -- as the F -- RPF in the government, what is your comment regarding that evidence given by Witness UB? 
A.	Mr. President, there lies the danger, that is, the danger of calling before this Tribunal witnesses of a very low level of education.  I just said that I personally presented the list of ministers and members of parliament to the designated prime minister, that I went to see the prime minister.  Where does 
witness -- what does UB rely on to make his conclusions?  Was he with me when I was with the prime minister?  Was he a member of the political bureau?  Was he a member of the 
national committee? 

In fact, this is a real problem, a problem of level -- or the level of witnesses.  If we wanted to carry out any obstruction, we would have created a problem within so as to delay the negotiations.  But we were the only party that had no problem.  Therefore, this allegation is gratuitous which, perhaps, is -- well, maybe the witness wanted to protect himself.  But clearly, the witness does not know anything regarding the mechanisms that led to the designation of ministers and members of parliament.  

And when that witness alleged that we did not want to apply the Arusha Accords because we had very few positions, well, the Defence witness, PTR, I believe, said that I went to the Méridien hotel to explain to the population that the 22 months of transition was not -- were not very complicated, that we're going to go through those months and go to elections.  

I have always trusted or had faith in elections.  Even on the 16th of January 1994, I still believed that the people were going to go to the polls and solve all conflicts -- resolve all conflicts amongst politicians.  To my mind, that was the best approach.  And I still believe that is still the best approach.  In democracy it is the best approach.  It is the best solution -- that is, the polls.  I still maintain that position.  

It is, therefore -- the status of this witness is, therefore, the -- his status within the party, within the society, which prevents him from being aware of the fact and the real position of the party.  Perhaps someone from the political bureau may have been called, and, in that case, we'll have an -- a -- a -- an argument among equal part -- parties.  But here is someone who doesn't know what was happening and yet who comes to testify to what was happening within the political bureau.  This is difficult.  This is impossible.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I would like to know whether, at any point in time, during a rally or during -- well, when I'm talking of a rally here, I mean a public rally.  Yes, a rally in English; a meeting in French.  At any point in time during a rally, did you speak against the Arusha Accords?  Did you take a position openly or even privately against the Arusha Accords? 
A.	No.  Never.  And I believe that answer is enough.  I do not have to elaborate on it.  What I said is available.  The Chamber will look into what I've already said to see whether I took such a position, but I do not believe I did.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse -- and Mr. Witness, nevertheless, because you're a witness now -- there is a Prosecution witness who argues the contrary, and I would like to confront you with what the witness said so that you should have the opportunity of making comments thereon.  

This is Witness GOB who stated that, at the time referred to, that is, at the time when you were secretary general of the MRND, he allegedly asked you on the 28th of January 1993, before a rally and in the presence of Interahamwe, like André Nzabanterura and Isaac Nkubito, the other parties that had approved the Arusha Accords, that -- and that you were for -- you of the MRND were fighting the accords and that you were developing a war strategy.  And he asked you what would happen.  

GOB claims that he met you on that day.  And he further states that you told him, quote/unquote, that the day the RPF resumes war, on that day, you will kill the accomplices who had been imprisoned; that in 1990 you were not able to kill them and that, since the international community intervened, you released those accomplices.  So you said, if the war resumed, you will kill them.  

This witness, that is, Witness GOB, says that is what you said, suggesting that, apparently, you were very harsh in your criticisms of the Arusha Accords and that you were very vehement in your determination to fight those accords and the RPF.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  One of the errors or weaknesses in false testimony is that they do not measure the scope -- the import of what they are saying.  

First of all, on the 28th of January 1993 -- what Arusha Accords is he talking about?  Did the -- did the Arusha Accords exist as of that date?  That witness in his statement places himself in the context of this Tribunal.  But on the 28th of January 1993, the Arusha Accords did not exist.  Did they exist?  So what did I have to fight against? 

Secondly, that witness says that I said, quote, that we were going to kill Tutsis and their accomplices and so on.  Now, we are referring to the 28th of January 1993.  On the 8th of February 1993, the RPF attacked.  The RPF got as close as 20 kilometres from Kigali.  They displaced 1 million people.  Does the file show that a Tutsi was killed thereafter? 

Can Witness GOB say that people died in February 1993 because Ngirumpatse said so-and-so?  So the facts speak for themselves.  I do not have to make any statement.  

On the 28th of January, the witness claims that I made -- I said what he said I said.  One month later, even less than one month thereafter, the RPF attacked and caused a great deal of harm.  There were never accomplices nor Tutsis killed.  

Now, the witness still maintains his position -- the position of such a nature.  He talks of an 
Arusha Accords which did not exist because, after the 8th of February 1993, we returned to Arusha to continue negotiations.  So which Arusha Accords is Witness GOB talking about?  

Thank you, Mr. President.  I -- I think that answer is enough.  I do not want to waste the Court's time.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, to avoid wasting the Court's time in cross-examination, if Mr. Weyl could refer us to the passage where GOB addresses the Arusha Accords, it would be much appreciated, because my recollection of his evidence in regard to the meeting of the 28th of January 1993 had nothing to do with the Arusha Accords.  It had to do with whether war would break out again and his allegation that Mr. Ngirumpatse's response was that, if war broke out again, they would kill all of the accomplices.  

I've gone over my summary of that day's testimony just two minutes ago, and there's no reference to the Arusha Accords in that conversation or that purported conversation, so if Mr. Weyl can check his notes -- or give us the precise passage that he's referring to when he represents what the witness said.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, cross-examination has not started.  I would simply like to observe that, according to my notes, these are the transcripts of 22 November 2007, page 39, et seq.  

Perhaps during the break the Prosecution could cross-check this.  But I believe my references are correct.  "The other parties accepted the Arusha Accords while we were fighting them", says the witness.  "And we developed a war strategy."  That is referring to what the witness said in those transcripts, the reference of which has been given.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Weyl, what the Prosecutor has raised is a possible misrepresentation.  I think it should be addressed so we could clarify it now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm looking at the transcripts of the 22nd November 2007, and we have testimony from a Witness AXA.  So I believe we'll have to look at -- if you give me a moment, I can look for the transcripts, but the reference that Mr. Weyl just gave us is not correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, my clerk has asked if you could give us a page reference so we can check it ourselves.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I will clarify, but perhaps I may do some verification if I take advantage of the break.  I -- I was talking about the transcript of 22 November 2007, page 39.  Perhaps there is an error.  

Can we give the clarification, if necessary, after the break, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We could take the mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1029H to 1050H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President.  Allow me to inform the Trial Chamber that during the break we were able to locate the right reference to Witness GOB's statement.  It is the statement of 22 October 2007.  2006, is it?  Ah, well -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I have it as the 22nd of October 2007, and the questioning begins on page 36 in the 
English text and on page 39 of the French text.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes.  We are now agreed.  That is what I meant:  22 October 2007.  And my quote of a short while ago was correct, and the transcripts can bear me out.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  Couldn't we just read the exchange to the witness and have his response? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I don't want to waste the Court's time.  I read out that excerpt a short while ago.  I could read it again, but we would be wasting the Court's time.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Let me then read the statement.  

"Therefore, at the time in 1992, Matthieu Ngirumpatse was the general secretary of the MRND party.  And I asked him on the 28th of January 1993 -- I asked him whether the other parties agreed to the Arusha Accords, whereas we were fighting against them, and putting forward a war strategy, what is going to happen?"

I think that is the excerpt I read a short while ago.  I have just read it again, and I believe that Matthieu Ngirumpatse's answer on that specific point was complete and exhaustive.  
MR. WEBSTER:
There isn't a response.  The -- the -- can't we read the entire portion to the witness and get his response, and in that way we will have dispensed with the issue?  Read the following sentence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, just as a matter of interest -- we've also accessed the transcripts so we have them before us.  So we are seeing what -- you -- you can really put it frankly to Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  Maybe I should move on to the question which I intended to put to him because I thought that this matter had been settled.  We had talked about it, and Mr. Ngirumpatse had provided his answer.  And it is in an attempt to challenge Mr. Ngirumpatse's answer that the Prosecutor asked for the reference.  

On my part, the issue of GOB's statement is settled and Mr. Ngirumpatse has answered the question, and I would like to move on to another question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, you must not forget where we are.  Put the whole package.  We're going -- at the end of the day, we're going to be judging the issue of truthfulness, reliability.  We have seen the entire transcript.  We have it before us now.  And it would assist us if you could deal with the matter thoroughly.  That's all we ask.  
MR. WEYL:
I'm going to read once more all that I read earlier on, since my reading was complete.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, it was not complete.  That is what we are saying, that you left out something which we think is useful.  And it would be interesting to have Mr. Ngirumpatse's response to it as well, and it would also put it more accurately in context.  

MR. WEYL:
I'm going to go over that again in full, the testimony of Witness GOB.  The previous paragraph.  
"Considering the confrontation of political parties that met the RPF in Brussels -- or consultations of political parties that met the RPF in Brussels, and in the absence of the MRND, and since the 
minister of foreign affairs signed the agreement relating to the sharing of power amongst the parties and the RPF Inkotanyi, the situation deteriorated, Mr. President, Your Honours.

"It happened that the MRND was marginalised.  We were given five portfolios and 11 seats in parliament.  We were not happy with that.  We noticed that this politically marginalised us.  We did not have the minority to block proceedings leading to some decisions.  

"When the situation turned out to be what it was, the MRND was not as cautious and before -- as before, and MRND members showed that those who were opposed to the MRND were enemies in the same way as the Tutsis.  And MRND members were saying that they were not going to accept the Arusha Accords."

I thank counsel for the Prosecution.  I thank the Bench. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have not completed his answer.  The answer -- what was relevant to your question was the next sentence on the completion of his sentence, because the punctuation mark here is a semicolon.  
MR. WEYL:
"At the time referred to, that is, in 1992, Matthieu Ngirumpatse was the secretary general of the MRND party.  I asked him -- that was on the 28th of January 1993.  I asked him whether the other parties accepted the Arusha -- I told him that the other parties accepted the Arusha Accords, whereas the MRND was fighting them, and that the MRND was putting forward a war strategy.  I asked Ngirumpatse what was going to happen.  

"In answer to my question, Ngirumpatse told me that the day the RPF will resume war, on that day, quote/unquote, we will kill the accomplices who had been imprisoned in 1990.  We had not been able to kill them.  And since the international community intervened, we released the accomplices.  So if the war resumes, we are going to kill them."  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, this more complete reading of the answer or testimony of Witness GOB, does it change anything?  Would it change anything to the comments you made earlier on? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Not indeed.  I will not change my comments.  I would simply like to add that this witness is talking about members of the MRND who were against the accords which had already been signed.  That is possible.  But for my part, as an accused before this Tribunal, I was not in charge of monitoring the conscience -- the minds of members of the MRND.  

What I can say is that I, as secretary general, the political bureau, the president of the republic and the chairman of the party were in favour of the accords.  So this does not change fundamentally.  I would simply like to add that this witness did not speak the truth because we also brought a witness, who was not a protected witness -- I believe I can mention his name.  

Can I mention his name?  That was Witness Nzabanterura, which Witness GOB -- or, rather, who said he did not hear that.  I will continue saying -- I maintain that, on the 8th of February 1993, the RPF resumed the war, so I do not see how the threat alleged here could be implemented.  In other words, I maintain my answer.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Another witness -- Prosecution witness, that is, Witness AUB (sic) said that during a rally, which was held at the Nyamirambo stadium at the end of 1993, that you took the floor during that rally and said that the MRND will never accept to share power with Tutsis and that you said that the Tutsis had obtained several positions in the government.  He added that everyone applauded when you made that statement.  What do you say to that? 
A.	First of all, I would say that that witness did not properly understand Rwandan opinion regarding the Rwandan war.  When he says that everyone applauded for me, I do not think that if I had said what he claims I said I would have been applauded.  In fact, I would have been described as a warmonger.  

At that time, that is, November 1993, to make the utterances ascribed to me when we were preparing or getting ready to get into a transition government would have been impossible.  So, once more, the speech referred to is available.  It suffices to look at the witness's testimony and my speech and make a comparison.  That exercise is very simple.  I did not make such utterances.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to you, what were the reasons why the putting in place of the 
transition institutions failed -- the transition institutions as provided for in the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Mr. President, negotiations of that nature are always fraught with some strategies -- exercises to study the government structure -- the structure of the government of that time and the parties that had to form the broad-based transitional government.  You had the MDR, the MRND.  There was the PSD, the Parti libéral, the PL and the PDC.  

The national assembly comprised practically everyone with a different number of MPs.  On the signing of the Arusha Accords, I already talked about the FDC, that is, the democratic forces for change.  So as I was saying, when the Arusha Accords were signed in August, those parties for democratic change constituted a block -- an opposition block that was very united.  But when the time of sharing came, there were problems in the MDR party, in the PL party as well, because people were no longer in agreement on who had to become minister.  
The RPF noticed that it was losing on the basis of the strategy it had devised, particularly as regards the Parti libéral.  The RPF wanted the ministry of justice to be given to a person of their choice.  The RPF preferred that the Twagiramungu wing of the MDR be given priority, and when there were problems -- when there were disputes within the party, the hope of having a two-thirds majority in the government and in the national assembly -- that hope vanished.  

That is when problems emerged because, within some political parties, some leaders had changed their minds, and this undermined the plan put in place during the Arusha Accords and the signing of those accords.  So it was just because people were vying for positions and because the RPF did not see its plan mature to fruition in that sharing that they had problems.  

The Tanzanian minister denounced that.  As regards us, the MRND, we accepted the situation because 22 months was an acceptable period.  We were going to work with the others while continuing to 
carry out our political campaign.  So this is the reason.  It was the split within the political parties -- the parties of the democratic forces for change.  It was that split that put an end to carrying out a healthy political game.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, some Prosecution witnesses, and the Prosecution itself, argue that you had stealthily caused division amongst the political parties so as to create conditions of discord and thus prevent those parties to put in place the transition institutions.  What comments do you have on that allegation made by the Prosecution and their witnesses? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to come back to what I said yesterday.  After the Byumba attack on the night of the 4th to the 5th of June 1992, I said that the MDR published a communiqué.  In that communiqué they challenged the power of MDR signatories in the Brussels meeting.  Their 
delegates -- those delegates had received instructions not to sign anything.  

After they signed, that attack took place.  I talked of the communiqué of 1st July 1992 which denounced the RPF attack.  That communiqué came from the MDR itself, and it is precisely from that moment that there was a pro-RPF faction and another faction that was not ready to support the RPF policy.  

Perhaps it may be helpful to find that communiqué of 1st July 1992, the communiqué signed by the MDR.  Please find it and submit it to the Chamber.  That is when divisions started.  We did not do anything at all within the political parties.  Moreover, those political parties were set up -- or, rather, they banded themselves together against us, so what could we have done to split them?  They went to court.  It is not we who sent them or who asked them to go to court.  They held a congress in Kabusunzu.  Kabusunzu is K-A-B-U-S-U-N-Z-U.  

In that congress they dismissed members belonging to the pro-RPF wing, the Twagiramungu wing.  We are not the ones who convened that congress.  We were not members of that party.  We did not attend the congress.  So, in fact, that was not our concern.  Once more, that allegation is false.  The problems those parties had was an internal problem.  

In the Parti libéral, the PL party, they split also.  There was a pro-Lando wing, that is, 
a pro-Ndasingwa wing and another wing which was in favour of Mugenzi.  But once more, that was an internal problem.  

I do recall that, on the 20th of January, Mr. Mugenzi was attacked, that is, 20th of January 1994.  He was attacked.  And that attack was attributed to the RPF.  But those were problems that were internal to those parties.  We did not play any role in the divisions and splits that occurred in those parties.  We would have liked the parties to remain united for us to make progress.  That is patriotism.  

We did not have an individual problem with those parties.  Those parties themselves -- the individuals in those parties had an interest to wage war against one another to obtain positions and advantages.  That is the reality.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, another reason mentioned by the Prosecution as being an obstacle to the setting up of the transition institutions is that during the swearing-in ceremony, as it was provided for or envisaged in January 1994, demonstrations allegedly were organised in order to prevent members of parliament to go to the CND so as to be sworn on -- sworn in.  What is the date you said? 
A.	January 1994, during the swearing-in of the president of the republic and in the days that followed the 8th of January 1994.  There were no demonstrations on the 5th of January, and to my knowledge, no one was prevented from coming to the assembly from the C -- coming to the CND, provided they had a card showing that they were a member of parliament.  

In fact, I was not in charge.  Well, the Chamber can go -- carry out a site visit.  They will see the location of the parliament building.  They will see how the access to the parliament building -- and I'm sure that it was not -- they will see that it was not possible to prevent people from passing, because you had the gendarmerie -- the national gendarmerie; you had UNAMIR and also the Presidential Guard element.  How could a civilian prevent people from passing? 

I was in the parliament building on that day.  I was there to be sworn in.  I did not hear -- I entered the parliament building without any problems.  I showed my ID card at the entrance, and they allowed me 
to pass.  

On the 8th of January, there was no swearing-in ceremony.  In any case, I was not invited 
to the alleged swearing-in ceremony supposedly organised on the 8th of January.  
On the 8th of January, there was absolutely nothing.  There was no ceremony that was organised on that date.  So I do not know where that witness sees that demonstration -- where the witness sees that there was a ceremony -- a swearing-in ceremony.  In any case, I was not invited to the alleged swearing-in ceremony.  

Moreover, I was surprised to learn before this Court that people had been prevented from going to the CND building to be sworn in.  I was not invited to be sworn in on that day.  And I'm not aware of anyone who may have invited MPs to the parliament building to be sworn in on that day.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, one of the other Prosecution theories is that in an attempt to -- to block -- to obstruct the progress towards peace -- progress towards democracy and the implementation of the Arusha Accords, the MRND allegedly incited the creation of the CDR and subsequently used the CDR as a -- as an element to cause chaos to prevent the setting up of the transition institutions.  Can you give your comments on that analysis? 
A.	The analysis is wrong.  We did not create the CDR.  Well, perhaps on an individual basis people were happy with the creation of the CDR, but I do not know such persons.  But I reiterate before this Chamber that we were not in any way responsible for the creation of the CDR.  

The CDR considered us as an opposition party, just like other parties did, because at some point in time the CDR thought that we were even too weak vis-à-vis the RPF.  And in this regard, we should recall before this Chamber that there is a letter from the CDR to the president of the republic.  Perhaps that letter is part of the case file.  Maybe your aides will find the reference of that letter.  In that letter the CDR reproaches the president of the republic for being weak, for not being firm.  Therefore, that is the fact.  

Between the fact and what people allege, there is a wide gap.  The CDR considered us like other political parties did, but we were not friends.  We formed an alliance with them together with two other political parties, an alliance which the CDR left because the CDR thought that the alliance served no purpose for them.  It did not serve their interest.  The CDR, therefore, took the initiative of leaving the alliance.  The alliance was known as an alliance for the strengthening of democracy.  RAD is the French acronym.  They left on their own initiative.  

Contrary to what the misinformed people think, we were not great friends with the CDR.  On the contrary -- in fact, if there was a party that they could criticise, it was the MRND and the president of the republic.  So that allegation is false, completely false.  
Q.	I would now make available to you the statement of AUB (sic).  AUB states that he discussed or talked with you about the coalition -- the coalition with the CDR in that he told you that Tutsi members of the MRND were leaving the party, that is, the MRND because of the alliance between the MRND and the CDR.  The witness further stated that your answer was that the MRND had preferred signing an agreement with the CDR instead of continuing to coexist or to live with Tutsis.  

It would appear, according to this witness, that you told the witness that, quote/unquote, "Allow them to leave.  We have no guarantee that these Tutsis are going to remain within the MRND.  We preferred signing an agreement with the CDR instead of continuing to collaborate with the Tutsis, even though we do not have confidence -- we do not trust these Tutsis.  But the few Tutsis who will accept to continue remaining within the MRND, we are ready to continue collaborating with them."

What do you say about this testimony given by Witness AUB? 
A.	The same answer that I had given before.  Each Prosecution witness comes here to say that they talked with me.  One would have a feeling that I had -- I was in a sitting room and talking throughout the day.  

This mass resignation I'm not aware of.  The resignation that I am aware of and which was written, and which AUB is not aware of, came from Professor Rubiya -- Rumiya.  That is R-U-M-I-Y-A.  That is the only resignation we are aware of.  But I would want to inform the Chamber that Rumiya was not Tutsi; he was a Hutu.  Therefore, this resignation in large numbers that AUB alleges is an exaggeration.  I do not know of Tutsis who'd resigned because of the CDR alliance, except Rumiya.  Rumiya wrote a letter.  He did not agree with that alliance.  
(Pages 13 to 26 by Jean Baigent)
















1130H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
We do not deny that at some point in time we had an alliance with the CDR.  But the purpose of the alliance was not to hurt anyone.  In any case, there was only one person who resigned, and that was Professor Rumiya.  The said Rumiya was not a Tutsi, he is a Hutu.  This is a matter of personal conviction.  

So when this witness talks of the resignation of Tutsis in large numbers, well, he's simply not aware of what happened.  He's simply ignorant.  I was the one who received resignation letters.  I was the one who also received oral requests for resignation.  And I did not go and tell this to UB, I did not report to UB, I reported to the political bureau.  If there had been a member of the political bureau who came to give such testimony, maybe that testimony could be taken seriously and we could discuss it.  But here I have nothing to say regarding what UB said.  He simply was not aware of what was going on.  He simply told a lie.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I will simply note -- I think the witness has corrected it now, but we've been hearing before "AUB" as the reference for the witness.  The last response is, I assume, the correct one, that the witness and Mr. Weyl are referring to "UB". 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the court reporters did not get your last intervention.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I didn't want to interrupt the witness before, because when the -- this question and the question before it, what we heard in English was "AUB", and I, at one time, heard "AWB".  So I thought that there was some confusion about the witness that was being referenced in Mr. Weyl's question.  But, given Mr. Ngirumpatse's last response, where the translation has been consistently "UB", I think the record is now correct.  But I just wanted to make that comment so that there's no confusion at a later time.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, when -- perhaps this is due to the utterance in French where you say somebody said -- said something to, quote unquote, "à UB", in French.  Perhaps that is what led to the confusion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thanks for the clarification.  
MR. WEYL:
Well, orally, it is not possible to make a distinction in the French between the A with or without the accent. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, would you please specify to the Court whether the CDR stood for the elimination and extermination of Tutsis.  
A.	No, that was not my observation, particularly relying on the statutes of the CDR.  Let me add, for the benefit of the Trial Chamber, that the CDR leader had matrimonial links with Tutsi families, and I may not mention some names.  But, in any event, they had matrimonial or marriage links with Tutsis.  

And I did not notice in their statutes that they stood for the elimination of Tutsis.  In fact, they went ahead to admit that Tutsis -- Tutsis could run for power, so long as they acted democratically.  And this was my reading of their statutes or constitution, which are available, and which can be consulted by the Trial Chamber.  I did not observe any such tendency in their constitution.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, we have discussed some of the obstacles to the implementation of the Arusha Accords and the setting up of the transitional institutions.  According to you, what is it that finally buried all attempts at implementing the Arusha Accords?  
A.	I am convinced that it was the assassination of the president of the republic and the RPF's determination to take power by force.  I am convinced that those are the reasons for which the Arusha Accords were not implemented.  

You see, on 22 February we had decided to set up the transitional government; and then the assembly, or the parliament, on the 23rd of February.  However, on that 22nd, the RPF assassinated Minister Gatabazi, Félicien.  Gatabazi is spelt G-A-T-A-B-A-Z-I, Félicien, who was then the minister of public works and executive secretary of the PSD party.  That assassination made it impossible for the transitional institutions to be set up on the scheduled date.  However, we continued negotiations, through UNAMIR, with the RPF.  

On the 6th of January -- the 6th of April, rather, 1994, in the morning, we had a meeting of the steering committee of the MRND with the director of cabinet of the president of the republic, urging him to decide on a final date for the ceremony.  And that final date was to be the 8th of April 1994.  Maybe that information was leaked, because the president had issued instructions for a communiqué to be released, or a statement to be made to the nation, at which the date for the setting up of the institutions would be determined -- or, would be announced.  

So that is what transpired.  And I believe that everything was already set for a solution to be found for the setting up of the transitional institutions at the time.  I believe, therefore, that it was the actions of the RPF and the murder of the president of the republic which made it impossible for the Arusha Accords to be implemented.  Thank you, thank you.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Now I would like to deal with another aspect of the Prosecution case.  

You know that one of the main charges against you by the Prosecutor is that, in 1993 and in early 1994, you are alleged to have participated in MRND meetings and to have spoken at public rallies and, in those instances, referred to Tutsis as "the enemy".  They charged you with attempting to indoctrinate MRND militants or supporters, particularly the youth and the Interahamwe, and also inciting fear and hatred within the Hutu people of Rwanda, fear and hatred for the Tutsis.  

Now, at this juncture in this trial, I would like to ask you whether you have any recollection of any public rallies or any public meetings, or even private rallies and meetings at which you may have spoken or attended between 1993 and 1994.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I never made any such statements; not in public, never in private.  I never made any such statements.  During my hearing, and even from the beginning of this trial, we have talked about my relations with Tutsis.  And I believe that I still enjoy friendships within that community, even today.  And if I had made any such statements, I would have been sanctioned by our party and I would have lost all those relations and relationships.  So I never made any such statement, neither in public nor in private.  

I did not indoctrinate any youth to hate Tutsis, because there was a large number of Tutsis within our party.  So that allegation, that charge, is not serious.  And, once again, public statements are available and can be consulted.  

I do not think that it is good enough to just bring a witness to say a thing or two about any specific document, because we need to read the documents.  These witnesses have narrated their own thoughts which have nothing to do whatsoever with my speeches and statements.  I have never promoted hatred, I have never promoted division.  

So these are matters that would have been disciplinary issues within our party, and I would have been reprimanded or sanctioned by the political bureau of my party, or even by the president of the republic, had I engaged in any such activities.  So it is false; all what has been narrated in that connection is false.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did you, at any time and in any manner, refer to the Tutsis as "the enemy"?  
A.	Never.  
Q.	Or as "an accomplice of the enemy"?  
A.	Mr. President, well, before I was overwhelmed by age and illness, my memory used to be very sharp.  I do recall that on 15 September 1991 I was the director of SONARWA, and I used the word "Tutsi" at the Nyamirambo stadium.  I believe that there is a report from the ministry of the interior to the president of the republic on that rally.  

This is what I said.  I called on our Tutsi brothers not to listen to the voices that were coming from abroad during the war.  I told the audience that we had entered a democratic era, and that all and sundry were free to raise their questions and would be listened to.  So I simply encouraged them to desist from listening to voices from abroad.  That is the only time I ever mentioned the word "Tutsi" in my speech.  I don't have any recollection of any other such incident.  

I want to say that this was not a negative statement.  I knew that the war that was being brought into our country from abroad was going to raise problems for my country and my fellow countrymen, and I wanted, in 1991, to avoid any such thing bringing a catastrophe to bear upon our country.  And that was the very first and only time that I made a public statement at a public rally in which I mentioned that word.  And any other allegation would amount to a lie.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did you -- were you ever present at a meeting, or did you ever attend any meeting or rally at which speakers referred to Tutsis as "the enemy" or "accomplices of the enemy"?  
A.	No.  There was never any mention of Tutsis as the enemy at all the rallies I attended.  You see, the Rwandan witnesses who make those allegations are simply availing themselves of an opportunity to speak to foreigners, and therefore can afford to say anything.  No one could dare make such a statement at a rally where Tutsis and ral -- and Hutus were sitting together, either as husband and wife, as wife and children, as a man and his Tutsi friend, and what have you.  It would not have been possible to make any such statement.  

The only speech, which has been challenged, and which is alleged to have made such a statement, is the Kabaya speech of 22 November.  But I was not present at that ceremony.  And may I say that the speech itself is being challenged.  I was not present at the Kabaya rally.  

For all the other rallies at which I was present, I never heard any such statement.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, maybe I would like to elicit some more detail from you by dealing with the specific rallies.  And I would like you to -- to bear in mind that you are answering or dealing with charges in an indictment, an indictment which was very succinct in terms of the -- of the rallies that allegedly -- or, rather, at which you allegedly may have been involved.  And we want to say that it might be important to cover all the rallies, even those which are not mentioned in the indictment.  

Now, let us talk about the rally of the 28th of May 1992.  Did you attend a march on that date which began at the roundabout close to Établissements rwandais and which ended up at the prime minister's office?  Were you part of that march?  
A.	Yes, I was part of that march, I attended that march.  I was present.  
Q.	Did you attend the assembly in front of the prime minister's office at the end of that march? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	During that march, during that assembly, did you deliver -- or, did you hear any speeches being delivered calling for hatred of the Tutsis and extermination of the Tutsis? 
A.	No, no.  Once again, those speeches are available, and what simply needs to be done is to read those speeches to find out what was said.  Anti-Tutsi statements were not made.  
Q.	I am referring to Exhibit P. 91, which bears the transcript of those speeches.  And I believe this is a valid document.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse, one of the Prosecution witnesses mentioned -- or, testified that during that march, participants sang out slogans for the extermination of Tutsis and their supporters.  What do you say to that?  
A.	I never heard any such thing.  
Q.	Did anyone ever tell you that they heard any such statement?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, a short while ago -- and I would rather not spend too much time on this point, which you have already dealt with, that is in relation to the unfolding of the Ruhengeri meeting of the 15th of November 1992.  My question to you is:  On that occasion, did you hear any slogans calling for the elimination of Tutsis?  
A.	No.  No.  Who could have -- who could have done so?  Who could have made any such statement before the president of the republic -- well, the president of the republic, who was the head of the party, and who stood for unity and peace?  Which militant, or which supporter could have dared to make such a statement?  That is a big lie, a very big lie by that witness.  It was not possible to do so.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, were you present in this courtroom when we projected material relating to the Ruhengeri rally?  Do you remember any songs that were sung in favour of president -- of the president, to the extent that he stood for friendship and unity between Hutus, Twas, and Hutus -- and Tutsis?  
A.	Yes, I do remember that projection, and that is correct.  
Q.	Do you remember the rally and the songs that were indeed sung in favour of that contribution towards the unity of all Rwandans?  
A.	Yes, and I have it clearly in my mind and memory.  
Q.	Would it have been possible that while singing the praises of a president who had worked for the union or unity of all Rwandans, would it have been possible for anyone at such a rally to call for the extermination of one or the other of those ethnic components of Rwanda?  
A.	Well, our party was a party of discipline and organisation.  It was not possible for such confusion to obtain in a party where people are singing the praises of the president in his efforts to bring the Rwandan people together, while others would be singing a contrary tune.  That type of confusion was not possible.  It was absolutely impossible.  It is actually revolting that anyone would make any such allegation, or any such accusation.  And I'm referring to anyone who would be honest about what they are saying.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, yet one week thereafter a disturbing occurrence is alleged to have taken place, and the Prosecutor refers at length to the speech of Léon Mugesera in Kabaya.  And I would like to ask you whether, at the time, you were aware of that speech.  
A.	Yes, I am aware -- or, I became aware of that speech.  I didn't hear it live when it was being delivered.  I learnt of the speech subsequently.  
Q.	Was that speech vetted and approved by the MRND?  
A.	No.  When the political bureau met to deal with that issue, I was abroad.  But the information that I gathered upon my return was that there was the unanimous condemnation of that -- of that speech.  The MRND, as a party, did not support Mugesera's statement.  

And Mugesera himself testified.  And I believe that I listened to his testimony by video link; it was provided to me on a DVD at the hospital where I was receiving treatment.  In my moments of calm and lucidity in hospital, I was able to listen to his testimony.  And during his testimony he gave a picture of what happened.  

And I know that the Prosecution tried to gain some points by saying that we facilitated his escape, but I think that his testimony stands.  And the MRND, in short, did not endorse or vet his speech.  
Q.	Moving on to my next question.  Now, did Matthieu Ngirumpatse, in person, defend Léon Mugesera?  
A.	No, not at all.  You see, in -- on that matter I was very firm, very strict, because that is the very word that he used in his testimony, which was given by video link.  So I took a very firm position.  
Q.	Did you subsequently use his statements for your own benefit?  
A.	That would have been impossible.  How can I disapprove of a statement, or disagree with somebody and his statements, and then subsequently use them to my own benefit?  No, that is not possible, and I did not do so.  
Q.	Did you have any conflicts in the past with Léon Mugesera?  
A.	I think that during one rally in Kigali he had attempted to take the floor, but I did not give him the floor for two reasons.  

First of all, he was not the chairman of the party in Gisenyi.  It was one Wellars, spelt W-E-L-L-A-R-S, Wellars, Banzi, B-A-N-Z-I, who was the chairman of the party.  So I never encouraged acts of indiscipline whereby people would take the floor without the authorisation of the officer in charge.  That was the first reason for which I did not give him the floor.  

And so, at that time, the second reason is that I did not know him at that time, and I did not know what he was going to say.  And I therefore used my office to stop him from speaking; as a matter of performing my duties as I had to.  
Q.	Now, for the record, Mr. Ngirumpatse, it would seem there might have been some confusion, or slip of the tongue.  You first talked about a rally in Kigali, and then went on to mention Gisenyi.  You also referred to Banzi.  But before that you had mentioned a rally in Kigali.  
A.	Yes, the president of the party -- of the MRND party in Gisenyi was Banzi, not Mugesera.  And Mugesera did not have the right to speak.  
Q.	Where did the rally take place?  
A.	In Kigali.  But he wanted to speak as president of the MRND, whereas he was vice-president in Gisenyi.  And I did not want to give him the floor in those circumstances.  
Q.	Thank you.  

Regarding that speech, Witness UB stated that members of the préfectoral committee -- 
MR. WEYL:
I will repeat and try to go a bit more slowly.  At the same time I would like to apologise.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness UB stated that, following Mugesera's speech, he himself, as well as members of the préfectoral committee of Kigali town, went to see you in order to tell you that the said speech had wronged or hurt a significant number of Rwandans.  According to UB, you replied:  "Yes, we heard the speech in question, but we couldn't do anything about it."  And the witness adds that you allegedly supported the words that were spoken because you never sought to condemn them.  What are your comments on these allegations made by Witness UB?  
A.	He lied.  I am not aware that I met the préfectoral committee of Kigali.  Furthermore, if it was a matter of getting information about any problem, there was a chairman of the MRND in the Kigali-ville préfecture.  That chairman would have come to see me on his own.  Why should he have set up such a huge delegation?  But, in any case, that did not take place.  I do not remember having held a meeting with the members of the préfectoral committee of Kigali town on that point.  No.  

I must repeat that when the political bureau discussed that matter, I was abroad.  Therefore, UB, in his profession or occupation as an international witness, tries to give some value to himself, he tries to give the impression that he's useful for something.  The ICTR owes him something, according to this witness.  The witness believes that it is thanks to his efforts or testimony that the trial -- that the Tribunal is conducting these proceedings.  That's all.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to Witness GOB, once more, Léon Mugesera was not arrested because members of the MRND party had hidden him.  And, once more, according to this witness, that is one of the reasons that led Minister Mbonampeka to resign.  Minister Mbonampeka realised that his efforts were being undermined.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Once more, GOB is wrong in his testimony, in his understanding.  It is true that there was an arrest warrant issued against Mugesera.  But he told the Court how he left.  He was not helped by the MRND.  

I would like to point out that the newspaper called Isibo, in that newspaper, a copy of which we have because it was disclosed to us, in that newspaper we have an article -- Isibo is spelt I-S-I-B-O.  Isibo, I would like to point out, was an opposition newspaper linked to the RPF, and it traces the itinerary that Mugesera followed to leave Rwanda.  For an opposition newspaper, if that newspaper had the opportunity of involving the MRND in Mugesera's escape, they would have done so.  Mugesera himself gave the itinerary he followed and the people who helped him.  And the opposition newspaper, Isibo, itself does not mention the MRND as a party that helped Mugesera to escape.  

As regards what Mbonampeka said, I do not think that was the reason.  If a minister issues an arrest warrant which he sends to the gendarmerie, and if the person escapes -- the person against whom the arrest warrant is issued is escaped, do you think the minister should resign because his arrest warrant was not executed?  In fact, he punishes those who should have executed the arrest warrant.  But I do not see why a minister should resign because his arrest warrant was not executed.  Perhaps I think there were other reasons for his resignation.  Not the failure for -- the failure -- or, rather, the fact that his arrest warrant was not executed.  

This person who is a jurist is a friend, he's the one who replaced me at the ministry of justice.  He never told me that he resigned because of the failure to exist -- or, rather, to execute an arrest warrant.  He had other problems that he himself knows, but reasons which are not linked to the escape of Mugesera.  

So, as I said, this professional witness, or this issue of professional witnesses who have formed a syndicate is of -- is an issue.  They come to tell the Court what they heard on the streets.  And what they say before this Court is not often a reflection of the reality.  It is very rare where hearsays on the streets reflects the reality.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to Prosecution witnesses, we have another rally which allegedly took place -- at least, according to Witness GOB, which took place on 29 November 1992.  According to that same witness, that is Witness GOB, before the holding of the rally, which you attended, this witness asked you what you thought of Mugesera's speech.  And he asked you that in the presence of other people like Banzi, Amandin Rugira, Callixte Nzabonimana, Thomas Kigufi.  Do you remember having participated in a discussion alongside a rally that was held in November 1992, a discussion between the persons I mentioned and Witness GOB?  
A.	That conversation never took place, and for good reason.  Because even if the witness is lying, of course they have their scheme in mind.  When the witness gave that evidence, I think Banzi had died, Amandin Rugira also had died, Kigufi was far away, and Callixte Nzabonimana had not yet been arrested.  He's currently in Arusha.  So no one knew where he was.  So therefore the witness thought that his evidence could not be verified.  

However, I believe that one of these persons stated that he did not participate in such a conversation.  So the testimony is completely false.  If Banzi had been alive, if Rugira had also been alive, we would have called them for help.  But unfortunately they are dead.  And the witness knew that.  He knew that these persons he mentioned had died.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, apart from this setting, this framework, did you declare anywhere else -- did you tell Witness GOB anywhere else that "Léon Mugesera is ahead of our plans"?  I'm quoting Witness GOB:  "Léon Mugesera is ahead or in advance of our plans."  That is what you are alleged to have said.  If you -- the witness continued and added that this was a -- known to the MRND, and that Mugesera had said that before.  Did you ever say that to Witness GOB in any occasion -- or, on any occasion whatsoever?  
A.	No.  Moreover, when he talks of a secret plan known to MRND members, does he have an idea of the number of people he's talking about?  Members of the MRND are many millions.  You cannot estimate the membership of the MRND in thousands.  No, there were millions of members of MRND.  So such a plan could not be conceived by millions of people.  So the witness, once more, told a complete lie.  

Yes, I wanted peace in my country.  I want peace in my country, and I want a general amnesty or pardon for everyone.  And during such a reconciliation meeting, I would like these witnesses to be confronted with their testimonies or statements.  If you attended such a reconciliation meeting, you will be surprised.  I would not be surprised because I know that if I returned now, the first thing these witnesses will do would come and ask me for pardon.  I know my compatriots.  These statements were never made.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness AWD testified that he was not present in Kabaya during Mugesera's speech, but that Mugesera repeated his speech at the Gisenyi stadium in his presence.  To your knowledge, did Léon Mugesera make a speech at the Gisenyi stadium after the speech he made in Kabaya?  
(Pages 27 to 35 by Kirstin McLean)















	1215H 
THE WITNESS:
	I do not think that he had the time to make another speech, because his problem evolved so quickly.  He made his speech on the 22nd of November, and I think by the end of the year he had left.  I do not remember that he spoke in a rally after the meeting in Kabaya. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness AWD also testified that he and other members of the party asked MRND leaders to take a position during that rally and that you told them that Mugesera's speech should be taken as such, because Mugesera was an influential member of the party; what do you say to that? 
A.	AWD, was a very, very, very general member of the party.  I never had the opportunity, except in huge rallies where there are thousands of people -- I never had the opportunity of meeting at a high level with this person.  He neither had access to the préfectoral committee, nor the political bureau, nor to the steering committee, nor to the national committee.  

This witness -- we could not have held a meeting together with this witness after Mugesera's speech for the good reason that when I was elected national secretary of the MRND I submitted my resignation from the position of the MRND chairman in Kigali town.  And I was replaced by Mr. Jean Habyarimana, who became chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture.  

So, if there was any meeting, that meeting would have been between Jean Habyarimana and myself and not between me and AWD.  So AWD's allegations are completely wrong.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, we heard about another rally which allegedly took place in Murambi in 1993 on a date which was not specified.  A meeting -- a rally, rather, that which took place in 1993.  According to Witness G, you chaired a meeting in Murambi in 1993.  You did so in the presence of Mr. Gatete, Mr. Kabagema, as well as other people.  According to Witness G, Mr. Gatete, in his speech, allegedly stated that the MRND Murambi commune was in a good state, and that the only problem was the Tutsis opposed to the MRND.  Do you remember having heard such words or utterances and of having approved of them? 
A.	Let us begin with the credibility of this witness, that is, Witness G.  Here is someone who is a provisional -- who is a member of the provisional committee of the Interahamwe, someone who is in Rwanda, who leaves at the same time as other people, who obtains total immunity so as not to be prosecuted, someone who obtains huge sums of money from the Office of the Prosecutor; what would he not say in order to preserve such advantages or benefits?  

Point number 2:  In 1993, as you know, this was after the RPF attack of 8th of February, rallies were suspended.  It was not possible to hold a rally in Murambi.  In any case, I would have been surprised that a rally was held or may have been held in Murambi.  
Thirdly, if Gatete was bourgmestre at the time referred to, he could not have taken the floor in an MRND rally.  He would have been sanctioned; he would have been punished immediately by the government, which government had recommended the neutrality of the local administrative authorities as well as the neutrality of civil servants.  

Therefore, I doubt such a rally ever took place, but I categorically refute the alleged utterances made by Gatete.  I believe that all these accusations, all these allegations should have, in the first place -- the first reaction should have been to take me to the site -- or, rather, to lock me in an asylum of a united people, because these are words that a head of party -- a party that cannot make and continue being in its position.  This was contrary to the constitution of party, this is contrary to my character, this contrary to my education, to my upbringing, and also to my experience in administration, but also in diplomatic circles.  

This is not the type -- this is not the type of utterance I would make.  Even if I was not the one making such utterances I would not tolerate them.  Therefore this is a frivolous, frivolous, frivolous allegation.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to the indictment, on 23rd October 1993, or around that date, you yourself, Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, as well as others, participated in a rally held in Nyamirambo stadium in Kigali.  During that rally speeches describing -- or, stating that Tutsis were acting in complicity with the enemy were made.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Who do you say is the witness who made that allegation?  
Q.	Well, maybe it is not important -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness -- the counsel.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	At this stage rather -- at that moment, rather -- or, rather, it's not a witness who says that, it is what is contained in the indictment. 
A.	That charge is wrong, that allegation is wrong.  I was not present at the rally of the 23rd of October 1993 held at Nyamirambo, I think that that is completely wrong and I believe amongst the Prosecution witnesses there are some who said categorically that I was not present at this rally. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness UB testified that it was on your order that he himself allegedly attended the said rally.  Did you order the witness to attend the rally held at Nyamirambo? 
A.	That witness doesn't have any idea of what hierarchy is -- of what supervisory authority is.  That witness had a chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture.  If there were any orders to be given or to be received, orders emanating from the party -- and I must add that the party never gave such orders.  But in any case, if such orders had to be given, they would be given by the chairman of MRND in Kigali préfecture.  So the witness would have received orders from the chairman of the party in that constituency.  

I was chairman of the party at the time.  What would be my interest to send an individual to a rally organised by other political parties?  What would be the reason for me to send a member of the party -- an individual member of a party to such a gathering, to such a rally?  Everything was registered, everything was recorded.  If you wanted to know what was happening you could tune your radio or ask for a report.  He simply lied.

The organisation of party would not allow me to give him such orders directly.  The command chain did not lead -- did not go from me to him. 
Q.	According to Witness UB, during the rally officials of political parties allegedly took the floor and said that the enemy was threatening them, was ambushing the Hutus, and they said that if Ndadaye had been killed, what happened to him could also happen to President Habyarimana.  

What's more, according to this witness, the idea was to invite political parties to collaborate and to fight the enemy.  Once again, according to UB, the enemy was the Tutsi.  The enemy were the Inkotanyis who had attacked Rwanda, and the Inkotanyis were described as being Tutsi.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Mr. President, I cannot say anything about that.  I did not attend that rally.  I do not know what was said there.  I listened to some excerpts of what was said at the rally over the radio.  The MRND as a party was not present at the rally.  I believe that that rally of the 23rd October had been convened by the MDR, and it was not for us to go and join another party, an adversary political party to begin with. We were not to go and join them at their rally.  I was to not present at the rally, therefore, I cannot say anything regarding what that witness said.  

What I heard on the radio did not contain what the witness alleges, but if that was said at the rally, well, what I would say is that I was not at the rally and therefore cannot make any comments on what is alleged to have been said at the rally. 
Q.	I will therefore move on to another rally.  I'm not going to dwell on this other rally.

Now, let us talk of the rally of 27th October 1993, a rally held at Umuganda stadium in Gisenyi.  Were you present at a rally held on the 27th of October 1993 at the Umuganda stadium in Gisenyi? 
A.	No.  No, and for reasons that I will try to explain to the Chamber.  I believe that at the beginning of our proceedings this rally was placed on the 23rd of October or something thereabout -- or somewhere thereabout.  And then later on it was placed on the 27th of October 1993.  

First of all, the 27th of October 1993, I believe that was a Wednesday.  In other words, a working day.  We can verify that later on, whether I'm right or wrong.  But what I know is that the 27th of October was a working day.  And working days in Rwanda were -- went from Monday to Saturday; Sunday was a holiday.  We could not hold rallies on working days.  There is no préfet that could have given authorisation for a rally to be held on a working day.  And I believe, as far as the MRND is concerned, we would never have allowed a rally to be organised or held on a working day, because that would have led to some excesses and disorder.  

You would try to imagine what would happen if each party could organise rallies whenever they wanted, that is, Monday, Tuesdays, Wednesday, Thursday and so on.  Nothing would happen in 
the -- rather, no work would take place in the country.  So I reiterate Wednesday -- or, rather, 27th of October was a working day and therefore it was possible to hold a rally on that day.  

Point number 3:  After the attack of the 27th -- rather, the 8th of February 1993, rallies did not take place, especially in the northern part of the country.  We talked about a demilitarized zone.  Part of that zone shared a border with the demilitarized zone and was entirely under the control of the RPF.  We were not in a position to pass by that area.  I never used that road from February 1993.  Therefore, we could not go from Kigali to Gisenyi to hold a rally during that period.  And so for security reasons, these are the three reasons which explain why I was not at that rally of 23rd October 1993, a rally allegedly held in Gisenyi.  So once more, the witness told a complete lie. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, perhaps you are aware of the difficulty regarding the date, the indictment opens a window -- or, opens a door by mentioning the 27th of October 1993, or a date around that date.  So, you have to go right to the end of your denial, even if this would assign the Defence a task which is not theirs.  So, let us talk about a date or a day around this date and go to the end of your refusal.  
A.	First of all, there is a doubt regarding the Prosecution allegation.  If there was a date -- if there was a rally on that date, then it should be known.  When you say "around that date", what do you mean?  I do not see why they should take this precaution of saying "around that date".  Those who told this, who said this to the Prosecution investigators, know the day.  And if it was not possible for them to remember the date, it was possible for them to go to Gisenyi and find out if a rally was held on that date.  They didn't do that.  So if they used the phrase "around that date", it means the Prosecution was already in doubt as regards the truth and what they said. 
Q.	But, Mr. Ngirumpatse, let us not leave anything to chance.  
A.	Very well. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	According to the indictment, on the 27th of October 1993 or around that date, the said rally at Umuganda stadium in Gisenyi brought together besides you, yourself, other people including Théoneste Bagosora, Augustin Ngirabatware, as well as other people, and as well as thousands of people.  

During the said rally you took the floor to speak against the Arusha Accords and urged participants to fight the enemy; what are your comments? 
A.	Mr. President, I could not have made such comments.  I could not have said what is alleged to have been said by me.  One, I did not attend the rally.  Two, I doubt whether the rally took place.  Furthermore, I did not have any reason to say that the Arusha Accords should be fought against, because the Arusha Accords had been signed.  

We were getting ready to receive UNAMIR and the RPF battalion later on.

I do not see in what way I could fight an agreement that had already been signed.  For what purpose, to re-negotiate the accords?  I -- I said here I came -- I said that I came here to sign the accords, so what would I be doing, withdraw my signature?  If I had not agreed with the Arusha Accords I would not have continued and signed them.  

I told you that I was not paid in my party.  The position of chairman is a benevolent position.  I had no material benefits nor political benefits nor personal benefits in occupying that post.  I occupied the position out of love for my country and my fellow countrymen.  So what would have been my interest in fighting the Arusha Accords after signing the same accords?  

I think that Prosecution witnesses should sometimes withdraw and think.  They should remember that you do not occupy the position I did occupy if you are not in your right mind, and I was in my right mind. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I have another witness, that is XBM.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	This witness is more cautious because he puts that meeting at the Umuganda stadium in Gisenyi between October and November 1993.  He sees you among the participants; he also sees Édouard Karemera; the second vice-president Kabagema; the secretary, that is, Joseph Nzirorera; Ngirabatware; Bagosora.  Apparently, you chaired that meeting, according to the witness.  Bagosora took the floor and said that he did not trust the Arusha Accords.  He encouraged the young people to undergo military training so as to be able to contain RPF attacks.  Allegedly, you supported those words or utterances; do you have any comments? 
A.	I do not believe that we held any rally in Gisenyi on that date.  The statements ascribed to me were not made if the meeting did not take place -- because the rally didn't take place.  It was not in our nature to make such utterances.  

Allow me, however, to also state that Bagosora did not attend MRND rallies.  In what capacity would he have done so?  He had no position, as such.  I do not remember what he was doing at the time -- at that time.  I don't remember clearly.  

It would have been out of place for him to be at a political party rally and go as far as taking the floor.  So that was absolutely impossible.  Those statements were never made, such a meeting, as far as I can recall, never -- or, such a rally, as far as I can recall, never took place.  So the statement is entirely false.  
Q.	I'm sorry to have to insist and refer to this litany of public rallies which are at the basis of the Prosecutor's allegations.  During deliberations a number of -- during these proceedings a number of meetings were referred to which do not appear in the indictment.  Now, there is said to have been a rally of 28 January '93; does that ring a bell?  
A.	Yes, that was a small rally held at the Kacyiru, or was it Kimihurura, one of those communal offices close to the city?  In my capacity as national secretary I had been invited to that rally, simply because I was in Kigali.  It was a local rally.  It was not a préfectoral or national-level rally.  

But, yes, I was present at that rally.  I was given the floor and I encouraged members to work for peace and unity as we usually did.  And those were the main thrusts of the speeches we delivered at that time.  So that rally actually does ring a bell.  

What I, however, disagree with is what I am alleged to have said in public or in private, alleged negative statements.  Allow me, by the way, to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to the fact that during that period the national and foreign press would have picked on those statements and condemned them as virulently as they did for Mugesera.  How could he have made such a speech in Kabaya and been the subject of prosecution by the government and yet Matthieu Ngirumpatse would make the same statements and no newspaper would report on it?  That is not possible; that could not have been possible.  So these are all fabrications in support of the Prosecutor's case.  That never existed. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, between '92 and '93 you chaired a meeting or a rally at Rwamagana -- with some 1,500-2,000 people in attendance -- with Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera as well as other MRND leaders from various préfectures and communes in Rwamagana.  Witness AWE claims that he was particularly struck by your speech in which you allegedly said that the Inkotanyi, namely, the RPF soldiers whom you referred to, as well as the Inyenzi, had attacked the country and were closing in on the city and that you said to those in attendance that they had to be careful, because they would come and see Inkotanyi accomplices.  Do you remember making any such statements in Rwamagana between 1992 and 1993, or did you hear any such statements being made by anyone whatsoever? 
A.	Mr. President, I was not at the Rwamagana rally.  On that day I had a meeting with the RPF.  Political parties had been convened to a meeting with the RPF, convened by the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General to Kigali, Mr. Booh-Booh.  

I do have evidence in alibi showing that I granted an interview to Radio Rwanda and I think this needs to enter as an exhibit.  I granted an interview to Radio Rwanda stating that I did not attend the Rwamagana meeting or rally because the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations had convened us to a meeting, although the RPF did not show up, alleging that some young persons had been arrested by the Rwandan armed forces as they went for training to Mulindi.  For that reason, the RPF was offended and the purpose of the meeting had been to look into setting up the transitional institutions.  And on that day -- and I made this statement to Radio Rwanda that for that reason it was not possible for me to attend the Rwamagana rally.  And also I was involved in a choir session that had to be broadcast over Radio Rwanda as well.  So these statements are pure fabrications.  
Q.	Allow me, however, to put the following question to you, because Witness AWE was categorical when he testified that you allegedly said that "Tutsis who are here are the accomplices of the Inyenzi", meaning that they were soldiers of the RPF, and that you told those in attendance to avoid collaboration with them and to avoid any contact with them.  

Then you said it was not all of them because some Tutsis were, however, members of our political party.  AWE goes on to testify that members of the population who had been living in harmony with Tutsis began to understand that those Tutsis had relations with the enemy of the country who had attacked the country, and that in the secteurs members of the population became wary of each other and that was the atmosphere that was created within the inhabitants of various neighbourhoods.  Did you make these statements that Witness AWE puts in your mouth at Rwamagana or at any other location? 
A.	No.  I think that the best clarification for the Trial Chamber would be for that interview on Radio Rwanda to be made available to the Trial Chamber.  I was not at Rwamagana, I could not have made any such a statement simply because I was not there. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, this document is already in exhibit as D. NZ311, pages 9 and subsequent.  It is written in Kinyarwanda and maybe we could place this document before Mr. Ngirumpatse and ask him to decipher this language, which he is in a better position to do, and then highlight and specify for the benefit of the Court those statements that were indeed broadcast over Radio Rwanda.  
Exhibit D. NZ311.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
And a K number was read out by counsel too fast, but he's seeking assistance from Mr. Issa. 
MR. WEYL:  
K number K0148852.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
By my records the document is available in French translations, so Mr. Issa should have that in his set of folders. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, after hearing counsel we have issued a decision on documents which we wanted the language unit to translate.  Is this included, do you recall?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If you give me one second, I will check.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't have this document as among those that were ordered to be translated, but I do have a French translation for it and it was admitted in evidence, because I have it in my collection of admitted exhibits. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't have it in English; I think it's only in French and the Kinyarwanda original.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, you can proceed. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, do you have that document before you and are you turned to the relevant page in relation to what you have mentioned to the Court? 
A.	Yes.  First of all, let me say that there was a mistake in the transcript.  The speaker is not Martin Ngirumpatse, it is Matthieu Ngirumpatse.  So there is a transcription problem which I would like to correct.  

"That is correct.  Yesterday evening I was brought here -- or, rather, I was given a letter from the representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations, informing me that the meeting would take place at 3 p.m.  At 3 p.m. I was ready.  I was getting ready to attend that meeting.  And it is for that reason that I was not able to attend the Rwamagana rally.  

"It is for that reason also that I did not participate in the activities of the choir.  You know that I love singing, and on Monday, there is -- on Sunday, rather, there is a Mass that will be broadcast."  

So I was ready to attend that rally with my colleagues, but I do not know what happened.  The Inkotanyi said that they would be available only at 5 p.m. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, on the issue of this Rwamagana rally I'm not sure if I'm following Mr. Weyl.  Is the suggestion that the witness was not present at the Rwamagana rally on a particular date?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am referring to the indictment and various witness statements.  That is all I am relying on, and I believe that the Prosecutor seems to forget that the onus is on him to show proof.  And I'm simply working with the materials available to me. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I asked because I'm trying to understand the question and the witness's response.  What was written to the record a second ago pertains to a broadcast of the 14th of February 1994.  So if Mr. Ngirumpatse in that broadcast is denying going to the Rwamagana rally, it's only with respect to whatever was organised on the 14th February 1994.  So, if Mr. Weyl has other information that he's putting to the witness so that we can understand what the denial entails, that would be helpful. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I don't think I can provide any further clarification.  Mention is made of locations and I'm dealing with those locations to challenge them.  Dates are mentioned and I'm dealing with those dates to challenge them as much as possible.  Now there is reference to Rwamagana and I'm trying to refute all evidence relating to Rwamagana just as I dealt with the dates.  

The Rwamagana issue was one of a rally, and a date was not mentioned.  And there was reference to a speech between 1992 and 1993.  So, I'm dealing with that situation and now Mr. Ngirumpatse has assisted us by using the material from Radio Rwanda to refute the allegations relating to Rwamagana.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, but the transcript is dated the 14th of February 1994.  So you cannot use a denial of attending a rally in February 1994 to suggest that the witness was not present at a rally in 1992 or 1993.  That's what I was trying to understand.  
MR. WEYL: 
I think these points can be raised in cross-examination and in final submissions, Mr. President.  I really don't have anything in the case file that proves that there was a specific rally in Rwamagana, apart from what Witness AWE testified to and that is how I am proceeding.  So we can deal with this either in cross-examination or in the final submissions.  

And all I know is that reference was made to Rwamagana, and Mr. Ngirumpatse has answered about Rwamagana.  Except that maybe this was in 1994 relating to Rwamagana, and there was no rally which he attended -- which Mr. Ngirumpatse attended in Rwamagana. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think we understand your position, so move on.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	This same witness, AWE, testified indirectly in relation to a meeting allegedly held at the Rebero Horizon hotel on the 28th of March 1994 and chaired by Matthieu Ngirumpatse.  Witness AWE states he was not in attendance at that meeting, but that he heard about it from the chairman of the -- from a chairman of the Interahamwe, and that according to that chairman, you allegedly chaired a meeting at the hôtel Rebero L'Horizon on the 28th of March 1994.  What do you say to that? 
A.	False.  That is false.  You see, at that time -- did you say 28th of March?  During that time we were busy attending meetings for the setting up of the institutions, so I could not have been in attendance at any such meeting.  And I'm not aware of any meeting that may have taken place at the Rebero hotel.  
Q.	Did you around that time - or, in the surroundings of the Rebero hotel or at any other location, did you chair a meeting during which some witness, who did not appear here to testify, is said to have heard you saying that the Inyenzi, the Inkotanyi or RPF soldiers were closing in on the city and that people noticed that they were killing people; namely, the Hutus.  Then police joined the Rwandan armed forces to kill the Tutsis and their accomplices.  "However, you must start by killing those who have been arrested as accomplices and are in detention."  Did you make any such statements around the 28th of March 1994 and in the neighbourhood of the Rebero hotel or on any other occasion? 
A.	No.  I never, never made any such statement.  Let me backtrack and state that Prosecution accusers, Prosecution witnesses have referred to accomplices and people who were arrested during the attacks.  But I want you to remember that these people were released following my suggestion for a general amnesty.  I am consistent in my statements and in my actions.  So these false statements, these false allegations, these false accusations, I do not know where they come from.  The simple fact is that I never made any such statement, neither in Rebero nor elsewhere.  And I am not aware of such a meeting taking place in Rebero.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  I didn't want to stop you because you seemed to on a -- quite a good momentum at the moment, but I wish to draw your attention that it's 1 o'clock. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, yes, I think I read your mind and that is what I was driving at when I self-interrupted.  I'm in your hands, Mr. President.  And I think it's time for the break.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will take our break now.  We will come back tomorrow morning and we will have a short day tomorrow.  We will work until 11:45.  Yes.
