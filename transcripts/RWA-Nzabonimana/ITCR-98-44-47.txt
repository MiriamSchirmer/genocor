        21        May we have the appearance of the parties, please, for 

        22        the record, starting with the Prosecution?

        23   MS. OJEMENI: Thank you, Your Honour.  With due respect, 

        24        Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial attorney.  I appear with Dorthée

         1        Professor Bompaka and Emilien Dusabe.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

         3        

         4        Yes.  Interpreter, could you tell Witness KNWA that the 

         5        Trial Chamber reminds him of the solemn declaration he 

         6        made yesterday, and that he will continue with his 

         7        evidence today on that same solemn declaration.  

         8   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: We can't hear the witness's 

         9        interpreter's microphone.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Learned Counsel, can you go on.  But yesterday 

        11        when we adjourned we were in closed session.  

        12   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, Your Honours.  We would urge the Court to 

        13        continue in closed session.  

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Then, we would go into closed 

        15        session to enable counsel to continue with the 

        16        cross-examination and raise questions with the witness, 

        17        even those which have a bearing on his identity.

        18        

        19        Interpreter, could you inform the witness that we are 

        20        back in closed session, so he should feel free to 

        21        mention names of people and places, even those which are 

        22        linked up to his identity?

        23   THE WITNESS: Agreed.

        24
