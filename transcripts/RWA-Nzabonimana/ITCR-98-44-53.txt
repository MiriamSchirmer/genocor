         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  The proceedings are called to order. 

         3        

         4        Could the registry introduce the matter coming before 

         5        the Trial Chamber this morning?

         6   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  

         7        

         8        Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal

        10        presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and

        12        today, Wednesday, the 11th of December 2002, for the 

        13        continuation of the Defence case, when Prosecution 

        14        Counsel, Ms. Ojemeni, will start the cross-examination 

        15        of Witness ZLA, PW23, in the matter of the 

        16        Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No.

        19        Thank you, Mr. President.  

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registry.  May 

        21        we have the appearance of the parties, starting with the 

        22        Prosecution, for the record, please.

        23   MS. OJEMENI: May it please the Court.  Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial 

        24        attorney.  I appear with Dorothée Marotine, case manager 

        25        for the Prosecution.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  May we also have 

        27        the appearance of the Defence for the record, please.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

         2        

         3        Yes, Interpreter, could you please tell Witness ZLA that 

         4        the Chamber reminds her of the solemn declaration she 

         5        made yesterday, and that she will continue with her 

         6        testimony today, on that same solemn declaration.  

         7        

         8        Yes, the examination-in-chief had just ended when we 

         9        adjourned yesterday.  So, we start with the 

        10        cross-examination of the Witness ZLA.  I don't know how 

        11        do you intend to proceed.  We are in open session.

        12   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, I will request that we go into 

        13        closed session because I would be asking questions that 

        14        might reveal -- the answers would reveal the witness's 

        15        identity.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  All right, we would go in closed 

        17        session.  For how long?  Do you have an idea, Counsel?

        18   MS. OJEMENI: It depends how the witness answers.  I guess 

        19        maybe one and half hours or so.  

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: I'm talking about closed session. 

        21   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, I think all my questions might deal on 

        22        that.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right. We'll go in closed session 

        24        to enable counsel to raise questions, even those which 

        25        have a bearing on the identity of the witness.

        26        

        27        And, Interpreter, could you, please, tell the witness 

        28        that we are going into closed session, and that she 

        29        should feel free to mention names of places and people, 

        30        even those which have a link to her identity.  The

         2        (Declaration made by Witness MLNL in French)

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Witness MLNL, you have just made a solemn 

         4        declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to how 

         5        your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few 

         6        essential elements before you begin your testimony.  You 

         7        will be led in your evidence-in-chief by the Defence, 

         8        who are seated on this side of the courtroom.  

         9        

        10        He is following in French, right?  Is that correct, 

        11        Interpreter?  Good.

        12   

        13        Thereafter, questions will be put to you in 

        14        cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on 

        15        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

        16        of you may also put questions to you to clarify your 

        17        evidence as you testify, if they will have such 

        18        questions to ask you.  If a question put to you is not 

        19        clear or you do not understand it, please say so and 

        20        such a question shall be repeated or explained.  These 

        21        are the few essential elements we want to bring to your 

        22        attention before you begin your evidence.  

        23        

        24        Right now, we are in open session.  So be careful not to 

        25        mention names of places and of people who are connected 

        26        to your identity.  If you have any problem in that 

        27        regard, please, indicate to the Trial Chamber for an 

        28        appropriate action in that connection.  Right, 

        29

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honours. 

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: We understand the witness is speaking in 

         3        French, we might be able to move faster, perhaps.  You 

         4        can confirm that, Counsel, to the witness.

         5                    WITNESS MLNL

         6             first having been duly sworn, 

         7                  testified as follows:

         9                         EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 

        10   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        11   Q.   Witness, how do you feel today?

        12   A.   No problem as far as language is concerned, especially 

        13        French, I think I understand it quite well. 

        14   Q.   Witness, how do you feel today?

        15   A.   I feel fine, no problems. 

        16   Q.   Witness, would you need at any time the use of the 

        17        translator -- the Kinyarwandan translator if you may 

        18        need something to be said in Kinyarwanda, or do you want 

        19        to dispose of him?

        20   A.   Of course, because in Kinyarwanda it is difficult to 

        21        find exactly the equivalent for everything in French, 

        22        especially proverbs and some terms -- technical terms as 

        23        such. 

        24   Q.   The question is, do you want the Kinyarwanda translator 

        25        to remain with you while you communicate in French?  

        26        That is the question.

        27   A.   Thank you. I think it would be better; it is better  

        28        that he should stay here by my side. 

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: And not only that, of course, we may have 

        30        issues of spelling of names and he might be able to be

         1        helpful perhaps in that regard.  I think he can stay 

         2        there.  We would request that the interpreter stays 

         3        there and see how far we move. 

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness, I intend to ask you most questions in open 

         6        session.  So, as the Trial Chamber had advised you, 

         7        think very carefully of the answers that you give before 

         8        you give them so that you don't reveal your identity.  

         9        There will be a stage where I will go into closed 

        10        session because I know that your testimony would be of a 

        11        sensitive nature.  Do you understand what I have said so 

        12        far?

        13   A.   Yes, I have understood. 

        14   Q.   Witness, I would like you to review a document which 

        15        contains your personal particulars.  If everything is 

        16        accurate, we would request that you sign the document 

        17        and date it and return it to me. 

        18   A.   Excuse me, I think there is a small mistake. 

        19   Q.   If there is any mistake of any type, you can make the 

        20        necessary corrections and initial it.

        21   A.   What date are we today?

        22   Q.   I think we are on 11th of December. 

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, the witness has signed and 

        24        dated the documents and made a correction on it.  We -- 

        25        the Defence would like to submit this document as 

        26        Defendant's Exhibit 43, and ask that it be sealed since 

        27        it contains the particulars of this witness, who is a 

        28        protected witness. 

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Has it been shown to the Prosecution?  

        30        Any objection?

         1   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, we need to see the correction.  

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  So, the witness has made some corrections, 

         3        but he says it is correct and he has signed it.  Is that 

         4        so?

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: The information contained therein is correct 

         6        with the correction on a date of birth. 

         7   MS. OJEMENI: No objection, Your Honour.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  And he has signed it and dated it? 

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is correct.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: So, let the document containing the personal 

        11        particulars of this witness be admitted as Defence 

        12        Exhibit No. D43, and the same shall be kept under seal

         1   A.   Yes, I did attend primary school. 

         2   Q.   And did you attend secondary school?

         3   A.   Yes, I did also attend secondary school. 

         4   Q.   Was it a specialised secondary school or just the 

         5        standard secondary school?

         6   A.   I did general studies -- secondary school studies, but 

         7        with the option of biology and chemistry. 

         8   Q.   What institutions if any did you attend post secondary 

         9        school?

        10   A.   After my secondary studies, I went to the Rwanda 

        11        National University. 

        12   Q.   And did you specialise in any particular course of 

        13        study?

        14   A.   I did agronomy.  I went to the faculty of agronomy. 

        15   Q.   Did you graduate with any degrees from that institution?

        16   A.   Having obtained my degree in general agronomy, I went -- 

        17        I nearly did a year in the same faculty, but I didn't 

        18        finish. 

        19   Q.   And what course of study were you pursuing for that 

        20        year?

        21   A.   I didn't undertake any specialisation, because normally 

        22        our faculty was divided into several options.  It is 

        23        only in the second year of the postgraduate that you 

        24        choose your specialisation. 

        25   Q.   Did you have any particular vocational interest while 


        26        you were in the first year?

        27   A.   Plant production.

        29   A.   Vegetable plant production.

         1   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: He repeats, "production vegetable" 

         2        which the interpreter believes is correctly translated 

         3        as "plant production" as opposed to "animal husbandry".

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness, when you completed your Baccalaureate degree, 

         6        were you employed in any capacity, and do not tell us 

         7        where, I just need to know whether you were employed?

         8   A.   After my degree, I wasn't employed anywhere. 

         9   Q.   Did there come a time when you left the country?   

        10        Witness, could you move closer to the microphone so that 

        11        we can hear you.  Did there come a time when you left 

        12        Rwanda?

        13   A.   Yes, I left the country. 

        14   Q.   When was the first time that you left Rwanda?

        15   A.   The first time was in July 1994, because of the war that 

        16        threatened the country.  The second time was in March 

        17        2002. 

        18   Q.   The second time you left, was it March 2002; is that 

        19        your testimony?

        20   A.   I did say March 2000 -- March 2000, excuse me.  Sorry. 

        21   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli?

        22   A.   Yes, I know him. 

        23   Q.   When was the first time that you first became aware of 

        24        Mr. Kajelijeli?

        25   A.   I met him -- the question isn't quite clear.  Please, 

        26        Counsel, could you repeat the question?

        27   Q.   When do you recall is the first time you met Kajelijeli?

        28   A.   The first time I saw him was when I was still in primary 

        29        school. 

        30   Q.   Do you know what jobs Mr. Kajelijeli held during the

         1        time that you have known him?

         2   A.   The first time he was a carpenter at Busogo parish. 

         3   Q.   Do you know what other employment he held after becoming 

         4        a carpenter?

         5   A.   After leaving the parish, I knew him to be accountant 

         6        for Nkuli commune and, thereafter, as bourgmestre of 

         7        Mukingo commune. 

         8   Q.   Do you know when he became bourgmestre of Mukingo 

         9        commune?

        10   A.   Sorry, could you repeat, please?  Excuse me.

        11   Q.   Do you know when Juvénal Kajelijeli became bourgmestre 

        12        of Mukingo commune?

        13   A.   He became bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1988, I 

        14        think. 

        15   Q.   And do you know whether or not he continued to serve in 

        16        that capacity as bourgmestre, uninterrupted?

        17   A.   At one point he left his job, he was desensitised (sic).

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: What is that?

        19   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Well, apparently he was fired, I 

        20        think.  

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Can we get the translation that --

        22   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: He was relieved of his post.

        23   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        24   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know when Mr. Kajelijeli was 

        25        removed from his post?  Do you have any idea when that 

        26        occurred?

        27   A.   He was removed in March 1993.

        28   Q.   And, Witness, do you know who replaced him?

        29   A.   After he was sacked from his job, at one point he was 

        30        replaced by the dean of the conseillers, the eldest

         3   Q.   And do you know whether or not the conseiller was 

         4        subsequently replaced by a permanent bourgmestre?

         5   A.   Yes, after the interim period, Ndisetse was replaced 

         6        officially by a bourgmestre whose name was Harerimana. 

         7   Q.   Do you know, Witness, how long Harerimana remained in 

         8        office or up to what time period he remained in office?

         2   Q.   And do you know whether or not he was succeeded by 

         3        anyone, that is Harerimana?

         4   A.   Yes, yes, he was replaced by the dean of conseiller.  

         5        Every time the eldest conseiller, every time there was 

         6        an empty seat in the bourgmestre position, he was chosen 

         7        to cover that interim to cover the position in the 

         8        interim.

         9   Q.   And do you know who succeeded him into the permanent 

        10        position?

        11   A.   After Conseiller Ndisetse Asiel -- at one point he was 

        12        replaced by an assistant bourgmestre whose name was 

        13        Semahane.  I think his first name was Felience -- I 

        14        think, but his surname was Semahane.

        15   Q.   An do you know whether or not Juvénal Kajelijeli became  

        16        bourgmestre in 1994, at any time?

        17   A.   Yes, he became bourgmestre after Semahane, Kajelijeli 

        18        became bourgmestre.

        19   Q.   Do you know how long Kajelijeli served in the position 

        20        of bourgmestre in 1994?

        21   A.   If I recall correctly, that assistant Semahane lasted 

        22        until June 1994.  And the -- after the election by the 

        23        conseiller communal assembly, Kajelijeli was elected.  

        24        And I think that was in July where he was elected 

        25        bourgmestre to replace Semahane.

        26   Q.   Now, Witness, would you be able to identify Kajelijeli 

        27        in the courtroom if you were able to see him?

        28   A.   Yes, I am able to identify him.

        29   Q.   Right, we would like you to look around the courtroom 

        30        and see if you see Kajelijeli, and describe what he is

         4   Q.   Witness, you can stand up if you want to sort of make a 

         5        better identification?

         6   A.   I see him in glasses.  He is a thick built man wearing a 

         7        blue shirt with the -- I don't know if it is a suit -- 

         8        what word would it be grey?  Grey, and a tie, brownish.  

         9        I don't see very well but it's him all right.

        24   A.   Yes.

        25   Q.   In 1994, was Kanoti married?

        26   A.   Yes, he was married at that time.

        27   Q.   And do you know the name of his wife in 1994?

         2        Valentine is a Christian name, a catholic name, a French 

         3        name, Valentine.

         6   Q.   Could we have the spelling of that second name again, 

         7        please?

         8   A.   Ayingorore, A-Y-I-N-G-O. 

         9   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: The next letter could be R-O-L, 

        10        sorry, R-O-R-E. A-Y-I-N-G.  He didn't really spell it in 

        11        letters in the -- sort of phonetic spelling.  I don't 

        12        know if you want us to interpret --

        14        interpreter, would be Ayingorore; is that correct?  

        15        A-Y-I-N-G-O-R-O-R-E. Spelling, A-Y-I-N-G-O-R-O-R-E.

         7   Q.   Now --

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour,  I think we will have to go 

         9        into closed session now because I cannot ask any other 

        10        questions without revealing the identity of the witness.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we will have to go to closed session to 

        12        enable counsel to raise questions some of which could 

        13        have a bearing on the identity of the witness, and we 

        14        regret members of the public -- and could you please 

        15        tell the witness that that we are going into closed 

        16        session.  He should feel free to answer questions even 

        17        those which concern or are linked to his identity.  The 

        18        public is excluded
