P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis C. M. Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and 
Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 13th of May 2008, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours; good morning, everyone.  I have returned as well as my trainee, Mr. Emmanuel Pire.  
MR. NIMY:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours, I am pleased to introduce our intern, intern 
Mrs. Nicole Mauskopf from New York in the United States of America, and who will be working in our team.  So, presumably, Counsel Hounkpatin was also talking about an intern.  

And, if you would allow, Mr. President, by your leave I should like to reiterate our concern with regard to Witness BTH.  You had responded that the registry would undertake investigations in that regard.  
I should like to know what stage we've reached; how far we've -- where we are with this matter.  It's a witness who was called by us who also testified before other Trial Chambers, and that's -- it's in that connection that the other incidents occurred concerning him and we are very anxious.  

We're very anxious because, in spite of what you told us about the investigations that the registry would undertake in that regard, we heard this morning over the radio on the BBC, that a member of the registry had made public statements in that regard to the extent of involving -- implicating the Defence, do you see, in this matter.  

Mr. President, that is further source for concern.  We're in a phase where the Defence is presenting its case.  Nothing should frighten all the other Defence witnesses who are due to come here.  
And BTH's case is really symptomatic in that regard.  And, really, we should like to see -- understand all this, see clearly in this matter.  And if the registry has anything, they should communicate it.  It concerns us all.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  Mr. Nimy, as soon as we receive anything in an official -- well, organised in a manner which we can communicate, we will certainly do so.  And I will make efforts to -- to ensure that I receive something as soon as possible.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  But as of now, at the present time, could you not exercise your administrative powers to ask, for example, the registry to avoid any public statements in that regard?  Where -- but to avoid putting yourselves in an embarrassing situation. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, before you answer on this specific point my colleague, Counsel Nimy, I should like to recontextualise the matter.  If the information we have received is correct -- it was the spokesman of the Tribunal -- your Tribunal, because what we need to do is remember that you are the 
President of this Tribunal whom -- so, therefore, the one whom I call your spokesman, who is your mouthpiece, has said over the radio that the Defence would be involved in the disappearance of that witness.  

Now, Mr. President, words fail me.  I can find no words to -- for the seriousness of such a statement, and if it is the one who speaks through you, who says that in public over a radio station, then you are implicated, Mr. President, on two -- from two points of view.  We know very well that you can't be behind it yourself, but you must understand it is your spokesman who goes to the radio and says, according to the information in his possession, the Defence would be involved in the disappearance of that witness.  Involved how?  To what extent, he was not able to say.  

But, Mr. President, what shocked me the most was that it -- the person who made the statement and the relations that exist between you -- your Tribunal and him -- and what he has said is extremely serious and he said it publicly.  Mr. President, I should like to -- the debate should not go outside this court.  The whole world cannot hear this over the BBC.  And we, the Defence, are -- are limited to discussing it here in the privacy of this court.  

Now you understand that the Defence, as of the moment your spokesman says it over the radio and makes such serious accusations against the Defence, you under -- well, you must understand that our response will be equivalent to what has been done.  However, before going there, Mr. President, we wish to ascertain your position on this.  Perhaps, you have clearer explanations than the -- what appears from what has been said by the one who spoke over the radio.  But I do note that it was the spokesman of the Tribunal; that the Tribunal has a President, and that the -- that is your honourable person, the President is your honourable self, sir, and I think you should speak to us.  
And whether I say it at length or whether I say it briefly, I -- I really must ask you how you think the Defence should behave ourselves -- conduct ourselves.  

I think it's a shame because you told us that there would be an investigation -- an investigation was underway and that was enough for us.  We were waiting patiently, serenely for the result of that investigation.  And now, over the BBC -- on the BBC, the spokesman allows himself to say what he said.  

Mr. President, please do understand the feelings of the Defence today, and especially the impact of what the spokesman has said.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I shall not speak at length, sir.  I merely wish to associate myself to what my learned colleagues have said, Counsel Diagne and Counsel Nimy.  It's inexcusable that the Defence in the course of its legitimate work should be referred to by a certain person in the Tribunal without your approval.  
You told us investigations are away and, somehow, we hear that a result appears to be achieved.  
I think, really, that the accusation against us should be dispelled.  Please do try and inform us as to the true situation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, we note the submissions the -- that have been made.  Obviously, we can't respond until we have some more information and we will initiate the enquiries with some degree of urgency.  

Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin, we're at the stage of the proceedings now where -- where you were to indicate whether you intended to cross-examine this witness or not - or, to examine this witness or not.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have decided neither to examine nor to -- nor to cross-examine this witness.  I have been informed of last week's proceedings and that is the decision our team has come to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you very much.  

Now, Mr. -- sorry, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
(Inaudible)
MR. MORLEY:
May I address Your Honours?  I'll sit down. 
MR. NIMY:
However, Mr. President, I do intend, for my own part, to put two questions to the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
Before we get to that, may I address Your Honours, basically, on what is a matter of law?  It's a matter for Your Honours as to whether the witness stays in the witness box presently.  It may not matter very much.  But I am a little concerned about the position with regard to the Ngirumpatse team.  
My learned friend, who, unfortunately, was not present in court last week when Mr. Weyl was present, has the disadvantage of arriving in court today not knowing what it was that was said last week -- although, of course, my learned friend has access to transcripts.  

What was put forward in light of what Mr. Weyl was saying last week was the opportunity for the Ngirumpatse team to examine this witness on the occasion of his being before Your Honours presently, because Mr. Weyl made it clear that it is the Ngirumpatse team's future application that this witness would be called as part of the Ngirumpatse defence.  And in light of that, Mr. Weyl was suggesting that it would be inappropriate for any cross-examination to be offered at this stage by the 
Ngirumpatse team, which led to some legal discussion. 

And Your Honours will recall that in light of the discussion, it was suggested at the initiation of the Prosecution, that if the Ngirumpatse team are minded to apply to recall this witness in order to present him as a Defence witness in their own case, an exception might be made to the fact that the witness is presently in the witness box, so that the Ngirumpatse team could interview him over the weekend.  
And, therefore, be in a position to present him either by way of cross-examination or examination-in-chief, as part of their presentation so that we avoid, firstly, an application to recall him; and secondly, the expense of simply bringing a witness back who is otherwise before the Court.  
I mention all of this to help my learned friend, Ms. Hounkpatin, who I imagine is au fait with what happened on Thursday, but perhaps some of what I'm saying brings the matter into sharper focus.  

I am, shortly after Mr. Nimy, about to embark on a cross-examination of this witness, which will touch upon the relationship of the MDR and the MRND -- as much of the history was related between 
1992 and 1994.  And much of what I will be touching upon may, indeed, reflect on the overall leadership of the MRND, which includes all three defendants.  

It's my respectful submission that if my learned friend for the Ngirumpatse team does intend to apply to recall this witness, that what should take place at this stage is that, in fact, we adjourn for my 
learned friend, before my cross-examination begins, to have an opportunity to speak to the witness as an exceptional circumstance.  And then we can proceed with the witness without need later to consider applications to recall and the expense of recalling the witness.  
So, in short, it's my respectful submission to Your Honours that if the matter is left as it presently is, namely, no cross-examination offered of this witness by the Ngirumpatse team, that is it with regard to this witness.  And what should not happen is that later, there is an application to recall him.  And with regard to the length of an adjournment, I would anticipate, for example, that the witness could be seen overnight or perhaps over the course of two nights and be back in the witness box on Thursday.  
So that is my invitation to Your Honours.  

The matter should not simply lie in the way that it does presently.  If there really is an application forthcoming later to recall this witness, when he's already before Your Honours, and there is an offer for him to be examined by the Ngirumpatse Defence so that he can be presented while he's here presently, it makes no sense at all.  I hope the point is clear. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I thank my learned friend, Counsel Morley, for his concern -- the concern he has shown to explain to me exactly what happened during my absence at the end of last week.  However, we had understood the same thing and I decided that in the conduct of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's defence, that at this stage I would neither examine nor cross-examine the present witness.  And a decision -- a ruling of the 
Trial Chamber of the 17th of April springs to mind in which the Trial Chamber ruled that the Prosecution in its cross-examination of the Defence -- of the co-accused could not put questions, unless they flowed from the examination-in-chief or unless the co-accused had also examined the witness.  At the time I had neither decided to recall the witness, and it is -- and I can and will decide either to examine the witness or not examine the witness, as is indeed my stand at this moment.  And in the -- the Prosecutor, in their cross-examination, should deal with matters covered in examination-in-chief and not go fishing in other waters.  

I would remind you that it is up to each Defence to be master of its own -- the way it presents its defence and not to be dictated what to do by someone else.  I hope I have been clear, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
I thank my learned friend for the helpful observations.  To distill it, it would appear that my learned friend is saying that no decision has been taken as to whether to apply to recall this witness, but that for the moment, there'll be no cross-examination offered.  

I simply flag up for the attention of Your Honours that if there is a future application to recall this witness, Your Honours may anticipate it will be resisted by the Prosecution in light of the fact that to deal with the witness could have and can take place now.  And I hope that's plain.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think that we'll rise for a few minutes to consider our response.  

We rise for a few minutes.  
(Court recessed from 0927H to 0933H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think that the status conference that we had planned to hold at the end of this week's session, it may be more practical for us to do it now, before we address this particular issue.  

One of the preliminary steps to that conference was the management of the ex parte applications with regard to modification of witness lists.  And we have decided to hold an ex parte conference with the Defence teams involved before making our ruling on this matter.  And last week, when we had our meetings with Mr. Weyl, we requested that it be dealt with when Ms. Hounkpatin arrived this week, and he promised to have her fully briefed.  

So what we would like to do now is to rise, have our ex parte conference with the Ngirumpatse Defence team.  I imagine that should last not more than half an hour, and thereafter we come back into Chambers and hold a status conference on matters which relate to the further management of the case, scheduling for the next trial session and related matters.  So we will rise now.  

I suppose, Mr. Witness, none of this is of direct relevance to your testimony so you'll probably be excused for at least an hour, maybe a bit more before we -- we would need you again.  But we will -- we will rise now and invite -- yes, Ms. Hounkpatin? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I understand that you would like to hold an ex parte meeting with one team only or would you like the entire Defence? 

Mr. President, you will understand that we are in somewhat a delicate situation here.  We are aware of the fact that we are involved here in a joint criminal enterprise.  This is what we're covering.  But we also have to guarantee the individual defence of the various accused present here, and we would like to remind you of this jurisprudence in which the indictment is actually tied.  So this ex parte meeting of the entire Defence seems to me to be fair.  

I'm very honoured that you are inviting me alone to have a discussion with you; however, I would like for the two partner teams of the Defence to also be present at this meeting.  And I believe that this will allow us to move forward towards the status conference.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says Counsel Hounkpatin. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, you're perfectly at liberty to invite them; we have no objection to that.  We were responding to the fact that you filed an ex parte motion and it was really in honour of the fact that you made the request for an ex parte adjudication.  So we -- we, however, were just dealing with your motion, but if you wish to invite the other Defence teams to participate, you have our permission to 
do so.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, something might have come past me.  Following an order issued by the Chamber, I filed an ex parte list of witnesses via a motion.  And in my absence, Counsel Weyl might have requested an ex parte meeting with you; I do not know.  However, this ex parte meeting is very welcome, but I do not believe that we had requested one in order to shed light on the position of Ngirumpatse's Defence team.  However, the meeting that you are suggesting at this moment in time, we gladly accept, 
Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Well, then, we will rise now and the registrar will announce our resumption for the status conference.  
I would rather imagine it will be in approximately 30 -- 30 to 45 minutes.  

Yes, Mr. Morley.
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, I was standing, Your Honour, the usual courtesy -- you seemed to be addressing me, so I stood up. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.  

Yes, Mr. Witness, you wish to say something? 
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Witness.  

The witness turned his microphone off again, unfortunately.  
THE WITNESS:
Much obliged, Mr. President.  Now, the discussions do rather concern me in the sense that the argument advanced by the Prosecutor is of importance in terms of cost incurred upon the Tribunal when calling me or recalling me.  

However, I just wanted to say that if I were to have to stay for three further days, I will also be losing costs, because I had a certification from my construction site that was underway.  So, of course, this could be even more serious for me to come back again, because I came here last time supposedly for one week of duration, but I stayed for an entire month.  However, had they organised themselves properly, I would not have had to stay for such a long time.  

I am taking in mind -- you are bearing in mind that there are costs incurred upon the Tribunal, but I also believe you should take into account that I had organised my programme.  I have already been -- I lost two days because I was given a wrong ticket.  So, Mr. President, I would also like you to bear in mind my costs because I would also like to be freed as soon as possible.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness, and I trust that everybody has heard what you've said.  

We will rise now.

JEAN-MARIE VIANNEY NKEZABERA (continued),
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness XTL, good morning.
A.	My name is Nkezabera.  Forgive me, but good morning, nonetheless 
Q.	Witness XTL, or Mr. Nkezabera, good morning.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	I am Counsel Nimy, co-counsel for Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, and I have two questions to put to you.  

Witness XTL, you are -- you were in the MDR party.  Do you know Mr. Christopher Mfizi, Mfizi spelt as Mike, Fox, India, Zulu, India, M-F-I-Z-I? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  But, please, I'd like you to drop that nickname you stuck on me.  My name is Nkezabera.  I wish to testify as Nkezabera, not as an anonymous person.  And I do know 
	Christopher Mfizi. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nkezabera.  How do you know him? 
A.	Is there something I didn't catch?  
Q.	That is possible.  I was asking how you knew him or how did you come about to know him? 
A.	Christopher Mfizi, I have known him since the '70s when we were studying together in Belgium.  He was a friend.  We continued to see each other back in Rwanda.  He was the director of ORINFOR, the Rwandan information office, for quite some time, in fact, until the advent of the multiparty politics.  However, throughout that period, he was also the government spokesman and took part in cabinet meetings and in the meetings of the MRND central committee.  At the time of the advent of the multiparty politics, especially in the period April to July 1992, the first multiparty government was instituted.  The ministry of information was -- the portfolio was given to the MDR party.  And after that, Christopher Mfizi changed parties and joined the MDR.  I think that is an adequate summary of his political itinerary. 
Q.	He changed parties, you say, Mr. Nkezabera, and joined the MDR.  Why? 
A.	My analysis -- I even said so at the time, the fact that he changed parties just when the MDR inherited the ministry of information, the ministry in charge of the radio and the press -- written press, whereas 
	He -- before he hadn't been in charge of running all that.  He changed because he'd lose his job.  And when he came, he came with a document, a very poetic document in Kinyarwanda on a term that we use in our meetings, "the Akazu".  

So he came with this document, as Gasana did some weeks later with his document on the Interahamwe.  So, Mfizi changed because he was losing his job.  And he came with a document to justify or assist his participation in the party, his joining the party.  
Q.	Do you remember any other contributions of Mr. Mfizi in this line of thought, that is to say, entering the MDR party by proposing gadgets?  
A.	In his document, he made mention of the Akazu.  He called it the Zero network.  However, in this document, he went further than we did, because, for us, the Akazu, when we coined this term, was just a political slogan which was aimed at the entire entourage of the president of the republic.  So it was just a slogan to bring this entourage down, if you like.  However, he went on to add the term 
	réseau zéro, Zero network, in French.  And the Kinyarwanda term for this, which is deeper in sense than ours, Akijurununga, A-K-I-J-U-R-U-N-U-N-G-A.  And in his definition, he included the fact that the réseau zéro also comprised death squads, providing no evidence thereof.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nkezabera.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to request that the registry clerk, Mr. Issa, provide us with the assistance in producing P. 310, Exhibit P. 310, that is.  
MR. MORLEY:
If I can assist my learned friend, I think he is looking for P. 311.  
MR. NIMY:
I apologise, Mr. President.  That is, indeed, the case.  And I would like to thank my learned friend, 
Mr. Morley, for that.  

I would like to request that you present this document to the witness. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Message from the English booth, Mr. President.  If these documents are to be read from, we would please like to have a copy.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy?
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have an extra copy for the language booth? 
MR. NIMY:
I might request that the court clerk help me in order to provide such a copy, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I can distribute, at this stage, my bundle of documents of cross-examination.  And it has within it the relevant document which is presently at issue.  That will mean that the interpreters can have two copies, and I will tell Your Honours the page reference within the bundle.  

With the assistance of Mr. Issa -- for the interpreters.  
And then, again, Mr. Issa, if you can assist Defence Counsel and Their Honours, and then come back to me, please.  

For the assistance of Your Honours and my learned friend, the document is in my bundle at page 38 in English and page 48 in French.  

For Mr. Issa, there is a one-sided copy for the registry, and the document can be put in front of the witness.  It is pages 38 in English through 48 in French.  So, that is pages 38 to 64, please.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Nkezabera, did you happen to glance over the document? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Please refer to page 50 to 51 of this document.  Do you have it before you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The French part of the document to the left-hand side, please consult the sentence beginning with 
	"ces ci ont."  

Have you found this? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Have you read through the excerpt? 
A.	Yes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreter has not found the section so that she should translate. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	These people have, for a number of years --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I have found it, and I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  You can continue now.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So I shall start again.  You take the section of the document beginning with the sentence "ces ci ont."  In English, "These people or this party has for a number of years now" -- this is Mr. Mfizi talking here.  He is saying, "They have formed what I refer to the réseau zéro, that is to say, a group of people."  Have you read from this passage? 
A.	Yes, I have.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness, without observing a pause.

BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	What is your comment thereon? 
A.	My comment is the same I made when we initially cast our eye over this document.  I said that Mfizi was not in a position to say such a thing, except that he said, as I said, this in order to be well seen within the MDR party.
Q.	And why was it that he was not in a position to say such a thing?
A.	Well, I am making reference to what he refers as a few years earlier, that is to say, the beginning of 
	the 1980s.  A journalist wrote an article which was against the cult, the personality cult, which was installing itself around President Habyarimana in Rwanda, and this article was entitled, "Kwambazamutagetsi Nukunurura," and therein he was asking himself the question -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, what the witness just said was very much out of context and would need to be repeated, if he is referring to the article and the title. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreters did not get what you just said, and we would request that you repeat your answer.  
THE WITNESS:
What I was saying was that a translation of this title in French would be more or less as follows:  Somebody who is supposed to be a chief, is this not losing him in the process?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction from the booth.
THE WITNESS:
"To praise a chief, is that not losing him in the context?"  

A few weeks after, Mfizi answered the article in the state newspaper Imvaho, I-M-V-A-H-O, with the title in Kinyarwanda -- a lengthy sentence.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if the witness wants to quote a lengthy Kinyarwanda sentence, I believe he should spell it, for the purposes of the record, or have it interpreted from Kinyarwanda.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a concern -- I am not quite certain how to translate that and to advise the witness.

Madam Interpreter, perhaps you can help me again.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I believe that he is quoting a title or a sentence and, if so, we'd need to spell it or we can have the full interpretation from the Kinyarwanda booth.  We are not quite sure what to do.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
Mr. Witness, there is a problem in reporting you.  The English translator has suggested that you might be quoting something in Kinyarwanda.  And they request that, if you do that, you could spell it.  If you are quoting a title into Kinyarwanda, you could spell it, and that would facilitate their work.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I shall do so.  

So the article is -- and I shall spell the first word H-A-R-Y-A, second word, K-W-A-M-B-A-Z-A, third word, U-M-U-B-Y-E-Y-I, fourth word, N-I U-K-U-M-U-R-O-H-A.

Now, this title itself is biased in the sense that the journalist had talked about praising a chief.  Mfizi, himself, is claiming that the journalist said or talked about praising the father, the father of the nation, I suppose.  His article came to the conclusion -- or came to this conclusion, that is to say, that he, in seeing what Habyarimana had done, was ready to praise him until kingdom come.  And this is why I said -- well, I have forgotten one detail.  

After this article, Mfizi did everything possible to make sure that he, who had written this article, and those who had taken his place or taken on from him in the other newspapers -- he made sure that these journalists were rid of their positions.  And it is from this moment in time that the newspaper, Umuryango, Watrafipro, U-M-U-R-Y-A-N-G-O, second word, W-A-T-R-A-F-I-P-R-O -- and it was from this moment in time that this newspaper gradually ceased to circulate.  So not only was Mfizi ready to praise the leader, but he was also persecuting the freedom of the press.  

And this is why I said that he was not in the position to be able to utter such a sentence and that if the réseau zéro existed, then, he really was one of the co-figures of that network himself.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nkezabera.  Can I, therefore, conclude, that is, for the attention of the Trial Chamber, and can you confirm this fact to me, that with reference to this réseau zéro or Zero network imagined by Mfizi, does this mean that the MDR did not believe in it? 
A.	We did not believe in it.  We had our own definition, which, with regard to the Akazu, we described it as the political entourage of the time which continued to help President Habyarimana and at that moment in time was a considerable political adversary for us.  And I can add that at that moment in time, because the multiparty government had already been set up, President Habyarimana's powers had seriously reduced. 
Q.	Much obliged, Mr. Nkezabera.  I would put it to you, therefore, that the reference made by Mr. Mfizi to this alleged Zero network, or réseau zéro, was really the price that he had to pay in order to be accepted into the fold of the MDR and be given an important position.  
A.	It is not only this paragraph.  It is the entire article.  It wasn't even necessary to write all of this in order to be accepted within the MDR.  To my mind, an individual who has remained within the system for a long time, that is to say, involved in personality adoration or cult, that is to say, by virtue of his editorials over the national radio or in the official newspapers, by virtue of his personality, he carried on in the same vein in order to gain access to the MDR.  So this document is not ours.  It is a document, I am afraid, that is one of a brown-noser.  Please excuse the term.  
Q.	This is Mfizi behaving as an opportunist.  Can you confirm this fact?  
A.	That is the correct word.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Nkezabera.  And you have no doubt heard mention made of the Loch Ness monster, that is to say, the monster that everyone talks about, but nobody has ever seen rear its ugly head.
A.	Indeed.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness -- Mr. Nkezabera, that is.  I apologise. 

I have one last question for you.  And we made mention of this at an earlier stage, that is to say, with reference to Mr. Anasthase Gasana.  You said that you knew Mr. Anasthase Gasana, did you not?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	In brief, could you please talk to us about this, very briefly, that is? 
A.	I came to know Gasana because he was an important personality at the time of the MRND as a single political party.  So he was the chairman of the political committee.  So, in brief, he was the most important of the commissioners.  

Later, with the advent of the multiparty politics, I would say that in the interim he, I believe, took part in the synthesis committee which gave rise to the institution of multiparty politics, then gave rise to the institution of the multiparty government, and he was still a member of the MRND party.  However, during the period of April 1994 to approximately July -- no, I am talking about 1992, until July 1992 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
And at that moment in time, the new ministers of all the parties -- the new ministers were setting up their ministerial cabinet.  And he soon realised that they would not -- or he would not be reintegrated within the MRND cabinet.  So he immediately then opted for the MDR party, which was, it should be noted, the most important political party, of the new political parties, that is.  It was the largest party.  He became the minister of foreign affairs after the plot against the MDR party, where the MRND and the president of the republic were supporting Twagiramungu, T-W-A-G-I-R-A M-U-N-G-U, against the MDR.  

Gasana was again minister for foreign affairs in the Twagiramungu government; this time after the RPF took power, and then became Rwandan ambassador to the UN.  When he was sacked -- and then he stayed in the USA in exile.  I won't come back to the letter he wrote to the president, but -- then the president, in which he said he had been a member of the RPF since 1992, in which case that means he would have been at that time a member of the three political parties.  

To conclude, he is a highly talented opportunist.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Nkezabera.  You have made quite a faithful reflection of his political itinerary.  But he was advisor to the scientific commission and not chairman of the political commission.  But that's just a minor detail and it doesn't change much.

So, coming back to this gentleman who lands in the RPF -- in the MDR, what did he bring?  We spoke of Mfizi who brought the Loch Ness monster.  And what did Gasana bring you? 
A.	At the time, I remember I was arriving from Brussels, he'd held a rally in the national stadium.  Moreover, he spoke to me about the rally.  I saw Twagiramungu in the same week, and I said to him:  "This fellow that you brought, you will regret it."  Because I had also just seen the document which he had brought in which he described how the Interahamwe were organised and how they functioned.  And in his case, that was his -- that's what he brought along to be in the party's good books.  But what we knew was that he had taken part in the attempts to set up the MRND youth wing at the time of the one-party system.  And that's what he brought along whilst sticking in a few things of his own invention.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would like to reiterate your last sentence, while adding things of his own invention.
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, could you please show the witness Exhibit D. NZ117.  I hope this time I have got the exhibit number right.  D. NZ117. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, that is the correct exhibit reference.  

And for Your Honours' assistance, in the bundle it is page 5 in English, page 22 in French.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, give the witness the French version.  Be careful in that regard. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have the document before you, Mr. Nkezabera? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you recognise this document as being the one that Mr. Gasana produced? 
A.	Well, I see here it is entitled the document -- "Working document for the MDR".  Because we had four that just escaped me, so I wondered whether it was an official document, but it isn't.  
Q.	Please turn to page 32 of the document.  I believe it is the last page of the document.  
A.	My last page is number 31.  
Q.	Where it is written "Kigali, 14th of May 1992 by Doctor" -- you see the name there? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Is that him? 
A.	Yes.  But what surprises me is that in May 1992 there wasn't as yet an MDR politburo which spoke of the national committee for the rebirth and renewal of the MDR, and that was until the first MDR congress, which was held, if I remember correctly, at the end of August 1992.  So, he wasn't a member of the MDR politburo.  And, in my opinion, he wasn't even a member of the MDR national committee.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nkezabera.  But this is his document.  
A.	Yes, indeed, it is his.  It's the one I know.  
Q.	So perhaps this is the position he was after in the MDR.  One must understand it, his psychology.  But it is the same document.
A.	Indeed.  
Q.	Mr. Nkezabera, when you look at this document and the commentary you made, could I put it to you that once again we are faced with a purely opportunist move by Mr. Anasthase Gasana selling the MDR a second Loch Ness monster? 
A.	That is not a suggestion.  It's my personal conviction.  
Q.	So you confirm before the Trial Chamber that this document on the Interahamwe Za Muvumo, the (French spoken) unvanquishable is, once again, a Loch Ness monster concocted by Mr. Gasana in his effort to obtain a position in the MDR? 
A.	Doubtless.
MR. NIMY:
Well, I think, Mr. President, we are -- we have all been enlightened in respect of the witness's answer to my two questions.  I have finished.  Thank you.  And I thank the witness for having so fairly answered with such precision my precise questions.  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  I was just consulting on my mathematical skills in identifying just how much two was.  

Mr. Morley. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The day-to-day running of the MRND was controlled by the executive bureau of the MRND; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	I suppose, but rather, by the committee director, which should be the steering committee, if I remember the statutes.  
Q.	The significant day-to-day influence over the MRND was wielded by the president, the vice presidency and the national secretary of the party.  That would be right, wouldn't it? 
A.	I would say that contrary to the MRND first version, they controlled the daily running of the party, but the most important organ for the MRND was their national congress at that stage. 
Q.	Yes, but the daily running of the party was in the hands of the people I have described; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I have just said they ensured the day-to-day management, but without forgetting that, as I remember it, the politburo, also the second body, would meet practically every week.  So decisions were not made solely by the steering committee.  
Q.	You knew the three defendants in this case, Karemera, Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Would you describe them as able administrators? 
A.	Well, when the party members selected them, it's because they had confidence in them.  To say that they were competent -- well, I would say, in view of the rise of the MDR, in particular, they did not know how to contain our thrust.  
Q.	I am not talking about the MDR yet.  From your knowledge of these three men, would you describe them as incompetent or highly competent administrators within a political party? 
A.	Well, it is difficult for me to analyse them without taking account of my political allegiance and the political context of Rwanda as a whole. 
Q.	That's not really an answer.  You were on the political scene.  The MDR was notionally an opposition party.  You would have been familiar with its existence and its structure and the way it was being run, as it was what you were having to meet.  So I am asking you, from your knowledge of the three men, would you describe them as worthy adversaries in an opposition party, highly competent administrators, or would you say they were incompetent, very useless of their jobs?  
A.	As to the opposition -- that was us -- well, now as to their management of the party, the MRND, I can say that if they hadn't managed it as they did, everybody would leave or would have left.  So they did know how to transform a party which, as I said last week, which is the only one in the world that I know of where the presidency was the main organ of the party and not the congress, and they succeeded in transforming it into a democratic party.  
Q.	Would you expect that the leadership of the party would consult with each other and inform each other of the -- of their individual activities so that there is cohesiveness to the leadership?
A.	With what was going on in Rwanda, they were obliged to do so if one wished to take part in multiparty politics, because anyone who joined the party, if he found that he had no voice, he might then turn to another more democratic party.  
Q.	Thank you.  You would not expect, would you, within the executive bureau of the MRND, any of the 
	four principal members to be uninformed about the activities of their colleagues within the same office; it's fair, isn't it? 
A.	When I look at the way political parties operated in Rwanda, it would have been difficult.  That would have been difficult.  
Q.	You helpfully told us that, to the credit of the three men in this Court, they managed to ensure that people did not leave the MRND when the era of multipartyism came about.  One of the difficulties which arose for the MRND was that there were youth groups trying to steal each other's members into the new parties which were being formed.  And it is right, isn't it, that as a result of that, another youth group was formed, which was the Interahamwe, the youth group associated with the MRND? 
A.	Those are many questions to answer.  But I wouldn't say that they succeeded in avoiding people leaving the MRND.  When they set up the MRND Mark II, they organised a constituent assembly, as we did four days before them.  And afterwards, they democratically elected those who wanted to stay in MRND Mark II.  In fact, they had to sign up, whereas in the old days, anyone was automatically a member.  As to the Interahamwe youth wing, what I know about that is, they were set up rather precipitously, in my opinion, for the following reasons:  At the MDR Kigali-urban level, seeing all the young people -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, your microphone.  Mr. President, excuse me, sir.  

Mr. President, your microphone, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, just before the break, we may get a statement from the representative of the registry.  So when you reach a convenient time in your examination, we will do that.  
MR. MORLEY:
I have reached it.  The witness didn't quite complete his answer and I can revisit when we come back after luncheon adjournment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
(Pages 9 to 18 by Sithembiso Moyo)











1230H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are about to address an issue.  You may have heard about it briefly, but we think we should do it privately.  

And so we would ask the registry that he be excused until after lunch. 

I remind you, as I did before, that you're not to discuss your testimony with anybody during this adjournment.  

The witness is excused now.
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we think -- we don't know exactly what report we're going to get, but we have the 
registrar -- registry has decided to respond orally to our request for information relating to the matter raised this morning concerning Witness BTH.  And we think that, in light of the sensitive nature about it, we don't know if there are -- I don't know, as yet, if any information affecting his identity may be involved in what has been reported.  And I think it will be safe for us to go into closed session, initially, as we get the report from the registry. 

So, let us go into closed session now, and immediately after, invite the Deputy Registrar to provide information on the matter that has been raised. 

(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 20 to 24] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Page 19 by Lisa Smith)












MR. PRESIDENT: 
We now have a representative from the registry, the Deputy Registrar, who would make a statement on certain submissions made this morning made by Defence counsel relating to Witness BTH.  
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I appear here because I understand that this morning various representations were made in your Chamber concerning the alleged disappearance of Witness BTH, who had given evidence before this Chamber in this case.  

What I can tell you is this:  That Witness BTH, subsequently, after his appearance here, proceeded to give testimony in another case, and that, as a result of things that were said to him, his testimony was held over to another date for him to become acquainted with the provision of rules -- the rules, in particular, Rule 91.  And that on a subsequent evening, before he had given his full testimony, he disappeared from the safe house where he was lodged.  Let me make it clear that he was a free person, under no form of restraint or detention whatsoever, and that he was under a protection order, which meant that he was protected against others -- against the outside world.  

But, as this Chamber knows, if a witness who is a free person wishes to change the conditions of his residence in Arusha, he -- although well-advised to ask the Chamber to change, to vary the protective order -- cannot be restrained from having his liberty, subject to the immigration provisions of Tanzanian law.  

In this particular instance, the witness left the safe house at some particular time during the night, and his whereabouts are, at this time, unknown.  He did leave a number of communications to the registry relating to the payment of some money.  But, apart from that, it was the position of the registry that his disappearance from the safe house was apparently voluntary.  And at this particular moment, he is being looked for in the Arusha area.  That's as much as I would say about the facts.  

As I understand it, some report was made upon the BBC, allegedly, to the effect that sources in the Tribunal were blaming a particular group, or particular parties, and I wish to make it absolutely clear that this comes as a surprise to the registry, that the investigations do not focus in any way upon the parties, or upon any people involved in any of the cases, and that the investigation continues, and that I will personally ensure, when I'm given further information, that we check with the BBC the content of this report, and should it give rise to concern, it will be corrected.  And, further, the spokesperson intends to address the press on the matter in the next 24 hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell.  

Well, I hope that this assists in clarifying the matter.  

And we can now take our luncheon adjournment.  We will resume at 2:30. 
(Court recessed from 1258H to 1448H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  You may continue, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The Interahamwe was controlled by the MRND; that's right, isn't it?  

Microphone, please. 
A.	Before the lunch break, I believe that I had not completed answering the question regarding the birth of the Interahamwes.  I was narrating how, within MRND in Kigali city -- I beg your pardon, MDR in 
Kigali city, after seeing that there were young people who were working -- some were not working, but there were many in Kigali city.  And MDR decided to advise those youths so that the youths could create an association of MDR youths so that they could be advised on how to form trade cooperatives, or professional cooperatives.  So they formed the association and filed their statute with the relevant ministry, and they were registered.  Having said that, it was the only party, youth wing, which was officially recognised at that time.  

On the 25th of September 1992, we organised a rally at the Remera national stadium.  At that time, the youth movement, which had just been registered, paraded at the rally, and their procession was very successful.  It was from that time onwards, when people saw the success of the youth wing of MDR, the other parties started establishing their own youth wings.  That is why earlier on I said that maybe the Interahamwe was founded in haste.  We have to say that at that time there was a continuous competition between the parties, and that each party wanted to do better than the other parties.  
Q.	The Interahamwe was controlled by the MRND; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	According to my experience, since there were many problems in Kigali city, I -- and I often had to intervene with the public prosecutor's office.  So, according to my experience, I realised that if, initially, the Interahamwe, or Interahamwes, looked like -- well, actually, young people who were providing cultural entertainment at MRND rallies.  And as time went on, and -- when we entered 1993, 1994, many groupings, small groups, that is, calling themselves Interahamwes, started getting out of the control of the party -- party leadership.  
Q.	The Interahamwe became a militia; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	I do not know whether the majority of Interahamwes became militiamen.  I cannot say that.  However, as I said, there were uncontrollable small groups with -- which we had often to deal, because they conducted themselves like soldiers -- wayward soldiers.  

But, as I said, I left Rwanda in April, and before that time, I had never seen Interahamwes carrying weapons.  Even those groupings, I never saw the small groups with firearms.  
Q.	All right.  Although you weren't in Rwanda after the 4th of April of 1994, do you accept that after the death of the president, there was a slaughter of hundreds of thousands of unarmed Tutsi civilians throughout Rwanda?  
A.	Not only hundreds of thousands of Tutsis, but hundreds of thousands of Hutus, as well.  The country had become uncontrollable, and it was not under control.  In a country which had just come out of strong government rule without a president, without a prime minister, without an army head, and then with the infiltrations taking place at that time, the country was in total chaos.  
Q.	Kambanda, he was in the MDR; isn't that right?  
A.	It is true.  
Q.	And was he somebody who you knew personally, reasonably well? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And you're aware, are you, that he has pleaded guilty to genocide before this Tribunal?  
A.	Could I say what I really think regarding his arguments?  
Q.	Well, I'm not particularly interested in those at the moment.  I just want to be clear that you are aware that your MDR member, Jean Kambanda, pleaded guilty to genocide before this Tribunal.  And it's right, isn't it, that he was the prime minister of the interim government?  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	What I acknowledge is that -- and after following closely many trials before this Tribunal, for example, in this case in which I'm testifying, in respect of this case, I was contacted by the Defence team about three years ago, and since I was following the case, I know very well that Kambanda did not have a lawyer up to two weeks prior to the commencement of his trial.  His wife, who lives somewhere in 
	Africa -- 
Q.	You've put forth the idea that the country was in chaos.  You weren't in the country, you were abroad.  I just want to establish on the record that a colleague of yours, somebody you worked with politically in your party, you are aware, has pleaded guilty, as the prime minister of the interim government, to the crime of genocide, irrespective of your opinion on that.  That's right, isn't it?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Objection.  Objection, Mr. President.  To the contrary, the witness is telling the Prosecutor that it is a known fact Kambanda was not treated fairly, and he was going to testify on how Kambanda was mistreated, or unfairly treated, before this Tribunal.  

So -- but the Prosecutor did not want to allow the witness to express himself on the record regarding what he knows about the former prime minister's plea of guilt.  So, he should be allowed to say what he knows about Kambanda's guilty plea.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I respectfully disagree, Your Honours.  I'm not asking him for his opinions on whether or not Mr. Kambanda should have pleaded guilty, I'm asking him for his stated knowledge that he has to genocide as the prime minister of the interim government.  And the question arises simply out of the last answer, which suggested that although the witness wasn't in the country, he can speak to the chaos which was in the country.  Respectfully, we don't need to go into this witness's labyrinthine opinions about what Mr. Kambanda may or may not have thought.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
The witness is saying that the guilty plea was, basically, more or less, pressed out of him.  And that is what was on the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We think both things:  We think the witness ought to answer this question specifically about his knowledge, but we think he ought to be allowed to give a comment.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Very well.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, the events which occurred in Rwanda cannot be easily categorised as black or white.  When the Prosecutor is telling me that, "Mr. Kambanda, a member of your party, said this," it's as if he wants me to say that the party should assume the responsibility for what Kambanda did or said, and that is why -- I do not agree with this.  And that is why I wanted to explain how he did not have a counsel, how his wife disappeared, how his children had problems with their papers in the United States, how his family members had to wait for five years before seeing him.  Those raise questions.  

If someone has confessed to a crime, it has to be established with whom he planned to commit the crime, where, when, how.  But the Prosecutor cannot simply ask me to accept that Kambanda did those things simply because he pleaded guilty.  I'm not a specialist coming from the U.S. or Europe.  I was in Rwanda in 1994.  I lived through the events.  He was not the -- the Prosecutor was not there.  And we were seriously following the news, and at that time, we were about to establish democracy.  The process was sabotaged.  So the Prosecutor now cannot come here and ask me to simply say yes or no, especially with things that directly concern me, and which I know about.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Niyitegeka was one of yours as well from the MDR.  He's another man convicted of genocide before this Tribunal; that's right isn't it, the minister of information from the interim government? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Agathe Uwilingiyimana was in the MDR.  She was murdered.  Any idea as to why?  
A.	I wonder why you are asking me how it is that I know when --   
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I apologise, Mr. Witness.  
Mr. President, I would like to raise an objection to this type of question, because I believe that the Prosecutor is duty-bound to remain within certain limits, that is to say, either within the limits of the examination-in-chief, or with regard to the credibility of the witness.  And I do not see where such a situation -- such a question he is putting to the witness can be situated within which of those two contexts.  And I believe, Mr. President, this should be put a stop to.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The issue of moderates, it was raised in examination-in-chief.  I'll go back to the question. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Have you any idea as to why Agathe Uwilingiyimana, from your MDR party and an associate of Twagiramungu, over which there was a split in your party, have you any idea why she was murdered on the 7th of April 1994?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I would like to request that the Trial Chamber rule as to my objection.  And I do not see why, in view of the fact that the witness says that he was not there at the time of the events, how it is that he can say who assassinated the prime minister, and why.  And in view of the fact -- and until, in fact, you have ruled on my objection, I would like the Prosecutor to be stopped from putting such a question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We think the question could be allowed.  It goes to demonstration of -- we think it's linked with the credibility assessment.  Much of the evidence that he gave in-chief was hearsay, anyway.  And he can say whether he has an answer or not to this question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So, the prime minister, Agathe, on the 7th of April 1994, it appears, was murdered by 
	Presidential Guards.  Can you offer any idea as to why that would have happened?  
A.	I could say that it is not up to me to answer that.  Those -- that should be the result of investigations.  I find it deplorable that, contrary to what occurs in the case of a murder elsewhere -- well, I could provide you with the example of a trial which occurred two years ago in Belgium concerning a state minister who had been assassinated.  The Prosecutor's office started looking for the murderers before seeking who the person was who had actually ordered that murder.  And it was through the murderer's themselves that one got to the order-giver.  

Now, Mr. Prosecutor, you would like to have me say, as if I led an investigation myself, that the Prosecutor has not conducted itself -- or, Prosecution has not conducted itself, and you'd like me tell you who killed Agathe.  Why? And I wonder why you are putting the question to me with regard to her before popping the question about who downed the presidential plane, because, according to the theory of this Tribunal, and even since the very outset, and according to everyone's opinion, that is, this attack set everything else off.  
Q.	Well, that's not much of an answer to the question.  You see, I suggest that you are aware that Agathe was what we would call a moderate Hutu, that the climate in Rwanda throughout 1993 had coalesced around extremists who were in favour of a Hutu power, unified front against the Tutsi and the Inkotanyi, and those who were more moderate and wanted to negotiate with the RPF; and within your own party, the MDR, there was a split, and the split led to Agathe being out of step with people like you; and that you are aware that Agathe was not a hardliner, she was somebody who wanted to negotiate the RPF position; she was a moderate; and that that is part of the reason why, in those sorry days after the death of the president, she was murdered, because the country was taken over by extremists. 

Do you disagree with that?  
A.	If you followed my explanation, Mr. Prosecutor, I said that I do not accept the term "moderate Hutu".  
	I gave some explanation on the subject.  However, if you would like me to provide you with details, 
	I can't.  It is not approximately 10 per cent of people who align themselves with others in order to conduct a coup d'état within the fold of their own party, who then go on to claim that they are moderates, who -- of whom the leader being Twagiramungu, as I said, and who I also described as "convenience Hutus". 

So, to tell me that Agathe was killed because she was a moderate, well, no investigation has been conducted as -- on -- as to the precise reasons for her death.  Had an investigation been conducted, one would know why.  However, I do know that, as regards the presidential plane and as regards all the other ministers who were killed that night, no serious investigation has been conducted, that is, in search of the murderers, initially, and also the order-givers, subsequently.  So I reject what you say, because no such investigation has taken place. 

And I would go on to add that the Arusha Accords, before the Nsengiyaremye government was ousted, was virtually signed, all the draft versions thereof, notably.  And there was also the draft version as to the integration of the armed forces, and the difficult - or, issue, that is to say, that the foreign minister here had refused that the RPF bring its contingent to -- within Kigali urban area.  

So, we cannot be designated as extremists with reference to the RPF, whereas it was the government itself in the leading position which drafted more than 80 per cent of the Arusha Peace agreement itself.  
Q.	You know the difference between a moderate and an extremist.  You were one of the extremists.  You told us you convened the Hutu power rally in on the 23rd of October 1993.  You organised it; you gathered all the political parties at it; you attended the speech by Karamira.  

It was your creation; it's right, isn't it? 
A.	You did not listen to what I said.  I'm sorry.  I don't know if there's a record for you to read from, a transcript, but I never said that about Hutus.  I even went on to add what I said at the end of that very meeting.  This has to be taken into account.  One needs to take into account the official communiqué of my party, which was written, and not take into account a speech given by Karamira.  

This said, I still wonder why it is that one has the transcript of a speech given, and that one does not have the transcript of the written version of the speech.  So the M -- we were not extremists within the MDR.  There were -- or, was a division created by President Habyarimana in order to get up against us.  And I can give you the example of the second government cabinet meeting held in Kigali chaired by Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  

And this was the case of the Taba bourgmestre that the cabinet wanted to do away with.  The MRND did not want him either, nor did Twagiramungu.  They wanted to sack him.  And in view of the fact that at the time the government was working on the basis of a consensus, they did not manage to reach a consensus because of Ndasingwa, Landouald's vote being lacking.  

Why did he vote for us if we were in favour of the Tutsis?  
Q.	Well, it's all very interesting.  But let's remind ourselves as to what was said on the 
	23rd of October 1993  at a meeting that you created, you arranged.  

Karamira -- Frodouald Karamira, he was a member of the MDR; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, but I also said that he was sanctioned by the secretariat of Kigali urban préfecture.  
Q.	At this gathering -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
And Your Honours, are referred, in English, of the bundle, to page 101 through to 104.  

And His Honour, Judge Kam, in French, 98 through to 100. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Essentially, Karamira drew together the Hutu as being in conflict with the Inyenzi, who were described as the Tutsi.  It's right, isn't it, from what you remember? 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I heard "Karemera".  In fact, we're talking about "Karamira". 
MR. MORLEY: 
We're talking about Frodouald Karamira of the MDR, as I understand it, who was later executed in Rwanda for the sorts of things he was saying in this rally.  

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, from what you remember of this rally, which you arranged, do you recall Karamira drawing together all the different Hutus in the different parties to coalesce around an anti-Inyenzi, anti-Tutsi stance?  
A.	Yes, I do recall what he said, but I also remember what I said in order to wrap up the meeting.  And what I said here, that is, that I reminded people of the fact that Hutu dignitaries were killed under the second republic, and that the second republic was, for the most part, Hutu.  So, I reminded people of the fact that democracy could not be on an ethnic basis.  

And my words are the most important, because, in view of what you say, I was the one who actually called people to follow this march.  I am the one who called people to order, who welcomed people, who read the official communiqué of the party.  I corrected Karamira's mistakes.  

And on the next day, as I repeat for the third time now, with reference to the secretariat meetings within urban Kigali district, we came back on this point.  And we said that we were shocked by this Hutu power issue, but also by the MRND power issue, because we were saying that, in view of the fact that we were fighting against the MRND, were we to get as far as the elections, and were they to get in a position of power, then they would beat us; and he recognised, having strayed somewhat verbally.  And in some of the documents you have here before the Trial Chamber, I might remember the number of the document.  On the 21st of January 1994, he was broadcast over the radio with a view to correcting the words he had added. 

So, I beg of you, it is not because somebody says something wrong, i.e., something that the party does not accept, that we then have to assume responsibility for this.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you recall in the course of that speech, Karamira referred to Agathe as showing "Inyenzi behaviour"? 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, page 104 in English, top of the page. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you recall Agathe as being characterised as being somebody showing "Inyenzi behaviour" as a member of your own party?  
A.	I shall repeat it to you.  This document, for me, did not commit the responsibility of my party, because, Karamira, as you just said, was executed.  I am here before you.  I am not contained on any list, and this document is like the Gasana documents that somebody wanted me to analyse.  I believe they are of no use.  These -- or, this document only involves the responsibility of that individual and no one else.  

And, as I said in my communiqué, I was launching a serious attack against the president of the republic, because I said that what was going on in Burundi, where antidemocratic behaviour is occurring, and as what is going on in Rwanda, where our party was taking decisions, even at congress level, and that we do not manage to put in place what we decide upon.  
And I went on to add in this written communiqué, which was given at the time of elections, that if our candidate won the election, and if things were to go on in the same manner, it could come about that he would be killed, and the international community would say nothing, as all those people who had been involved in the negotiations here for more than two years, and who said nothing, and when a 
coup d'état was organised against our party.  
Q.	How many people were at this Hutu power rally on the 23rd of October of 1993 that you organised?  
A.	I do not want to answer this question whilst you are still using the term "Hutu power".  I did not organise a Hutu power rally.  I told you what I said during that rally, and do not talk to me about "Hutu power".  
Q.	Well, I'm sorry, I will.  Now, remind me, how many people were at that rally, please, approximately?  
A.	Well, you know the state's (unintelligible) somewhat. However, the cabinet stadium was full to the brim.  
Q.	I suggest that Karemera, that is to say, Édouard Karemera, arrived late, after the principal speakers had spoken, and spoke with Jean Habyarimana about his disappointment about not having been able to speak that day, because it was all over.

Now, can you comment on that?  Would you have seen Karemera arriving late amongst a crowd throughout the entire stadium?  
A.	I believe that what you are saying is false.  He did not arrive after the speeches had been made.  And if I told you that I was the vice-chairman of the party, he -- as a member of the national bureau of the steering committee, he was also the president of Kigali-ville urban district.  And I told you last week that I handed to him the official document that the Kigali office had prepared, and he told me that I should read it myself.  

So, he was, indeed, there when we read the statements.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  It should be explained to the witness that there is an element of confusion because of a homonym.  

You are not being spoken to about Frodouald Karamira, but the Prosecution is suggesting to you that Édouard Karemera, present amongst us, attended the march towards the end, and that he talked to Jean Habyarimana.  That is the suggestion that he is putting to you before this very Trial Chamber. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  I find it rather extraordinary that my learned friend interrupts the witness in respect to the question, which on the face of it, seems clear.  I made it plain who I was talking about.  And as the witness has gone on to describe the involvement, or otherwise, of Édouard Karemera, my learned friend interrupts the question in order, upon the face of it, to prompt the witness to change his answer.  

And it may be that I'm being unkind, but my learned friend is invited to wait until the answer is over, and then, as is customary, if there's a concern, Your Honours may think it appropriate, you raise it then, not in the middle of an answer, which doesn't seem to be going according to my learned friend's best wishes.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, how can one let the Prosecutor say things and do things of such a nature?  Ask the witness whether or not he was confused.  How can one say that Mr. Karamira was actually the chairman of Kigali urban district?  How can one have him say such a thing?  When there is an element of confusion, then light should be shed on the matter.  One should accept it, and one should continue.  He should not show such a state of disarray.  This is not possible.  And, the first names should be given.  Karamira is Frodouald, and Karemera is Édouard.  And, in such a manner, we should avoid any further confusion. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  There are two of comments I wish to make.  I still want my proceedings to be conducted with a certain degree of decorum.  And there's a sense in which, even if the witness is under a misapprehension, that the -- he should have been allowed to finish his answer first before he was interrupted. 

Now, Mr. Morley, on the other hand, I think you should clarify the position and allow the witness to give an explanation.

	1530H
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I've suggested to you that Édouard Karemera came late to the meeting, which had many thousands of people present, the stadium being full, and spoke to Jean Habyarimana, who, as you a moment ago mentioned, had been the president of the Kigali-ville MRND, expressing disappointment that he, Édouard Karemera, had not been able to speak at the meeting.  

Now, as I understand your position, you're saying that Édouard Karemera did not attend the meeting; is that right? 
A.	That is correct; he did not attend the meeting at all.  He could not do so because some -- it was, more or less, against him, because he was in a steering committee of the MRND, and this -- what I was saying was precisely against the MRND bureau, that is, the president of the republic.  So it was impossible for somebody from the bureau of the MRND to be present at that meeting. 
Q.	Do you recall that Jean Habyarimana was present, who was the president of the MRND for Kigali-ville? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	When you say it was impossible for Karemera to attend, what you really mean is that it may have been impolitic, not physically impossible, and I am suggesting in the crowd, at the end of this rally, you didn't see him.  Can you disagree with that? 
A.	No, I do not agree with that.  I did not see him.  And I also went on to say that it was unthinkable that he would come, and his physical presence could not be separated from his political presence.  
Q.	That will do on that particular subject.  

Now, you mentioned Gasana.  He became the foreign minister, didn't he, for a brief period of time?  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, within Agathe's and also within Twagiramungu's government, and also after Twagiramungu's government, I believe.  I do not recall very well. 
Q.	Would I be right in thinking that there was a lot of bad blood between those members of the MDR who were in the Twagiramungu faction and those members of the MDR who were in the -- call it -- other faction?  You ended up falling out with each other quite considerably, would that be right? 
A.	And also I should tell you what happened in the Kabusunzu congress in order to explain to you.  However, I would say, within the Kabusunzu congress, there was 83 percent of the members of the congress who were in attendance, so we had really exceeded the quorum in order to hold a congress, which was 60 per cent, in fact.  We took a sovereign decision to exclude from the party some individuals.  

In order to say that this is a faction, well, that is your right to say such a thing.  However, the day that they had been excluded from the party, whatever they went on to do, it did not concern us.  So we tried to recuperate our rights until the very end.  And I know that within the dossiers of this Court, there is a dossier dating back to March 1994, which was the decision of a court in Kigali, which talks about Twagiramungu, because he was using the MDR stamp.  

So, according to this or the decisions of the Tribunal, the MDR was -- and, according to the decisions which had been taken within the conciliation meeting of the bishops, that is to say, the Catholics and the Protestants, and I think I have noted this down and I do believe that you also have access to this information, the MDR accepted, in view of the fact that the agreements had been signed, because Twagiramungu was prime minister and he was prime minister within the -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness will have to slow down in order to allow for interpretation.
MR. MORLEY:
In fact, I go further and suggest that the witness simply answers the question, if there was bad blood.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The Twagiramungu faction was thrown out of the party as a result of the congress in July of 1993.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Twagiramungu was expelled from the party in July 1993 with Agathe Uwilingiyimana and others by a sovereign national congress of the party. 
Q.	And it's right, isn't it, that the Twagiramungu faction labelled your faction the MDR power faction; isn't that right? 
A.	That's not correct.  We were known as MDR power.  Why? After Kabusunzu congress, Twagiramungu tried to organise meetings with the complicity of MRND authorities, because they considered him as the party chairman, still.  And we, too, organised meetings in order to explain what was happening.  And when we saw that the number of participants were attending meetings, we realised that we had more people attending our party rallies.  So, what I know, that-- 
Q.	It's not a complicated question.  Your faction was called the MDR power faction.  That's right, isn't it?  We don't need the whole history.  
A.	That is not true.  We were not a faction.  We were a party. 
Q.	All right.  Your party was called the MDR power party after the split; is that right?  
A.	If you listen to what I'm saying, I have just told this Court that you have a document which I saw in another trial where the court in Kigali convicted Twagiramungu because he was using an MDR stamp.  If we were officially calling ourselves power, then we could have had a stamp with the word "power" on it.  But what we continued calling ourselves, what our party was known was MDR, simply. 
Q.	Well, that's not what you said a moment ago.  And it's right, is it not, that when a statement was filed on your behalf in respect of the Niyitegeka case for the 13th of November of 2002, it is said there that the Twagiramungu faction labelled your faction MDR power.  It's not a complicated point, and one doesn't need to delve into the ins and outs and whether somebody had a stamp which had the right word in it, or whatever.
A.	Those details are important, because they really are related to the history of the country, to the lives of many people.  Twagiramungu considered himself as a moderate, but now he's basically a Hutu of convenience.  I mean, those are things that you should say -- we should say. 
Q.	Oh, dear.  There's that word "moderate".  Twagiramungu considered himself to be a moderate and thought that your end of the party was extreme; isn't that right?
A.	No.  They tried to do everything to take power.  And when they got to that stage, they tried to look for means with -- which would allow them to be considered favourably by the international community.  So they invented the term "moderate Hutu".  

I -- last week I asked the same question.  And at the meeting with the bishops in order to discuss the MDR problems, I raised that problem -- rather, not yesterday, but in the past.  I gave you the list of names of all the people who were in the Twagiramungu wing or faction who would attend the meetings.  I mentioned -- all of them are in exile now.  If being moderate means working with the RPF, why are they in exile?
Q.	Gasana was expelled from the party, is that right, and was one of the so-called moderates working with Twagiramungu?  Would that be right?  
A.	Gasana was expelled from the party.  He was not a moderate.  He was somebody who just wanted a position.  If he had a position, let's say, in the MRND, he would have been in the MRND.  
Q.	He had been a senior member in the MRND, and when he came to the MDR, he produced a report on the growing menace of the Interahamwe.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours have it, a bundle, at page 5 in English, page 22, the original, in French.  

And this is a document -- if it might be put in front of the witness, please.  In French, it's pages 22 through to 32.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	This is a document which you have seen.  And it's right, is it not, that Gasana was describing how the MRND had created a movement of youths which -- 
MR. MORLEY:
On page 16 of the bundle, Your Honours, in English, and in French, page 28 of the bundle for His Honour Judge Kam and the witness, bottom of the page.  Top of the page in English, page 16, bottom of the page 28 in French.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Gasana is describing the purpose of the Interahamwe is to carry out criminal acts, commit crimes and assassinations in order to terrorise the people and divert them from their democratic ideal by making them helpless and confused; to create a general and widespread sense of insecurity in the country in order psychologically to prepare Rwandan public opinion for the acts of murder planned for the future; to unconditionally protect the MRND regime to carry out criminal and terrorist acts against opposition political parties, essentially, those of the MDR and of the PL parties.  

That's what Gasana was saying was the menace of the Interahamwe.  We're agreed on that, yes?  That's what he was saying.  Whether you believe it or agree with it, that's what you were put on notice of in the MDR, yes?
A.	I don't agree with you at all because I said that that person does not have any credibility.  He, himself, said that in 1992 he was a member of the RPF.  He was in the MDR, and we did not know that he was -- he had been in the RPF, and that is when he joined the MDR.  

So, for me, this document was prepared by an RPF infiltrator, because they were preparing their action, action to be taken.  For me, someone is not credible -- if he is not credible, and if he is an opportunist, then his document should not at all be considered as a document. 
Q.	And in the document he identifies the brains behind recruiting civilian Interahamwe.  Page 25 in French, page 9 in English.  And under the heading, "In charge of recruiting from among civilians," for the MRND, we have third-named person, Joseph Nzirorera, a former minister, through whom everything destined for the Akazu was channelled, and name number 5, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, a former minister, MRND coordinator for Kigali-ville, a well known and unwieldy partisan of the regime.  

Gasana is identifying those who are controlling and recruiting the Interahamwe, mentioning Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse as amongst them.  Now, you'd have to agree, wouldn't you, given the roles and the seniority of Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera, that it wouldn't be surprising if they had something to do with the recruitment of the Interahamwe?  Wouldn't you agree with that?  
A.	I would like to avoid analysing a document which is not credible because of the person who wrote it.  If I do not believe that that person was sincere, then I cannot trust a document written by such a person, and even if, in such a document, you'll have things which are true mixed up with things which are false.  
Q.	Well, you just don't like Gasana, and you don't want to agree with anything he said.  But let's have a look at a document that you yourself wrote, dated June of 1992, so it's a month after the Gasana report.  
MR. MORLEY:
Page 33 of the bundle, for Your Honours.  

Page 33 through to -- with the assistance of Mr. Issa -- page 37.  

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, on the front of this document it's referring to the MRND, (French spoken).  It's dated 
June of 1992, and there is your name on it, Jean-Marie Vianney.  Agreed?
A.	Yes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
For the record, the translation of the title is "MRND in Violence in Rwanda."
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Over the page, helpfully broken down, we have the contents, item 3, "Acts of aggression and terrorism of the Interahamwe militia."  So, in June of 1992, you, yourself, were calling the Interahamwe militia.  It's right, isn't it? 
A.	Before answering your question, I have to talk about the context of this document.  
Q.	Time for that in re-examination.  Let's just concentrate on what I want to draw your attention to, please.  The answer to my question is, yes, in June of 1992, you were describing in your own hand the Interahamwe as a militia.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	If we are out of context, I do not want to answer that question, because I cannot answer your question without explaining the context in which we wrote this document.  At least for once I am not a specialist who has come here to analyse the document.  Actually, I was one of the people who wrote the document, so I can explain what the context was when I wrote that.  
Q.	Yes, you've thought better of that, haven't you?  We don't need an expert to analyse the document.  You wrote it.  So we'll discuss it.  Now, is there a problem with saying to Their Honours that in your hand you have said, in June of 1992, the Interahamwe was a militia?  Can you not simply admit that, or do we have to have a long-winded explanation by way of content? 
A.	Yes, it's better to have a long explanation which shows the context.  But since you are insisting on that, we called them militias, since we were always denigrating what MRND was doing, and we were saying they were a militia which was harassing the opposition.  They were not terrorising Tutsis.  They were there intimidating us.  I do not know whether that was decided by MRND.  And such intimidation occurred only during rallies, not before or after.  At that time I was in Belgium trying to make contacts for my party.  And when I got there, there was a conference which was to be held in order to discuss multiparty politics and violence in Rwanda.  So, in view of that meeting, I prepared this document.  But we referred to them as a militia to show that they were different from us, because we were suffering from the intimidation. 
Q.	You referred to them as a militia because they were armed and violent.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  Sometimes they were armed with clubs, which they would get from the nearby forests during rallies.  But, as I said, that I did not see them or any militia as a militia force with firearms, no. 
Q.	And if we look at paragraph 3, which is page 36 in the bundle, it begins with, "Violating the law on political party, the MRND created a militia called Interahamwe, armed with clubs and other traditional weapons or bladed weapons and entrusted with the task of terrorising opposition supporters."  And when we go over the page, we see the plot behind the use of the Interahamwe, page 37, 
first paragraph.  "Traumatised by the magnitude of the democratic opposition movement, MRND 
tried on several occasions to provoke or cause disorder in the country so that it could have an excuse to put an end to the democratisation process and in order to conserve the dictatorial regime of General Habyarimana."  

And you go on to have quite a lot to say about Mathieu Ngirumpatse, four paragraphs down,  
"The statements made by the MRND national secretary, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who interpreted in his own way the minutes of the cabinet, during which the minister of planning, a member of MRND, had raised the issue of demobilisation of a part of the army in line with the requirements of the structural adjustment programme, and that was an incitement to mutiny within the armed forces."  And it goes on, more of your words, bottom of that section, last paragraph, "To that end, the statement by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the national secretary of MRND, who energetically opposed the streamlining of the government, such statements only give credence, according -- the fury, according to which MRND is taking advantage of the situation of current disorder."  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
	Mr. President, before the witness answers, I would like to object to that line of questioning by my learned friend.  This morning I referred to your order, which said that during cross-examination the Prosecutor should not deal with subjects which were not raised in the examination-in-chief and also through the answers which he actually gets from -- he should not use the answers by this -- by the witness to elicit matters which will have an impact on the case of the Accused.  

Since I was not present during the examination-in-chief -- but when I read the draft transcript, I understood that everything that was said in examination-in-chief supports what I'm saying.  That is, the Prosecutor does not have the right to bring in, in this vague manner, this line of questioning, and he should avoid asking -- he should avoid asking questions which can directly cause prejudice to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And he should -- and during the examination-in-chief, nothing was said regarding what he's talking about now.  And I think, Mr. President, that in your 17th of April order -- according to the 17th of April order, the Prosecutor should not be allowed to proceed in the manner in which he is going on.   
MR. MORLEY:
There are two thoughts.  The first is, unhappily for my learned friend, the issue of the reliability of Gasana's description of the criminal intent behind the MRND is live largely because of, firstly, examination-in-chief on the issue of Gasana being an outcast and unreliable and, secondly, because of cross-examination by Mr. Nimy this morning on Gasana's document D. NZ117.  

So, I respectfully submit the matter is live with regard to the reliability of what Gasana had to say about the criminal intent of the Interahamwe, the document referring to Ngirumpatse, as well as Nzirorera, being principal recruiters to the Interahamwe, the Interahamwe being a criminal organisation.  

And it becomes relevant, what this witness then had to write in June of 1992, which, on the face of it, is entirely consistent with what his then colleague was saying in May of 1992.  We are a year in advance of this extraordinary and, perhaps Your Honours' minds, confusing blood-letting which arose over a split in July of 1993.  On the face of it, this witness, in 1992, in June, was saying pretty much the same thing about the criminal disposition of the militia, described as such by this witness as the Interahamwe, in keeping with what Gasana, later to become the foreign minister, was saying.  

It goes to his credibility, and it also goes to the truth of what was taking place within the MRND and the creation of the Interahamwe.  And it arises because of questions in examination-in-chief on the credibility of Gasana and the reliability of his document produced in May of 1992.  

Moreover, even if there is to be a successful argument that what is being elicited in respect of Ngirumpatse is not evidence against Ngirumpatse, it is, I respectfully submit, evidence ultimately against Nzirorera and Karemera of their association with Ngirumpatse.  So that the activity, as described by this witness and Gasana, of Ngirumpatse can be impugned to the two other defendants because they operate out of the same office.  

And Your Honours will recall my opening questions to establish that the three men would have worked closely together, and it would be assumed that they would keep each other informed of matters.  

So, in short, there are two reasons for this line of questioning being appropriate.  One, it arose in examination-in-chief and cross-examination by Nimy and, two, in any event, it's evidence relevant against the other two co-defendants.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, as Ms. Hounkpatin said, I never ever raised that issue during the examination-in-chief.  Therefore, we should avoid mixing up things.  

Now, if the Prosecutor wants to test the credibility of this witness, he should do so.  But there are limits, and the limits have been outlined already.  But beyond -- going beyond this -- the Prosecutor should not go beyond the scope of the examination-in-chief, and he cannot ask questions regarding Mr. Ngirumpatse because he is -- his counsel did not raise matters referring to this particular area.  

I think the witness's credibility should be tested, but I think the learned Prosecutor should avoid mentioning things that were not raised by Ngirumpatse's counsel.  I would like to remind the Court that Mr. Morley himself is aware of what he is doing, because in my transcript -- 16 hours, 36 minutes -- he somehow acknowledges that his questions could be prejudicial to Mr. Ngirumpatse, and he is implying that this witness could be included in this particular area, whereas in the examination-in-chief no issues were raised regarding Mr. Ngirumpatse, and the Prosecutor is violating the orders which were issued by this Court.  

So, under the cover of pretext of reading Gasana's document, and particularly since the witness does not really think that Gasana is credible, the Prosecutor should not use this pretext in order to accuse Ngirumpatse.  And, of course, Ngirumpatse was never mentioned in examination-in-chief.  And we object to this issue being dealt with in the manner in which the Prosecutor is doing now.  

And we request you, Mr. President, if you allow the Prosecutor to go along these lines, we will request you to allow us to actually have further questions, or we should be allowed to ask this witness additional questions arising from matters which are being elicited from this witness by the Prosecutor. 
MR. MORLEY:
Briefly, I beg to differ with Mr. Sow.  I believe Gasana was put in evidence during the course of his examination-in-chief.  He was a lengthy part of the history of the MDR, and the credibility of Gasana was called into question.  

Mr. Nimy has then gone on to put the document into evidence, which tests the credibility of Gasana, and the document which I am currently examining this witness on supports the credibility of Gasana.  In that context, I respectfully submit it's a perfectly proper line of questioning, albeit it may be my learned friends didn't see it coming.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I believe that we know each other, learned friend.  We saw it all coming.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think we will take advantage of the time.  It's just around 4 o'clock.  We will have our short mid-afternoon recess and, at the same time, consider our response to this issue. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  Thank you.  
	(Court recessed from 1605H to 1635H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we think that your line of questioning needs to be somewhat -- because we don't think that, in light of the fact that this witness was not adopted by Ngirumpatse, that you could not build your case against Ngirumpatse through the witness.  So, that's the line that we think you should not cross.  
MR. MORLEY:
What I'm trying to do is build the proposition that what Gasana had to say about being a criminal organisation by the MRND was reliable.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can adopt that.  You can pursue that line.  But there was one question that you raised which was building the case against Ngirumpatse.  
MR. MORLEY:
I understand. 
	(Pages 35 to 43 by Claudette Ask)





























1645H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, just coming back to where we were just makes it plain that in June of 1994, you saw the Interahamwe as the criminal arm of the MRND designed to advance the MRND's need to maintain power within the country, it's right, isn't it? 
A.	I would like to remind you, since you wanted to look also at Gasana's document, which I find unacceptable, because it's not credible, but I would like to remind you that if you analyse it, he, as an RPF member, and taking into account what was said last week regarding the infiltration by RPF in all political parties, Gasana was an eminent personality. 
Q.	Stop for a moment.  I'm asking you about your document.  Never mind Gasana.  In your document, 
	we have -- thank you -- in your hand -- thank you -- reference as follows -- if you will allow me a moment.  Sorry.  Thank you.  

Page 37 of the bundle, in your hand:  "Traumatised by the magnitude of the movement of the democratic opposition, MRND tried on several occasions to provoke disorder in the country in order to have an excuse to put an end to the democratisation process and in order to conserve the dictatorial regime of General Habyarimana." 
A.	I wanted to look at the reference regarding what was said last week in respect of the infiltrations by RPF in all political parties.  You have referred to Gasana's document, and if he was an eminent infiltrator, permanent infiltrator, then RPF must have organised infiltrations in Interahamwe.  When you look at -- I can explain paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this document, particularly the announcement by the military command, because we have read what was written in it.  For me, that was the beginning of the attempt to create unrest in the country.  So what was attributed to the MRND was actually caused by the RPF.  This was clear.  After the elections, there were more than 30 assassinations.  

It seems that Dallaire carried out a study, but the outcome was never revealed.  And there were rumours that MRND had carried out the assassinations.  Yet, we needed only a very short time, 
two or three days, to realise that all the assassinated people were cellule leaders, were all MRND members, yet the rumours claimed that the killings were carried out by MRND, whereas we know that it was the RPF which had infiltrated the country, and they're destabilising the country. 

However, I agree that there could have been some small groups -- groupings who acted on their own initiative, particularly after the rallies when they would meet and harass people along the way, and people would say, "Oh, those are the militias." 
Q.	There is an expression in English, "When you are in a hole, stop digging."  Have a look at your document.  It has no reference to the RPF.  It is all about the way the MRND wants to hold on to power and it wants to usurp the democratisation process.  Have a look at paragraph 2, page 35 of the bundle, under "Campaign of Intimidation and Denigration of Opposition Parties by MRND". 

It says, the opening paragraph:  The legalisation of multiparty politics coincided with the beginning of a widespread campaign, wide-ranging campaign aimed at denigrating the opposition parties which were in the embryonic stages.  We should recall that MRND, using or exploiting the state of war in the country, made an offer to describe those parties as accomplices of the Inkontanyi. 

There is no analysis of the RPF running the country and infiltrating everyone and consequently being responsible for the Interahamwe being a criminal organisation for the propagation of MRND power.  What you've been saying is rubbish.  What you have here is, in June 1992, in your own hand, you describe the menace of the MRND and their Interahamwe.  Do you seriously deny that?  
A.	I'm not rejecting anything.  What I'm saying is that time can shed light on history.  When I say that MRND carried out a campaign against us and talked about Inkontanyi infiltrators, that is true.  And I am also saying that, since there were infiltrations, we now know that some things were attributed to MRND, whereas it was RPF that had committed those acts.  So time can change analysis. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- excuse me, Mr. President, I let my learned friend, Mr. Morley, speak up to this point because, firstly, I did not want to interrupt him; secondly, because I wanted to understand the logic of his line of questioning.  Although I don't like the expression "line of questioning", so I will call it line of questions. 

Mr. President, Mr. Morley is asking the witness about the political relationship between the MRND and other political parties in 1992.  The relationship can be described in any manner one wishes to describe it.  I would like to place an emphasis on the period in question, that is, 1992, at the height of the political struggle between political parties, either to retain power or either to try to accede to power, that was a fair political struggle.  But when I think that we are here before this Tribunal, not to discuss political problems which occurred in Rwanda, but, rather, we are here in order to look at criminal conduct, particularly which occurred after the 6th of April 1994.  And this is where I do not yet understand.  Apart from testing a witness's credibility, that Mr. Morley wants to carry out, I do not understand what is the trend in the reasoning regarding what was the relationship between MRND and the other parties in 1992, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the criminal conduct of people after April 1994.  

And when I look at the indictment, I would -- I feel that maybe Mr. Morley can help me by telling me where in the indictment is that part he is raising now covered regarding the relationship between parties, regardless of the stages of the relationship between MRND and other parties, in this particular case between MRND and MDR. 

Secondly, Mr. President, with regard to Gasana, I was the one who raised the issue this morning regarding Gasana.  There is a problem of reasoning which I do not understand on the part of the Prosecutor.  It is true that Mr. Gasana, up to the time when we started the Defence case, was considered as a serious witness, up to that point.  However, this morning we had our own evidence, and the witness shed light on the person of Mr. Gasana, his character.   

Now, the document to which my learned friend, the Prosecutor, is still referring has been analysed and placed in its context what in respect of the letter and the spirit of the document.  Therefore, what the witness has said should help us because now we know who Mr. Gasana is.  It will be going against reason if we continue to assert the reality and deny the obvious. 

I'd like to know, where is Mr. Morley going to?  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Morley is going to the position of examining the credibility of this witness when he would say that the three defendants are men of integrity, not responsible for anything that happened during the genocide, and that the country was in a state of chaos.  This line of questioning goes directly to whether one can believe anything he says about the MRND and the Interahamwe.  When one sees the inconsistency between what he said in testimony and what he has to say when he is confronted with his own document.  So it's a credibility issue. 

May I apply, Your Honour, for the document to become a Prosecution exhibit?  And I look to the helpful registrar for the next number.  I think it's P. 21 -- or, 313, but I'm not sure. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. Morley, which document are you referring to?  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, just to get us all back on the same page, the document which this witness helpfully wrote in 
June of 1992.  I think it would become -- I think it's P. 313, but I'm looking to Mr. Issa. 
MR. MJUI:  
The document will be P. 314. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 314 admitted) 
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Now, you've told us that you have no idea what an extremist is or a moderate is, although you reminded us that Twagiramungu in his camp, including Agathe, thought themselves to be moderates.  If we go to page 108 of the bundle, we have another helpful bit of information written by you. 

You wrote this one, 10th of July of 1994.  There is your name, Nkezabera, Jean-Marie Vianney, 
from the MDR.  Press release:  "The closing stages of the ordering of violence in Rwanda."  Do you remember this?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the first paragraph reads:  "Thousands of people -- thousands and -- tens of thousands of people lost their lives following the war which was launched by the RPF in October 1990, and due to intolerance and refusal to democratic opening, which actually was on the part of the hardliners within MRND. "

Oh, dear.  So we've got the hardliners and the MRND being responsible for the conflict with the RPF, because the MRND won't open up to democratisation.  And this is what you were saying on the 
10th of July of 1994, and that that accounts for thousands of people being killed.  What do you have to say about that now?  
A.	Yes, I can see the sentence.  This is what I said.  And what I talked about is the period of October 1990, but you misinterpreted what I said.  I talked about the war starting at that time.  And I also talked about the intolerance and refusal to open up democratically on the part of MRND hardliners.  This was in connection with 1990.  But I developed, as time went on, because there was democratisation, parties were founded.  So this was a way for me to introduce what we said. 

Now, since you have given me this document, I see why I wrote what I wrote.  And in paragraph 4, in support of the Arusha Accords, contrary to what you said -- contrary to what you said, we were not against the Arusha Accords.  This is on paragraph 4, page 2, where I called for the return of UNAMIR as soon as possible by asking the international community to take its responsibility. 

So this goes against what you said earlier on by calling me extremist, because I said there was a need to have UNAMIR II redeployed at that time when some countries were doing everything to avoid the redeployment of UNAMIR II.  Even the Belgian Senate committee, in its findings, and I'm talking about the commission which was set up by the Belgian Senate to study the Rwandan case, in its conclusions or findings the commission says, if UNAMIR had been there, there would not -- the genocide would not have taken place in Rwanda. 

Now, going back to the first line of the press release or press communiqué, this is an introduction talking about 1990 and building up later to events going up to 1994.  So the introduction should be -- not be more important than the conclusion of this press release.
Q.	But you're referring to hardliners, whereas earlier you were trying to suggest that you can't really make distinctions between moderates and extremists.  You seem to be quite quick to judge the MRND, as you were in your document of June 1992.  Do you still maintain you don't really know what an extremist or a hardliner is? 
A.	I said that extremists exist in all societies and that, in general, as far as I am concerned, the majority of members of any society are normal.  But moderates is defined by Twagiramungu as sellouts.  And I have to remind you that when he himself left RPF, they started talking about Hutus of convenience.  But there were extremists in all parties, be it amongst Hutus or Tutsis.  There were Hutu extremists, MRND and other parties, that is true, but there were also Tutsi extremists in RPF and other parties.  
	But what I am saying is that the average people in any society, in any community, the majority of people are normal.  It's only a minority of people who are extremists. 
MR. MORLEY:  
Your Honour, I'd ask that that document in the hand of the witness becomes Exhibit P. 315. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 315 admitted)
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	You were asked by Mr. Nimy quite a number of questions about Mfizi and his document about the réseau zéro.  Indeed, you were asked some questions by Mr. Sow about Mfizi, and you suggested that the document he produced was unreliable.  That he is an unreliable sort of chap, and that what he had said is not true.  Do you remember telling us all of that? 
A.	You're always interpreting what I say in a special manner; your way.  What I'm saying here is what we realised when we saw the document brought by Mfizi, because he was exaggerating some things because he had just been dismissed as the head of information services in Rwanda.  And, just like people who were -- who join politics after leaving the civil service, he wanted to make a statement.  
	And at that time, I was one of the people who said that the national committee of MDR should not study that document.  My position has not changed, because we cannot study a document of an opportunist, because that would be wasting time.   

And I still -- although I place it in the context of that time, whereas you were not there at that time.  So I place it in the context of that time because that is how I see this document.  So if you spend time studying all the documents by people who are not credible, we'll not get anywhere.  We'll simply be manipulated. 
Q.	Well, I suggest that the Mfizi document, that of it, it is true what he has produced, and that he is politically right in what he said in that document.  And that, in fact, he didn't bring to your party any new information.  He'd already worked all of this out.  What do you say about that? 
A.	I say -- or, I wonder why had we -- had we said this, why do you not use the documents that we produced, rather than somebody who is seeking a position?  We produced a lot of press communiqués, and I believe that we should produce and read the MDR documents, and I will comment on them.  However, I should not be told to comment on a document of an opportunist. 
Q.	I suggest, so that it's clear, that the Mfizi document, when you consider it, it is true what he has produced, and that he is politically right, but nothing new was brought to the MDR.  Now, do you agree or disagree with that proposition? 
A.	No, there are some exaggerations contained in this document.  And I repeat what I said, if you accept that the MDR had already published this, had said this, then I am ready to comment on MDR documents and not on the document of an opportunist. 
Q.	Well, leaving aside exaggerations, is the document basically true and basically politically correct? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, when on the occasion of a police investigation the investigator finds the truth, but the Tribunal does not take this into account by obeying some given order or law, and I am belabouring the point from the outset., as I said in the year 1992, that there is no point in giving a chance to the opportunists, whomever they be, by studying a document, even if they were to tell the truth.  Because, for example, if you manage to prove that I am not honest, everything that I have said here will be reduced to nothing.  

So, for me, I would request that if Mfizi's document says things that are contained within the 
MDR documents, then I will comment on the MDR documents.  But in view of the fact that I have refused to study this document within the national committee itself at the time, then I remain of the same conviction, that I do not want to pass any comment whatsoever on it. 
Q.	That's not good enough, I respectfully suggest.  It's right that you had an analysis of this document, and it is right, is it not, that, leaving aside any question of exaggeration, it is basically true, it is politically right?  Now, do you disagree with that?  Do you say it is not politically right, it is not true, or do you say, well, allowing for a bit of exaggeration, actually, it's basically right? 
A.	I don't quite know how to say this, because I repeat my request, because you say yourself that he is asserting what our party said.  So if he exaggerated, we did not exaggerate.  So the fact that he is exaggerating somewhere can then cancel out anything true that he might have said.  So if I lie at any point here, anything that I might have said in the past will then be annulled.  So if I did not take into account the document at the time that it came out, I do not want to analyse it in any other manner now. 
Q.	Let's stop dancing on the head of a pin, please.  
MR. MORLEY:  
Put the document back in front of the witness.  Pages 48 to 64, Your Honour's bundle. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, that's what we're talking about, the Mfizi letter.  And I would like, please, a clearer answer.  You have it in front of you.  

I suggest that this is a document upon which you performed your own analysis.  I suggest that this is a document which is politically right, and it is true what Mfizi has produced.  What do you say?  You have it in front of you.  What do you say about it?  Is it true what he has produced?  Is it politically right?  
A.	It's difficult for us to understand each other.  You are asking me to ascribe credit to an individual who I say is not credible in his writings.  That's not a normal stance. 

He did, indeed, have the time, in betraying, to write all that he did.  However, in view of the fact that I never took into account what he wrote at the time, we have more reliable individuals.  And I do not see why I should take him into consideration now, because at that moment in time, those were opportunists who have been making life difficult for us since the outset in Rwanda, whereas there are more reliable people whose writings could be taken into account. 

So, if I am not bound by law, then I do not want to pass comment on the document, a document written by an opportunist. 
Q.	Well, you may not be bound by law, but you may think you ought to be bound by what you've said previously.  You had given evidence in other trials.  And in the trial of Zigiranyirazo, on the 8th of March of 2007, on being questioned about this document in front of you, produced by Mfizi, you said, at 
	page 52 of the English translation, line 19, as a matter of public record, without any pseudonym, 
	"Now, my own analysis was that there was nothing new in it.  It is true what he has produced.  He is politically right, but nothing new was brought to the political party." 

You blow hot and cold, depending on how you think the interests of whoever it is you are helping to defend best suit in your thinking of that person.  You have flatly given a completely different account of the reliability of the Mfizi document in a previous case.  You are inconsistent and you are dissembling.  

That document, you know, describes -- and there is no great beef about it -- the existence of a coterie of individuals surrounding the president who exercised undue influence throughout the country.  You don't want to admit its true because Mr. Nzirorera was a member of that network, that Akazu, and you're here to help him.  But the bottom line is, I suggest to you, Mr. Nkezabera, either you were telling lies in the Zigiranyirazo case about the document being reliable, or you are telling lies today.  Which lie are you going to offer the Judges?  
(Pages 44 to 50 by Joe Reynosa)







1715H 
THE WITNESS:
I would say, Mr. Prosecutor, that you have given us half the truth.  I remember all too well what I said, and if you have the transcript somewhere, you will find that when the Prosecutor belaboured the point for me to pass comment, that is on this document, I refused, and I believe that the Trial Chamber reminded him that I had said that the document was not credible for me.  So I do not see -- I have come here to testify for Mr. Édouard Karemera, so I do not see what Joseph Nzirorera has to do with my testimony.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Let's not misunderstand each other.  You were being cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  There was no suggestion that the document wasn't credible.  You offered, quite clearly, that Mfizi is politically right and it is true what he put in that document.  There's no transcript which is going to help you by reference to, oh, you later mentioned some form of incredibility.  Now, which of the two is true:  Is the document reliable or is the document not reliable?  In which case are you lying, in Zigiranyirazo or in this one?  Answer, please.  
A.	I would like to read through the transcript, because I'm convinced that I did indeed say that Mr. Mfizi was not credible because he was seeking an appointment.  I'm sure that I will come across that. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Morley, I believe that the witness has already answered your question and he has repeated what he said in the other trial.  And I believe that in terms of loyalty, you should give to him the transcript with the references and the date of the hearing in order to follow all the -- in order to allow all the other parties to follow, rather than taking him by surprise.  
MR. MORLEY: 
It can be done if that's necessary.  The practice has developed, rightly or wrongly, in Your Honours' court that when people refer to transcripts in previous trials which are on public record, the transcripts haven't been produced as part of the bundle which is being used for the witness.  If Your Honours feel that the witness ought to have put in front of him what it was that he said, then I can make arrangements for that to be done.  It largely arises out of what he was saying earlier today under the cross-examination of Mr. Nimy.

Now, having said that, alternatively, my learned friend can re-examine on it.  It's a matter for 
Your Honours.  

I have a relevant page here in English.  Having gone through this witness's previous four trial appearances -- and, as I said, although Mr. Sow may have missed it, it's page 52, open session,
8th of March 2007, Zigiranyirazo, line 19.  

MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I believe that the witness has answered by saying that he did not say what the Prosecutor is alleging that he did say and he would like for the document to be shown to him.  The document should be disclosed to him.  This is the practice.  He should be able to read and be able to see what he said in the past rather than us losing more time.  Mr. Morley knows only too well the procedure.  
MR. NIMY: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I wanted to continue in the same vain in order to assist Mr. Morley.  In the Zigiranyirazo trial, there is a will-say that was filed, where Mr. Nkezabera is only too clear with regard to Mr. Christophe Mfizi and the Zero Network.  It's written in English.  And he explains very well when he said this morning when I, myself, questioned him.  

I think you have to take it as a whole, Mr. Morley.  The will-say is here; it has been admitted into evidence.  Would you like me to read it to you, Mr. Morley?  It says:  "Zero Network test was launched to cause a great scandal" -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours, just pausing there.  My learned friend is welcome to read this.  
MR. NIMY:
-- "and" --
MR. MORLEY:
Just pausing there.  We need to do these things, one may think, in a proper way.  

Exceptionally, I don't really object to my learned friend referring to the will-say, which I have in front of me.  But I find it odd that he interrupts the questioning of the witness during the course of cross-examination to start reading out sentences from other documents.  It can be dealt with in re-examination in the usual way.  But having said that, my learned friend is very welcome to read the short paragraph which appears in the Zigiranyirazo will-say, which, of course, was not, in toto, the evidence which was given.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think that we should move on.  The question has been asked, the witness has made an answer, and we will have the opportunity to check the transcripts ourselves and arrive at our own conclusions in due course.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  And with that, and on that note, with regard to the Zigiranyirazo evidence, I have no further questions of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  
Is there any redirect examination?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I do have a few questions to put to the witness. 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, mention has been made -- when the Prosecutor was putting the question to you on the subject of the MRND, the subject of the Interahamwe was broached, and also the réseau zéro or the 
	Zero Network.  And I shan't come back on the réseau zéro because you were very clear on the subject, and the author of the document, you say, is not credible.  

But let us talk about the Interahamwe.  You, as a political actor, had the opportunity of -- to observe the Interahamwe.  And can you confirm to us whether the Interahamwe were carrying any weapons, such as rifles and grenades, especially on the occasion of rallies that were organised or even when confrontation occurred between the youth members of the various parties?  
A.	I did say this:  I cannot confirm this fact.  I never saw them, apart from those that -- who were carrying clubs and sticks on the way -- or around the rallies.  However, as far as rifles and grenades is concerned, I did not see this.  If this happened after April 1994, I was no longer in the country.  However, there was violence, but not with rifles or with warfare weaponry. 
Q.	Witness, you were confronted with a document you penned on the subject of the violence, and I would like to ask you whether you can confirm that the violence which existed between the parties and, more particularly, between the youth or youth wings of the parties did not actually target Tutsis? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that fact, because when I was talking about the Base, and I was saying that our vehicles -- well, stones were thrown at our vehicles, well, those were the MDR youths, and when organised -- when meetings were organised in the north, they were never thrown -- stones were never thrown at them.  They were, for the majority, Tutsis.  This was a struggle between youths from the various parties themselves.  And I would add that, as I said, the Interahamwe was set up because the MRND could see how successful we were in terms of reaching the youth at the outset.  And it was not set up at the outset; it was set up with the advent of war.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you agree with me that with the advent of multiparty politics there was a political struggle between the political parties and that it was rife at the time that parties would mutually accuse each other? 
A.	Yes, I can agree with that, except that I will repeat it again and again that we were at war and that a division, of course, within a party will be profitable to somebody coming from the outside.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when mention was made of Édouard Karemera, you made comments as to the man himself.  Can you tell us whether what you stated to us as regards the man as an individual, did you do that in a purely informed fashion or did you do this by hearsay? 
A.	No, I did this because I was fully informed.  This is somebody that I have known since the 1970s.  This is my personal analysis.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you talk of Édouard Karemera by saying that he was not in attendance at the rally dated the 23rd of October 1993 -- I don't mean rally; I mean the march dated the 23rd of October 1993 -- did you say so quite simply because you were told this or because you were in attendance yourself? 
A.	I was in attendance and I was leading the march.  And had we had the opportunity to have somebody from the national bureau of the MRND, we would have been very happy, and -- because we were attacking the MRND, and of course we would have been very lucky had they come to support us. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please explain to the Trial Chamber how it is that demonstrations were organised in general terms.  I mean to say that if one organises a demonstration at a préfectoral level, does this only concern the leaders of the préfecture itself who are normally involved in such demonstrations and not the national leaders? 
A.	What you have just said is very clear, because as regards Kigali, there were sometimes national demonstrations, and chairmen of parties, notably, those whom I managed within Kigali-ville, these were chairmen of political parties who were requesting authorisation.  But in view of the fact that they were within my jurisdiction, I was the one who would organise the demonstration.  

With reference to Nsanzimana, on the 8th of January 1992, this was a demonstration, and it was said that 100,000 people were out the street.  I believe that that is somewhat exaggerated for a population of 300,000.  And the demonstration which followed was broken up, because the chairman of the demonstration had forgotten to request an authorisation.  And I remember calling the chairman of the -- for external relations of the MDR party, and I remember calling him three days before, asking him whether he had drafted a letter, and he had not done so.  And we were told then to break up the demonstration. 

So, in general terms, the demonstrations were requested by the national bureau of the political parties.  And it was at préfectoral level that we would then request authorisation.  And then this was done relatively rapidly.  And it was the people from the LMDR who were there.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, Frodouald Karamira was often confused with Édouard Karemera by the Prosecution, and I believe that they certainly realised this mess-up, and Mr. Karemera, whether -- as to whether he was in the march of the 23rd, and you said earlier that there was a programme over the radio where Mr. Karamira took the floor in order to come back on what he had said.  Can you confirm that fact?
A.	I can confirm it, and I even have the name -- or the number of file within the court.  It is 300/221/520, and it was on the 21st of January 1994, I believe.  And it was because of pressure exerted upon him that he went and explained what he had said during the march. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would like to request the assistance of Mr. Issa for him to distribute a document, a document from radio RTLM, that is, on the subject of a programme on the 21st of January 1994.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, do you have the document before you?  
A.	No.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I do not have a French version, but I'm sure that one -- at one moment in time Mr. Morley will provide us with assistance in order to have access to the French version.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Now, Witness, I would request that you refer to page 4 of the document where the name of Mr. Frodouald Karamira of the MDR appears.  Can you see that excerpt? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	I might request of my legal assistant that she read the extract from Mr. Frodouald Karamira's speech for there to be a translation thereof, and then I will put a question to you.  
MS. NDOUR:
"Frodouald Karamira, MDR.  First of all, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.  Yes, I wish to mention that the MDR power does not exist as such.  There is only one MDR who has power.  That is how you have to understand it.  Yes." 
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Ms. Ndour.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, after the reading out of Frodouald Karamira's statement, what commentary does this give rise to, from your part? 
A.	A commentary it might give rise to?  Well, as I said, with the comments of Twagiramungu with reference to Hutu power, et cetera, Karamira should have better explained what he meant.  And, as I said, we even lodged a complaint against Twagiramungu, who was actually using the MDR stamp.  And all the campaigns that made reference to MDR power we refuted.  And this is what Karamira is explaining here.  
Q.	Would you agree with me that to say that the march dated the 23rd of October, which gave rise to the gathering at Nyamirambo stadium, was the point of departure of a coming together of all those who were supporting Hutu power, and this was purely a concoction? 
A.	Absolutely. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, this brings my examination -- my re-examination to a close.  

And, Mr. President, as far as it is possible -- and maybe I -- before I request that the witness be allowed to meet with the Accused -- Mr. President, I would like to have admitted into evidence this document I have just read from. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I'm not objecting at all, but I anticipate my learned friend has seen what appears in the next paragraph about how Karamira is promoting this witness in Nkezabera as a future member of parliament for the MDR, despite this witness saying he dissociated himself from Karamira's speech on the 23rd of October.  If my learned friend wants it in evidence, he's very welcome to have it.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would like to say that this document has already been entered into evidence in another trial, and I would like to thank Mr. Morley for kindly really pointing this out.  And I think that was very kind on his part.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we admit the document.  
(Exhibit No. D. K78 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we grant the permission you requested and ask the registrar to make the necessary arrangements.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  
MR. SOW: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  It's a bit longer than we anticipated, but it's obviously much shorter than the experience that you referred to in your evidence earlier today.  We thank you, as we thank all witnesses, for assisting us in our work.  Now you are excused.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1741H)
