MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MS. KOUO:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 15th of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the          Prosecution versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  The Chamber has some business to conduct concerning a request it made of the registry in closed session.  And we would like to go into closed session immediately for that purpose. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 4] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue this morning, and Mr. Sow will continue his examination of you. 

Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to everyone.  Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Counsel.
WITNESS HH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, as you were reminded by the Presiding Judge, you are a protected witness, and we are in open session.  So you have to be very careful in your answers so as to avoid mentioning locations which may undermine your protection.  As far as I am concerned, I am going to make extra efforts for your identity to be preserved.

Yesterday we were talking about the weapons which you said were distributed by Mr. Turatsinze, which weapons he took back and most of which he sold.  I'm going to continue with this line of questioning, Witness.  Please tell me who informed the party that Turatsinze had informed UNAMIR.  
A.	I often heard that from Séraphin Twahirwa and Aloys Ngirabatware, but you can notice that those people were Turatsinze's opponents.  So those were the two people that I heard spreading that rumour. 
Q.	How did you get to know that it was Georges Rutaganda who had distributed those weapons to the Interahamwe? 
A.	Counsel, which distribution are you referring to?  Did you see Georges Rutaganda?  I am unable to know which person you are referring to. 
Q.	Witness, in your statement of the 3rd to the 11th of November 2004 on page 9, this is what you said on the last paragraph:  "Georges Rutaganda collected them and distributed them to his Interahamwe to commit massacres."  Don't you remember your statement, sir? 
A.	Indeed I said that, Counsel.  But the question which had been put to me is not congurent with what you read to me regarding that matter.  I'm going to tell you of how I got to know of it.  After the death of the president of the republic, Georges Rutaganda came and took back those weapons.  I got this information from Séraphin and Ngirabatware.  Georges Rutaganda distributed those weapons to the Interahamwe, who then went to the Margewa (phonetic) to indulge in lootings.  I remember very well that there were crates of Heineken beer which were looted from that place.  It was said that the weapons had been taken from the party headquarters, where they had been kept.  And that is what I told the Prosecutor. 
Q.	So, sir, if I understand very well, you are saying that you got the news from someone else; you got the information from somewhere else?  You did not see Georges Rutaganda taking the weapons; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  When he went to pick up those weapons, I was not with him.  I got the information subsequently, and I am giving you proof of that, the reasons why I believe that it happened.  As I told you, people told me they had received weapons from Rutaganda.  And, indeed, I saw them carrying the weapons. 
Q.	Witness, please tell me whether during the war, or in connection with the war, the army recruited young persons to go and fight the RPF. 
A.	Regarding the young people I learnt there were young people involved in self-defence, a civil self-defence programme, and who received -- underwent military training.  I suppose those are the young people you are referring to. 
Q.	And you, Witness, did you join the army? 
A.	No, I never was in the army, but I cooperated with soldiers. 
Q.	But, Witness,**********************************************************************. 
A.	What are you talking about, Counsel?  
Q.	Did you not acknowledge that you had a nickname that everybody used as far as you are concerned? 
A.	I explained to you the origin of that nickname.  I think I gave sufficient detail on that score, but if you want me to repeat it, I can.  What I told you is true. 
Q.	Witness, as of when did you begin speaking of civil defence in Rwanda, as far as you know? 
A.	It was in 1993 they began talking about civil defence. 
Q.	When the RPF attacked Rwanda for the first time in October 1990, did not the people ask to be armed in order to defend themselves? 
A.	Regarding the weapons that were asked for, I think it was rather in 1994; that is when the prime minister said that arms should be distributed to all members of the population, to everyone.  He said if someone was working in his fields, he needed a gun so that -- a firearm, so if the enemy arrived, he could defend himself.  That is when I first began to hear that it was necessary to give the people guns. 
Q.	Tell me, Witness, did your Interahamwe participate in civil defence? 
A.	None was enrolled in civil defence in my neighbourhood except the people who received military training after the 8th of April 1994. 
Q.	And you yourself, did you take part in the civil defence? 
A.	No. 
Q.	But, Witness, I don't understand.  You said that you yourself fought the RPF.  Was that not in the context of civil defence? 
A.	Personally, I don't think it was in the context of civil defence.  It all depends on the circumstances under which I was taught how to handle a firearm.  It was in another context then that which you are talking of. 
Q.	Witness, did you go to the front to battle the RPF? 
A.	Yes, that did happen. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, microphone, please. 
MR. SOW: 
Forgive me, I mispunched the button. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	When you were fighting the RPF as a civilian, that wasn't in the context of civil defence? 
A.	Well, if that is how you see things, interpret things, as far as we were concerned, we never sent people to undergo training in the context of civil defence, but as regards the people who did undergo -- but they did go -- undergo training, but it was clandestine.  It was secret.  It was not in that context, whereas in the context of civil defence, the training was organised at communal level and the training took place in public. 
Q.	Witness, I now come to the problem of some meetings, or rallies that you referred to where you considered that Mr. Karemera, Édouard, was present.  I will begin with the Ruhengeri rally; you claim that Édouard Karemera was present.  Are you sticking to that? 
A.	Yes, my position remains the same on that point because whenever there were MRND rallies, very large rallies and important rallies at national level, all of the national leaders had to be present.  So I say that he was present.  Sure, he didn't take -- he didn't speak, but in view of my responsibilities, what I was given to do, I didn't check who it was exactly, everyone that spoke. 
Q.	Witness, when you say that the party leaders had to be present, this is a mere supposition, is it not?  The question I am putting to you is not for suppositions but to tell me exactly was he there; did you see him? 
A.	Well, in any case I have just given you my answer.  I will repeat it.  I think he was there, but I'm not sure if he spoke.  I say that because he was vice-president, national vice-chairman, vice-president.  That is the basis on which I say he was present. 
Q.	Witness, at that rally you have spoken of certain parts of President Habyarimana's speech.  In particular, when he was speaking to the Interahamwe, you have stated on Wednesday the                 8th of November 2006, Wednesday, 8 November 2006, the president was congratulating the Interahamwe.  "Prosecutor" -- this is the draft of the 8th of November 2006, page 38, that is presumably in the French.  And then you said, Witness, that he added something else.  He said "That the Interahamwe should have a uniform, a smart uniform so as to come down."  

And then the Prosecutor put the following question to you:  "When you heard the president of the republic say that he was going to 'come down', what did he mean from your understanding thereof?" 

And you answered:  "I would not say that, as I see it, that I truly understood.  I very, very well understood, but I understood that it was necessary to come down to get closer to the people in the context of campaigning to get -- to enlarge the membership."  Do you remember having said that?
A.	Yes, that is what I stated. 
Q.	So, you are confirming that? 
A.	Yes, that is what I thought at that time.  That is what I thought after having heard what              President Habyarimana said, but that was my understanding at that time. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, I come to the Nyamirambo rally.  Can you tell me, Witness, according to your information how many MR -- how many MRND rallies at Nyamirambo did you attend? 
A.	There were many rallies in Nyamirambo, but I remember the two last meetings to be held in Nyamirambo. 
Q.	Were you at the meeting which was held -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, I missed whether it was the 6th or the 16th of January.  
BY MR. SOW:
-- In Nyamirambo. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, could you mention which meeting; what date did you mention, please?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, it was on the 16th of January, 16th, one, six of January 1994.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I did not hear your answer.  Could you repeat it, please? 
A.	1994, did you say?  I was not in Kigali on that date. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I wish to speak with you about your trip to Rushashi.  Yesterday, I reminded you of your statement that you gave; we're still at the 8th of November regarding the trip to Rushashi.  I should like you to remind me what was the purpose of that trip to Rushashi?  Did you hear me, Witness?
A.	Yes, I heard you.  I'm listening. 
Q.	I will repeat my question because I think you missed it.  You claim that you made a trip to Rushashi and that was with Édouard Karemera.  I should like you to tell us exactly -- what exactly was the purpose of that trip.
A.	Well, to my knowledge, I was told the day before that some leaders had to go to Rushashi préfecture and I was one of the people that had to accompany them.  We arrived in Rushashi in the context of the Interahamwe.  I was with Robert Kajuga and other Interahamwe, many other Interahamwe presidents.  When we arrived in Rushashi, we were received in the Kigali east, Kigali east project, the meeting hall of that project.  It was Karemera who took the floor -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry; I think he said it was Karemera who took the floor. 
THE WITNESS:
-- and introduced leaders, MRND leaders and spoke of the incident that had occurred the day before and said it was very difficult, but we sacked him at dawn.  He was speaking of the prime minister, Dismas Nsengiyareyme.  He said that they had deposed Nsengiyareyme to install Agathe.  So, he was speaking to the inhabitants of the three Rushashi, Tare and Musasa, the three communes that make up the préfecture of Rushashi.  That is what he said and what I am repeating now. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, in what capacity did Édouard Karemera take -- speak? 
A.	In his capacity as vice-chairman, vice-president, which was known.  So he presented the new authorities.  He presented Mathieu Ngirumpatse as party chairman or party president, and Nzirorera, Joseph, who had just been elected secretary-general. 
Q.	Witness, since you say that Karemera spoke in his capacity as vice-chairman, can you tell me on what date he was elected vice-chairman? 
A.	Don't put questions to me as regards the date he was elected to that post.  But when I was an Interahamwe, I was always told that Karemera was vice-chairman of the MRND.  He was vice-chairman -- he had been vice-chairman since well before, at the time of the elections held at     Amahoro stadium; even nothing was said about that.  He kept his position as vice-chairman as before. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that what you are saying is not correct.  Not only did Mr. Karemera, Édouard, not only was he not vice-president, vice-chairman at that time, he did not participate in the trip, and he did not speak at Rushashi.  What do you say to that?
A.	I am testifying as someone who was there and saw him at Rushashi. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I'm going to put questions to you concerning the 6th of April 1994. 
A.	Very well. 
Q.	Yes.  When the presidential plane came down and you heard the information -- was shot down and you heard the news, a communiqué emanating from the armed forces asked the people to stay home.  Did you hear it? 
A.	Yes, I heard that communiqué in the morning of the 7th of April; at about 5 a.m. or 5:30, I heard that announcement, that communiqué. 
Q.	Did you comply and stay home?  Did you comply with the communiqué and stay home? 
A.	In my capacity as an Interahamwe, that would be absurd.  It would be absurd for me to stay at home, so I left my home and I went on the road to follow events closely because I'd just heard the communiqué. 
Q.	Witness, is it not true that as of the 7th, the fighting resumed? 
A.	I know that on the 7th of April 1994, the killings started. 
Q.	And there was no fighting, no combat between the RPF and the Rwanda government forces? 
A.	On the 6th of April during the night, already there was combat.  After the news came out, some people even were killed, members of the population were killed. 
Q.	In that state of war, you have stated that meetings were held; do you stick to that? 
A.	You are speaking of that date?  
Q.	Yes, I am speaking of that date as of the 7th of April 1994.
A.	I don't know from where you have obtained that information.  I have never heard of any meeting that was held on the 7th of April 1994.  I never spoke of a meeting held on the 7th of April. 
Q.	I shall be more specific.  I said as of the 7th of April, after the 7th of April, the whole period from the    7th of April to the month of July, you have claimed that there were meetings, Interahamwe meetings.  That is the question I'm putting to you.  
A.	Well, now your question is clearer.  Yes, meetings were held. 
Q.	Witness, do you know that one of the members of the provisional national committee has stated one question, that in that period of war the national provisional committee could not hold meetings, and did not hold meetings? 
A.	If the person said it, well, that is only one.  That is his way of answering you.  I answer you my way.  There was a witness who gave one version, and, me, I'm giving another version.  So which one do you choose?  It is one against one. 
Q.	Witness, it seems to me as if the committee which you referred to as the national provisional committee represented the leadership of the Interahamwe organisation.  And it does not seem likely to me that the leadership would be unaware of meetings which took place. 
A.	Well, perhaps I need to repeat my answer.  You are referring to the Interahamwe senior leadership.  But I am confirming that on the 8th of April 1994 those authorities came to*******.  I saw them with my own eyes.  I do confirm that.  And you tell me that one of those authorities said that meetings never took place; don't you understand that the authority in question wants to exculpate himself? 
Q.	Well, Witness, spare me those comments of yours, just tell me what you think because I may have to say the same thing to you.

Witness, do you know when Mr. Édouard Karemera left Kigali?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you know when the government left Kigali? 
A.	I think, from the information I received, that the government left Kigali on the 12th of April. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell me where Édouard Karemera went to after he left Kigali? 
A.	I said I saw him in Gitarama; that I saw him in Gitarama does not mean that he spent the night at Gitarama.  Perhaps he spent the night somewhere else, but I saw him in Gitarama.  I never said he lived in Gitarama. 
Q.	Witness, you said that you accompanied some members of the national provisional committee to Murambi to make a report.  Was that your evidence? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	When you set off, did you take time to ascertain, as you said, that the national executive bureau was in Murambi? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to have explanation regarding what is the national executive bureau, because when you refer to the national executive bureau, I am unable to understand which organ you are referring to. 
Q.	Witness, you may have forgotten this, but in your statement you often mentioned the executive bureau. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, Mr. Édouard Karemera is drawing my attention to the interpretation just given, which may be the reason why the witness did not understand what I said.  So, I'm going to repeat my question.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	My question to you, Witness, was as follows:  When you left for Murambi, were you sure that you would find the national executive bureau of the MRND there? 
A.	Yes, sir.  I saw them there. 
Q.	Witness, my question was not to know whether you saw them there.  My question was as follows:  Before you set off for Murambi, were you sure you would find them there or had you booked an appointment? 
A.	Counsel, what I told you is that I accompanied those people.  I'm not one of those who were to be in a position to go there.  I simply accompanied those authorities without participating as a decision-making.  I was not the one going to meet with those senior leaders. 
Q.	Witness, those people whom you said went to Murambi with you, are they still alive? 
A.	I can't answer that question.  I don't know whether or not those people are still alive, because we are not together.  I am in gaol; they are not there with me.  So I cannot risk to tell you whether or not the people are still alive. 
Q.	Were you not made aware that Kajuga had died? 
A.	It was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who told us that Kajuga was dead.  He summoned us to Bukavu while we were in exile in early 1995. 
Q.	What about Bernard? 
A.	I know nothing about Bernard, sir. 
Q.	So, if I were to tell you that Bernard too is no longer alive?
A.	Perhaps you are aware of that.  I know nothing about that, and I'm not going to gainsay you. 
Q.	Witness, if you look closely, you will realise that, the people you are referring to are no longer around.  So I wonder why you are always referring to those people; and that is the same thing regarding Turatsinze.
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, have we gone down the list of all of the persons that the witness mentioned as having gone to Murambi because I believe he had mentioned, at least, five names, and we've only covered two of them?
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, did you hear what the Prosecutor said?  Apart from those people, were there others of the national provisional committee? 
A.	As you are saying, the only person I was told had left this world was Robert Kajuga.  It was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who informed us of that when he summoned us.  Regarding the other people whose names you have mentioned, no one had told me that they were dead already.  Even if those people were no longer around, that does not exonerate them.  The fact that someone is no longer of this world, it doesn't mean that people should not talk about the crimes he has committed, unless there is some particular piece of legislation in that connection. 
Q.	So, Witness, if I were still to tell you that one of the members of the national provisional committee who was interviewed said that he regularly went to Murambi for professional purposes and that he himself never mentioned any meeting whatsoever with the national executive bureau, what would you say? 
A.	Counsel, you say you were able to discuss with one of those members and he told you what you just said, but you have not given any proof that the person questioned confessed to his crimes.  If that person had confessed to his crimes, then we can consider what he has said as being true. 
Q.	Witness, you are here to testify to facts, not to accuse people.  I don't think that because you confess, that is the only reason why one should believe that you are telling the truth.  The proof is that you have confessed to your crimes, but you are not, obviously, giving us all of the truth.  I am telling you about the witness who has testified in this court and who stated that he often went to Murambi.  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, my learned friend is on his feet. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I think the witness has a point.  And it would be helpful in questioning him if he -- if the information was specifically put to the witness, which witness are we talking about, because we all know that there are at least three members, if not more, of that committee that are not dead.  So, Mr. Sow may have someone very specific in mind, but the others that are present and listening don't know who that person is or what the basis of his enquiry is.  So, if he could find some way of putting that on the record. 
MR. SOW: 
I had disclosed to my learned friend the transcript concerning that witness, the transcript of               26th of May 2006.  My learned friend has the English version, on page 11 of the transcript -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
What I would suggest is that you put the P. 9 in front of the witness and that you indicate by number which person you are talking about so that the witness has a clear idea of what the basis of your question is.  I don't see how we could expect the witness to answer without knowing exactly, you know, what -- you know, the basis of your enquiry.  I mean, that is how we have done this in the past.  And I'm suggesting that you do that at this time so that the witness knows what you are alleging. 
MR. SOW: 
Well, my learned friend, let me tell you, I have a difficulty because the witness in question is protected.  So, I don't think that this witness ought to know who we are referring to.  I disclosed to you the transcript, I had disclosed the transcript to the Chamber.  I am fully entitled to refer to the evidence of a witness who is a member of the national provisional committee.

Now, he can either corroborate it or say -- deny it.  Given that we have the document, I can subsequently move that it be entered into evidence.  Since it already has the number 9, I don't want to give to the witness the name of that other witness, who is equally protected.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	So, Witness, I will simply read to you what that witness said on the 26th of May 2006 regarding his trips to Murambi.  That person was one of those members of the national provisional committee who made the greatest number of trips to Murambi.  And during questioning, he said he went there regularly for professional reasons.  He never mentioned any meetings.  

So how come that such a high-level figure of the Interahamwe was not aware of the meetings which you claim were organised with the national executive bureau of the MRND in Murambi? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you for your question.  You are saying that the witness had been to Murambi.  I remember earlier on when you said that my presence here is not to accuse people, but I would also tell you that my presence here is not to clear anybody's name.  So, I think that if I had known that person's identity, then I would be able to make comments.  Given that I don't know the person, and I am simply giving you an account of events which I'm aware of, then I think it is needless for you to seek to contradict me. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would make a request for the transcript of the 26th of May 2006, which are page 12 for the French version and page 11 for the English version, be entered into the record. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You mean our transcript?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I refer to the transcript of the 26th of May 2006. 
JUDGE SHORT:
In these proceedings?  
MR. SOW: 
In these proceedings, sir. 
JUDGE SHORT:
It is already in evidence, so what is the point?  It is part of the record. 
MR. SOW: 
But, Mr. President, I believe transcripts have been filed.  Mr. Weyl has filed transcripts which are transcripts in our proceedings.  And given that the witness was a protected one, he requested that the transcripts be placed under seal, which is something that the Bench accepted.  So I don't know whether we cannot use that same manner of doing things.  Otherwise, if your view is that it is already part of the record, then that is okay, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think that accepting the transcripts by Mr. Weyl was unnecessary.  And the record is already -- the evidence is already on the record.  And you have referred to it.  We can easily check the transcripts without having them not be filed. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I may intercede, Your Honour, there is a very specific reason why we admitted the transcripts that were offered by Mr. Weyl, and that was because this witness had been identified in those transcripts.  And the only way to preserve it on the record was to actually take a few pages out and enter it on the record, because if we had mentioned the pages, then the witness's identity would have been revealed to the public.  So, we did it for a very specific reason in that context.  

But with what Mr. Sow is attempting to do now, as I look at the page that he was referring to us, the witness who is speaking there actually talks about meeting Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera and Karemera in Murambi on a specific date.  And he gives the 18th, and then he goes into a bit of detail.  So, I don't understand how we can address this issue competently without confronting the witness with this information.  That is what the witness -- that was the basis of my comment earlier.  And the witness also picked up on it.  

And if the Court is interested in this piece of information, the only way to deal with it is to put the issue to the witness and allow him to respond.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think that the testimony of this witness is very clear, and we are in a position to assess it without him being told the identity of the protected witness.  And, in any event, we are of the view that the -- that the protection order should have priority in this incident.  So we would leave the situation as it is; we don't require you to disclose the identity to the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The one other point that I would like to add is that when I read the transcript of the 26th of May, at    page 11, which is where Mr. Sow had directed us, the witness says quite clearly, "I went to Murambi almost every day."  So I don't see how Mr. Sow can rely on that portion of the transcript to confront this witness with the absence of that particular person since the witness himself -- the information that is being used to confront this witness, that transcript has a sentence in it where he says, "I went to Murambi every day."  And between -- and then he gives certain other details. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will assess this in due course. 

 MR. SOW:
	Mr. President, I think my Learned Friend is actually misstating what I said.  I said that the witness went there for professional reasons.  There was not meeting.  The problem is about the meeting.  I think if you are repeating someone's statement, for purposes of good faith, you have to repeat it correctly.  

	Mr. President, the transcripts are in the possession of the Chamber, the Chamber will be able to make a determination of all of that.  And as Mr. Justice Short has said, the transcripts are already part of the record.  So it is not necessary for me to make another requests for them to be part of the record.  On that note, Mr. President, I am done with this witness.  

	Witness, I thank you.
THE WITNESS:
	I thank you too, Counsel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you, Mr. Sow.

	Witness, you still have to respond to questions from counsel for Joseph Nzirorera.  And he will be the next person to cross-examine you.  But it is now almost 10:30 now, and I think we will take the         mid-morning recess and commence with that cross-examination after the break.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you may proceed.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, good morning.  How are you?
A.	Good morning to you, Counsel.
Q.	Witness HH, you've told us that you were arrested upon your return to Rwanda on the*************** ***************.  My question to you is: when was the first time you were questioned by any authorities after your arrest?
A.	I was arrested by soldiers.  After arresting me, they handed me over to the communal authorities.
Q.	And were you questioned by any police officers or prosecutors after that?
A.	I was questioned after about a month and a half.
Q.	And were you questioned by a man named Pascal Kalisa, the prosecutor of the tribunal of first instance, in Kigali, in approximately the*******************?
A.	I didn't remember the name of the person who questioned me.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the witness be shown a statement, which is item No. 3 in the documents disclosed by Mr. Weyl?  He disclosed all of the prior statements of this witness when he began his cross-examination, and this is item No. 3 in that disclosure.

Excuse me, Mr. President; I see the registrar is looking through the admitted exhibits.  I don't think he understands my request.  Mr. Weyl gave a packet of documents when he began his cross-examination, and the packet included the prior statements of this witness, and the third item of that packet, which has not been admitted into evidence or yet shown to the witness, is a statement this witness made, which bears K-number K0294788, and that's the document I'm asking be shown to the witness.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, do you see your signature on the bottom of that document?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And do you see the signature of Pascal Kalisa, the representative of the prosecutor of the tribunal of first instance, next to your signature on the bottom?
A.	Apart from the fact that I told you I did not remember the name of the person who interviewed me -- I, however, see his signature just near mine.
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that in this statement that you signed, which is dated**********************, in the second question you were asked: "Do you recognise having distributed firearms to Interahamwe and having sent them for training sessions?"  And your answer was: "No, it is not me who committed such acts."  Was that your statement?
A.	That is my answer as it appears in this document, but I'd explained to you already that the only documents of mine which you should consider truthful are those prepared after my guilty plea and confession.  Any other documents prior to that period should not be considered as true.
Q.	So we can agree, then, can we not, that when you told the prosecutor in Rwanda in a signed statement that you had not distributed firearms or sent Interahamwe for training sessions, that you were lying; correct?
A.	What I'm saying is that you cannot attach importance to the documents which I prepared before my guilty plea.  That's what it means.
Q.	And what I'm asking you is whether or not when you made the statement that it is not you who committed the acts of distributing firearms to the Interahamwe, and having sent Interahamwe for training sessions, when you made that statement to the official of the government of Rwanda, you were telling lies; correct?
A.	All the statements I made before my guilty plea are untrue.  I hereby repeat that.  I made all those statements just to protect myself.
Q.	And in question 4 when you were asked if you launched attacks in Gitarama, you were asked in question 4: "What is your comments on the allegations, according to which you even launched attacks in Gitarama?"  And your answer was: "It is a lie.  I went to Gitarama three times only."  So, that statement you made was not true, was it?
A.	That is not truth; I mean, that answer.
Q.	And, in fact, you were accusing the people who were claiming that you had launched attacks in Gitarama, you said that they were lying, but it was you who was lying; correct?
A.	Counsel, I think I have explained this to you.  All my statements prior to the ****************************** should not be considered as valid documents.  I said this when I started giving evidence, and now I'm repeating.
Q.	Yes, it's not necessary to repeat that.  My point is that not only did you lie to the officials of the Rwandan government, but you accused other people of lying when those people were telling the truth; correct?
A.	If I have asked you not to attach any importance to all those statements, why do you keep belabouring the point?  All the statements I recorded from the time of my arrest and prior to my guilty plea are invalid.
Q.	Mr. Witness, the importance to be attached to your statements is a matter for the Trial Chamber to decide, so it would be simpler if you answer my questions, rather than repeating that same admonition.  If the Trial Chamber wishes not to attach any importance to your statements, they are free to do so.  In the meantime, it's necessary for you to answer my questions, or else we are just delaying the proceedings.  The point I'm trying to make, Witness --
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson, but the witness's answers were responsive, and I think it's inappropriate for Mr. Robinson to suggest otherwise to the witness.  He's repeated himself several times, but we have to accept the answer that he has given us.  It was responsive to the question that was put to him.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, was that -- if that was an objection, would you like to make a ruling?  Or if that was a comment, I'll just move on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it was a comment.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, when you made this statement to Pascal Kalisa, the prosecutor in Rwanda, you not only lied --
A.	If I understand you very well, unless you don't want to compel me to accept what you want, if it is not a written instruction, then perhaps you can read it out to me so that I'm going to comply with the instructions, but I am repeating that I am not attaching any importance to all documents and statements that I recorded before I entered my guilty plea before the Rwandan authorities.
Q.	Thank you, Witness HH.  My question to you is that not only did you lie, but you accused others of lying when those people are really telling the truth; isn't that right?
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, I am objecting to the form of this question.  We've gone -- Mr. Robinson has asked the same thing at least three or four times now.  I think I've already made clear to the Trial Chamber the stand that we take with respect to statements elicited from witnesses under duress and coercion, which seems to be what the witness is suggesting here.  So, for Mr. Robinson to constantly use the word "lie" is disruptive or is deceptive, and it's unfair to the witness.

In re-examination, I'll go back to this issue and clarify it for the Trial Chamber, but I think it's tying up matters now.  Obviously, the witness objects to that characterisation, and there's good basis for that.  So, I'd request that the Court instruct Mr. Robinson not to accuse the witness of lying under the circumstances that this statement was taken.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, there's been no evidence about that -- the circumstances under which the statement was taken.  And I think it's -- from now on, when Mr. Webster makes a comment, I would ask that you direct the witness to take off his headphones because he seems to be simply prompting his witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You see, you've reached this stage now where I might have to intervene, and the witness has admitted on more than one occasion that the statements he made were false.  Just to make him repeat, that becomes oppressive, and that's what you seem to be doing.  And we don't like the use of pejoratives, and you have used it too often.  The witness has admitted that what he said wasn't true --
MR. ROBINSON:
Well --
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- so, it will be entered on the record.  So, you can move on.
MR. ROBINSON:
That part is on the record, Your Honour, but the next point I'm trying to make -- the witness has not only told things that were untrue, but he accused people who were telling truthful things of lying, so that's a second level of deception that I would like to establish through this witness.  And he has not yet answered that question, which is why I have had to put it to him several times.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	My question was that you not only, yourself, made false statements, but you accused other people, who were telling the truth, of lying.  I think I am entitled to an answer to that question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness can answer that question.
THE WITNESS:
If I consider the way you have put that question to me, it's a question which I've been asked on several occasions, but I must tell you, sir, that all the statements which I gave before my guilty plea are not true.  What do you want me to add?
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What I would like you to add is that in those statements that were not true, you accused people of lying when you knew they were telling the truth.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, the witness's answer, it's all embracing.  He says "everything in those statements".  That means what he said about himself and about other people, they were untrue.
MR. ROBINSON:
If that's the way the Trial Chamber takes it, then I can move on.
JUDGE SHORT:
That's the way I see it.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.

Mr. President, at this time I will offer the statement as Exhibit D. NZ192.  There is also a French and English version, which would be Kinyarwanda, 192A; French, 192B; and English 192C.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence.
MR. ROBINSON:
And it should be under seal also.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ192A, D. NZ192B and D. NZ192C admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, can you tell us, approximately, the next time that you were interviewed by any Rwandan authorities?
A.	The next time -- apart from that first person who questioned me and who came to the prison for me to sign my statement, no other Rwandan authority questioned me.
Q.	And that's true up to the present date, today?
A.	No one else questioned me in connection with my case file.
Q.	Have you been questioned by Rwandan authorities in connection with any other case files besides your own?
A.	I testified in the Gacaca proceedings regarding events which occurred in my place of residence.
Q.	And can you tell us, approximately, when you gave that testimony?
A.	I think it was in 2005.
Q.	Have there been any other occasions on which you have been questioned by authorities in Rwanda or testified in cases other than your own?
A.	Yes.  Questions were put to me, but I don't deem it necessary to refer to those issues here and now.
Q.	Thank you, Witness HH, but that's up to the Judge to determine, what's necessary and what's not.  So, can you tell us, on what other occasions you have been questioned by Rwandan authorities or have testified in cases other than your own?
A.	Counsel, what I'm saying in answer to your question is that I cannot give any answer in this courtroom because of the way I know you and when you go to Kigali the things which are said.  I cannot dare give any answer to you in your presence.  Perhaps, if you are out of this courtroom, I may answer the Judges, but definitely not in your presence.
Q.	Thank you, Witness HH.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask you to order the witness to answer the question.

Excuse me, can the witness take his headphones off before Mr. Webster addresses the Chamber?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you may take off your headphones.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, perhaps it would be appropriate for the Court to enquire of the witness exactly what he means and probe a bit further in his response, because I don't think it's necessarily clear for the record.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, this is my cross-examination.  I don't think it's necessary for the Court to take it over.  It's a question that's relevant.  I -- there's no legal basis for the witness to refuse to answer it, so I think if you ordered him to answer it, then that would solve the problem.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, what I heard the witness say is that he would answer the question if it came from the Court, and he began to explain why, and I think to move forward the Court needs to make further enquiries from the witness.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not suggesting that the witness should not answer the question.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I heard the witness say he didn't want to give an answer in my presence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, we have heard both of you.  We'll make our-- we are just thinking about it, and we will give you a ruling in a minute.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the function -- I'm sorry.  Can you hear me now?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
One of the functions of the Trial Chamber is to ensure that the questions put to you by counsel conform with the rules which govern our proceedings.  Now, in this particular case, the question put by Mr. Robinson is a permissible question.  It is normal for counsel in a cross-examination to try to elicit information from witnesses about previous statements they have made, to assist the Court to determine whether the story they have told in this court is consistent with the stories that you've told before.

Now, you have already stated in this court that all the statements you made before a certain date are not truthful, but it would still be a permissible exercise for the Court to have a list of the statements that you made before that date.  So, that is the question which you are permitted to answer -- that you are required to answer. 

Now, in view of the comment that you made, the personality of the person who is asking you the question, we cannot take cognisance of it.  We have to look at the question to see if it is permitted or not.  So, any personal reservations you have about your questioner is (sic) not really important at this stage.  If, however, you feel that there are -- particular questions which are asked of you may have an impact upon your security, you are, in fact, invited to draw our attention to it at any time.  So, I'm again giving you permission to raise an enquiry with us if there's any particular question which you think threatens your security, and we will take the appropriate action.  Do you understand?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand you, Mr. President, and I thank you.  But as to the question put to me by Counsel Robinson and which might be a threat to my safety, he had asked me if I had met the Rwandan authorities.  It is true that I did meet those authorities, but if I give him any details, in view of his conduct when he arrives at the prison, it could compromise my safety.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are going to have to ask you for an explanation because we don't understand the way in which the answer to that question could compromise your safety.  But in asking you to offer an explanation, I have to tell you that we don't want our trial to become diverted into having to investigate issues that are peripheral and not relevant to the indictment that we are trying.  But with that limitation, I would have to ask you to explain in what way the answering to the question that was put to you could compromise your safety.
THE WITNESS:
The problem is -- I am speaking of Robinson like that, because when he comes to Kigali he has associates among my co-detainees.  Some things said by witnesses here he relates to other detainees, which can give rise to problems in the prison.  You can be attacked in the prison because of that.

There are two parties in the prison: the party of those who have pled guilty, and the party of those who have not yet pleaded guilty.  When those who have not pleaded guilty hear of information by witnesses who have pled guilty, they spread the word in the prison.  I'm speaking the truth.  I do not trust him.  If I gave some information here, I am sure that he will relate all this information when he gets to Kigali.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness --
MR. WITNESS:
I'm listening.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- the lawyers who appear in our Trial Chamber, in our court, are bound to observe certain rules and they are bound to observe the spirit and the terms of the protection orders that we have made.  And the Chamber remains ready to enforce those rules.  If there is a breach of those rules, or you believe there's a breach of those rules, a report should be made to WVSS, or to the Prosecutor, and they will be able to conduct appropriate inquiries and bring the matter to our attention in the proper fashion and we will take the proper action.  Any such allegation will have to be dealt with as a separate matter, not part of this trial.  But we are committed to enforce the standards of behaviour for all officers of our trial and to ensure that the protection orders have proper meaning and are observed.

Now, with regard to the question that has been put to you, it is a question which you have to answer, and if as a result of answering that question, you observe or believe that there has been improper use of information you are giving to us, then the remedy that you have is to report the matter to the WVSS, or to the Prosecutor, who will take the necessary steps to bring the matter before our attention for further action.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:
I am delighted, Mr. President, by this response.  I am very pleased that I can turn either to the Prosecutor or the witness protection section.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now -- Witness, now, you can tell us: at which time and in which matter you have been questioned by Rwandan authorities in cases other than your own?
A.	I answered the question regarding my trial.  I gave you the date on which I met the Rwandan authority.  I added that last year I testified before my cellule's Gacaca court.  I think that that is the answer you are trying to elicit.
Q.	Well, no, Witness, actually, I already had understood you very well about that.  But my question is: can you tell us when you have been questioned in cases other than your own and in which cases you have been questioned?
A.	Counsel, I think the President gave me instructions as to the people I should speak to.  I think that what I am saying could compromise my safety and reveal my identity.  I have already said I don't have confidence in you because every time you go to Kigali you speak with the detainees, the prisoners, and after you leave, problems arise between those who have accepted to come and testify here and those who have refused to do so.  Because I know that when you put questions to the witnesses who come here, your purpose is to go to speak to other people in Kigali, to confront their opinions as to what was stated here before this Trial Chamber --
Q.	Witness, I think you have --
A.	-- so I will only answer your question on instructions of the Trial Chamber.
Q.	Witness, so far, I think you have misunderstood those instructions.  The Trial Chamber instructed you to answer the question, so, please, answer the answer.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, this may be an issue for closed session.  I'm not quite sure, and this is why I make this enquiry now.  But it may be that the witness testified against other persons without them knowing his identity.  And if it's his identity that has been compromised, then revealing who he has testified against may be a concern.  So, that's something that the Court can consider, and perhaps we can ask the witness whether he'd be more comfortable in answering that question in closed session.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you see, that is exactly what the witness said.  He said, "I think that what I'm saying could compromise my safety and reveal my identity."  Without knowing in advance what the witness will say, we cannot make an objective assessment.  But I think that it is our duty to act on the basis of his testimony and the opinion that he had expressed in this manner.

Mr. Robinson, if you want to persist with this question at this time, we will have to go into closed session.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I propose then that the witness simply be given a piece of paper and asked either to write himself or to instruct the registrar to write down on that piece of paper the date, as best as he can recall, and the name of the person in whose case he was questioned.  I don't think we have to go into closed session for that.  He can either write that himself, or he can have a secretary, in the form of our registrar, to take that information down.  We can admit that under seal, and that would solve the problem.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, that is something that can be done.  If we admit a document under seal, it remains confidential and its contents cannot be revealed.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, what I thought I was given to understand was that if I did not want to answer this question, I had to specify the reasons leading me to decline to answer either to the Prosecutor or to WVSS, the section responsible for protecting witnesses.  I think if -- with your permission, I could at lunchtime specify my reasons and have them conveyed to you in writing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not necessary.  There are two issues here: the questions that you can refuse to answer are those which could incriminate you.  Now, we have made an order to protect --
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, as I said at the very outset, it's because Defence counsel is inviting me to mention the name of Rwandan authorities with whom I have spoken.  I think that if I go about mentioning their names, it will compromise my safety once I'm back in Rwanda, so I would like to beg you to allow me to stipulate the reasons leading me to decline answering this question.  Unfortunately, I'm not very fast, which is why I asked you to grant me the lunch break to draft a document in response to that, the reasons for declining to answer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The point I was trying to make to you is this: that is not a reason for not answering; that would be a reason for us to take steps to ensure that your answer cannot be revealed to anybody.  If we feel that answer was given in a closed session, or you wrote it in this a document we declared to be under seal, it would be an offence for Mr. Robinson, or for anybody else, to disclose the information that was revealed to the Trial Chamber in that manner.  So, the interests that you have explained will be protected by us taking one of two steps: either you give the evidence orally in a closed session, or you write it on a document, which will be admitted in evidence, under seal.  Any revelation of that information outside of the confines of our Trial Chamber's requirements would be an offence which the Court will punish if it had improperly occurred.  So, Mr. Robinson would be obliged to honour the confidentiality of the information if it was revealed in that manner.  Do you understand?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I've understood that.  I don't want to persist along those lines.  If you could give me a piece of paper, I will write down all the information during the lunch break.  Now, if you are not comfortable with that, then I am ready to answer the questions in closed session, but that would mean I have been compelled to do so.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, would it be in order for the witness to write it during the lunch break?

Can you move on to another subject now?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, you were interviewed for the first time by officers -- investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor for this International Tribunal in February of 1998; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	And the first investigators that you say, according to their report, was Mamadou Cone -- that's M-A-M-A-D-O-U, Kone, K-O-N-E -- and Mamadou Camara, C-A-M-A-R-A, and they saw you at the prison; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is correct.
Q.	And after you provided them with the information concerning -- answering their questions, you signed a statement; correct?
A.	Yes, I did sign.
Q.	And when you signed that statement, you certified that the information you were giving was true and correct; isn't that right?
A.	Yes, that was the practice at the time.
Q.	But, in fact, the information that you gave to these two gentlemen from the Office of the Prosecutor was not correct; isn't that right?
A.	I had already told you that, when you put that document to me, what I told them was not the truth.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I am thinking that that's becoming oppressive for you to make the witness say that over and over again.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President.  Mr. President, at this time I would like to add the witness statements of the 16th of February 1998 introduced as D. NZ193A for the French, and 193B for the English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  They should be under seal, Mr. Robinson, shouldn't they?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ193A and D. NZ193B admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness HH, during your meeting with the investigators on the 16th of February 1998, they have reported that you told them about a meeting that you attended at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 24th April 1994.  Did you attend a meeting --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  The registrar has drawn my attention to the numbering, she is saying she thinks the numbering is 193, not 198.
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry, I thought -- I meant to say 193.  I may have misspoke.  I'm sorry.  That's correct.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness HH, did you tell these investigators that you attended a meeting at Hôtel des Diplomates on the 24th of April 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And did you, in fact, attend that meeting at the Diplomat hotel on the 24th of April 1994?
A.	I can't remember the dates.  All what I can remember is that it happened in April.
Q.	Well, you have told us that the -- of one meeting that you attended at the Hôtel des Diplomates which you claimed to have taken place before the interim government left Kigali.  In fact, I believe you said it was on the day they left Kigali, which would have made it on the 11th of April.  So, my question to you is whether or not you attended any meeting at the Diplomat hotel after the government had left Kigali.
A.	Yes, Counsel, I know there is some answer you are seeking, but let me repeat to you that I attended a meeting at Hôtel des Diplomates.  I cannot be more specific than that regarding the date.  By way of a reference point concerning that meeting, I said we were with Dallaire's representative at that time, when Dallaire's representative chaired the meeting, and I gave you some information regarding what was discussed during that meeting.  Those were the benchmarks I gave you.  Concerning the dates, I cannot be specific.
Q.	So is it possible that this meeting took place after the interim government had left Kigali?
A.	Counsel, just take it that it was in April.
Q.	Now, you claim to have seen some ministers and other officials during the course of that day that you were at the Diplomat hotel.  And if the government had left Kigali by then, then it is unlikely those people would have been there.  So, how do you explain to us that you can't tell us whether this meeting took place before or after the 12th of April?
A.	If you say the government had left Kigali at that time, do you think a minister could not have been in Kigali even though the government had moved?  In any case, I used to see some members of government in Kigali.  Now, talking about that meeting at the Diplomat hotel, I saw Callixte Nzabonimana, who was a minister of youth affairs.
Q.	Well, when you were being interviewed by the Prosecution in 1998, this -- let me read you what you said.  You said that "On 24th of April 1994, I attended a meeting held at Hôtel des Diplomates which was chaired by Marcel Gatsinzi.  The meeting was attended by all the Interahamwe leaders; conseillers de secteur of the city; the leaders of the MDR, CDR and PSD youth wings; and a representative of the préfet."  And you said that "Along with Gatsinzi, there was Colonel Kanyamanza" -- that's K-A-N-Y-A-M-A-N-Z-A -- "and two UNAMIR colonels sent by General Dallaire.  The colonels were white and spoke French.  Marcel Gatsinzi called upon the participants to stop the killing and take the people arrested at the roadblocks to the préfecture.  The speech was mainly a message of peace and pacification."  And you went on to say that immediately after the UNAMIR delegates left, weapons were distributed.  Now, the meeting that you've described on 1998 is similar to the meeting that you have described here today.  And I'm asking you whether or not -- since you place the date of the 24th of April 1994 at that time, whether or not that was a relatively accurate date for this meeting.
A.	But, Counsel, I have told you that you have to look at my pre-guilty plea documents as not valid.  Those were documents which were prepared in 1998.  I have told you that it was from 2004 that I started giving, of my own free will, documents with true contents.  I don't attach any importance to any pre-2004 documents.  That is what I had said a long time ago.  Even before I started giving my statements to investigators of this Tribunal, I said all pre-2004 statements and documents should be considered as not valid.  I don't know why you are revisiting this matter.
Q.	Well, Witness HH, one reason I am revisiting this particular matter is that we've had testimony from another witness in this trial that there was a meeting on the 24th of April 1994 at the Diplomat hotel, which that witness attended and which was attended by Interahamwe secteur leaders, as well as representatives of UNAMIR, and so I am wondering whether or not this was just a coincidence, that you made up some fictitious information and placed the same date, or whether there is some factual basis in your answer in 1998, and perhaps the meeting with UNAMIR did take place on the 24th of April.  So, can you tell us whether or not what you said about the meeting on the 24th of April in 1998 has any basis in fact?
A.	I don't think there is need to rely on that date, that is, 24th of April 1994, because I am telling you that I stated freely saying the truth, with my own conscience, from November 2004.  I think you are wasting your time when you go and look at my pre-guilty plea documents.  Now, start with the documents given in the year 2004 to put questions to me.  That was the time I freely gave my statements and I decided to say the truth.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer in as Exhibit D. NZ170 -- 194, a interview statement on the 23rd of February 1998 given by this witness to the Office of the Prosecutor.  I'm content to simply offer the document and have it accepted, rather than question the witness about it, unless you would like me to ask him some questions about it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I have made my position my clear, that I don't think it's necessary to get the witness to repeat that the document is false.  I said it several times.
MR. ROBINSON:
So may the document be admitted then as D. NZ --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It's admitted in evidence.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  That would be D. NZ194A for the French and 194B for the English, under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal; it's admitted under seal.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
 (Exhibit No.  D. NZ194A and D. NZ194B admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would like to offer, also under seal, as my next exhibit an investigator's note of an interview with this witness at the prison.  The document has K0356108 as the French version and K0348849 as the English version.  It's three pages.  It has no date, but I would ask that that be received as D. NZ195.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is also to be under seal?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, also under seal and --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
 (Exhibit No.  D. NZ195A and D. NZ195B admitted, under seal)

MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And I ask that 195A be the French and 195B be the English.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now.  Witness HH, I have an interview report of the investigators having spoken with you at the prison, and again you spoke about the meeting on the 24th of April.  And this time you said that the decision was made to distribute weapons in the secteurs after this meeting by Colonel Marcel Gatsinzi and Léonidas Rusatira.  And my question to you was whether or not, during your false statement to the Prosecution, you were accusing innocent people of having distributed weapons.
A.	Before answering you, I would like to ask you to perhaps refer to the statement I gave after this statement, that is, the statement given after 2004.  I cannot keep on accepting what you are putting to me because I have already given you my personal reasons, and I have never denied that what I said was not the truth.  So, what I'm saying is that that document should not be of any relevance in this court, and, if necessary, I can explain to you why I am not attaching any importance to that document.
Q.	Witness HH, it's the position of Mr. Nzirorera that you are falsely accusing him of acts, in this courtroom and in your statement.  And my question to you is whether in the past you have falsely accused others of committing acts during the genocide, and I'm specifically referring to General Gatsinzi and Colonel Rusatira.  Now, did you falsely accuse those men?
A.	Listen, sir, you keep on forcing me to accept what you are putting to me.  I don't understand why.  That doesn't mean that I don't understand your question, but what I don't understand is why you keep on badgering me with the same questions, whereas I have already told you that the evidence I am giving now is the most updated statement.  Consider all post-*********************** statements as true.
Q.	Witness, there's difference between --
A.	Regarding any statements and documents prior to that year, well, sir, you are wasting your time.
Q.	Witness HH, there's a difference between denying something you have done, and falsely accusing an innocent person, and I'm asking you whether you falsely accused Colonel Rusatira and General Gatsinzi of distributing weapons; yes or no?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, it's obvious that any question you put to the witness about anything he said in those previous statements, you are going to get the same answer, that you should ignore all the statements he made before 2004 and only pay attention to the statements he made after 2004.  So, no matter how you turn around the question, no matter what allegation you put to him about those statements, we are going to get the same answer.

And it seems to be an exercise in futility.

If you tender all these documents, you can address us on that.  He is saying that everything, each and every statement he made in those statements, you should consider to be false.  Once they are in evidence, you can address us on them and then we will know what to make of those statements.  But if you keep asking him the same questions put in different language, we will get the same answer.  And that's been obvious for the last 30 minutes or so.
MR. ROBINSON:
All right.  That's correct -- you are very correct about that Judge Short.  But, to me, it seems that the inmates are running the asylum.  Because -- he has to answer questions.  He can't avoid answering questions by keeping repeating the same avoidance and then that be acceptable in a court.  If he doesn't answer a question, someone needs to encourage him to answer the question because it's a valid point that someone who was willing to falsely accuse others is deserving of less credit than someone who simply falsely denies their own participation.  So, I think it's -- if I'm unsuccessful in convincing this witness to give me a straight answer to the question, then I would ask the Trial Chamber to assist me, but it's not satisfactory to let the witness avoid answering questions by simply repeating the same mantra.  So, I would ask that at this time -- I asked a legitimate question.  I think it deserves a legitimate answer, and I would ask the Trial Chamber to order the witness to simply state whether or not he falsely accused General Gatsinzi and Colonel Rusatira, and we can move on.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, what's the difference between saying that everything in those statements were false, and saying that "I falsely accuse General Gatsinzi of distributing weapons"?  What's the difference?
MR. ROBINSON:
The difference is that there -- that to make the general statement that everything in those statements are false is not really accurate because there are some things in the statement that are true.  He talks -- he does say some things that are actually true about events, and --
JUDGE SHORT:
Isn't that a matter for your address?
MR. ROBINSON:
Do you want me to go through everything that he said, "Is it true or false?", "True or false?"  I'm picking --
JUDGE SHORT:
No, no, no.
MR. ROBINSON:
-- out the highlights.
JUDGE SHORT:
That's exactly what we don't want.  Because it seems, from the last series of questions you have asked, that every item in those statements that you extract and put to the witness, he gives you the same answer, that you should pay no attention to anything that is said in those statements.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I understand that, but that -- to me, that doesn't go far enough because there are things in his statement, for example, he says, "I was in charge of Interahamwe in my secteur" - well, that's obviously true, so I don't think it's worth while for me to point out the true things that are in these statements.  I've asked him -- I've directed his attention to one particular item in a three-page statement.  I think I should be able to get an answer as to whether that particular item -- in that particular item he falsely accused another person.  If it turns out that he did, he can say "yes", and it's a simple matter.  But to let the witness control the -- what he wants to answer and what he doesn't, I don't think is right.  So, I'm asking the Trial Chamber to order the witness to answer that simple question.
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, there's a factual enquiry that I have, and I'd rather not go back to it in re-direct, and perhaps it may assist the Trial Chamber and Mr. Robinson, and that's to ask the witness if the date of the 24th of April, in these statements of 1998, is the date that he volunteered, or a date that was suggested to him by the investigators.  Now, I'd rather not have to go back to the statements in re-direct, and if Mr. Robinson addressed this issue, maybe he wants to put that question to the witness.
THE WITNESS:
The Prosecutor just asked a question regarding the 24th.  I don't know anything about that date of the 24th of April, which Robinson has been putting to me.  So, let him keep on putting questions to me regarding questions and statements after****************.  Because if they are concerning statements before*******************, I'm not going to answer him.  He should consider the statements I gave freely.  If he keeps on putting questions to me on documents before that date, then we will be playing a hide-and-seek game here.

1230H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's 12:30, it's time for the lunch recess.  

Mr. Robinson, it is not that the question you put was in improper question.  That's not the issue.  What is bothering us is that the -- the answer is already on the record, so -- so even if -- but we are a little bit concerned that to get the witness to constantly repeat the fact that he has not told the truth in those statements seems to have little effect, little purpose, other than to humiliate him.  We -- so that's the problem that's bothering us at the moment, that the witness is being treated in an oppressive manner when it doesn't affect the presentation of your case.  The point that you wish to make has already been made.  So we have enough information on the record for us to determine what effect does the fact that the witness did not speak the truth in the statements to the authorities prior to*********************.  It's implicit in the answers he has given that he has made false accusations against people, and he has made false statements of himself.  That information is there.  We can compare the details of those statements with details of his testimony in court and identify the areas of inconsistency, and we have information on this issue which will enable us to assess what weight and reliance we can place on his testimony.  We don't approve questioning that has no -- that seems to have no purpose other than humiliation and making him feel badly.  To make a man say, "I've not told the truth" over and over again does not seem to be necessary for the purpose of our trial.  That's the way we see it at the moment.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President.  If you're satisfied to accept that as a matter of fact that the witness falsely accused others, I can move on.  That's really -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's implicit from his testimony.  We think it's implicit from his testimony.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Then I don't need to go any further than that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it's time to take the lunch adjournment now, isn't it?  
(Court recessed from 1237H to 1422H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon. 

Mr. Robinson, you may continue. 

Sorry, before you do, there was an issue with regard to the transcript.  The court reporters have drawn it to our attention that on the 8th of November it was unclear whether Exhibits P. 35 and P. 36 were admitted, and we'd like to confirm for the record that these exhibits were admitted on that day. 
Now, Mr. Witness, I see you're trying to attract my attention.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, much obliged, Mr. President.  As you asked me this morning, you asked me to draw up a list that I did not want to show to you because I said the Defence counsel should not be informed of this list, but I have now compiled said list.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Can we see the list, please, Mr. Registrar?  

The witness has prepared a document in the Kinyarwanda language.  In view of his statement that the contents of this document could disclose his identity, and in order for the document to be translated into languages that the Trial Chamber can utilise, it will be necessary to go into a closed session so that the witness can read the letter and we can get a translation of it. 

For the benefit of the public, I'm very sorry that we have to do this, but it's an essential that we must take to protect the witness's identity at this stage.  

So we go into a closed session for a sort time. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 34 to 38] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 32 to 33 by Sherri Knox) 
















MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you may proceed now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I'm going to take your suggestion and not ask any more questions about the contents of the false statements that the witness has made, but I do want to introduce two remaining false statements into evidence.  So, the first one which I would ask be admitted under seal as D. NZ196 is a document entitled confirmation before Mohammed Ayat, A-Y-A-T, and Geir, that's G-E-I-R, Bing, B-I-N-G, at Kigali central prison.  It's undated, but it a bears K number K0356100. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ196A AND d. NZ196B admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And the second one is reconfirmation of the 12th of June 2003 at Kigali prison before Don Webster and Geir Bing, and I would ask that the French be admitted under seal as D. NZ197A and the English under seal at D. NZ197B.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ197A and D. NZ197B admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, have you ever been interviewed by authorities from the government of Belgium? 
A.	I think that's the very question that started the debate which isn't yet terminated.  I should like to tell you that I might answer after the contents of the letter have been scrutinised, examined.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think at this point we should scrutinise the contents of the letter, since I'm unable to make any progress, even on other issues.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, as the witness has stated, that really is the same issue.  It's just a different detail of it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, he was ordered to give the list of the times he's been interviewed by the Rwandan government.  I just asked him if he'd been interviewed by the Belgian government.  I don't see why the same issue would apply if he's -- it's either a yes or no to that question, and then I could ask the contents of the discussion.  It's not giving the name of any individual who he incriminated or anything of the same concerns.  He can simply say yes or no.  If the answer is yes, then I want to ask some more question about the statement, but it's not of the same nature of -- at least as the concerns that we're speculating he has expressed concerning being -- it being known that he's incriminated other individuals. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, my problem is that we don't know what are the concerns that he has detailed. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Which is why we should be finding those concerns. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what we're trying to do.  Is it not possible to address another issue?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, it is possible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're not stopping you from doing it, but there's a question, really, of how do we utilise our time better -- best. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, you've told us that you first joined the Interahamwe in about May or June of 1992 and that thereafter you were appointed by Jean-Pierre Turatsinze to be**********************************.  Is that correct? 
A.	It wasn't Turatsinze who appointed me.  Rather, he was one of the people who encouraged me to join the Interahamwe.  
Q.	I understand that, but when it came time for you to be appointed as the****************************** ***********************************************, was it not Mr. Turatsinze who appointed you to that position? 
A.	No, it wasn't only Turatsinze, because he was not able to take a decision by himself, of his own accord. 
Q.	And so can you tell us how it was that you became*******************************? 
A.	You're entitled to a repetition.  I told you that before me, someone else was in that post, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  It's a well-known name.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Maybe it should be struck. 
THE WITNESS:
And at one point he was guilty of bad conduct, poor behaviour.  And in the course of a meeting, the Interahamwe denounced that bad behaviour, where we were in the meeting at (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Maybe another one to be struck.  
THE WITNESS:
It was suggested that I succeed him in that position, so let it be clear that it wasn't Turatsinze who appointed me to that position.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
One of the things that we have been wondering about is whether stating the name of the person whom he succeeded in the office is identifying information.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
It probably is, Mr. President.  He's been stating that name for the last week.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know.  We -- it's a matter that we were considering as we were reviewing the testimony up to now. 

Mr. Webster, do you have any suggestions?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I think that I had even mentioned this particular point yesterday or the day before, because globally, the minute we talk about his successive positions at the various levels, it starts to reveal his identity, not globally, but to the persons that associated with him in that context, which are certainly the persons that he has reason to -- to be uneasy about in the prison.  

So, all I can suggest at this point is that we put that particular name under seal, and we just do the best we can as we move along.  But this is not a perfect world, and all we can do is make our best good-faith efforts.  We can do that, but there's not much more that we can do.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, then we'll redact the name of the person whom he succeeded. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Is that something you would like to do for the entire testimony?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think so.  I think that would be appropriate.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness HH, can you tell us, was there a president of the Interahamwe for the commune Nyarugenge?  
A.	There was no Interahamwe president for Nyarugenge commune --
Q.	And was there -- 
A.	-- in the sense that he was not present. 
Q.	Who do you mean by that? 
A.	If I say that he was not present, it is something that I have explained on a number of occasions.  I said that presidents at secteur level were grouped together, and the presidents of secteurs of the town and the vicinity elected their leaders, which means that we consider that person to be a coordinator of Interahamwe presidents at secteur level.  So, he was not considered to be the president -- or an Interahamwe president at commune level, and I believe that I have explained that fact on a number of occasions. 
Q.	Was there a president of the Interahamwe for the commune Kacyiru?  
A.	There was no president at commune level for Kacyiru.  However, there was a group of Interahamwe presidents at secteur level within the town, and when I say the town, I mean the three communes. 
Q.	Was there a president of the Interahamwe at the level of the commune Kicukiro? 
A.	There was no president at commune level. 
Q.	Was there a president of the Interahamwe at the level of Kigali-ville préfecture? 
A.	I explained to you how the situation was, but you persist in putting questions to me of that nature, so I shall repeat what I said.  Of the three communes that made up Kigali-ville, there were presidents for the Interahamwe at all secteurs and also for those secteurs in the vicinity of Kigali.  At one moment in time, all those presidents came together and elected a leader, and that leader was to act as a coordinator.  Now, I never saw a leader at communal level, and that is coming from somebody who observed this, and that is what I can say in your response to your question.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness HH.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think it's necessary to go into closed session for my next series of questions, which I hope would be the only time that we go into closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We go into closed session now.

(Pages 39 to 42 by Sherri Knox) 









1700H 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, I'm reminding you that we are now in open session, so hopefully we won't have any problems concerning revealing your identity.  I want to ask you about testimony you gave as to officials of the Interahamwe who were elected in the various prefectures throughout Rwanda.  You have told us that a man named Munyagereke, M-U-N-Y-A-G-E-R-E-K-E, was elected president for Butare préfecture; is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not what I said. 
Q.	Remind us, then, of what you said. 
A.	I said the following:  The person who used to come to the MRND office was called Banyangiriki and he was a trader.  And, as a result, I came to the conclusion that he was Interahamwe president, but I never declared that he had been elected to that post. 
Q.	Who told you that he was the president of the Interahamwe for Butare préfecture? 
A.	There might be a number of elements to my response to this.  When we sat at Turatsinze's office there were a number of officials that would come and speak with Turatsinze or with the secretary general of the party.  It was Habinshuti who told us that when we were at that location, and he told us that he was the president of the Interahamwe.  He said that that man supported the Interahamwe and that as a result he was the president.  He said that that individual was the one to provide assistance for the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And from that you concluded that he was the president of the Interahamwe for Butare préfecture? 
A.	Yes, that is how I understood the situation. 
Q.	Now for Byumba préfecture, you told us that Jean-Baptiste Gatete was the president of that préfecture Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that fact on the basis that Gatete used to come to the MRND office.  And he would discuss the problems that the Interahamwe came up against with Turatsinze.  And from that I deduced that he was the president of the Interahamwe for that region. 
Q.	Well, just because someone came and spoke to Turatsinze, what made you think that they had been elected president of the Interahamwe for that préfecture? 
A.	Counsel, you are still insisting on the fact that that person was elected, but that is not what I said.  I told you that I often saw him at the party headquarters, and that when he came there he would talk first and foremost to Turatsinze, and then he would go and talk to Mathieu.  We were often at the party headquarters.  And we thought that he was the president of the Interahamwe for Byumba secteur. 
Q.	Did you mean Byumba préfecture? 
A.	Yes, the Interahamwe from Murambi were very much part of the news at that time.  So we considered him to be the president of the Interahamwe for Byumba préfecture. 
Q.	Now, you have testified that the president of the Interahamwe for Cyangugu préfecture was        Youssef Munyakazi; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And Munyakazi is 66 on the spelling list.  Where did you get that information?
A.	I got that information from Turatsinze, and we were not alone.  We were informed as********************** *********************************************, and we were informed of that fact when we were at the MRND headquarters where that person came to tell us what was going on in the -- amongst the Interahamwe of Cyangugu préfecture. 
Q.	Now, you have testified that the president of the Interahamwe for Gitarama préfecture was               Silas Kubwimana, which is number 54 on the spelling list; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And where did you get that information? 
A.	It was that very person who told me about it.  Often when there was a meeting, there were reports drafted on the subject of the Interahamwe within Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	Did he tell you that he had been elected to that position? 
A.	We did not talk about that.  We never talked about that fact, notably, whether he had been elected or not. 
Q.	Do you recall who the president of the Interahamwe was in Gikongoro préfecture? 
A.	No, I do not recall the name of that person. 
Q.	For Gisenyi you told us that the Interahamwe president was Bernard Munyagishari; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And that is M-U-N-Y-A-G-I-S-H-A-R-I.  Do you recall who was the president for Kibungo préfecture? 
A.	I heard people say that his name was Sylvain Mutabaruka, and I often saw him at the party headquarters when he came to tell us what was going on amongst the Interahamwe of his area. 
Q.	And who told you that he had become president of the Interahamwe for Kibungo préfecture? 
A.	The people who gave me that information were -- amongst them was Claude Nshimiye, but I could note that fact to myself when that person, the concerned party, came to the headquarters of the MRND.  And when events were organised in Kibungo prefecture, I saw him in charge of the Interahamwe there.  And everyone was well aware of the fact that he was the Interahamwe leader there. 
Q.	For the préfecture of Kibuye, do you know who was the president of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No, I do not know that person. 
Q.	And what about for the préfecture of Ruhengeri? 
A.	As regards Ruhengeri prefecture, there was Ziragobora, who was also the Cyahafi secteur Interahamwe president, who introduced us to Baheza, who I also saw on a regular basis when he came to the MRND headquarters. 
Q.	Do you know from what part of Ruhengeri Baheza was from? 
A.	I quite simply heard that name, but I did not know from which region he hailed.  I was merely told that he was a businessman. 
Q.	And you saw him at the office of the MRND at the Kabuga building? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately how many times you saw him? 
A.	From what I can recall, in fact, that was when Jean-Pierre Ziragobora talked to us about him. I believe that was on two separate occasions. 
Q.	Was he older or younger than you? 
A.	Well, were I to attempt to provide you with an approximation, I could see that he was older than me at that time, but I didn't ask him his age.  I quite simply made that observation, and I deduced that he was older than I was. 
Q.	Now, Witness HH, I want to put it to you that it is the case of Mr. Nzirorera that there were no Interahamwe presidents at the préfecture level other than Bernard Munyagishari in Gisenyi, who was an employee of the MRND secretariat for that préfecture, and that none of these people had ever taken such a post.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, there is nothing surprising about what you have said or that your client gives you some such information.  You talk about Bernard Munyagishari, well I would like to specify that when I was elected, your client was the secretary general of the party.  But from this moment in time, he has not yet admitted that fact.  And I believe that anybody present in this Trial Chamber can deduce something from that fact. 
Q.	Witness HH, it is the Defence case that you were never elected to any position of the Interahamwe *****************************, and that you have fabricated your position and that of others in order to increase your importance before this Trial Chamber; do you have any comment to that? 
A.	Once again, Counsel, I think there is nothing surprising about what you have just said in view of the fact that you are Defence counsel.  There is nothing strange when you claim that I never occupied a post, of a position of that type.  I know that you go to Kigali on a regular basis and that you conduct investigations there.  And I see that you are denying the fact that I was elected to those positions.  But that is something that happened openly and that everyone was aware of.  And were an investigation to be conducted in order to shed light on this situation, I think that you would come out a loser. 
Q.	Well, can you give me the names of people at the Kigali prison, currently, who were aware that you were elected to the post that you claim to have been elected to**************************************? 
A.	Counsel, you say that I was elected**********************************************************, and I'm saying that that never took place.  Were an investigation to be conducted with reference to what you have just said, I believe that you would come out a loser.  How can you say that I claim those posts to have been mine?  What would my interest be in claiming that those posts were mine?  
Q.	Well, Witness HH, can you give me the names of some people who are currently at Kigali prison who can verify that you held a post************************************************************? 
A.	Counsel, I do not believe that it is a good idea to give you the names of such people in view of the fact that you are Defence counsel.  I would like you to go and talk to prisoners in Kigali.  I know that you go there on a regular basis.  And they will be able to give you information.  What I would like to add is that I note that you are saying that I have lied to the Prosecutor when I claim to have occupied or held such a post.  I believe that the Prosecutor is an intellectual.  And I don't think that he is that easy to mislead.  I believe that he is somebody who has conducted investigations himself with the view to ascertaining whether this information is correct or not. 
Q.	Well, Witness HH, you have told me that if I conduct an investigation I will confirm that you held such a post.  And I am now giving you the opportunity to give me the names of people you think I should talk to who could confirm that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have some problems with the question.  We think that if the witness does that, and then you ask those persons about the witness, using his real name as you would have to, it would reveal his identity. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I wouldn't have to.  I wouldn't have to.  I could simply ask the people, do you know who was elected at this post and --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you don't need him to do that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I don't need him to do that, but he is telling me that he can prove he was in those posts.  I am giving him the opportunity to give me the names of people who can prove it, and then I will go back and see whether that is true or not.  But if he doesn't want to take that opportunity, he doesn't have to. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness HH, would you like to give me the names of any people who could verify that you held the post above that of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thought that you should not ask him. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness HH, you told us you attended the meeting on the 15th of November 1992 in Ruhengeri in which President Habyarimana passed by and made a speech.  Do you claim that Mr. Nzirorera was present at that meeting? 
A.	Counsel, yes, I said that he actually gave a speech.  But before answering your question, I would like you to tell me whether you actually admit to the fact that that speech was ever made, or agree to that fact.
Q.	Well, Witness HH, in fact, I think this is a really -- excuse me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Robinson. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, you have told us that you remember Mr. Nzirorera gave a speech at the Ruhengeri meeting.  And I'm telling you that what you have just said proves beyond any doubt how fraudulent and fabricated your testimony is, because, you see, we have a videotape from the Prosecutor of that entire meeting from the beginning to the end.  And on that videotape we have all of the speeches, and not only that, but on that videotape we have the introductions of all of the people, the personalities who were present.  And it has been established beyond any doubt that Mr. Nzirorera was not present at that meeting, and he didn't give a speech.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, I beg to differ with Mr. Robinson, the suppositions in Mr. Robinson's question.  He can reconsider his question and rephrase it, but there has never been a supposition on behalf of the Prosecutor that that tape records every single moment of the rally in Ruhengeri.  It is a tape.  It is a very long tape, but the Prosecution has never maintained that the tape records every single speech and every single person that was introduced to the crowd there.  There have been several witnesses that have identified Joseph Nzirorera as being present on that date.  Whether he was there or not is a matter for the Court to decide when all of the evidence is considered.  But it is inappropriate to suggest to this witness that it is a Prosecution contention that the tape that we have records everything that took place on that date in Ruhengeri. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
You know, Mr. President, I think Mr. Webster has to say that he is in error here.  Because, first of all, we see on the tape, if he'll watch it again, shows the arrival of President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, but, Mr. Robinson, this is this witness's testimony.  We are going to review the tape as -- when we are reviewing the testimony.  You are -- in putting in -- in challenging the witness's testimony, you are too strong in your language.  I think that is point.  So, you can put to the witness about the tape, but to -- the -- I think your language is too strong in describing what the result or effect of the tape was. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, I put it to you that Mr. Nzirorera was not at this meeting, because we have the tape that shows the people being introduced and he was not among them.  We have the tape that shows the speeches which were made, and he was not among them.  The Prosecutor has Mr. Nzirorera's passport, which it seized at the time of his arrest in Benin, which shows that he was in Brussels on that day.  The Prosecutor has Mr. Nzirorera's hotel bills, which shows that he was in Brussels on that day.  The Prosecutor has Mr. Nzirorera's rental car bills, which show that he was in Brussels on that day.  And I suggest to you that the testimony you have just given, that Mr. Nzirorera was present in Ruhengeri, is totally and completely false.  Do you have anything to say to that? 
A.	What I have to say to you with reference to the meeting held in Ruhengeri, when I said to you that a number of officials were present, notably, MRND officials, and when I talked with the people who were there, I said that Nzirorera was also present.  I suggest that we have a look at the entirety of the videotape so that we can see exactly who spoke during that meeting, and also see all of the officials that were introduced during that meeting. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I think that is a good idea, Witness HH.  
MR. ROBINSON.
And, Mr. President, with your permission I would like to have the witness be given access to         Exhibit P. 11, Prosecution Exhibit 11, which is a collection of four CDs that show this meeting.  And while we are doing other things tomorrow morning, the witness can watch that proceeding.  And I will have some more questions for that -- for him about that tomorrow afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have asked the registrar, the registry to facilitate the viewing of the tape by the witness.  We are not quite certain what arrangements will be made, but it is likely that that will be done tomorrow morning.  As you recall, we are not going to be sitting tomorrow morning.  So we take the adjournment now, and we resume until tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock.  

Mr. Witness, you may have recalled that we had indicated earlier that we would not be sitting tomorrow morning.  And I expect that the time will be utilised for you to have an opportunity to look at the video.  I remind you that you are not to discuss this case or your testimony with anybody during this, as on any other adjournment.  

We'll take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1734H)
