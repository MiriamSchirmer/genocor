ALBERT RUKERANTARE, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, good morning.  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	I would like to remind you that it is necessary to speak slowly and to observe a break or pause between my questions and your answers and also to spell out any proper names that you may refer to in the course of your testimony.  

Yesterday, Mr. Rukerantare, when we broke up, you had just informed us that you were recruited into the security services towards the end of December 1989.  And I went on to ask you which other positions you were posted to thereafter, that is, the -- the -- your career profile and the locations in which you worked.  
A.	Thank you.  Yes.  Indeed yesterday I stated that I began to work for the intelligence services on the 28th of December 1989.  I was replacing at that time a colleague who was a receptionist and who went on holiday or leave.  

Two weeks thereafter I began to receive training as an intelligence agent.  The training lasted for two months, during which we were taught intelligence-gathering techniques, behaviour, and how to handle some equipment.  

Then I returned to work at the reception after the training.  After six months I was in charge of the car park or the car fleet, and I held that position till February '92.  Then I was transferred to the Bugesera control post in Gashora commune.  Gashora is -- G-A-S-H-O-R-A for Gashora.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Rukerantare.  Before going to Gashora, can you tell us a little more about your duties when you were in charge of the car fleet.  Tell us, first of all, at what location you were working, and what were the duties of the person in charge of the car fleet?  
A.	In my position at the headquarters of the central intelligence service in Kigali, it was apparently my duty to manage the vehicles belonging to our service.  All motorised vehicles were under my responsibility.  I had responsibility over the drivers.  I was in charge of managing fuel allocation, assigning drivers on mission, and also oversight in terms of their behaviour and discipline and relationship towards -- towards and -- with other agents or staff. 
Q.	Where was the office of the central intelligence services located, and under what -- to -- or to which ministry was it answerable? 
A.	The intelligence service was located within the presidency of the republic at the plateau opposite the Bank of Kigali and close to the, quote/unquote, Caisse d'épargne.  At that time the pres -- the -- the service was under the authority of the presidency of the republic. 
Q.	Was this a service that always fell under the presidency, or did anything change in that connection?  And if so, please provide clarification to the Court.  
A.	Would you kindly repeat and clarify your question.  I didn't quite understand it. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, my question was to find out from you whether this service remained under the authority -- or as part of the presidency, or did anything change in that arrangement?  And if that were to be the case, from what point did that service no longer fall under the authority of the presidency of the republic? 
A.	If my memory is correct, up until I left my position, the intelligence service at some point was taken away from the presidency and split into three different sections.  With the Arusha Accords and the creation of a prime minister's office in the country, the intelligence service and internal security were placed under the prime minister's office.  And external security was placed under the ministry of defence, while immigration and emigration came under the authority of the ministry of the interior. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, from what you observed, did your service become more efficient in terms of performance following that break-up or breakdown into three sections under three different ministries? 
A.	No.  In fact, the opposite actually happened.  With the splitting of the intelligence service, it, rather, became weaker.  You see, when we worked as a centralised unit, information was managed more efficiently.  But when the service was split, it appeared to me to have simply been dismantled, given that there was no more coordination and people worked in a disorderly manner at that time. 
Q.	Was the information shared amongst and between the three services? 
A.	As far as I know, and unless it happened only at the highest level -- what I have already told you is that we worked in a divided atmosphere.  So there was no more sharing of information.  
Q.	Were there any meetings, any coordination meetings, between the three services? 
A.	I am not aware, and I did not see any such meeting take place, except it may have been at the highest level between the bosses of the various services.  As far as I know, there was no such meeting, at least at the level of my position. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, if I understand you well, what you are telling this Court is that when Rwanda was facing internal difficulties and was under attack from external forces with significant number of persons being displaced within the country -- what you are telling the Court is that there was no longer a coordinated handling of security -- immigration and internal and external security services within Rwanda.  Is that the case? 
MS. WILSON:
Excuse me.  If I may state, could learned counsel not interpret the evidence of the witness.  Instead the evidence should, in fact, come from the witness himself.  
MR. WEYL: 
If the objection stands, then I would rephrase my question.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- or, rather, Mr. Rukerantare, you told us that there was no longer coordination between the internal security, external security, and immigration services at the time.  Could you then tell the Court what the prevailing situation in Rwanda was in terms of internal security.  
A.	Thank you.  I, first of all, wanted to tell you that when the three services were still working as one we had a coordination office which centralised all information from all sources, be it information or intelligence about internal security or external security or information relating to immi -- and emigration.  That coordinating office was in charge of coordinating this information and publishing a bulletin or -- which was forwarded to the head of state on a daily basis every morning to brief him on the overall situation within the country.  

A similar bulletin was forwarded at noon and in the evening.  With the splitting of the service, I believe that the bulletin was no longer published.  

Now, as for internal security, what I can tell you is that with the replacement of the boss, that is, when Iyamuremye, Augustin -- Iyamuremye is spelt I-M -- I-Y-A-M-U-R-E-M-Y-E, Iyamuremye.  When he replaced Donat Hakizimana, at the time when internal security matters were shifted to the prime minister's office -- it would appear to me that for the first two months he came across as a very dynamic person.  Then he went on training or on internship in South Africa for two months.

And upon his return things were rather confused, because the neutrality of intelligence officers was put into question and recruitments along political lines had been introduced.  So without any training these new recruits replaced the old hands that had been working for the intelligence services at the sub-préfectoral and préfectoral levels, and that created a lot of confusion. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, what was the prevailing situation in Rwanda at that time regarding internal security? 
A.	You know very well, as I do, that the -- or you know as well as I do that the country was at war, a war that had been launched by the RPF since the 1st of October 1990.  So during that period, although the negotiations -- the Arusha negotiations were coming to a conclusion -- what I can say is that things had not yet been sorted out.  
Q.	Can you tell this Court who Mr. Iyamuremye was and who he is.  
A.	Iyamuremye, Augustin was our boss.  He was the Permanent Secretary for intelligence services.  Previously, he had served as the director of ABOPHAR (sic) upon completion of his studies, I believe, in Belgium.  Then he became the director of the dairy factory in Nyabisindu and then subsequently préfet and then ultimately the boss of the intelligence services in matters of internal security.  

He was a member -- or an influential member of the PSD.  And I must also point out that he was the relative of Mr. Sindikubwabo, Théodore, former president. 
Q.	As far as you know, what is he today?  What has he become since 1994? 
A.	After 1994 he was appointed minister of foreign affairs in the RPF government.  Today he is a 
	life senator under the same regime. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, as far as you can recall, do you know on what date or at what period Mr. Iyamuremye became the boss of internal security services, replacing Donat Hakizimana? 
A.	I do recall that the Nsengiyaremye government was formed on the 16th of April '92, and it was two months thereafter that Mr. Iyamuremye became our boss.  So it must have been in June or July of that year. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Rukerantare.  What about the other eminent officials of the internal security services with whom you worked?  Do you have any recollection of the profile of any of those former 
	senior officials, which may be similar or akin to Mr. Iyamuremye's profile? 
A.	Well, eminent officials, I will -- I will attempt to say a thing or two, although I am not aware of all the profiles.  Madam Mukandamage, for example -- Mukanda (sic) is spelt M-U-K-A-N-D-A-M-A-G-E, Marie-Josée.  She was a former official in the intelligence services and is today one of the high-ranking officials within the council of the magistracy.  She is the one who actually officiated at the swearing-in of the president following the 2003 elections.  

Another official I remember was the head of the coordination office, Mr. Ephrem Ndangamira.  Ndangamira is spelt N-D-A-N-G-A-M-I-R-A.  He also remained and I believe became very close to Iyamuremye but was transferred to the prime minister's office where he may have served as an adviser.  I don't quite remember.  But it would seem that he is now of late -- or deceased. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, what were the duties of Madam Mukandamage before she occupied high offices within the RPF? 
A.	I have already told you that Marie-Josée Mukandamage was the director of personnel within the intelligence services when I worked there.  She was in charge of the personnel service and was, therefore, in charge of recruitments, training, discipline, and she had the power to dismiss and to assess or grade staff or agents. 
Q.	Well, let me observe the pause and put it to you that you told us that from the time Mr. Iyamuremye was appointed to that position recruitments were carried out along political lines.  What was Madam Mukandamage's political inclination, if you know? 
A.	If memory does not fail me, I believe that Madam Mukandamage was of the PL party -- PL. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, it has been your testimony that the intelligence services were split and reassigned or redeployed to different ministries.  You said that internal security matters were placed under Mr. Iyamuremye, Madam Mukandamage, and Mr. Ndangamira.  

Now, do you think that the -- that service functioned properly from that date on in the discharge of its duties, namely, providing intelligence to the authorities of the Rwandan government?  Or do you have another opinion?  
A.	As I have already told you, when Mr. Iyamuremye took office, initially, he appeared to be a man of integrity, patriotic, to the extent that he had opted for a strategy whereby agents were brought together to discuss government policy.  

I do remember a meeting we held of the entire service at which he told us about government hesitation regarding the admission of the RPF battalion into Kigali town.  As you know, at some point the RPF brought a battalion to the R -- to the CND.  

So initially, government was reluctant about this arrangement.  And Mr. Iyamuremye had called us together in a meeting and explained to us why government was hesitating, because it would indeed have amounted to granting an opportunity for the attackers to have a foothold on land without having engaged in battle.  So that gave us pointers in our information-gathering and analysis exercises.  

But after returning from the internship or probation in South Africa, his attitude changed.  And his position, therefore, was that, as intelligence agents, we were supposed to be neutral and we were supposed to do that as part of our duty.  But upon his return he questioned that neutrality, and I was very surprised at that new attitude. 

Secondly -- and I do not know whether this is -- this was the case for the other agents -- as far as -- do recall, I authored a report for which I was criticised because I had discovered an RPF-attack plan when I was in Bugesera, and I submitted my report on the 31st of March 1993.  Yes.  That must be the date.

I was summoned by the secretary general.  I received a telegram requesting that I appear in Kigali before the secretary general and that if I do not find him in his office I should report to him at his house.  

It was kind of strange for me to notice that this new attitude was disruptive.  And I wondered what had suddenly happened.  He suddenly had become negative in his behaviour towards former colleagues.  

So I went -- and I was wondering why I had been summoned to his home.  I had been summoned on a Friday.  I remained in my office over the weekend, and then I went to his office on Monday.  And then his private secretary told me that the Permanent Secretary had informed him that I should rather appear before the coordination office.  

And then I reported to Mr. Ephrem Ndangamira, who was the boss of that service, and he began to put questions to me about the source of my information.  And in a nutshell, he -- he said that it appeared that the information was plausible but that it could also have been a -- a figment of my imagination.  And then he went on to ask me whether I could release the name of the source of my information, and that was strictly prohibited.  

And I think that even if I were to be asked to provide the names of my informants here, I will not provide them because that is part of the protection that informants and -- informants and security agents enjoy.  

So in that context I told him, "Ephrem, that is an unusual question you are putting to me." 

So when he wanted to insist he was in a tight corner, because he -- he was the one who had told us about the code of protecting informers -- so he had to accept.  

But in the final analysis, he made a remark to me.  He told me, "We will not want to have such information again, information that may alarm the country.  If ever you give such information, you may be imprisoned."  That is the term he used.  I was surprised.  So I left.

And after two months -- that was around April -- in June I was transferred.  I was brought to Kigali.  I spent two weeks in Kigali without a post, without an office, without anything.  

So I was just moving about.  I presume that it was because of this report, this report which was still hounding me.  

After two weeks I was given another transfer, even though I had just found a house in Kigali.  I was transferred yet once more to Kabaya in Gisenyi.  I almost refused.  

I asked some friends -- in fact, I discussed the matter with some friends.  I remember a certain Gahutu, who was of the MDR, who knew Iyamuremye very well, and discussed with him why I was being transferred just like that.  

So Iyamuremye was asked why.  So he said:  No.  That person works very well.  I need him in that place.  But normally, it is -- it is not a sensitive point.  

Finally, the gentleman asked me to accept the transfer, so I went to Kabaya. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, if I understand you well, you understood your recall to Kigali and then your transfer to Kabaya as an assignment, as a posting.  
A.	Personally -- well, directly -- or, rather, as a penalty -- personally, I did not take that as a penalty but, rather, as a way of breaking my information network, since I was in Bugesera.  I found that as a way of taking me away -- further away from my informants.  I realised that after our departure, when I saw that Ndangamira and the director of personnel remained with the same RPF without any worry.  Rather, they occupied very good posts.  

So I said -- well, I thought they wanted to destroy my information network, even though my network was not where they lived in Bugesera.  
Q.	Sir, according to you, why this insistence by your supervisors to have the names or name of your informant who had given you intelligence on the attack plan hatched by the RPF? 
A.	Well, I have just told you that when I realised that my supervisor and other superiors remained in Kigali I thought that they were just disrupting my information or intelligence network, just like they would have done for others.  

You know very well that we experienced the assassination, the murder of some persons, simply because those people were thought to have -- to have known too much.  I fear that at that point in time it was a way of penetrating my network and a way of destroying it.  

So -- well, when the RPF attacked in 1994, in fact, I realised that they were following the same plan which I had given at that time.  Therefore, the departure from CND to Mount Rebero and other columns that left from Gatsata -- Gatsata is G-T-S-A-T-A (sic).  So they left Gatsata and went around Kigali town.  They hemmed in Kigali town.  

So I thought that, if I had given the name of the informant, perhaps he could have been bought over so that he should stop giving information.  If he was someone I had infiltrated in the RPF ranks, he could have been killed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you have other examples of investigations that could have in -- which -- which would have cast doubts -- RPF agents or RPF activities and which were prevented, as was the case with your own investigation? 
A.	Thank you.  Here perhaps I can only talk about the intelligence service within the country.  But I remember very well the example of information received by a former colleague who was in the immigration service.  That colleague, after having identified a certain -- a certain Kayitesi, K-A-Y-I-T-E-S-I -- af -- Cyimana -- Cyimana is C-Y -- rather, this is the daughter of Cyimana -- Cyimana is spelt C-Y-I-M-A-N-A -- who was the liaison officer of DHL.  DHL is the courier.  I think it's a mail service which is well known around the world.  So this person was the liaison officer working in Rwanda but who was the liaison officer of DHL in Uganda and Kenya.  She was also a concubine of Karenzi Karake.  

But through her Karenzi Karake was able to recruit people.  And it is this lady who gave them information about the RPF.  So one of our former agents, a colleague of mine, who contacted this lady -- well, the lady stopped -- well, rather, arrested the lady, thanks to the inter -- intervention of the external intelligence service boss, who was a soldier.  In fact, external intelligence services had come under the ministry of defence.  So that person did everything to ensure the release of this woman who was arrested.  

I also know that there were cases that were addressed by a certain Habimana, Augustin, also a former colleague.  But, once again, he's working with the RPF regime.  Recently, he became secretary of an embassy -- of the embassy in Brussels.  

The case was tried or considered inadmissible.  It was a case of requests or applications for visas for some Pakistanis or maybe Indians.  Those cases were solved because the information I had indicated that these people were also contributing to the RPF.  

So you can see that all security services were undermined.  The RPF had succeeded to infiltrate their persons, either to hold down some cases or address certain problems which concerned some of its agents. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, I thank you.  To your knowledge, what would you say about the situation of the army as regards military intelligence?  Are you aware of the situation that may have prevailed? 
A.	Even though I was not in the military -- but there are -- some information or some intelligence about which you cannot be mistaken.  If you have a military intelligence agent, if -- well, the boss at that time was Colonel Rutayisire.  Now, if you have a military intelligence officer who causes the release of such a woman, that would not surprise you.  

I would also say that had it not been for the implication of the RPF in the assassination of Gatabi -- Gatabazi himself confirmed that he was aware of that.  In fact, he displayed his affiliation to the PSD, an opposition party.  In fact, Mr. Gatabazi was his brother-in-law because their wives are sisters.  

In addition to that, after power -- or Kigali fell to the RPF, his sister-in-law, Jeanne Ndamage -- Ndamage is N-D-A-M-A-G-A (sic) -- who was a major in the Rwandan forces and who was working at staff headquarters, returned to work in Kigali with the RPF.  

It was only when she -- when he realised and when he learnt that it was the RPF that was involved in the death of his brother-in-law that he had to leave the country and sought exile -- asylum in Belgium.  

I would also say that at the level of the security services there was a certain Gatsinzi, Marcel, who was chief of staff during and after the genocide.  But in the final analysis, he was given the post of chief of staff, minister of defence.  This is not for nothing.  

I could give another example, the example of a certain Ndibwami, Colonel Ndibwami.  N-D-I-B-W-A-M-I.  He was chief of personnel at the army headquarters.  He too is still today with the RPF.  He is someone who could have easily -- I do not know whether he did it because I have no information on that -- is somebody who could -- who was aware of the transfer of soldiers, soldiers who were ill.  He was aware of the strategy and so on.  

So as you can see, the security services, in my view, were undermined during that period. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Rukerantare.  To your knowledge, these services, regarding which you told -- which you said were undermined, were infiltrated -- we could have used another term.  Did the services, nevertheless, obtain documents, intelligence -- intelligence equipment, or material which demonstrated the planning of genocide, the preparation of genocide?  Were there any documents obtained by your services which were managed under the conditions you have just described? 
A.	I would ask you:  Planning by who?  Because there were two belligerents, and there were killings perpetrated by both belligerents.  
Q.	My question is to know whether your services -- your services obtained and preserved evidence, whether they obtained evidence which could have suggested and established that a genocide was being prepared, because this is the -- the main point of our trial.  Did intelligence services obtain any evidence which demonstrated that genocide was being -- or prepared? 
A.	To my knowledge, and following the confrontations or clashes that occurred, such planning -- or such evidence doesn't exist.  In fact, instructions given to an intelligence officer in times of war -- first of all, if it is a matter of fleeing, the intelligence officer has to destroy any material, any intelligence document.  So far, to my knowledge, I am not aware of any destruction of such material or evidence.  Our 
	central office, for example, was between the CND and the Presidential Guard camp, at least when I was there.  

	At the time when the president's plane was attacked, there was only one operator, namely, Mr. Denis Rwamuhizi.  Rwamuhizi, R-W-A-M-U-H-I-Z-I, Denis.  Those who were in charge of coordination had returned for some meal, but they had to come back.  But because of gunshots which were heard immediately, they did not come.  

After the war it would have been possible to find all the necessary documentation that could be used to pre -- prove the preparation of genocide.  Even as regards the internal intelligence agents, I do not know anyone who may have destroyed documents, which means that all the documents are in the country or were in the country.  I, therefore, do not see how such documents, if they existed, would not have been found.  

But as concerns the other side -- in fact, information which was not cross-checked even after the threats directed against me -- well, I thought I cannot give information or intelligence that may cost my life.  So even if I had to go -- take my research further, I became afraid, because at that time I didn't even know who to give the intelligence to, even if I found such intelligence.  

In fact, at that time -- from the time I became threatened, I became inefficient.  And how can I put it?  I became less enthusiastic in my work. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, for your part as an intelligence officer, did you obtain any information, any intelligence, that may have proved the preparation of a genocide in Rwanda? 
A.	No.  I never had such information or intelligence. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Rukerantare.  You told this Court that you remained in Kigali as a person in charge of the vehicle fleet or pool until February 1992, I believe.  
A.	Yes.  That's correct. 
Q.	In February 1992 what was your assignment?  
A.	In February 1992, around the end of February, I was assigned or posted to Bugesera at the Gashora control post. 
Q.	What are the events you faced when you arrived in Bugesera? 
A.	When I arrived in Bugesera in -- or during the week when I was still settling down, it happened that killings were perpetrated.  There were disturbances -- disturbances that emerged in rallies organised by the liberal party.  The classes -- clashes degenerated, and the whole sub-préfecture was involved.  In fact, the clashes almost -- or practically extended to the neighbouring sub-préfecture of Kibungo. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court, from what you personally observed, what caused these disturbances.  
A.	I do not clearly remember the date, but it was in the month of March 1992.  During that month there was a rally held by the Parti libéral, the PL party.  That rally was chaired by Mr. Justin Mugenzi.  

As usual the bourgmestre came to give a kick-off, to launch the meeting -- or, rather -- rather, the rally.  But after the bourgmestre's speech, which requested the population to wait for the programme and to listen carefully to the message given them by the PL party, when the president of the party, Justin Mugenzi, stood up to speak, he started by insulting the bourgmestre.  In fact, he was pointing at the bourgmestre.  

He said, "Toi, Rwambuka, don't think that since you are of the MRND party you can threaten the Tutsi.  You will pay for your conduct one of these days."  

Rwambuka, who felt threatened, stood up and left.  When he left, some of the people followed him.  So they also left.  Certainly, they were not in favour of Mugenzi's utterances.  The rally end up in a -- ended in a zigzag manner.  

After the rally came to an end, members of the PL party assembled in a bar belonging to a certain Gahima.  Gahima was an influential member of that same party.  I do not remember whether he was a member of the political bureau of that party.  I think he must have been a member of the political bureau at the préfectoral level.  

But from that moment also members of the PL party didn't stop provoking members of the MRND who were -- who passed by.  With the utterances made by Mr. Mugenzi and the words of provocation -- or acts of provocation perpetrated by members of the PL party -- well, they started exchanging words.  They started trading insults.  

I had just arrived in the region, and I had to return to Gashora.  I returned because the atmosphere was not good.  There was another intelligence officer on the spot, so I decided to return.  

At night, at about 2 a.m., the bourgmestre of Gashora, Mr. -- what's his name again?  I've forgotten -- I've forgotten his name, but I will remember it.  Ruhuna (sic), François.  Ruhuna is N-T-I-V-U-N-W-A, François.  

So he came to my house with his commune brigadier to wake me up.  He said, "Houses are being torched."  Indeed, when I woke up -- in fact, I was living in a place where there was a BJM (sic) -- there was a project -- which was hosting a project.  That is where I lived in the house belonging to the BJM -- or BGM project.  

So we left.  Since it was night, when we arrived at the place where a house was burning, we would see nobody, because when people saw the lights -- the front light of vehicles, they would hide.  Until early in the morning, we couldn't know what was happening -- we couldn't solve the problem, because from time to time it would -- the house burning to the left, another house burning to the right.  So we didn't know exactly what to do.  

But from the following day we were, nevertheless, able to see some young people, some determined young people.  Quite often we surprised some of them who had just -- who may have just killed a cow or others who had clubs and machetes.  

It was at that time that we even started arresting some of them.  And we also held préfectoral security council meetings to see how we could manage the situation. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, according to what you were able to see on the ground, were these events prepared or were they the outcome of some explosion? 
A.	Well, to say that the events were prepared, I wouldn't know how to put that.  But regarding the in -- the insulting words that were uttered regarding somebody influential, as far as I'm concerned, that was a deliberate attempt to provoke a situation of an explosion. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, to your knowledge, what happened to the rioters who were arrested?  First of all, are you aware of any arrests?  And if yes, do you know what happened to those who were arrested, if at all anyone was arrested? 
A.	I would not be precise enough on that point.  But I know that we arrested some people.  I had worked together with staff of the prosecutor's office, Mr. -- a certain Mr. Shumbusho at the time referred to.  Shumbusho is S-H-U-M-B-U-S-H-O.  His first name I have forgotten.  

So I worked together with staff from his office, with the brigadier general and the IPJ of the commune, together with communal authorities, sub-préfectoral authorities.  Quite often in the 
préfectoral security committees, I often met the prosecutor, who was then a certain François Nsanzuwera.  

I remember clearly that we arrested some people.  I do not remember the exact number of people we arrested.  But strangely enough, these people were released.  Under what conditions I do not know.  Perhaps it will be for the prosecutor's office to tell us why they were released, if we were fortunate enough to find any member of the prosecutor's office at the time.

1015H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	As far as you can remember, when were those people released? 
A.	I do not quite remember, but it must have been during the summer or in -- in the month of August.  I don't have a clear recollection.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Rukerantare.  In the course of your activities as an intelligence officer in the Bugesera, did you ever have to deal with issues of infiltration or exfiltration of young persons or of members of the RPF? 
A.	Thank you.  I must say that it is for that very reason that my position, which had previously been 
shut down or closed, was re-instituted or reopened because we were informed of great numbers of exfiltrated youth who were exfiltrated to link up with the RPF.  

I had to deal with the case of one Kayigi, whose sister was my friend at the time, and it is the sister who told me that her brother had gone to join the RPF.  And when I asked their parents, whom I knew very well -- the father used to work at the ISAR in Karama, a branch of the ISAR project in the Bugesera -- he told me that he was in Kigali, and I left it at that.  

But because of those exfiltrations, we organised our rounds and patrols to find out what was actually happening.  Many youth went through Kirundo in Burundi, and during our patrols I remember that the conseiller of Rweru -- spelt R-W-E-R-U -- whose name was Mayira - Mayira, the conseiller -- 
Mayira, Salathiel.  Mayira is spelt M-A-Y-I-R-A.  He had intercepted eight youth, and they confirmed to us that they had intended to link up with the RPF.  

This was confirmed by the brigadier of the Gashora commune.  He was Tutsi, and he helped us 
to question these young people under comfortable or convenient circumstances.  No one was arrested.  We simply asked them to return to their families.  However, at some point, we noticed that cattle was being shifted or moved, but we were not able to find out who was behind that operation.  But this appeared to be similar to the tactics used by the RPF prior to attacking the Bugesera.  

What they did was they would strike and steal within the borders in order to determine how porous the borders were, and then would move in from 1 kilometre to 5 kilometres and then 10 kilometres.  
And there was sufficient report -- there were enough reports on these issues from our colleagues, 
so we felt that maybe, the plan was to attack through the Bugesera.  And that is how I remember 
that I attended an administrative meeting with Burundian colleagues from the 
Busoni...(no interpretation)...province in order to see -- seek ways of dealing with that problem.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Rukerantare.  As far as you know, what relations did political leaders -- or leaders of political parties in Bugesera, what relations did they have with the RPF, as far as you know, and going by the intelligence you were able to gather on the ground? 
A.	Some political leaders, particularly of the Parti libéral, the PL -- who were known officially to be of the Parti liberal -- also openly showed their inclination or support of the RPF.  A case in point will be one Gahima and also one Rupekenya, whose real name I do not know.  His nickname was Rupekenya because he used to gnash his teeth or grind his teeth.  His -- Rupekenya is spelt R-U-P-E-K-E-N-Y-A.  Those two were openly known to be RPF supporters.  

Then there were others, for example, within the PSD; one Muhimbara, James who was the 
commune chairman at Gashora commune.  Muhimbara is spelt M-U-H-I-M-B-A-R-A, James.  Muhimbara, James.  James did not speak much about his own activities, but it was often said that he was involved in recruiting youth for the RPF.  

Now, as for the other parties, when the -- the five parties met openly in Brussels with the RPF, that was an indication in itself for all and sundry then to come out openly to state that they were collaborating with the RPF under the umbrella of the FDC, democratic forces for change, following the meeting in Brussels, and which was a reflection that they all had a common policy.  
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, when you say that some did not hide their relations with the RPF, how could this have been observed?  What behaviour did they portray that would confirm or would indicate that they had open relations with the RPF? 
A.	Now, I have mentioned two names, Gahima and Rupekenya.  They made open statements to that effect.  Whether they -- they -- they did or did not, what I can say is that clearly -- even to me, they said it.  There was another person from the Parti libéral who worked at ISAR in Karama who would even sing about it and say "Ntitwateye twaratabaye" or something like that, which meant, "We did not attack; we simply came to save."  And that was a clear allusion to the fact that he had clearly aligned with the RPF, which had launched the attack.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Rukerantare, please, would you kindly slow down and spell out the sentence that you made in Kinyarwanda.  
A.	Ntitwateye twaratabaye is written as follows:  N-T-I-T-W-A-T-E-Y-E; the next word, T-W-A-R-A-T-A-B-A-Y-E, which means in French -- or, rather, "We did not attack; we came to save or to rescue."  
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Mr. Rukerantare, within the framework of your duties, did you become aware of military training for the youth of the MRND? 
A.	No, not as far as I know.  
Q.	Did you receive or gather any intelligence, given that some Prosecution witnesses have testified that MRND youth received military training from soldiers on a large scale?  Are you aware of such training exercises? 
A.	My answer is no.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Rukerantare, in the discharge of your duties as an intelligence agent, did you ever attend any political rallies, irrespective of the organising political party? 
A.	Yes, particularly when I was in Gashora.  I was able to attend a number of rallies of the MRND, of the PSD, of the MDR as well.  I think those are the three rallies I attended.  
Q.	Did you attend any rally at which Mathieu Ngirumpatse spoke? 
A.	If my recollection is correct -- well, at the Gashora rally -- I'm -- I'm not sure whether he was there, 
but I -- I think that it was at another rally in Kigali that he spoke in my presence.  
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, on that occasion did you hear him make any statement in which he called for hatred of the Tutsi or -- and the extermination of the Tutsi? 
A.	Well, that -- that would be quite ridiculous because Mathieu Ngirumpatse was a man -- is a man of integrity.  He is one of the genuine politicians that Rwanda could have had and he would never have made such a statement.  Even on moral grounds, before he became president of the MRND, I had known him through his music and I do not see how he would make any such statement.  

But on that particular occasion, he talked about the MRND political platform or programme, and he called on MRND supporters to -- to be consistent in the -- in the actions that they undertake, and that they would win the elections because all -- that -- that is, the entire party was convinced that they would win the elections when such elections would be organised.  

So Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not one of those who would make any hate speech in -- in Rwanda.  Be it in public or in private, I do not see how he would make any such statements.  Allow me, by the way, 
to inform you that, if Ngirumpatse had had any iota of hatred of the Tutsi, he would never have allowed Kagame's father-in-law to occupy the Eden Garden, which was his restaurant.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am looking at the clock, and rather than start another line of questioning, would it not 
be -- well, I'm in your hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how much more time do you think you need to complete the examination of this witness? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, another half-hour or 45 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can take the recess now -- the mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1031H to 1103H) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, we will continue our examination, and I would like to ask you where you were in April 1994.  
A.	In April 1994, I was in charge of the intelligence service in Kabaya sub-préfecture.  K-A-B-A-Y-A for Kabaya.  
Q.	Could you tell us in very brief and relevant strokes what your activities were, particularly from 
April 1994 to July 1994.  
A.	In summary, my activities involved information gathering.  I often attended sub-préfectoral and préfectoral security council meetings, and I was part of the security outfit at the préfectoral level.  

From April to July 1994, my activities -- and I believe you are referring to the 6th of April when the president's plane was brought down.  Now, if we were to begin on that day, I have already stated that the unfortunate -- or tragic event occurred when, as usual, I was waiting for a transmission of some radio messages at the office and waiting to make contact with the central authority.  

When I was able to make contact with Mr. Denis Rwamuhizi, whose name I have already spelt out, on the radio -- when I contacted him on the radio, he informed me that there was information that something was burning in Kanombe and that it may be the president's plane, which had been brought down.  And he said he would be confirming that either the next day in the morning or shortly thereafter.  

After that discussion I called back some 30 minutes after.  And I have already mentioned that he was the only one on duty, and maybe he had panicked or there was firing already going on, and so no one answered my radio contact.  People tried to call from all over, but the central unit was no longer responding.  

So I waited till the next day in the morning, and I came to the office without any further radio contact.  
I called some friends in Kigali.  One of them was Ntuyeheye, Emmanuel -- N-T-U-Y-E-H-E-Y-E -- Emmanuel, who worked for the National Bank of Rwanda.  He is the one who confirmed to me that the president's plane had been shot down.  

I must underscore that, at that time, I had a motorcycle as my lone means of transportation but it was in Kigali and so I didn't have any transportation facility at that time.  So I remained on the spot.  And the staff of the sub-préfecture and of the court of first instance arrived and we began to share information.  
I spoke specifically with Nzamuye, Jonas -- Nzamuye is spelt N-Z-A-M-U-Y-E, Jonas -- who, by the way, was the godfather of my junior sister, so I had a special relationship with him.  I had other friends in Kigali, but he, in particular, confirmed the news to me.  

Then, in the afternoon of the 7th, I told myself that it was abnormal for me to continue to remain at my location without finding out what was happening at the sub-préfectoral level.  So I took a motorcycle from an agronomist who was my neighbour and whose name I forget -- I took his motorcycle and travelled to Mukamira with the intention of going as far as Nyirakigugu towards Gisenyi, which was at the very border of the sub-préfecture, seeking, as it were, to find out what the situation was all about.  

When I got to Giciye, however -- that is, after a place which was known as -- and which was very close to the residence of Protais Zigiranyirazo, the former préfet -- when I got to that location, I decided to take the earth road going by his house, because I also wanted to find out what was happening around the president's residence.  

So I went through that area and by the secondary school that was built in that location where I had studied -- that is, the boys' and girls' Rambura schools and the Rambura parish, as well as the Rambura primary school.  

Quite curiously, when I got to the Rambura parish, I met a crowd with a white man in front of them and apparently headed for the commune.  That white man was a French priest who was on mission and on a retreat with the charismatic group at the Rambura parish.  He told me that he had arrived some 
four days before and his name is Jacques Hazard.  Hazard is spelt H-A-Z-A-R-D.  He's a French -- he was a French priest living in Toulouse.  

So I asked those people, who appeared to be very angry -- I asked them what was happening.  And they appeared not to understand what was going on, because most of them were not educated, and they claimed that some RPF infiltrator had come to conspire with the priest to exterminate the population.  

In fact, when that crowd attacked the -- the church or the monastery, it happened that they lobbed a grenade.  And I -- I had wanted to go to the location, but the crowd stopped me from doing so.  I asked them to hand over the priest to me so that, in my capacity as a senior staff of the commune, I could take him to the préfectoral office.  

So they granted me that request.  I had studied in the area and they knew me.  So I said that I wanted to go back to the parish to take the priest's belongings and take them along with him.  But they said, "No.  You either take him away or we will keep him."  So I preferred to take him to the 
sub-préfectoral office without his belongings.  

He then went on to explain to me that while and -- and this was at lunch -- or, rather, we had finished breakfast -- no, lunch, and we were discussing about the crowd.  And so he told me that the crowd had lobbed a grenade into the living room of the priests' residence and that three priests had died.  

And, quite curiously, the French priest did not as much as have a scratch on his body.  So I took him to the sub-préfectoral office.  And on -- on that day we called the French -- I called the French embassy and told them that I had rescued a French national and that we needed to work together to see how to transfer him -- or to find ways of transferring him to another location.  
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, the thrust of my question, rather, was to ask you to tell the Court whether, during that period, you felt that you had some authority.  And whether you felt that there was a hierarchy in place that could come to your assistance and whether you felt that the state apparatus was actually set up properly to operate in terms of your dealings with your superiors. 
A.	That, in fact, is what I was headed at.  I wanted to get to that point and we needed to do so in a chronological manner.  So when I got to that spot -- or to that location where I found the priest and his Rwandan colleagues who -- who had died, I wanted to make a report accordingly.  But the radio system was down; the telephone lines were down, at least within the sub-préfectoral office -- well, not -- not the telephone.  The radio transmitters were not working, and so I used the phone to call Karekezi -- Karekezi, who was supposedly my hierarchical boss.  Karekezi is spelt K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I, Justin.  

So when I called him, he told me that, "Yes, not only the priest was involved, but that three Belgian technical assistant staff had also died in the commune."  So I wanted to inform my colleagues accordingly.  So, fortunately, Karekezi told me that the sous-préfet was at the Gisenyi Méridien hotel; that he gave me a number and I was -- I attempted to contact Iyamuremye by phone.  I was able to reach him and he advised me to call the préfet because he was not in a position to assist me.  

Well, I thought as a Permanent Secretary he had more authority and would have been in a better position to contact the préfet than I was.  So when he told me, rather, to call the préfet of Gisenyi, I -- it was as if I was going to give up.  But then I called my colleague Karekezi again, and at that juncture he told me that the préfet was in a security meeting in Kanama commune.  Kanama is spelt K-A-N-A-M-A.  
So my conclusion then was to ask them -- to ask Karekezi to assume the responsibility and determine how to deal with that case.  
Q.	In the period following, were you able to refer these problems to any other hierarchy or were you left with the feeling that there was no one in control? 
A.	The truth of the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You should reconsider that question.  You know, that's a very -- you're putting exactly the words into the witness's mouth.  That's not permitted.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, let me repeat my question.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have asked that question three or four times, and each time it has got more and more leading.  
It's not permitted.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'll move forward.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, what about the subsequent period?  Were there any other incidents and were you in a position to report to anybody about any such incidents? 
A.	I have already told you that I was handicapped in terms of transportation because my motorcycle was in Kigali for repairs, so I was not in a position to move about as freely as I could.  So I used rudimentary resources and accompanied the sous-préfet in his activities, as we assisted war-displaced persons, who went from Kigali to other sub-préfectures in order to avoid any difficulties arising from being overwhelmed by these activities.  

So the telephone had broken down; we couldn't use it.  It was difficult to communicate and I was virtually cut off from all other authorities.  

You see, after that period Iyamuremye left Gisenyi and returned to Kigali and I no longer had any contact with him.  As for Karekezi, I was hoping that he would become available to come to Kabaya so that we could have a discussion and be able to contact our colleagues from Ngororero so we would have such small meetings together and review the situation in order to, at least, be able to brief Karekezi on what was happening in the -- in the region.  

Otherwise, it was no longer possible to forward any messages by our radio transmitters as usually would have been the case.  We were not able to use the phones either.  The only opportunity would have been through one-on-one physical or personal contacts.  
Q.	Did you have any such one-on-one contacts with your hierarchy? 
A.	As I have already told you, apart from Karekezi, who was in charge at the préfectoral level, up until the month of May I did not meet any other hierarchical superior.  And in May I met the new Permanent Secretary who had just been appointed and whose name was Nsabimana, Alexis.  
And, again, at that time, it was simply a contact meeting because he had simply been appointed to that position -- although he was not trained for our duty and he had no experience -- he did not know how our services operated, and, simply, the purpose of that meeting was to see how to reorganise matters. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Rukerantare.  Now, Mr. Rukerantare, I have a few last questions for you on a topic of concern.  Now, does the name "Turatsinze" ring a bell, Mr. Rukerantare? 
A.	Yes.  Turatsinze was a driver with the intelligence services and he was one of the staff of my section -- the car pool section, and I had authority over him.  
Q.	Can you tell us what Mr. Turatsinze's first name was? 
A.	Turatsinze's first name was Abubakar, a Muslim name.  He was the driver of Mr. Donat Hakizimana, my former boss.  
Q.	Am I to understand then, that you knew Turatsinze, Abubakar at the time when you were in charge of the car fleet? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Rukerantare, did you ever have an opportunity to have information about the identity and the professional background of Turatsinze, Abubakar? 
A.	Yes.  It would have been normal for me to be aware of his identity.  I was in charge of the car fleet, 
I organised their missions, and I was even involved in the hiring of the drivers -- although he was hired before I took office.  

In a nutshell, he had been recruited before 1989 as Donat Hakizimana's driver.  Hakizimana had been the director for internal intelligence services and then was appointed préfet of Kibuye.  And when he went to Kibuye, Turatsinze, Abubakar went along with him.  

I must also mention that Turatsinze, Abubakar was the nephew of Hakizimana's wife and was a native of Biryogo in Kigali.  

When Donat Hakizimana replaced Augustin Nduwayezu, our boss, he returned with Turatsinze and so he was his protégé.  You see, I must tell you that to be a driver in Rwanda you do not need any special training.  The duties of a driver were not so significant as to call for training.  So his level of education was limited to his primary education.  However, he was a very smart man.  He could speak a bit of French and he was able to find his way around.  So he was someone who did not require any special training.  
Q.	Were you familiar with his curriculum vitae?  And are you aware that he may have been, as was alleged by a Prosecution witness -- or as was testified to by a Prosecution witness that he actually underwent military training or -- or that he may have been involved in some kind of military training? 
A.	First of all, Turatsinze was never a soldier.  I am familiar with his CV.  Now, if he had been a soldier, he would have been a reserve soldier and I would have seen him assigned to the ministry of defence during the war.  So at that time -- for example, those who were -- those who were reservists in my service were called upon by the ministry of defence to join the army.  But that was not the case with Turatsinze, so he has never been a soldier.  

Now, secondly -- except he prided himself, as he was wont to do, as being an agent of the intelligence services -- let -- let me first of all say that anyone who worked with the intelligence services was somehow respected in -- in -- in the -- by -- by members of the public because they claimed to be of the intelligence services.  So people would brag about it.  And, so, that could have been the case -- that he may have been bragging about belonging to the intelligence services.  

So Turatsinze was never a soldier.  He never received any military training.  And all I know is that he was my boss's driver.  
Q.	You testified that, as far as you can remember, Turatsinze was a braggart.  Do you have any other traits of his character on the basis of what you know? 
A.	I believe we're talking about the same Turatsinze.  Turatsinze, Abubakar that I'm talking about was, first of all, somebody involved in some kind of fraud, shady deals.  And he had Donat as his direct boss.  Quite often, out of concern not to stain him, he would not do something wrong in his pres - presence, but when I had him in my fleet he was someone who, in the absence of his supervisor or boss, would want to show that he was charge, that he was even the boss of his superiors.  

In fact, that happened even to me.  I remember one case.  In fact, he was someone who could make people quarrel.  Within my fleet, car fleet, he would come and tell me things about his fellow drivers definitely in a bid to make me have some problems with them.  In fact, he tried to put me in an embarrassing situation when he went to introduce himself to Donat Hakizimana.  There was a mission in Burundi.  I had to put a Jeep at their disposal, but I opted to give them a Pajero Jeep instead of giving them a Land Rover which Turatsinze liked a great deal.  

So he went to tell Mr. Hakizimana that I had refused to give them the Range Rover because I had said that the Range Rover belonged to me.  In such a context, what I did was simply for economic reasons because the Range Rover was not fuel efficient.  When you had a full tank to go to Butare, you would come to -- on arrival in Butare you would be out of fuel; whereas, with the Pajero you could go with a full tank -- a full tank would suffice to take you to Bujumbura.  

So this Turatsinze wanted to make his boss be prejudiced against me.  That was his character.  In fact, he always sought to create confusion -- disagreement between people.  
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, did you have any -- well, this is something that could be known at the time -- did you have any information on the ethnicity of Abubakar Turatsinze? 
A.	I told you a while ago that Abubakar Turatsinze was the nephew of Mrs. Hakizimana, who was known.  I do not know whether it was his nickname or his own name -- and that he was known as Mwanayidi.  This is spelt as follows:  M-W-A-N-A-Y-I-D-I.  Mwanayidi.  

According to information available to me, Mwanayidi was the sister of Turatsinze's father.  He was a Tutsi initially, but at some point in time -- I do not know for what reason -- they changed his identity and he became a Hutu.  I have this information following a -- a -- a confrontation between two directors, a certain Nzitonda -- Nzitonda is spelt as follows:  N-Z-I-T-O-N-D-A -- Nzitonda, Emmanuel, who was director of immigration when Donat Hakizimana was Permanent Secretary.  

So it happened that Nzitonda had to get married.  His fiancée was a Tutsi, but Donat also -- I do not know for what reason -- made his life complicated.  He was asked to give up the marriage or to change his post.  

I -- I came upon that clash by surprise.  They were coming to a meeting next to my office -- the meeting of directors took place next to my office when I was in charge of the car pool or fleet.  Nzitonda was telling him, "We also know Mwanayidi, who is a Tutsi.  Why are you making my life complicated?  I have already made my choice and that is my choice."

Finally, Nzitonda had to change profession.  He went to work in the ministry of foreign affairs.  
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, I was focusing more on your knowledge -- or what you know about Abubakar Turatsinze.  
A.	I hope the explanations I have given you perhaps would suffice in that context.  
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, I would have a last question on that point, and maybe that second question could lead to a -- that question could lead to a second question.  On that basis of your knowledge of 
Turatsinze, Abubakar, was he a man who could be entrusted with some mission or assignment requiring trust? 
A.	Turatsinze, Abubakar -- on first sight anyone would notice that his behaviour was rather strange.  
In fact, he could not be some -- he wasn't someone who could be immediately trusted.  Even when you stayed longer together, his conduct became even more irritating.  In fact, he was someone who easily became an imposter.  He could easily become a usurper.  In the presence of anyone he was talking with, he would show that he was arrogant, so much so that it was not easy -- or it wasn't even possible to give him an assignment requiring trust unless you were a member of his family.  
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare -- and this will be my last question -- to your knowledge, Abubakar Turatsinze, was he someone who could be given an assignment requiring secrecy -- a secret mission? 
A.	Well, I would be surprised because, even though he was working as a driver in the intelligence service, he did not have the quality of being a secret agent.  He didn't have the competence of being a secret agent.  I, therefore, do not see how someone of his character could be entrusted with a 
secret mission.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Rukerantare.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I have no other question for this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  
Ms. Diagne, do you have any questions you would like to put?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Witness.  

Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  I have no question for this witness.  
I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, you'll now have to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and you will have to answer questions put to you by the Prosecutor.  
MS. WILSON:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Defence team, Mr. Witness, members of the public.  

Mr. President, before I commence my cross-examination, I would like to lodge a complaint.  And it has been a general problem for most of our witnesses, and that is in regard to the will-say of this witness.  
The evidence this witness has given in relation to a Prosecution witness, Turatsinze, forms no part whatsoever of the will-say, and thus the Prosecution has had absolutely no notice.  And this is a very sensitive issue in relation to the case, and Defence counsel really ought to have incorporated this as part of the will-say.  

Mr. President, these are my comments on this particular issue.  It forms no part of the will-say.  
We will proceed, Mr. President, but I just wanted this to be put on the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We take due note of this.  

Was there any remedy that you thought might be appropriate to address this problem?  
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, we will proceed with the cross-examination.  But if, in the course of so doing, there's a need for any sort of documentation, then we'll probably raise that issue with you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. WILSON:
Thank you. 


CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning again.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	I will now be asking you some questions to seek some clarification -- or more information on certain issues that you have raised.  
A.	Okay.  Very well.  
Q.	So do not feel it is a repetition of what, in fact, had been asked by the Defence counsel, but just simply my attempt to seek further clarification; is that okay? 
A.	That's okay.  
Q.	Thank you.  You said that you worked in Bugesera from February 1992; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, in Bugesera.  Yes, I agree.  
Q.	And how long did you work there?  Until what date? 
A.	I worked in Bugesera from the end of February until June 1993.

BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	And just to understand the context in which you give your evidence a bit more clearly, you said that you commenced working in -- in the intelligence services from December 1989; is that correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Then a couple of weeks later, you received training.  Yes?  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	How long did that training last?  
A.	I had indeed pointed out that it was two months. 
Q.	Two months.  And what I'm not clear about, actually, is after those two months of being trained as an intelligence officer, you were subsequently assigned to be in charge of the car fleet; is that not so?  Or am I missing a gap in your -- your working history?  
A.	I said that I started working on 28 December 1989.  Two weeks later on I underwent that training that lasted two months.  I returned to the reception, and in June, that is six months thereafter, I was appointed the head of the car fleet.  So I think this ties in.  
Q.	And you worked as head of the car fleet from June 1990 until -- was it February 1992?  Am I correct?  
A.	In fact I worked until 1991, since I had to be evacuated to Belgium for medical reasons.  On return during the -- my convalescence, I took two months of medical leave.  And when I resumed work I was still considered as the head of the car fleet, although there was somebody acting in my place.  That is when I was appointed to Bugesera.  
Q.	Okay.  And during the period that you were in Bugesera, you gave evidence about a meeting occurring in March 1992.  Correct?  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Were you actually present at that meeting?  
A.	Yes, I was. 
Q.	And during that meeting, did you -- well, you said you -- you were present at that meeting, and thereafter there was some violence that occurred.  Yes?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When exactly did the violence occur, in relation to that meeting?  
A.	I did point out that following the speech made by the PL president, the bourgmestre of the Kanzenze commune, Mr. Rwambuka, Fidèle -- Rwambuka is spelled as -- I do not know whether I have spelled it.  In any case, it is spelled as follows:  R-W-M-B-U-K (sic), Rwambuka, Fidèle.  He had to leave the meeting -- 
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  I do not seek for you to repeat the evidence that you gave in direct.  I am simply trying to ascertain -- I understand all you said in direct.  Violence occurred after that meeting.  
A.	Mm-hmm. 
Q.	I am trying to ascertain, when exactly did the violence occur?  
A.	As soon as the meeting ended.  First of all there were -- there was some verbal assault.  Members of the PL came together in Mr. Gahima's restaurant/bar.  And since there was a colleague at the sous-préfecture level, I had to beg leave of him and return to where I lived.  

It was at night, at about 2 a.m., that the bourgmestre and his brigadier came to look for me.  They told me that houses were burning.  Therefore, I do not know when physical confrontations or clashes started.  But as soon as the meeting ended there was verbal assault, verbal confrontations, as it were.  
Q.	And whilst that verbal assault was taking place, you said you left and you left a colleague behind.  Yes?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Around what time did you leave that evening?  
A.	On that evening I left that scene between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  
Q.	And at 2 a.m. you were told that the houses were being burnt.  But did you actually see the burning of the houses and the violence that took place following that rally?  
A.	If houses were burning and if the bourgmestre came to fetch me at 2 a.m. to tell me that houses were burning, I agree I saw houses burning.  But houses did not burn at the same time as when verbal assault occurred.  Verbal assault occurred just immediately after the meeting.  So up to that point the situation had not degenerated.  
Q.	I understand that; thank you.  

And you assisted one of the officers from the prosecution's office in the arrest of some of the individuals who were responsible for the violence that occurred.  
A.	Very well -- that's correct.  
Q.	Apart from burning of houses, were there any other acts of violence that took place that night?  
A.	To be precise -- moreover, I had said this before -- at night you could not realise the scale of the event because whilst houses were burning, it wasn't easy to know whether someone had been wounded in the banana plantation.  You could not realise that there were assailants or rioters around.  It was only in the morning that we started becoming aware of groups of people on the roads, in streets, people -- or, rather, people who had been killed, people who were wounded, others who came out -- when they saw us together with the bourgmestre, they came out of their houses to ask for help from us.  
Q.	And did you later become aware of who was responsible for the acts of violence that occurred during these events?  
A.	That -- well, it would have been pretentious to say that we would be able to hold anyone responsible since we were expecting proceedings.  But what I said earlier on is that subsequently I learned that the prosecutor's office decided to release detainees.  On what basis, I do not know, because there was -- there were no proceedings to know who was guilty or not guilty.  
Q.	Are you aware that the Bugesera killings were in fact investigated by a human -- an internal human rights group?  
A.	Yes.  I was not aware of -- or, made aware of the outcome of those investigations.  I don't know what the findings of those investigations were.  
Q.	But did you later become aware that that group found that the -- the acts of violence amounted to genocide?  
A.	I will be surprised, but as I told you, I am not aware of the report of that group so I cannot know its content.  
Q.	Such a report is already in evidence before this Court.  
MS. WILSON: 
And for Your Honour, it is P. 393.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	And that report referred to the incident as amounting to genocide.  

Do you have any comment to make, any further comment?  
A.	Well, what I can say is that considering what the events looked like, and the very outbreak of those events, I would rather look at that from a different standpoint.  

Obviously these were disturbances which witnessed the confrontation of two ethnic groups.  In that situation I should tell you that although I did not see them with my own eyes.  According to information available it was said that those hiding in the marshlands, in the bushes on -- in marshlands were shooting arrows.  In fact, it was an act of provocation in order to cause civil war -- that is my personal opinion.  But, up to that point, I would not consider that as an act of genocide.  

This may be characterised as genocide by someone who carried out that investigation.  But I did not have the opportunity to carry out such investigation.  Furthermore, it was up to the prosecutor's office to determine whether it was genocide.  And since the report was not available to me, I cannot answer -- give any other answer to your question.  
Q.	Thank you.  So, as you have stated, you were not in a position to carry out any investigation into the matter yourself.  But are you aware that the Interahamwe was in fact involved in these acts of violence?  
A.	Interahamwe from which region?  Interahamwe coming from where?  I apologise for asking you that question.  However, in the Bugesera I was not aware of any Interahamwe movements.  
Q.	Were you aware of a radio broadcast in relation to the rally by Radio Rwanda that in fact provoked and incited violence which occurred after that rally?  
A.	I'm not aware of that broadcast -- or rather, I didn't listen to it, unfortunately. 
Q.	You didn't listen to it, but you are aware of it.  
A.	No, I wasn't aware of it.  
Q.	You agree that this -- these attacks, these Bugesera events, they're quite notorious.  There was a lot of press communication about it.  And you're saying you were not aware of it?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, the media, even today, we notice that they write what they want.  I was in many security meetings.  Up till that period, even up until today, that mission was never mentioned in our attempts to ensure security for the population.  At present, even if you insist, I cannot tell you that I was aware of that mission.  Although it was talked about in the press, I never came across any journalist who asked me what I thought about it.  So I think anyone who would have talked about it, it's up to that person to mention their sources.  
Q.	Okay.  And you indicated that Yamoramya (sic) became your boss in April of 1992, correct?  
A.	Not in April -- April, but rather in June/July.  
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  

And you do not challenge his competence in 1992, do you?  
A.	Even after that period I never challenged his competence, but rather I called into question his changing attitude.  This is what surprised me, and I would say even shocked me.  
Q.	You are aware, whilst he was heading that unit, that he looked into reports that Juvénal Kajelijeli and Katate (sic), they instigated attacks against Tutsis.  You're aware of that?  
A.	No, I'm not at all aware of that, and I would find that ridiculous.  
Q.	There are several reports by your then-boss of these attacks that subsequently led to the dismissal of Kajelijeli and Katate.  What do you have to say in response?  
A.	It is in the same manner that I wrote a report regarding the RPF attacks, and I was -- I was blamed.  In fact, I was even about to be seriously sanctioned, since I gave out my information.  Today I realise that at that period he had changed his attitude, that his conduct could rather favour the RPF.  I would not deny that he probably went further by fabricating other reports.  

In that regard, as well, I could tell you that not only he.  Of course, I also talked a while ago about Mrs. Mukandamage, Marie-Josée, who at present is in the senior ranks of the magistracy in Rwanda.  I also talked about a certain Ndagamira who was in charge of coordinating and summarising information.  And I will also add a certain Jacqueline Nyiramugwera, from whom I received information.  In fact, she was working in the same department as -- well, Nyiramugwera is spelt as follows:  N-Y-I-R-A-M-U-G-E -- G-W-E-R-A, Nyiramugwera, Jacqueline.  I learnt that she was transferring information sent by agents to the RPF.  

So, in my view, I can conclude that, well, knowing the situation of the country regarding internal security, the RPF could have -- could ask its links, its agents, its infiltrators, or it could even contact the security services or even in the intelligence services -- because the intelligence service had been infiltrated at the highest level.  It could have asked its agents or infiltrators to fabricate such reports that would further tar the image, mar the image -- or, tarnish the image, rather, of the regime.  
Q.	Tell me, Mr. Witness:  You said that you produced a report on the 31st of March 1993; is that not correct?  
A.	Correct.  
Q.	And since the production of that report you were transferred on two occasions.  Yes?  
A.	Correct.  
Q.	Would you agree that since writing that report, that you were isolated, you were not given any post?  
A.	I would agree with you.  However, that method whereby agents were isolated impeded the efficiency of the service.  You see, when I -- 
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  I simply asked you if you agree that since writing that report on the 31st of March 1993 you were isolated.  And your answer was yes.  Yeah?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And, as a result, you were not very positive about being in the service, were you?  You didn't really feel motivated to work in the way you once worked.  
A.	No, on that score I do not agree with you.  I have always been a motivated worker.  

Now, returning to your previous question, you talked about being isolated but -- I'm sorry -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...you have more to say.  Do you agree that you were isolated or not?  If you agree, then we can move on.  If there's anything further -- details, maybe your Defence counsel could ask the question.  

Let's turn to Turansinski (sic).  How long did you know him before 1992?  
A.	Before '92?  No.  I only saw him once or twice.  When his boss came to Kigali on mission he would stop by to greet his former colleagues.  Otherwise, that's the only extent to which I knew him.  From any other angle I wouldn't say that I knew him. 
Q.	So when did you first -- got to know him?  Was it in January of 1992?  
A.	Well, let us refocus the events.  Donat Hakizimana replaced Ndawayezu on the 5th of January -- 
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  I'm simply ask you the question:  When did you -- when did you get to know Mr. Turansinski?  Simple question.  
A.	When his boss became the permanent secretary of the intelligence service, that is, in 1990.  
Q.	And how long -- you knew him in 1990.  And you said that you were his boss at some point in time.  When did you become his boss?  
A.	From the time he returned to the service in 1990 until I left my post at the car fleet in 1992.  
Q.	And in the course of that period between 1990 and 1992, how often were you in contact with him?  
A.	From what time?  Can you please repeat your question?  
Q.	You told me that you were his boss between January 1990 until 1992.  Yes?  
A.	No, I said October 1990 to February 1992.  
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  And during that are period, how often were you in contact with Turatsinze?  
A.	If he was not on mission I saw him on a daily basis, because I was in charge of providing fuel for all vehicles, checking their roadworthiness, and assigning drivers on mission.  And whenever he was on -- or, rather, he had a specific assignment, but except he was on mission, I saw him on a daily basis.  
Q.	And how often would he be on mission, if you can recall?  
A.	Not as often as that.  Maybe once a week or once a month, or even for a whole week.  It all depended on the cases that his boss was dealing with at any particular time.  
Q.	And he continued to work for the intelligence services even after you left in February 1992, didn't he?  
A.	No.  He left the service, but he continued to work after I left, and I think it was probably in June or July 1992 when Donat was replaced by Iyamuremye. 
Q.	And you said that persons working for the intelligence service, they're usually well respected; is that not so?  
A.	No, that's not what I said.  
Q.	How much direct contact did you have with Turatsinski (sic) after he left the intelligence service?  
A.	Not often, but I met him every now and then in Kigali town.  
Q.	Yes, so you would not -- you would probably just have seen him from a distance during that period, or not at all?  
A.	I have already told you that I saw him from time to time.  We met, we greeted each other, and then we went on, each person going their own way.  
Q.	But you're -- the relationship you had with Turatsinski, it was such that after he left the services, you did not have any discussions with him about his work, did you?  
A.	You see, in Africa, when you meet somebody you say, "How are you?"  You greet them, you find out where they are working, and then that's it and you move on.  In any event, he was not my friend.  We had some common friends.  
Q.	In any event, during the period he worked for you between October 1990 and February 1992, you didn't -- there was no reason for you to fire him or dismiss him.  He continued to work under your supervision continuously during that period.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, would you please kindly ask counsel for the Prosecution to break down her question so that I may be able to answer specifically as well.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Thank you.  I will ask you:  He -- did Turatsinze work with you continuously from October 1990 until February 1992?  
A.	Not for me, for the intelligence services. 
Q.	But -- but -- 
A.	But again, let -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...but he continued to work for the intelligence service, yes, throughout that period.  
A.	That's correct.  Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	When did you first learn that Turansinski (sic) divulged MRND's secrets?  
A.	I don't know whether he divulged MRND secrets.  What I would say is that he provided false information.  When he left the service he was still an MRND driver, so I do not know whether we can talk about MRND secrets, or simply that he overstepped his duties and acted as an impostor who was the bearer of MRND secrets.  You see, I do not see how, as a driver, he would have familiarised himself with the M -- with the secrets of the MRND.  
Q.	You said he provided false information whilst he was still an MRND driver.  

Did you get the translation?  
A.	No.  No, I don't understand your question.  
Q.	Did you not understand the question?  Okay.  
A.	It would appear that I did not understand your question.  
Q.	No problem.  When did you learn that he provided false information about -- whilst being still an MRND driver?  
A.	I still do not understand your question.  
Q.	You gave evidence that Taransinski (sic) provided false information whilst an MRND driver; is that not so?  That's your evidence.  
A.	No, maybe you did not understand me.  
Q.	What did you say in relation to that issue?  
A.	What I said is that Turatsinze was an impostor.  I said that he was a braggart.  I also said that he was not in a position to be in possession of MRND information, since he was a driver.  
Q.	And when did you learn that he was an impostor, according to you?  
A.	His behaviour and my relationship with him at work pointed to that.  When his boss was not present he acted as if he were a superior and therefore was unmanageable, point one.  

Point two:  He was a driver.  He would often portray himself to the public as if he were a civil servant rather than a mere driver.  
Q.	Are you aware that Turatsinski (sic) was a source of information for Dallaire in relation to the Interahamwe training? 
A.	Well, that's funny.  First of all, Turatsinze, to my mind, and as I knew him for as long as we were together, was not a reliable man.  He was given to tricks.  And Turatsinze knew that informants were usually paid.  So I can assert that he simply made calculations against pecuniary lines, knowing how much money he would be able to get.  And he also thought about things that could be of interest to Dallaire.  And so he was able to provide false information, so long as he made some money doing so.  

But, to my mind, when Turatsinze worked for the car pool, I didn't know him to have the ability to analyse the activities of the Interahamwe because the Interahamwe was a group of young persons from Kigali who were somewhat well-to-do, and who came together, even outside the ranks of the party, to strengthen the organisation, that is, to strengthen the party.  As far as I know, Turatsinze was never part of that group because he was of a different social status, compared to those who were part of the Interahamwe.  So I do not see how he could have been in possession of such information about the Interahamwe.  That's the first point.  

Secondly, even within our services, the drivers were not trained as intelligence agents.  So, three, I believe that he did not even have the resources.  
Q.	That's your answer, yes?  

So, are you suggesting that the information he provided, that Interahamwe were in fact trained, you're saying that is not true?  
A.	I myself was never aware of any such training for the Interahamwe.  Even if I were not a member of the MRND, I do not see how Turatsinze could have become -- or, could have come into that information.  My colleagues and myself, and even from my own knowledge, no one has ever talked to me, to this date, or confirmed that there was training for the Interahamwe -- that type of training for the Interahamwe.  
Q.	But you agree that the information which he provided to Dallaire in fact anticipated what occurred, that the genocide -- the actual genocide that took place between April and July 1994.  
A.	Madam Prosecutor, let me tell you the following in relation to the problem of training:  You may want to know that during that period in Rwanda, a number of personalities, should I say, organised themselves or made arrangements for their own personal safety and security.  

Now, when you talk about Interahamwe trained in Gishwati, the point is that from Masumbuka, M-A-S-U-M-B-U-K-A, Masumbuka, who was Ntekelizia (sic) Aloys's nephew, I got information from him in relation to the training in Gishwati.  That is from his neighbour -- his nephew, that there was a group of youth.  He did not mention the number of young persons, he did not give me an exhaustive list of those people, but he said that they were being protected by his uncle because he had run into some conflict with the head of state and they had fallen out.  So he tried to organise a team for his own personal security.  

His nephew, by the way, was a warrant officer, graduated from the non-commissioned officers' school, was certain that those people were being used to protect his uncle, working with other youths.  But these were not Interahamwe, as the claim would be subsequently.  

So we must make a distinction between decent persons who created small groups on their own account, and the Interahamwe.  What I am saying, therefore, is that the Interahamwe network should not be extended to cover other préfectures, because they were not present in those préfectures.  
Q.	Now, if you say Turatsinski (sic) was a Tutsi, wouldn't that explain why he would divulge MRND's secrets about arming and training of Interahamwe to target the Tutsis?  
A.	Well, this is what I have always said:  He did not have the ability to -- or, have access to MRND secrets.  First of all, he was simply a driver, and that was it.  Now, maybe he provided a document from one of the buses he was driving.  Fair and good.  I can say yes about that.  

But to claim that he was aware of some of the secrets of the MRND?  Well, I am sorry, I cannot believe in that.  You see, as a driver, he never attended any meetings of the bosses of the MRND, he did not attend any meetings of the bosses of the Interahamwe, because the Interahamwe had only one committee in place.  Which, by the way, was a provisional committee, as far as I know.  
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness.  But you are not in a position to say where Turatsinze could have gotten his information from.  You are simply judging him as a driver working for the intelligence services.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So I again would suggest to you that he has every reason, if you claim that he was Tutsi, to divulge the information about the training and arming of Tutsis (sic).  
A.	Please repeat your question.  
Q.	I will move on.  

Mr. Witness, you said that you knew the Accused through his music.  
A.	Correct.  
Q.	So I take it from that that you never had the opportunity to meet the Accused.  
A.	Honestly, I only saw him from a distance.  I have never had the opportunity to meet him close up.  
Q.	And -- so your ability to assess him is merely through his music.  Do you think that's a sufficient basis to make an assessment about a person?  
A.	Well, you know, I may have listened to his music -- very beautiful music, I must say, the religious music.  But you need to first of all acknowledge that, as an artist, he put together ideas and words and music, thereby reflecting his personality.  These things do not happen haphazardly.  They reflect the person's heart, so to speak.  And although I may not have met him in person, I did have friends who knew him in person and who were élogeuse of his personality.  

Now, thirdly, I also told you that I at least heard some of his speeches, whether they were delivered over radio or at a rally at which I may have been present.  I also know people belonging to opposition parties who have very pleasant things to say about him.  So I can talk about his wisdom and his integrity.  
Q.	But you would appreciate what I was asking you about is your ability to assess -- assess the witness, based on your personal knowledge of him, not what other people said to you.  So -- but thank you very much.  
MS. WILSON: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this is all -- these are all the questions for this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Weyl, do you have any redirect?  
MR. WEYL:
No question, Mr. President.  I simply want to thank Mr. Rukerantare for appearing before this Court and contributing to the quest for the truth.  And, as usual, Mr. President, I would like to apply for permission for Mr. Rukerantare to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse, if he desires to do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony before this case.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You are now excused and you are free to go.  The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate the request made by counsel.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President; thank you, Your Honours.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, do you have any report on the status of things now?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'll leave it to the lead counsel.  But I can indicate to the Trial Chamber that we have continued to deploy our efforts to ensure that witnesses can appear when we resume after the suspension of this session.  We will do our best to bring all the witnesses to ensure continuity in our proceedings from the 8th of November.  Because it would appear, Mr. President, as we understand, that we will not be sitting next week.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, this is Wednesday midday, so the point is -- you're confirming that you have no other witnesses to testify at this moment, and that you wish to resume on Monday the 8th of November?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the Trial Chamber is aware that we were mindful of the indications from the Trial Chamber that we will not be able to hear our ordinary witnesses next week.  Mindful of the difficulties we had towards the end of the last session when a witness came for nothing and went back to Canada, it would therefore be difficult for us to call another witness and would maybe end up either wasting time or coming to Arusha for nothing.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, do you know where you are?  This is Wednesday at midday.  I should be asking you to call your next witness now.  Are you in a position to do that?  I gave you an opportunity to just set the record straight.  We have an idea of what the position is, but I gave you an opportunity to do it.  Because it seems as though we're going to have to adjourn the trial session now because you do not have any witnesses available.  Is that the position?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it would appear to me that things were very clear from yesterday, and that you were aware that there are no other witnesses in Arusha.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday we had an informal meeting off the record.  We are on record now, and I gave you an opportunity to set the record straight.  
MR. WEYL:
Well, Mr. President, that is exactly what I was trying to tell the Court.  We do not have any witness on hand now in Arusha for the reasons that I have already explained to the Court, namely, problems with mobilising witnesses because of the absence of a hearing session for next week.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think I need to announce that we are going to have to adjourn our trial session now and resume on the 8th of November.  We will be publishing a scheduling order to confirm the arrangements that have been discussed.  

We have been informed by the registrar that one of the key workers in the Court Management Section is about to go on pre-retirement leave, despite a very youthful appearance.  And I think that she will be going on leave at the end of this week.  All of us have benefited from the high quality of service to this case, and we just thought it would be appropriate to let her know the extent of our appreciation for the high quality of her work.  

I gather that one or two counsel wish to say a few words on her behalf.  And I now invite the Prosecutor to say a few words, if he wishes to do so.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  Thank you.  

I would say good morning or good afternoon to everyone, and a special good afternoon Madam Zerthun Belay who joins us in Court today.  And I simply want to take this opportunity to express to her the thanks of the Prosecution for her diligent work in what has been a very challenging case, especially where documentation and motions and the work of CMS in support of the trial is concerned.  It's a very heavy -- heavily documented case, and one which has had quite a deal -- quite a great deal of motion practice.  And without her diligent service we would have been much less efficient in dealing with the issues.  

So, thank you once again, and we wish you all the very best.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I thank you, Mr. President.  

It is not often that I congratulate the Prosecutor for a good initiative; generally we are pitted against each other.  But this is a very timely initiative for Ms. Zerthun Belay, for the Prosecutor to have thought that it would be a good thing to tell her farewell in court, in this very challenging case where tonnes and tonnes of documents have been processed by her, where she has come to our help in order to meet our deadlines.  

So, over the years we have been able to appreciate her patience, her kindness, and we want to say this to you in person:  I hope that you will not forget us; I hope that you will, however, forget those correspondences that you received by email.  But if you do miss us, think about them.  We wish you the very best, and great courage as you move on.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it will not be redundant to say that Ms. Hounkpatin has said it all.  But let me add that all of us, and many of us will miss her.  And irrespective of Mr. Hometowu's presence, we will still miss her.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
For the Karemera team, we want to thank you, like all others, and to congratulate you, Madam Belay, for all you have done.  

Allow me personally to thank you for all what you have done on behalf of all of us from West Africa, from Dakar, when we have struggled to make ends meet with the three-hour time lag, with telephone lines that do not always work, and with the challenges of talking to our client.  You have been our liaison; you have been extremely useful to Mr. Karemera's Defence team.  

In spite of all the challenges in the area of communication, you have always been available.  Whenever we were still awake in Dakar while Arusha was asleep, you kept your computer and your lines open so that we could work to meet the deadlines and avoid any problems with orders and decisions from the Court.  You were professional at all times, in spite of the very difficult conditions that we work in.  Particularly during this completion phase you continued to be steadfast, you had extraordinary courage.  
And I would like to join my voice to those of others, to also thank Mr. Constant Hometowu with whom we have continued to work, and for the smile that he has kept on his face throughout.  

So, this is only a goodbye.  We will never forget you.  You have been a key link in the proceedings -- in these proceedings.  And on behalf of the Karemera team, I want to tell you, once more, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, on behalf of the entire Court Management Section, and on behalf of the Judicial Proceedings Unit, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to you for allowing these submissions in regard to Zerthun's performance.  We thank you all very, very much.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We thank you all very much, and we take our adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1245H)
