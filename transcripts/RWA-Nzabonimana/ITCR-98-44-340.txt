P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 15th of July 2008, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., case number ICTR-98-44-T.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The appearances are the same.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  There is a change on Mr. Karemera's team.  I am here since this morning and sitting in for my learned colleague, Sow.  

Let me take this advantage to greet all the parties here present.  I thank you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We welcome you back to Arusha, and to the trial.  
MR. MORLEY: 
We all welcome back Ms. Diagne, but do I understand she will continue the examination-in-chief?  Is that the plan?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Absolutely so, Mr. Morley.  Is that any problem to you?  
MR. MORLEY: 
If it's not a problem for my learned friend, then it's no problem for me.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue this -- thank you.  Good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony will continue this morning.  Counsel Diagne will continue examining you on behalf of Édouard Karemera. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  
WITNESS CTB, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I believe that yesterday this witness was handed a piece of paper on which he wrote out a name.  And I move that that document be admitted into evidence under number D. K93; of course, subject to confirmation by Mr. Issa and your leave, Mr. President.  
MR. MJUI: 
Yes, Your Honour.  The document will be D. K93.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. K93 admitted, under seal)  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, with your leave, I would also like to check -- or, cross-check with Mr. Issa whether the witness's identification sheet of yesterday was admitted into evidence.  

If it wasn't, Mr. President, can you grant leave that it be admitted into evidence under number D. K94?  
MR. MJUI: 
Yes, Your Honour.  The information sheet was not admitted, so it will be D. K94.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. K94 admitted, under seal) 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
For the record, Mr. President, the interpreters withheld the name of that centre which was given by counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
No.  Yesterday I gave an explanation by stating that there was no roadblock at that location, and I further stated that I lived in that centre.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  May I ask you the following question, Witness:  Since you were at the scene, a resident of that location, did you ever see or hear that Mr. Édouard Karemera went to the Bisesero hills? 
A.	I wasn't a witness to that fact.  I never heard anybody mention his presence at the Bisesero hill. 
Q.	Witness, do you really believe that if Mr. Karemera had gone to Bisesero by any route, by any means whatsoever, it would have been known to you? 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry.  That is a leading question and invites an opinion.  The opinion's inadmissible, the mode of the question is inappropriate.  But it's a matter for Your Honours. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
My apologies, Mr. President.  I would like to state that I am not seeking the opinion or leading the witness.  I am putting a very specific question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, our -- our -- our concern right now is simply with redundancy.  We think that's already on the record, that is, the witness has already provided his proposition to that very question yesterday.  But, proceed.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, before starting my examination-in-chief, I reviewed yesterday's transcripts.  Perhaps I did not make myself very clear.  I am not sure I saw that question among the questions raised by Counsel Sow yesterday.  I'm going to rephrase the question.  

May I ask the witness if he ever heard other members of the public refer to a possible or real presence of Mr. Karemera at the Bisesero hill?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I never heard about that, be it from the members of the public or in bars.  I never heard such a thing.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The person in question alleged, by way of evidence, that some persons went to Bisesero, and he mentioned examples of persons who had gone to Bisesero.  Namely, Mr. Ladislas Nkurunziza, spelled N-K-U-R-U-N-Z-I-Z-A; his younger brother, Francois Nzibabaza, spelled N-Z-I-B-A-B-A-Z-A; Nyirinkwa, spelled N-Y-I-R-I-N-K-W-A; Noel Buyenzi, 
	B-U-E -- B-U-Y-E-N-Z-I; and a former policeman by the name of Budaraza, spelled B-U-D-A-R-A-Z-A.  

So my question is as follows:  Do you know the above-mentioned persons?  Also, did you hear that they had gone to Bisesero hill to commit any offences? 
A.	I know the above-mentioned persons and their places of residence.  
Q.	Witness, my question was the following:  Did you hear that those persons had gone to Bisesero hill? 
A.	What I can say about those persons is that these are persons who dwell in Gisovu commune, while I live in *******************.  Buyenzi was a teacher, and there was a former policeman, while the others were farmers.  Some persons mentioned, dwellers of Gisovu.  And the person who gave that name also hails from Gisovu, and it is only that person who is aware of the activities of these persons.  I am completely unaware. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness, for that honesty.  Witness, do you know a certain *******************, spelt B-A-R-I-G --
A.	Yes, I know *******************.  He was a ********.  And his business was located in the centre, but he lived in Gisovu commune, but would return home every day after his business.  He lived in Gisovu, while I lived in ***********. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness interrupted counsel's spelling of that name. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, the interpreters are -- would like the witness to spell the name again.  Sorry.  The interpreters would like the witness to spell the name again.  You came in too quickly.  
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, what do you expect of me?  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, may I put on the record that the name I just mentioned, *******************, is the first name on the spelling list which has been circulated to the parties.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
My apologies.  May I seek the assistance of Mr. Issa?  Apparently, that list has not been circulated to the parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed, please.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I'm obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, the person whose name was written down on that piece of paper mentioned the president's stop -- or, arrival of Mr. Édouard Karemera in the company of General Ndindiliyimana with whom he stopped to convene a sort of meeting in that market in that Gisenyi centre.  Did you hear about that and do you believe that story to be true?  
A.	As I testified yesterday, between April to July 1994, I did not see Karemera in that centre between April and July 1994.  
Q.	That's crystal clear, Witness.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  May I point out that I am done with the cross-examination -- the examination-in-chief of this witness. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
Any other Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  I did not deem it necessary to examine this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Same here, Mr. President, for Mr. Ngirumpatse's team, as the questions that have been put are enough, as far as we are concerned. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, you're now going to have to respond to the Prosecutor who has the right to ask you some questions in cross-examination.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, we have an application for 15 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Closed session?
MR. MORLEY: 
The reason for that -- no, not closed session.  An application for 15 minutes to gather my thoughts in the matter.  I've just had handed to me a moment ago by my ever-helpful intern, Mr. Leonard, the transcript of yesterday's proceedings, and there's a number of matters which I want to check.  

I had expected, as a result of Mr. Sow's helpful observation yesterday, that there would be a further hour and 15 minutes, or thereabouts, of examination-in-chief.  And I have been taken somewhat by surprise by my learned friend, Ms. Diagne, continuing the examination-in-chief and taking around about 20 minutes, much of which was a repetition of yesterday's evidence. 

Would Your Honours allow me a few minutes to read over the transcript from yesterday?  Your Honours will recall that it only became apparent to me what the significance of this witness was about 45 minutes into his evidence yesterday.  Your Honours will recall that one of the difficulties the Prosecution have had has been the smallness of disclosure.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, we have decided to accede to your request.  The Court will rise for 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 0929H to 0950H) 

MR. MORLEY: 
May I thank Your Honours for the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  You may continue now.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you agree that there was a slaughter of Tutsi civilians throughout Rwanda between April and July of 1994? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone is not on.  
THE WITNESS:
I do not know how to turn on my microphone. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa -- 
THE WITNESS:
I have already answered the question, saying that what the Prosecutor has just said actually happened.  
 
Let me repeat my answer.  What you have just said actually happened.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The Interahamwe was an organisation which did much of the slaughter.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	In the area in which I resided, in my secteur and in my commune, there were no Interahamwe. 
Q.	You are aware that elsewhere the Interahamwe was responsible for much of the slaughter.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I personally never saw Interahamwe in our area.  Interahamwe were not active in our area, so I do not know what happened elsewhere.  
Q.	You have given the impression that you were well-informed as to what was happening.  Are you saying that you were not well-informed about what the Interahamwe was doing throughout the country? 
A.	I heard people talk about the Interahamwe, but I did not see them with my own eyes.  And in our area, there were no Interahamwe. 
Q.	And when people talked about the Interahamwe, what they said was the Interahamwe was killing Tutsis.  Isn't that right? 
A.	I have already answered your question saying that I never saw the Interahamwe with my own eyes. 
Q.	No, you haven't answered my question.  Listen to it again.  When people talk to you about the Interahamwe, what they told you was the Interahamwe was killing Tutsis.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, let me repeat what I have already told you.  That in the area in which I resided, particularly where I resided, or lived, I never saw any Interahamwe. 
Q.	You're still not answering the question.  You've told us that people told you about the Interahamwe.  You've told us you didn't see the Interahamwe, but people told you about them.  Now, it's right, isn't it, that people told you that elsewhere the Interahamwe were killing Tutsis.  That's what you learned about the Interahamwe.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	I cannot make any such assertion.  I cannot say that the Interahamwe were killing people, whereas I did not see them kill anybody.  I would be lying if I were to say so. 
Q.	You've told us that people talked to you about the Interahamwe.  But what did they say?  Did they say the Interahamwe is a delightful Boy Scout movement?  What did they say to you about what the Interahamwe was doing elsewhere?  I'm not interested in what you saw, I'm asking you about what you heard.  
A.	When I say that I heard people talk about the Interahamwe, I would like to repeat what I just said:  I was not a witness to the activities of the Interahamwe, so I cannot assert, and I can't answer your question in the affirmative.  I cannot lie about something, especially something which one did not witness. 
Q.	Stop ducking the question.  What did people tell you the Interahamwe were doing elsewhere, whether you saw it or not?  What did people tell you?  Answer that, please.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, you are insisting with your question, although I've told you that in my commune the Interahamwe did not undertake any activity.  And I never said that anybody told me that the Interahamwe had undertaken any activity anywhere.  And this is logical, because I have said that I was not aware of the activities of the Interahamwe elsewhere.  
Q.	You told us that people talked to you about the Interahamwe.  Tell us what people said the Interahamwe were doing.  Answer that question, please.  I ask it for the fifth and last time.  
A.	You have asked me a question about the Interahamwe.  And, Counsel for the Prosecution, I told you; and if you were keen, I told you that in my area the Interahamwe did not show up, they never came there.  Accordingly, I did not see them.  So, if you are putting words in my mouth, according to which people allegedly told me that the Interahamwe did anything whatsoever, I do not believe that is what I told you. 
Q.	I'm asking you what people said the Interahamwe did, and you have very acidulously not told me what people told you the Interahamwe did.  Are you prepared to answer that? 
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend is on her feet. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, may I seek your office to put an end to the badgering of the witness?  We heard Counsel Morley go the fifth time, and he said it was the last time, and he went on the sixth time.  And the witness has given all possible answers.  Mr. President, kindly stop this badgering of the witness.  Thank you.  

MR. MORLEY: 
I respectfully agree with my learned friend.  I don't propose to pursue this any further.  It's a matter for Your Honours what you make of the witness's answers at this stage. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What happened to the Tutsis in your area?  
A.	This is what happened:  In 1994, there were massacres.  The Tutsi were killed.  And their hangmen, at the end of the war -- or, their hangmen were questioned and they were asked where the Tutsi who lived at a given place had gone to.  It was what is referred to as the collection of evidence.  And all the perpetrators of the massacres were prosecuted accordingly.  
Q.	How many Tutsis were massacred in your area?  Give us some idea.  
A.	I cannot tell the exact number of Tutsi who were killed.  What I know for sure is that Tutsi were killed.  But there were some survivors, as well.  
Q.	You were a person in authority; you must have some idea of how many Tutsis were in your area.  Give us some idea, please.  Was it two people killed, was it more than that?  Give us some idea, please.  How many murdered?  
A.	I cannot say that two or three persons, only, were killed.  Tutsi were massacred.  But as I have said a while ago, I am unable to give any figure. 
Q.	That's not true, is it?  You exercised some authority in your area.  Are you suggesting you had no idea how many Tutsis were living in your area?  
A.	In my area, there were Tutsi who lived there.  Perhaps you may want to ask me the areas where the Tutsi lived in, and I might be in a position to answer that question.  But asking me to come up with a grim figure or census, I am unable to give you an answer to that question.  
Q.	Well, you've helpfully told us you're aware of the areas that they lived in.  Some might think that that would mean that you have some idea roughly of how many people were Tutsi living in those areas.  You've also told us that the Tutsis in your area were massacred.  Now I'll ask for the last time:  As a person in authority, knowing where the Tutsis were living, how many, approximately, were murdered in your area?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I have told you that I admit that Tutsi were killed and that there were survivors, as well.  However, I denied having conducted a census of persons who were killed, and less so of Tutsi who lived in a given place.  So I am unable to tell the number of persons who were killed.  I am unable to give a figure, even by way of an estimate, because I would be mistaken.  I would be able to give you a figure if I were sure that I had that figure.  
Q.	Who killed them? 
A.	There was violence -- or, in fact, there was a civil war pitting the people of Rwanda, and civilians killed one another.  And that civil war was the direct consequence of the war which raged, actually, in the country, generally speaking.  
Q.	Civilians massacred the Tutsis.  Is that right?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I do not know what you mean by "civilians". 
Q.	It was your word.  I asked you who killed the Tutsis; you told us there was a civil war, and civilians killed one another.  So, I anticipate you are saying to us, in a roundabout and slightly evasive manner, I suggest, that civilians massacred the Tutsi.  Is that right? 
A.	I wonder if I referred to civilians.  I was referring to members of the public, to ordinary citizens; namely, farmers, traders, civil servants.  All these persons are part and parcel of what I call the civil population known as abaturage, which is spelled A-B-A-T-U-R-A-G-E.  So all of these form members of the public, or citizens.  
Q.	That will do.  Citizens.  You exercised authority in your area.  What did you do about your citizens massacring the Tutsis?  
A.	When the war of 1994 sparked after the 6th, if my memory serves me right, we tended to condemn those activities, that internal strife, or the clashes which originated from rumours peddled to the effect that there was a wide scale war.  And, subsequently, the situation boiled over and we lost control of the situation and we could not handle the events. 
Q.	Are you saying you did nothing about your citizens massacring the Tutsis?  
A.	I did not play any part in the massacre of the Tutsi. 
Q.	But are you saying that you, in authority, did nothing in respect of your citizens massacring the Tutsi? 
A.	As I have said earlier on -- and I would like to repeat what I have said before -- those who perpetrated the massacre of the Tutsi were identified during the collection of evidence which was conducted throughout Rwanda from the grass roots, which was known at the time as the cellule.  Members of the public explained what had happened, and the perpetrators of the massacres were arrested and imprisoned.  
Q.	That's not an answer to the question, referring to the investigations launched by the RPF after they took power in Rwanda.  I'm asking you about what you did at the time; at the time your citizens were massacring your Tutsi population.  Never mind what other people did later.  What about you, personally?  What did you do to stop it?  
A.	This is what we did when the war broke out -- I have said it before;  I'm going to repeat what I said -- we tried to put an end to the fighting, and we did our level best, all what was in our power to stop the clashes, but we did not succeed in doing so.  Because, as I have told you, there was a wide scale war in Rwanda, and the intensity of the massacres continued to rise from April and in the subsequent months.  And at some point in time, we were unable to stop the clashes.  And that is why persons were massacred.  
Q.	You told us you did your level best and all within your power.  You still haven't told us what that was.  What did you do to stop the massacres? 
A.	We told the citizens that the unrest, the massacres, and looting were not correct.  And that is all we could do with the little authority we could exercise.  And due to the widespread war in the country, the situation worsened and the situation went out of hand.  We couldn't bring it under control.  And in our capacities as persons in authority, we were unable to put an end to the massacres. 
Q.	You didn't try, did you?  Simply saying to some people, you are being naughty, that what you are doing is not correct, but not following it up with any action; for example, ordering the police to make arrests, ordering the police to shoot people who are otherwise engaged in massacres, calling in the army in order to prevent the massacres.  That would have been action.  You did none of them, did you? 
A.	You are alluding to the police force and the army, and you claim that I -- we should have requisitioned the army and the police force.  Do you believe that the army and the police force were not aware of what was happening in the country?  You should know for certain that those two entities you have referred to were overtaken by the events which unfolded in Rwanda. 
Q.	Do we agree, then, that the army and the police force did nothing to stop the massacres?  
A.	If those institutions were -- had acted properly, there wouldn't have been any massacres.  Those two institutions were overwhelmed, or overtaken, by the events.  And that is why the citizens fought one another, leading to death.  And this was all a consequence of the war.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I apologise for interrupting.  I would like to let my learned colleague act as best he wishes; but when the witness says that the two institutions were overwhelmed, counsel interjects that, "You agree they did nothing."  

Mr. President, you would know that when you say somebody is overwhelmed, it means they are helpless.  Mr. President, I take exception.  And, kindly, forbid the Prosecutor from proceeding on that path as he's been doing.  
MR. MORLEY: 
And I would ask Your Honour to kindly allow me to continue questioning the witness.  He's just said, a moment ago, that the army and the police did not act properly.  I'd like to follow that up, please.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I believe there was a major misinterpretation.  I mean, it was major, because the consequences are untold.  

So, Mr. President, kindly conduct a check, or that the witness be allowed to repeat, because the Accused persons are listening in Kinyarwanda and can tell if there's been a faithful rendition of the witness's testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I must confess I don't understand the last comment.  Maybe the best -- we were going to allow counsel to continue his questions, and it may very well be that that may be the best way to resolve this issue.  The witness will have an opportunity to explain himself in response to the questions that are put.  

Mr. Nimy?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I have no problem with my learned colleague to pursue his cross-examination, but he shouldn't do so on the basis of misunderstanding.  The witness did not say what the Prosecutor claimed.  And the witness said if the army and the police were able to -- if they had the means, they would have.  And the interpreter, not the Prosecutor, says if they had acted properly that would have been stopped.  

It is not the same thing.  The witness says they could have.  They were overwhelmed, and so could not act.  It is very important, Mr. President, and we can't let this go, Mr. President.  I'm obliged, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Let the witness, himself, correct, if there was an error.  I think the testimony should come from the witness. 

Okay.  Mr. Morley, you have heard the complaint.  Please see if it can be addressed.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  And Your Honours will be alive (sic) to the fact that the learned friends' offers have explained to the witness, because he's been listening to everything that they've been saying, how to deal with the enquiry I'm about to make.  It would have been better if they had asked for the witness to take his headphones off.  And they know that.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I cannot allow the Prosecutor -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, it's not necessary to argue the point.  

Please continue, Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you go to Bisesero? 
A.	No. 
Q.	There were Tutsis massacred in Bisesero.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes.  Tutsi died in Bisesero, but I wasn't there when it happened.  
Q.	I suggest that as many as 50,000 Tutsis died in the Bisesero area.  What do you say about that?  
A.	This is what I can say about that matter:  You have referred to 50,000 Tutsi.  I do not have any explanation on that matter.  I did not live in that area.  And even if I had, I would not have been able to know about it.  All I know is that throughout Rwanda, the Tutsi died during the war.  The war caused victims among the Tutsi.  But I cannot say that in Bisesero there was so-and-so a number of Tutsi who were killed.  All I know is that in Bisesero, like elsewhere, there were massacres.  
Q.	Who massacred the Tutsi in Bisesero? 
A.	I do not know.  It was an act of war, like other acts of war. 
Q.	No.  Killing civilians is not an act of war.  Armies perform acts of war, engaging each other with armaments.  Killing civilians is not an act of war.  Who massacred the Tutsis in Bisesero? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution -- I'm sorry.  When I refer to the war, what I meant to say is that their clashes were a direct consequence of the war.  
Q.	And who massacred the Tutsis in Bisesero? 
A.	I do not know who did that.  
Q.	It was a joint effort, wasn't it; the army working with the Interahamwe and other civilians?  You're aware of that, if you were being well-informed.  Or were you not well-informed?  Did you hear nothing of who was killing the Tutsis in Bisesero? 
A.	I've told you, and I would like to repeat it, that Bisesero is an area which is located very far from my own place of residence.  Between my area and Bisesero you have Gitesi and Gisovu communes in between, as well as Gishyita where Bisesero is located.  So I am unable to tell you who were -- the perpetrators, rather, of massacres in that area.  
Q.	Who massacred the Tutsis who had taken refuge in Gatwaro stadium in Kibuye? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, you should not put that question to me.  Gatwaro stadium is situated very close to the préfecture.  And I was an ordinary citizen living in the country.  I lived to the west of **********************.  How could I have known what was happening in Kibuye préfecture?  
Q.	You attended the meeting on the 3rd of May of 1994 at which the prime minister and Karemera spoke, at the préfecture office in Kibuye.  Now, that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes.  I indeed attended that meeting.

      1030H	
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Well, tell us who massacred the Tutsi in Gatwaro stadium in Kibuye about 400 metres from the préfecture office, approximately 10,000 people.
A.	That took place about a week before that meeting.  I do not know the persons who massacred those people. 
Q.	Who massacred the 10,000 or so in the Home Saint-Jean about 400 metres to the left of the préfecture office approximately eight days before the 3rd of May meeting?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I have already told you where I lived and the distance from that place to the préfecture.  Do you honestly think I am able to know those who massacred those people?  
Q.	Was it not discussed?  Was it not something that was the subject of conversation when you, as a figure of authority, gathered with so many other figures of authority on the 3rd of May 1994 that there had been the massacre of 20,000 Tutsi civilians within 400 metres of the préfecture office, or was it all a big secret and nobody talked about it?
A.	It is true that I was present at that meeting, but the only issues we discussed were related to securities and the measures we had to take to put an end to the war.  Those were the issues we discussed at that meeting.  That meeting was a security meeting.  
Q.	The gathering of the authorities on the 3rd of May -- is this right? -- never breathed a word about the slaughter of the Tutsi civilians.  Is that your evidence?  It was all a big secret?
A.	That was a security meeting during which participants discussed ways and means of putting an end to the massacres.  That was the objective of that meeting. 
Q.	Massacres were discussed then.  Thank you.  In the presence of Édouard Karemera.  Thank you.

So what was said about these massacres?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I have told you that meeting which was convened in May was aimed at providing for security and putting an end to the massacres.  I have already told you that.  That was the only objective of that meeting. 
Q.	Well, as part of putting an end to the massacres, was it decided that those committing the massacres should be, perhaps, arrested or shot or disciplined, gathered up?  Is that the sort of thing that was discussed as part of putting an end to the massacres?
A.	That was a preparatory meeting that had been convened for purposes of discussing the massacres and to request that those responsible be arrested regarding the punitive measures that had to be taken against those persons.  You could not arrest people without, first of all, carrying out investigations to identify those responsible.  You, first of all, had to carry out investigations in order to know who was involved in those massacres, in order to know who the perpetrators of those massacres were.  
Q.	Great.  So what investigations did you discuss, Mr. Figure of Authority?
A.	Instructions had not yet been issued to us regarding those investigations. 
Q.	Well, is that a fancy bureaucratic way of saying, "None.  I, as a figure of authority, conducted no investigations because I hadn't received instructions yet"?
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And it's right, isn't it, that you never received instructions?
A.	Could you please repeat the question. 
Q.	I thought you might say that.

It's right, isn't it, that you never received instructions?  
A.	No.  We never received those instructions. 
Q.	The government, represented by the prime minister and Édouard Karemera and others on the 
	3rd of May, having been informed of the massacres -- I'm sorry.  Let me finish the question, please -- having been informed of the massacres, your evidence is no instructions were ever formally issued to conduct investigations.  That's right, isn't it?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
	Before you answer the question, Witness -- 

	Mr. President, I would like to again object to the manner in which the Prosecutor is proceeding.  The Prosecutor is fully aware of the fact that on the 3rd of May 1994 Mr. Karemera was not yet minister and could not have been the representative of any government.  The Prosecutor knows that and has been told that on several occasions.  He knows that the witness was there but that Mr. Karemera was not attending that meeting as a representative of the government.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I don't propose to respond to that, Your Honours.  May I continue with the question?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	It's right, isn't it, that the government, assembled with all those figures of authorities, Karemera being the vice-president of the MRND -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, the Court's indulgence.  I would like you to rule on my objection before the Prosecutor is allowed to proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think the question has been rephrased, and we permit Mr. Prosecutor to continue.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The government, with all those figures of authority, including Karemera, who was at that moment in time the vice-president of the MRND, learning of massacres in the area, at no stage issued instructions for investigations.  As I understand it, that's your evidence.
A.	I have told you that that meeting was a security meeting.  I, therefore, think that another meeting could. have been held for purposes of discussion and investigations.  But we were told to go and meet members of the public to ask them to stop the massacres.  But let me repeat that I have told you that that was a security meeting. 
Q.	Did you keep a diary between April and July of 1994? 
A.	No, I did not keep a notebook recording events that unfolded on a day-to-day basis. 
Q.	When are you first approached by the Defence to give evidence in support of the Defence position?  Approximately when was it, please?
A.	We were in the month of July.  The first time I met members of Karemera's Defence team was in June of this year.  That is last month.  
Q.	It's right, is it not, that you have at no stage made any statement to any of the Prosecutors of this Tribunal; is that correct?
A.	Are you referring to the Prosecutor of this Tribunal?  Members of the Office of the Prosecutor of this Tribunal?  I have not quite understood your question.  Are you referring to the OTP here?  
Q.	Yes, I am. 
A.	I have never met with members of the Office of the Prosecutor.  I met with Karemera's Defence counsel who asked me to appear before this Tribunal to testify to events that I witnessed.  
Q.	Did you make a statement which you signed to the Karemera Defence team?
A.	No.  I did not give a written statement.  However, I gave them information I had.  I gave an oral statement, nothing else. 
Q.	The first time, then, that you have offered information that concerns Karemera, although not signed by you, was in June of 2008.  Do I understand correctly?
A.	That is correct.  It was in June that I met with the Prosecutor (sic), and it was on that occasion that the latter told me that I should prepare myself to appear before this Tribunal to testify.  
Q.	Thank you.  When you spoke with members of the Defence in June of 2008, were you told that a witness in these proceedings had said that he had seen Karemera in your area on three occasions between April and July of 1994?
A.	No.  We never discussed such a subject.  They told me that I had to testify before this Tribunal to facts that I had witnessed, and I told them that I was aware of those facts.  Regarding those other witnesses, it is only here that I heard that those persons had come to testify when I was asked to write the name of someone on a piece of paper, or rather, when I was shown a name on a piece of paper. 
Q.	Thank you.  That's helpful.

When you spoke with the Karemera Defence, is it right that in June 2008 you were asked whether you had seen Karemera in your area between April and July of 1994?
A.	Yes.  They asked me whether I knew Karemera, and I told them that I knew him, and then they asked me whether I was aware of any activities he may have carried out during that period.  And I told them that I was going to come and testify and testify only to events that I was aware of.  
Q.	What activities did you tell them Karemera, you recall, had conducted in your area?
A.	Now, I have already told you that I informed them that I knew Karemera and that I would willingly testify before this Chamber, but I was not asked to talk specifically about one event or another.  I know Karemera because he is *****************************.  I know he was a member of parliament, and I told them that I would answer any questions put to me by members of this Tribunal. 
Q.	That's helpful, but what is it you told them you knew about Karemera's activities in the area?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, what I knew was that, among all charges, as regards all charges against Karemera, I had no information, or rather I had not witnessed any of the activities or acts he is charged with. 
Q.	But you had seen him on the 3rd of May 1994 in Kibuye at that meeting with the prime minister.  If I understand you correctly, you did not tell the Defence that.  Is that right?
A.	Prosecutor, that was 14 years ago.  That's when those events occurred.  Do you think anyone can remember all those events in detail?  My head is not a computer.  All you need to do is press a button on the computer, and it would give you all the information you need.  I am not a computer, Prosecutor. 
Q.	Did you forget certain things because it's all so long ago?
A.	What events are you referring to?  What events would I have forgotten?  
Q.	Did you forget about seeing Karemera on the 3rd of May of 1994 because you're not a computer?
A.	I have just remembered that event because you put a question to me concerning that meeting, and I remembered that I had attended that meeting. 
Q.	I understand that.  But when the Defence first spoke to you in June of 2008, it's right, isn't it, that you had forgotten that you had seen Karemera in Kibuye on the 3rd of May 1994?
A.	I did not remember that detail.  It is today that I have recalled that fact following a question you put to me on that meeting, and that is when I remembered that that meeting indeed took place and that I was present.  And I am telling you the truth. 
Q.	Can you remember now what Charles Sikubwabo, S-I-K-U-B-W-A-B-O, Sikubwabo, one of the bourgmestres in the Bisesero area, said to the prime minister was happening in Bisesero on the 
	3rd of May 1994?  Can you remember what he said, or is it so long ago it's difficult to remember?
A.	Now, you cannot remember all the persons who attended that meeting.  There were people who hailed from all corners of the préfecture.  During the meeting all we focused on was what was said regarding security.  It is impossible for me to remember all statements made by everyone who spoke at that meeting. 
Q.	Did you attend the meeting with Sindikubwabo on the 16th of May 1994 in Kibuye?
A.	I only remember that meeting of the 3rd of May.  Besides, as concerns that date, the 3rd of May, you are the one who reminded me of that date.  I had forgotten about it.  I no longer remembered that date. 
Q.	I'm not talking about the 3rd of May anymore.  I'm talking about the president on the 16th of May, Sindikubwabo.  Now, there was a gathering then, on the 16th of May 1994, again in the préfecture hall in Kibuye.  Did you attend that?  Can you remember, or can you not remember?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I do recall that I only went to Kibuye on one occasion to attend a security meeting. 
Q.	You were a member of the MRND.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	That is correct.  I was a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	Karemera was your vice-president.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, he was. 
Q.	How long had you been a member of the MRND by April of 1994?
A.	I had always been a member of the MRND, and I have never been a member of any other political party. 
Q.	Did you hold any office?  Were you a member of the local committee of the MRND?
A.	I was a member of that party.  I was a member of the MRND in my area. 
Q.	Were you on the area committee?  Is that what you mean by  "I was a member of the MRND in my area"?
A.	I was one of the members of the party, and in the office I held, as I have told you, I was a leader, but I was not a leader of the party at the secteur level as I have said before at the beginning of my testimony. 
Q.	And you knew Karemera as someone in your area, someone coming from your area, the 
	**********************.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Had you ever met Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No.  I do not even know him.  I only know him by name.  We often heard his name over the radio, but I do not know him.  I never saw him.  And even if he had been at a meeting, it would have been impossible for me to recognise him.  So I cannot tell from where he hails.  I did not know him. 
Q.	Did you know or ever meet Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	I do not know him either. 
Q.	Did you ever attend any MRND meetings or rallies?
A.	Yes.  Initially, when the rallies were organised, we would go there, and in my area, there were only 
	two political parties, namely, the MDR party and the MRND party.  The MDR party had many more members than the MRND.  It had virtually silenced the MRND, but I continued to be a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	You are aware that the Interahamwe was the youth movement attached to the MRND; isn't that right? 
A.	No.  That's not true. 
Q.	What was the Interahamwe?
A.	From the very beginning, I have told you that I never saw any Interahamwe.  There were none in my area.  I didn't see any, and I have explained to you, from the very beginning of my testimony, that I did not see any Interahamwe, I was not familiar with that movement, and that the Interahamwe did not ever exist in my area. 
Q.	I'm not asking you about that, in your area.  I'm asking you about being a member of the MRND for many years.  I'm asking you about:  What was that organisation?  From your knowledge of your party, what was the Interahamwe?
A.	I do not know the Interahamwe.  I do not know the members thereof.  I do not know persons who belonged to that organisation or association.  I do not know them at all. 
Q.	The Interahamwe was the youth movement of the MRND.  That is well established.  Are you saying you were entirely unaware as to whether the Interahamwe was the youth movement within the MRND?
A.	I know nothing about that.  I have told you that I was a member of the MRND party, but the Interahamwe have never existed in our area, and I have never seen any Interahamwe anywhere, and I believe that you should make do with my answer.  I do not know the Interahamwe, and I never saw any of them. 
Q.	You've offered yourself as somebody who was well informed, somebody who would have known what was going on.  I suggest to you that if you don't know what the Interahamwe was, despite being in the MRND; you don't know who was killing the Tutsis in your area, despite being in charge of your area; you don't know who was killing the Tutsis in Bisesero, despite knowing that there were Tutsis in Bisesero; you don't know who happened in Gatwaro stadium or the Home Saint-Jean, despite being at the meeting on the 3rd of May 1994, you're not actually that well informed at all.  You'd like to have been, but you're not. 
A.	I have stated that the massacres took place, and I have given an explanation.  There were clashes that were a consequence of the war, and as far as the events of Gatwaro and Bisesero are concerned, I have told you that I am unaware. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Closed session, please, Your Honours, for about five minutes, and then I will finish with this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
For the benefit of the public, the Chamber has made an order for the protection of this witness for security reasons, and one element of it is that his identity should be concealed from the public during this evidence.  For this reason, we have to go into a closed session now to ensure that the questions that are now being asked to him will not elicit answers that might reveal his information to the public, identity to the public.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 19 to 22] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 13 to 18 by Kelly Surina)








MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  My learned friend Mr. Nimy is looking at me.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I would simply like to request my learned colleague Morley to give the sources and references of the figures that he has advanced as it would enable us to cross-check and also to take it into consideration.  As far as our Defence is concerned, he referred to 50,000 killed in Bisesero, 10,000 killed in the stadium, and 10,000 at the Home Saint-Jean.  I would like him to give the sources so that we can verify those figures because you would understand, sir, that the Home Saint-Jean can hardly contain a thousand persons.  So it is difficult to fathom that 10,000 persons were killed in that location.  Thank you, Mr. President.  For the record it was the Gatwaro stadium where, according to the Prosecution, 10,000 persons were killed. 
MR. MORLEY: 
As my learned friend asks, I'll respond.  The witness GK talked about the massacres of the Home Saint-Jean and the Gatwaro stadium.  There are photographs of the memorials.  The numbers are recorded in the photographs if I remember correctly, and certainly there was evidence to the effect of the numbers that were killed.  And not long ago, if I also remember correctly, whilst cross-examining the witness LSP, the figures were put to him, and he didn't dispute them.  So there we are.  I hope that answers Mr. Nimy's inquiry.  It may be that he has the disadvantage of not having been present when we heard from examined GK, but no doubt he can look material up.   
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not wish to engage in this debate anymore.  I would simply like to recall, for the benefit of Mr. Morley, that I only challenge the testimony of our witness, the figure of 200- or 250,000 persons who are said to be killed in Kigali, and that question is still awaiting an answer, but be that as it may, Mr. President, I take cognisance of the sources of the figures he has mentioned, and we are going to revisit that issue in due time, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY: 
As my learned friend reminds us of the Kigali figures, my learned friend is reminded of the proposition that it's up to 200,000 Tutsis in the Kigali area which includes the city as well as Kigali rural.  Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I thank Mr. Morley for the progress he is making in terms of mastery of figures.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Miss DIAGNE-Mbaye, you may continue.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, I would like to come back to you with a few short questions.  I would like to put to you again some questions that my learned friend put to you because I do not understand why he put them to you in closed session.   I would like you to confirm what you stated, if I've properly understood your statement, that it was the RPF that attacked Rwanda and triggered all the unfortunate consequences which we are now discussing today.  
A.	That was indeed my statement.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I would like us to clarify a point mentioned a while ago.  Do you confirm before this Chamber that you did in fact make the following statement.  What I mean is, did you say that the police and the gendarmerie did all they could to contain the killings but they were overwhelmed by the events?  Do you confirm that?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry.  That is a leading question only half of which was in fact arguably part of his previous testimony.  Doing all they could to contain the killings has never been this witness' testimony.  What he has said is that they were overwhelmed, and there's been a dispute as to whether he said the army had not acted properly.  But to put the question in the way that my learned friend has put it is inappropriate.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness did say yes in answer to Counsel's question.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
In that case, Mr. President, can the Prosecutor tell us how the gendarmerie and the police were overwhelmed if it was not to contain the killings which is what is before the Court today.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne-Mbaye, the question that you're asking is really unnecessary because if he in fact said it already, it's already on the record, and he doesn't have to repeat it.  On the other hand, our recollection is that what he did say was that it was the government who had done all in its power.  But if it's already stated, it's already on the record, and it's unnecessary just to get him to repeat it.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I am sorry about that, Mr. President, but the witness is here, and he has testified about the police, the gendarmerie, and the action they took.  I am looking at notes I took.  Mr. President, I wouldn't like to engage in polemics before this Chamber.  I'll proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, can you confirm before the Chamber that the famous meeting of the 3rd of May 1994 was a security meeting?
A.	Yes.  That is true. 
Q.	Witness, if that is the case and if the prime minister, his government, and figures of authority deemed it necessary to convene a security meeting, that would indeed have been for purposes of putting an end to the killings, isn't it?
A.	Yes.  That was the subject of the meeting. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness. 
A.	I am listening to you.  
Q.	Witness, a while ago, you told the Prosecutor that those responsible for killings in your commune were identified and punished, were identified and punished.  Do you confirm that?
A.	Yes.  That is what happened. 
Q.	Witness, can you confirm before this Chamber that Gacaca court sessions were held in your commune in all cellules and secteurs in order to identify all those who perpetrated killings in your commune?
A.	Yes.  That is what happened. 
Q.	Witness, please tell the Chamber whether you have ever heard members of the public, be it once or on several occasions, say who are responsible for those killings, whether they said that Mr. Édouard Karemera was either directly or indirectly responsible for those killings?
A.	Throughout my ten years in custody, I was with co-detainees from all the communes of the préfecture, and we were in ****************, and information was collected over a long period of time, and some of the detainees confessed to participating in those crimes and asked for  pardon, but I never heard any detainee state that Édouard Karemera had incited him or her to commit any of the killings attributed to the detainees.   
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  This will be my last question.

Do you confirm that the persons mentioned by the other person whose name was written on a piece of paper, I mean those persons I named a while ago, namely, Stanislas Nkurunziza, who is number 11 on the spelling list, Françoise -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry.  This doesn't arise out of cross-examination.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, the names do not flow from the cross-examination, but the facts do.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have completed your redirect?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Pardon me?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I didn't understand your comment, and then you sat down.  So I enquired whether you had completed your redirect.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
No, Mr. President.  I am a disciplined person.  Mr. Morley made an objection, and I was expecting you to rule on it, but if you are asking me to proceed with my re-examination of the witness and to complete it, I will proceed immediately. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  I did not understand your response to Mr. Morley.  You conceded that the names you mentioned didn't arise, but I don't understand why you say you're entitled to ask that question.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I did not insist on anything at all.  I responded to Mr. Morley's objection.  What I said was that I wasn't focusing on names but on the facts which are of interest to me and which flow from the cross-examination.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, a while ago I named some persons who you said a while ago resided in Gisovu commune.  I would like you to confirm before this Chamber that Gisenyi centre is indeed situated in Mwendo commune, Gahunde secteur.
A.	The facts are correct as you have just recounted them, and they tally with my knowledge of the events.   
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  

Mr. President, may I inform you that I have completed my re-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
What I meant was my redirect.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Witness, that concludes your testimony.  We thank you for being a witness and assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You are now excused.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you.  
(Witness excused) 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, the witness is seeking the Chamber's leave to say hello the Accused before leaving, that is, during the break period.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Permission is granted.  The registrar will facilitate. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Might Your Honours contemplate a 15-minute break now and contemplate sitting through until 1 o'clock?  It's a thought, a matter for Your Honours.  If Your Honours are intent on rising at 12:30, then perhaps we should just continue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne-Mbaye, what is the anticipated duration of the examination-in-chief of the next witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I am unable to tell you that now because I don't know how fast that witness' examination-in-chief will last and the duration of the cross-examination by Mr. Morley.  Since we have completed the testimony of this witness before break, I would imagine I would be in a position to tell you after the lunch break, but if you wish that we should proceed on the issue of personal particulars of the witness, I would suggest that we proceed depending on what you say, but my humble opinion is that we should start after the lunch break.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That really invites the potential that we lose control of the timing of the trial.  We would lose too much time if we acceded to that request without in fact having some clarity as to the intended duration of the witness' testimony.  Under the circumstances, I think we'll probably -- yes.  We think that we will let the witness' testimony start now, and we will take lunch at 12:30.

Could you please change the witness.

Mr. Morley, unless there was a physical reason why we needed to break for a short while?
MR. MORLEY: 
There is, but I'll be back in a moment. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
For that we can raise for a few minutes.   
MR. MORLEY: 
No, no, no, Your Honour.  It's no difficulty at all.  I'll be back in a minute and a half.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
As a first step to giving evidence here, you are allowed to take an oath or make a declaration to tell the truth during your testimony, and the registrar will now assist you in doing that.  
(Declaration made by Mathias Hitiyaremye in Kinyarwanda) 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose, and you will respond, first of all, to lawyers representing Mr. Édouard Karemera, Ms. Diagne-Mbaye.  
MATHIAS HITIYAREMYE,
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
	Mr. President, I recall that this morning the witness told Mr. Mjui to inform me that he would have some difficulty reading any documents because he did not have his eyeglasses on him.

May I ask him whether that problem has been sorted out?
THE WITNESS:
No.  That problem has not been solved.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, it would appear that the problem was being solved, and I was told that normally it ought to have been solved by now.  I do not understand why it has not been solved.  That being the case, Mr. President, may I request you to allow me to find out from Mr. Mjui why it hasn't been solved by granting me a few minutes break?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Isn't the answer simply to, in closed session over a few minutes, to put to the witness his personal details?  He doesn't have to read anything, and once we're satisfied that he agrees them, he can sign the document because we'll all know that he's attested to its contents, and we can get on with things.   
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I thank Mr. Morley, but he says that is all.  He says that my witness will not have to read anything.  That is well and good, but he doesn't know anything about the whole matter.  As for the witness' personal particulars, may we go into closed session?  And the witness will eventually get his glasses and confirm the information, and thereafter, the personal particulars will be placed under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  For the benefit of the public, the Chamber has made an order for the protection of this witness for security reasons, and one element of that is that his identity as a witness should be concealed from the public.  Now, very often we're able to conduct that examination as to who he is in open session because there is a written document which he could sign, and that could become evidence.  But as you have just heard, we have to get the evidence from him by way of question and answer.  So we have to go into closed session for this section of his evidence, and we will do that now.  
MR. MORLEY: 
While we're doing that, may I mention that if there are other documents for this witness at the moment the Prosecution haven't had them distributed.  So we don't know what they are, and they're normally distributed at this stage. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
May I start, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness. 
A.	Yes, Counsel.
Q.	Please tell the Chamber your surname, your first name, date and place of birth.
A.	My name is Mathias Hitiyaremye.  I was born on the 5th of March 1954 at Nyabubare in Gikaranka secteur in what is known as Gisovu commune in the former Kibuye préfecture in Rwanda.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Hitiyaremye is spelt as follows, H-I-T-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  Nyabubare is spelt as follows, 
N-Y-A-B-U-B-A-R-E, and Gikaranka is spelt as follows, G-I-K-A-R-A-N-K-A, spelt by the interpreter.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. Issa, kindly assist me so that we can move more swiftly so that the judges and the parties can have the documents before that the accuracy thereof is confirmed orally by the witness.  

Thank you.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	At this stage, kindly state the name of your parents, namely, your father and your mother.
A.	My father's name is Rwabanda, and my mother's name is Nyirabamenyerwa. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
There was an overlap, Counsel.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Can you tell the Court, Witness, your place of residence in April 1994. 
A.	I lived in Bwishyura in Gitesi commune in the town of Kibuye, but my family lived in Gisovu commune. 
Q.	Kindly tell the Court your current place of residence, namely, the town and country.
A.	I live in the city of Kampala in Uganda. 
Q.	Kindly tell the Court your current occupation. 
A.	I am unemployed. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court your occupation or position in 1994.
A.	I was a public servant serving in the ministry of family welfare and women's empowerment. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I deem that at this juncture we can safely revert to open session so that you can check with the witness if the protection order you took should be maintained or not.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I could ask him the question now.   

Mr. Witness, you must already be aware that the Chamber had made an order, a protection order, for your benefit.  And one element of that was that your identity as a witness should not be revealed to the public.  I am now asking you whether you wish that order to remain in force or you wish to have it revealed.  So can you indicate what -- do you understand my question?
THE WITNESS:
I believe that I can testify in open court.  As I have said, my testimony is the truth, and I wish to reveal that truth to everybody.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  So -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
It might be mindlessly technical, but it may be that the witness now in open session in the open may need to say who he is on the record, and my learned friend is welcome to lead and announce who this witness is.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We revoke the protection order we made in favour of this witness.  All right.  We'll go into open session now.

Thank you.  You may continue.  I think as a preliminary point I should now make an order that the testimony taken in closed session should become public.

You may continue, Ms. Diagne-Mbaye.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I'm obliged, Mr. President.  And technically speaking, I encountered that problem, and I understood that the witness wanted the protective measures to be waived and that he wanted to testify in full view, and the practice is that that question should have been put before all the other questions, and that is why I thought that that question would have been repeated and, therefore, while (sic) the time of the Court.   

Now that that question has been addressed in closed session, is it necessary, Mr. President, for that question to be asked again so that it can go on the record as being in open court. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I have just made an order that the closed session, which was undertaken initially, is now in the clear to be open session.  So those records will now be public.  So it's under public record now already.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you for that clarification, Mr. President.  I had merely understood that the witness was ordered to give his testimony in open court.  Thank you, sir.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, were you a member of any political party in your country in Rwanda?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was that party?
A.	The MRND. 
Q.	Mr. Hitiyaremye, I will attempt to pronounce your name correctly.  Mr. Hitiyaremye, Mathias, kindly tell the Court, if you know, Mr. Édouard Karemera.
A.	I knew him. 
Q.	Can you state the circumstances?
A.	Our native communes share a border.  They are neighbouring communes, and we used to worship in the same parish.  While he was a student, a university student, and while I was a university student as well, we met during worship, and when he completed his studies, he started working, and I started working as well.  And sometimes we would meet at different meetings and other activities pertaining to the development of the country. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Mathias, kindly tell the Court whether you've ever been convicted in Rwanda.
A.	Yes.  I was tried.  I was convicted.  I have served my time.  I have served that sentence. 
Q.	Thank you.  So why were you convicted?
A.	I was detained for 13 years, and I was charged with participation in the horrific events which unfolded in Rwanda.  Subsequently, I pled guilty.  I confessed, and I was convicted.  And that sentence was mitigated by the years I had already spent in prison, and I spent the rest of the time in prison. 
Q.	Where did you serve that sentence?  In what prison?
A.	Between 1994 to 1998, I was hailed in the Gitarama prison, and from 1998 to 2007, I was hailed at the Gisovu prison. 
Q.	Thank you, and I apologise.

Witness Mathias, kindly describe the situation in Kibuye préfecture, your préfecture, after the RPF attack in October 1990.
A.	The war did not break out in Kibuye.  However, we learnt in Kibuye that the country had been attacked, and the people were frightened, but the authorities told the population not to worry as the Rwandan armed forces were holding the assailants in check, and when the RPF attacked, there was no war in Kibuye, but people were very concerned.  And besides, in some communes young people headed to Uganda because it was said that the attackers had come from Uganda, and some young people went to Uganda by different means to join the ranks of the assailants. 
Q.	Do you, therefore, confirm before this Court that as far back as 1990, specifically in October 1990, there was a massive recruitment of young people by the RPF? 
A.	No.  I cannot make such an accession, and besides, it is only subsequently that I learnt that young people were leaving, but I cannot claim that those departures or that exodus started at that time, but in 1992, bourgmestre read out a letter to us during an ordinary meeting, and that letter had been drafted by a certain Kanyarengwe wherein he was thanking the bourgmestre of the Rwamatamu commune for having sent him young people, for those young people together with Kanyarengwe to fight together, and he also requested the other bourgmestres to allow other young people to come and fight alongside Kanyarengwe to weed out Habyarimana's government, and it was on that occasion during the meeting that the bourgmestre read out the letter to us.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a spelling list for this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
It is being prepared, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you ask the witness the spelling of the names just mentioned.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, you mentioned a certain bourgmestre who was commanded by Mr. Kanyarengwe.  Kindly spell out those two names for the benefit of the Court.
A.	That bourgmestre went by the name Joseph Bugingo spelt B-U-G-I-N-G-O, Bugingo, Joseph Bugingo.  Joseph is spelt J-O-S-E-P-H. 
Q.	One minute, Witness, please.
A.	He was the bourgmestre of Gisovu commune.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could counsel kindly observe a small pause between the witness' testimony and her question to ensure a smooth interpretation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Both counsel and the witness, the interpreters have requested that there should be a pause between question and answer so that the interpretation could be completed to avoid overlapping.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
That's understood, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, kindly spell out, for the benefit of the Trial Chamber, the name of the person who commanded the bourgmestre.
A.	Are you referring to the bourgmestre to whom the letter of thanks was addressed?  
Q.	No, not at all, Witness.  You told the Trial Chamber that a certain gentleman had sent a letter to the bourgmestre to thank him, that is, the bourgmestre.  So I would like you to spell out the name of that person.
A.	Thank you.  That letter was written by Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe who was the chairperson of the RPF at the time, and Kanyarengwe is spelt K-A-N-Y-A-R-E-N-G-W-E, Kanyarengwe.  That is his surname.  And his first name is Alexis, spelt A-L E-X-I-S.  

May I correct something that has been said.  He did not send the letter to Joseph.  He sent the letter to the bourgmestre of the Rwamatamu commune.  Rwamatamu commune, number 15 on the spelling list of the previous witness.  
Q.	Can you kindly spell out that name for the benefit of the Trial Chamber.
A.	Rwamatamu is spelt -- (Microphones overlapping). 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I was just saying that if it's on the spelling list, you don't have to take the witness' time to get him to spell it again.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Indeed, Mr. President, it is number 15, but I wasn't sure that you had the document before you.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I have it.  I think it's been circulated and distributed already.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, what was the name of that bourgmestre of Rwamatamu?
A.	His name was Abel Furere. 
Q.	How is Furere spelt?
A.	It is spelt F-U-R-E-R-E. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, kindly tell the Court when, specifically in which year, did you become aware of the young people who were leaving to join the ranks of the RPF in Uganda? 
A.	It was when the letter was read out to us.  I'm not very certain, but I believe it was in 1992. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, thereafter was the advent of multiparty politics in 1991; correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Kindly describe for the benefit of the Trial Chamber the political landscape from that moment in your area.
A.	From July 1991 political parties started recruiting members by convening meetings and rallies to recruit members. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But I would rather you told the Trial Chamber with the advent of multiparty politics what were the political forces who were active in your commune of Kibuye -- préfecture rather.  The Kibuye préfecture.
A.	Prior to multiparty politics, it was only the MRND that was present throughout the country.  Other political parties like the MDR and the PSD were on a campaign to recruit members of the new-found or revamped MRND, and it was the MDR which was most active and successfully attracted a greater number of members compared to all political parties in the préfecture of Kibuye. 
Q.	Do you mean to tell the Trial Chamber that after the advent of multiparty politics in Rwanda in your préfecture of Kibuye the predominant party was the MDR?
A.	Indeed.  That is what I mean to say. 
Q.	Thank you.  Kindly give an account of the activities of your political party in Kibuye préfecture from that time on.
A.	From 1991 the leaders of the MRND party started looking for members.  They were the transitional organs of the MRND which organised meetings, and at some point in time, an office was set up at the préfecture, and the person manning that office had to coordinate the activities and manage relations between the top brass of the party and those of the lower rungs, and these officers had to handle the communiqués of that party which had to be sent out to members of the party as well as handle relations with the media. 
Q.	As far as you are concerned, did you ever attend any rallies organised by the MRND during which Édouard Karemera was present?
A.	Yes.  I attended such rallies.  As a matter of fact, at some point in time, I worked in that MRND office in Kibuye.  I was a worker at that office. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell the Court if, in the course of those rallies, you heard Édouard Karemera utter statements of discrimination targeting the Tutsi?
A.	Never.  During those rallies I never heard Édouard Karemera utter negative statements against the Tutsi.  And if my memory serves me right, he was the national secretary of the MRND party.  And accordingly, he couldn't flout the ideals of the MRND party, and by the way, that party sought to achieve unity and development in the country, and therefore, could not pit citizens against one another when the very purpose of those rallies were to enlist members into that political party. 
Q.	Indeed, Witness, within the MRND in your préfecture, were there any Tutsi members?
A.	Yes.  There were Tutsi.  There were Hutu.  There were Twa.  We often met at the rallies, and we didn't have any problems. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I notice that everybody is looking at their watch, and with your leave, we apply for adjournment for lunch.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take the lunch of adjournment now as usual.  
(Court recessed at 1235H)
(Pages 23 to 35 by Kelly Surina)


































(Court resumed at 1410H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Good afternoon, Your Honour.  As you can see, there's a change in this place; it shows that 
Counsel Hounkpatin travelled and asked me to apologise to the Court and to also greet the Chamber in his -- on his (sic) behalf, which I -- I have just done.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I agree to testify in open.  I also would like to ask something from you, and I hope you will grant my wish.  I have a problem with my sight .  I continue having headaches and I even get dizzy, because I don't have glasses.  I would like you to ask the people involved -- concerned that they should provide a pair of glasses to me.  I also would like to ask you that, after my testimony, that you allow me to stay elsewhere than in the place where I am.  If you don't think it is asking to too much, I would like to stay in a hotel.  I also would like to ask that, after my testimony, I would like to say hello to Karemera and to his Defence team.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Some of the matters that you have raised can be dealt with very simply.  But I think it might be better to wait until the end of your testimony, which will take place during the course of this afternoon.  And then we'll make the appropriate orders.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Good afternoon, President, Your Lordships.  

Good afternoon. 
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Counsel.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Before the lunch break, we left off at a time when you were stating to the Chamber that you -- you had never heard Mr. Karemera during your party rallies calling for the extermination of the Tutsis.  Is that an adequate summary of what you said? 
A.	Yes, you understood me well.  
Q.	You also confirmed to the Chamber that your political party also had Tutsis as members.  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	Witness, Mr. Mathias, I would like us to talk a little bit about the Interahamwe in your commune.  Could we say that there was an organised structure that could be called Interahamwe?  
A.	No.  That did not exist in our commune.  However, such an idea was floated by some people when we heard that in Kigali the MRND had a -- a group known as the Interahamwe of the MRND, or za MRND.  So when we were invited to a meeting to say what we thought and to see how these structures were run in view of enabling the existence of Interahamwes in all communes so that these organs could entertain meetings of the MRND -- but this did not happen because of the death of the head of state.  
Q.	When you met in view of setting up this youth wing organisation, could you explain to the Chambers what the idea was, why you felt the urge for your political party, the MRND, in Kibuye, to have its own youth structure?  
A.	This idea of creating a youth association came from Kigali, because when -- with the advent of multipartyism, the MDR, PSD, and the PL, had set up youth wings that were affiliated to those political parties, and those opposition party youth were met -- had targeted the dislodging of MRND militants and to recruit them in their parties, and often through violence.  And that is why in turn, the same organ of youths was set up in order to counter the action from the other parties.  That is what had been done in Kigali.  

But on the whole, that youth -- the objective of the youth was to provide entertainment during party rallies, because, you know, during party rallies, there's some form of manifestation of joy.  And that is the underpinning idea behind the setting up of the MRND. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for your explanations.  And I would like you to provide the Chamber with your vision of your party's desire, at some point in time, to set up such a youth organisation in Kibuye; although, as you say this had not been done because I met -- I saw in a transcript of a meeting of the MRND -- unless I am mistaken, it is the meeting of the 7th of November 1993 -- that you took the floor, and it was said that you were speaking on behalf of the Interahamwe.  

So, when you explain that these structures never existed in Kibuye, that's what I would like to understand and have the Chamber understand.  Do you recall that meeting? 
A.	I no longer remember the date at which a meeting was held, but I remember having attended that meeting, and I told you under what circumstances.  The Interahamwe officials in Kigali came together and wanted to popularise the ideas in other préfectures.  The Kibuye was invited to that meeting as well.  Considering the fact that I usually participated -- attended MRND rallies and other party meetings, I told the MRND officials in each commune to tell me people who had to join me from Kigali to take part in that meeting, considering the fact that some people were sent to me.  But some communes could not send delegates, because the idea was very speedily set up.  So seven of us left, and there were about ten -- it was supposed to be ten, but actually -- only seven -- I'm sorry.  Okay. 
Okay.  When I arrived to Kigali, the ceremony was about to come to an end and someone was saying the people who were invited to this meeting have seen everything, they heard what we desire, and that is why we would like them to tell us what they think.  Among the youth who were with me, none of them was used to speaking in public, and we hadn't prepared a written speech for that occasion.  And those youths asked me to speak on behalf of all to explain our needs, our desire to implement what we had just heard.  

As I had noted, that the organisation had been well done, and that these youths' objectives were not contrary to those of the MRND, which were peace, development and unity, I said that when that organ would be set up, that the rules and regulations of that body have been drafted, a copy should be sent to us.  And that is under what circumstances I took the floor.
MR. MORLEY: 
I am on my feet.  May I enquire, please?  My learned friend has announced that she saw a document referring to this witness being a spokesman for the Interahamwe on the 7th of November 1993.  Can my learned friend help us, please, with what the reference for that document is so we can find it?  Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour, I am unable to give a positive response to that request because I don't have the documents here.  Quite simply, it was just something I thought of off the cuff when I was talking to the witness.  But I can promise opposing number (sic) that I will do the necessary research as he had done.  So I would not be riding out to Gitarama or Kigali, but I will give him the references of these documents here.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, as far as you are aware, could you state to the Chamber if military training was organised, and if weapons were distributed in -- in the Kibuye préfecture between 1993 and 1994?  And it may be a good idea if -- you may state if it so happened, irrespective of the commune in that préfecture.  I know that is a general sort of question.  But before I come to something more specific, I would like to ask you if you heard whether there was a distribution of weapons or military training in any commune or another?  

I am going to take out the term "to the Interahamwe" since you have already asserted to the Chamber that there were Interahamwe.  
A.	Thank you.  I never heard talk about that, in any way, in Kibuye there was a distribution of weapons or military training.  I never heard that said in any Kibuye commune.  That was about to happen when the prime minister, during a tour of all the préfectures, stated that fighting had intensified and that youth should assist the army, and that they had to meet and train, and that they would be provided weapons to go and assist the army in kicking out the enemy -- out of the territory.  I know the PM said that in Kibuye at the beginning of May, and it was in line with what was known as "civil defence".  

While the bourgmestres were wondering how the civil defence was going to be organised, the government -- the interim government, that is -- went on exile with the people prior to the implementation of that plan.  I believe I have been clear.  If you missed something, or if you didn't understand what I said, I'm ready to provide further explanation.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I believe I understood you.  

But allow me to insist, might you not have heard of military training provided Interahamwes weapons distributed to Interahamwe in the Rwagera commune?  
A.	If I were to return to the answer I gave you earlier, what I said was that there was no branch of the Interahamwe in Kibuye préfecture.  So there was, therefore, no arms distributions to Interahamwes, unless there were other militias that I was not aware of.  But, in Kibuye, there were no MRND Interahamwe.  So weapons could, therefore, not have been distributed to people who did not exist.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Would you, by any chance, have heard of military training ordered by Mr. Édouard Karemera, or would you have heard of weapons distributions carried out by Mr. Édouard Karemera in the company of a colonel called Ndahimana?  Have you ever heard of any such events?  
A.	I have never heard of that.  I spent 13 years in prison.  I heard the confessions of several persons who confessed their offences, and I did not hear anyone make mention of Karemera or Ndahimana to the effect that the two persons participated in any distributions of weapons.  

Furthermore, I was a member of a commission that sensitised the detainees on the advantages of making confessions.  Many of those persons made public statements and gave public confessions, and on no occasion did I hear anyone state that those two persons did anything whatsoever in Kibuye.  
Q.	I thank you.  Mr. Mathias, were you aware of the presence of clandestine RPF brigades in Kibuye préfecture?  
A.	I heard people say that, but I did not witness any such events.  Some bourgmestres, when they went to the préfecture office, submitted reports on such matters, particularly, that of Gishyita, stated that sub-brigades existed in Bisesero.  Those are the kinds of information I received on that.  Regarding RPF brigades, I did not see any such brigades.  
Q.	Mr. Mathias, do you know the Bisesero zone very well? 
A.	I know the Bisesero region because it is a region that is adjacent to ours from the west -- it is a neighbouring region to ours in the west.  
Q.	Thank you.  Is it true that during the events of April 1994, Tutsis went to seek refuge on the Bisesero hills in droves? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  Many Tutsis went to seek refuge on the hills of Bisesero, as well as some Hutus, besides.  But since that region was predominantly inhabited by the Tutsis, it is obvious that the Tutsis were in the majority there.  However, I didn't go there to conduct a census of Hutus and Tutsis there.  However, it is public knowledge that many people sought refuge there.  
Q.	In your opinion, to your mind, did the Tutsis go there because it was a zone that was predominantly inhabited by Tutsi?  
A.	When people sat down to do an analysis of the situation, they wondered why people who hailed from several regions sought refuge in Bisesero.  Everyone tried to reflect and to understand the situation relying on a report by the bourgmestre of Gishyita, who made mention of an existence of an RPF brigade in that region.  Some people said that the RPF had infiltrated that region, and that supporters of the RPF had been sensitised to go and serve the rounds of the RPF brigade in that region.  That was an analysis that everyone did with a view to finding out why all those people went to the Bisesero region to seek refuge.  
Q.	Thank you.  Did you, nevertheless, hear anyone talk of the existence of a radio station called 
	Radio Muhabura? 
A.	I heard people say that that radio station existed, and I, myself, occasionally tuned to that radio station and listened to its broadcast.  Whenever I passed by a place where there was a shortwave radio, I would listen to broadcasts of that radio station.  
Q.	Is it true that that radio station broadcast messages calling on Tutsis who supported the RPF to go up to the Bisesero hills to seek refuge there?  
A.	I, personally, did not hear that.  But, according to what people were saying, some people said -- or, rather, some people asked the people who had sought refuge in Bisesero to make an effort to be patient because the RPF was on the point of going to Bisesero.  I didn't hear such information with my own ears, but I heard people say that such information had been broadcast.  
Q.	Thank you.  Were you aware that after the war, that is, after the events -- I believe it must have been on the 17th of April 1998 -- I know you were already in prison, but did you hear people say that the 
	resist -- the resistance, or those who were members of the resistance in Bisesero, were decorated by the president, Pascal Bizimungu? 
A.	I, indeed, heard that, although I was in prison.  While in prison, we had the opportunity of being in possession of radio sets in order to listen to information.  That is how I came to know that members of the resistance were decorated  meritoriously.  A speech to that effect was broadcast on the radio in its entirety.  
Q.	Thank you.  During the events of April to July 1994, did you ever hear that Mr. Édouard Karemera went up the Bisesero hills?  Did you get to know about that, or did you hear anybody say that?  
A.	I did not hear that, and I did not hear anyone, be it my co-detainees, or any other person I may have met, or people whose confessions I heard.  None of those people -- nobody said that Karemera went up the Bisesero hills.  When people wrote their confessions, they tried to recall the different events.  I -- all I heard, nobody made mention of the presence of Karemera in Bisesero.  And when I was released, I did not hear any such information.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, at this stage in the proceedings, I am experiencing some difficulty, because I would like to put the names of certain persons to Mr. Mathias -- I mean persons who made statements before you, this Chamber.  What I want him to do is to tell the Chamber whether he knows those persons.  But we have this problem -- the problem the witness has, which is sight.  Could we circumvent that problem by using a microphone -- I beg your pardon, Mr. President.  Can we circumvent that problem by going into a closed session?  
MR. MORLEY: 
It might be thought that if my learned friend thought the matter through a little bit, all that really needs to happen is for my learned friend to write down the various names and for Your Honours' ever-helpful usher to, with the microphone switched off, whisper into the witness's ear, in respect to the names put on the piece of paper, the names.  The witness would then know the names, and then could pass comment based on the note, which has been produced, and would, no doubt, become an exhibit.  That is one way around the problem. 

However, what is not helpful is to announce before the Chamber that the names which are about to be put in front of the witness are the names of people who are protected witnesses before these proceedings.  My learned friend did not need to say that.  And that comment has been made once before already today.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Ms. Diagne, first of all, a comment.  We considered, a little bit more closely, the position you adopted both on this occasion and on the last occasion.  And we think that we should draw to your attention that the protection orders do not involve the public only.  They also involve the witness in the witness box.  So the witness is not supposed to be given information about the status of the names that he's being shown, because that is a breach of the protection order.  

Now, however, what we do propose to do, if you will accept Mr. Issa's assistance, is that I think the suggestion made by Mr. Morley could satisfy the current situation.  If the names were -- Mr. Issa were allowed to communicate information to the witness, he could then comment upon them in the way in which -- or, respond to questions put to him about them.  That may save us from having to go into closed session. 

How many names are you dealing with?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, before answering your question, I pray the Court's indulgence.  I would like to say that I do not, at all, agree with the proposal made by my learned friend, Morley, because I do not find it an intelligent proposal.  I want him to tell me which university he attended such as to have solutions to all problems.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, please.  Let's try and take personal issues out of your comments, please.  And remember that your submissions are directed to the Chamber, and not to counsel on the other side.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Court's indulgence, Mr. President, what really bothers me is that when Mr. Morley tells you that I should reflect before speaking, I find that shocking.  And when it shocks me, I speak up.  Mr. President, when I am insulted, I have no choice but to speak up.  

Now, let me continue to inform you that if I am not allowed to put the names to the witness in a closed session, I will not do that, and I do not intend to follow the proposal made by Mr. Morley.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, you, perhaps, have not heard the exact translation of what Mr. Morley said, so you probably missed what we heard, because, indeed, when we hear the interpretation -- let me inform you exactly of what we heard:  "If my learned friend could reflect".  That is intolerable and it is not worthy of the wig that Mr. Morley is wearing.  He should stop making these personal attacks regularly at 
Mrs. Diagne.  That is intolerable.  And I would request that the Chamber should call Mr. Morley to order and remind him of his duty not to attack.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Chamber -- has the Chamber come back to normal yet?  

Ms. Diagne?  Ms. Diagne. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't think that irritation with Mr. Morley is a sound basis for the way in which the trial should be conducted.  So let's try and move forward in a manner which guarantees all of the rights of the Accused.  One of it is the issue of having their trial in public.  And we would easily move into closed session if we thought that is required in the current situation.  

But, from the restriction of the problems that we have to address, it seems to us -- and, in fact, it's no longer really Morley's suggestion, it's really coming from the Bench now.  And we thought that, unless the number of names that you had were excessive -- and that's why I asked you how many names were involved, because if the number was not excessive, we think that allowing it to be conducted in public is much better, if you can find a way to do it without breaching the protective orders or any other issues that we have to secure.  

How many names are you addressing?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Three names.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Three names.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Insofar as it is a proposal of the Chamber, I would defer to it.  But if it is a proposal from my 
learned friend, I would not go by it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you got the names written as yet?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I can do that, Mr. President.  It wouldn't take more than a minute. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Issa, would you assist, please?  

Mr. Witness, of the three names shown to you, have you understood what the names are?  
THE WITNESS: 
In answer to the Defence counsel's question, which is whether I know those persons, if I understood her question correctly -- perhaps, I should be told that that is exactly the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Well, this is the Presiding Judge speaking to you.  And I was asking you if you are able to read or understand.  So my question really had to do with whether you recognise the names on the paper.  Could you read the names -- or, were you told what the names were?  
THE WITNESS: 
Now, I understand your question.  I believe I understand your question.  I was, personally, able to read the names on the piece of paper.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good.  And do you recall the order in which the names were?  Can you remember which is number one, number two, and number three, or would you like to have the paper back in your presence?  Which will be permitted if you wish it.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I recall the order in which those names appear on that piece of paper.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good. 

Ms. Diagne, you can proceed.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	My question was, whether you know those persons whose names feature on the piece of paper that was shown to you? 
A.	Mr. President, I do not know person number one on that piece of paper, but I know persons 
	number two and three.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Mathias.  

Now, can you tell us under what circumstances you got to know persons number two and three, since you state that you do not know person number one?  
A.	Regarding person number two, I know that that person is from ******************************.  Our secteurs are neighbouring secteurs.  That person is from ********************************************.  As regards to person number three, that person lives far from my home.  But let me tell you under what circumstances I knew that person.  

A long time ago before the war, if I remember correctly, that person was one of the members of comité de cellule of the MRND.  That was my party.  In fact, it was the single party by the time.  I went to that person's home.  I was a member of a committee in charge of monitoring and supervising the activities of the members of the comité de cellule, namely, development activities.  So I went to the home of that person as part of the supervision of the activities of that person, because the grass roots leaders of the party were supposed to act in an exemplary manner in order that the other members of the party could emulate his example.  And that is how I came to go to that person's house.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
May I request Mr. Issa to assist me in showing the witness a piece of paper on which he shows only the names of the persons that the witness knows.  

While we wait I would like to proceed.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Mathias, those two people whom you've recognised, would you be surprised to hear that they stated that they saw Mr. Karemera supervising attacks against the Tutsis in -- on the Bisesero hills?  
A.	I would be surprised, because regarding, for instance, the person on number two -- 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Interpreters are waiting for witness to speak.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I would be surprised to learn that this person who appears on number two claims to have seen Karemera in the Bisesero.  This person is a Tutsi survivor.  And based on information I had from my co-detainees at the time when I was detained when the war began, at least from the onset of the war, this man hid in his -- his in-laws, which -- who were Hutus.  

Taking into account the killings at the time, that person would not have been able to go to the 
Bisesero hills, that is to say, the distance of about 5 kilometres, to see or to find out about the so-called leaders of the attacks.  That is something difficult for me to understand.  But that is why I dare say he is lying with regard to the Accused, unless he had divine revelation with regard to the presence of the Accused on the hill.  

With regard to the person who appears -- whose name appears in number three, I believe that what is said is not possible, unless that person had come with a person concerned.  As a matter of fact, this person lives at a distance of about 45 kilometers from the Bisesero hills.  And we are talking about the third or fourth secteur from the secteur where the person concerned lives.  I have already covered that distance, and I am of the opinion that a young man who is trekking would cover the distance for -- within five to eight hours -- seven to eight hours of time.  That is why I can't tell you they came together.  But if they claim to have seen him there, while they didn't come together, the Chamber has to examine that more closely to see how somebody could see another person on a place, irrespective of the place, whereas they were not on that same -- in that same place.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, may I just mention from recollection -- and I may be wrong -- that it was never put to number two that he had hidden with in-laws throughout the genocide.  So that -- number two has never been asked about that.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour, responding to my learned colleague's objection would allude to revealing the identity -- their status, which you stated a while ago, and that will have an incidence on the order for the protective measures that you have made.  That is why I have tried not to reply to his objection. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry, that's nonsense.  My learned friend has already told this witness that the names that she was going to put in front of him had been witnesses.  And I objected to that.  But that's been done.  The public doesn't know the names of the witnesses.  We managed to stop that, because the names appear on a piece of paper.  My observation, to which my learned friend may reply or may not, is that the allegation that number two hid with in-laws throughout the genocide was never put to him.  He's never been tested on it.  It's never been suggested before.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, as it appears that Mr. Morley is the person who is managing the trial, I would like to state that Mr. Mathias referred to this witness who had hidden at his in-laws.  I only said that the person claimed that Mr. Karemera led the attacks on the Bisesero hills.  And witness is suggesting that, according to him, that it is -- why it is not possible that person could have stated that, because that person, himself, was not on the Bisesero hill, but, rather, he was hiding at his Hutu in-laws.  I hope that those clarifications are in place.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, how much longer do you anticipate the examination-in-chief to last?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
If Mr. Morley so allows, in a short while, even though that might not be before the first break of the afternoon, or in any event, a short while after that break.  I have almost finished.  Of course, that depends on the objections that I have to reply to.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may continue.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Mathias, where were you on the 6th of April 1994 at the time when the president -- when the plane of the president was brought down by the RPF?  
A.	That event occurred at night and, at that time, I was in my house in Kibuye.  
Q.	And how did you learn about it?  
A.	I had a neighbour, a man, who, having heard the news, knocked on my door and told me -- as a matter of fact, who asked me the question as to if I had learned that the plane of President Habyarimana had been shot down.  Those are the circumstances under which I learned about the death of President Habyarimana.  
Q.	In your opinion, is that what unleashed the hostilities that bedevilled your country?  
A.	For Rwandans, everyone has their own answer -- everyone has an answer to the question.  They know that the answer -- when an army -- the leadership of an army is no longer there, there's this -- people are dispersed, and you can have internal confrontations.  As a matter of fact, it is a paraphrasing of a Rwandan proverb.  

So, when they attacked the country, they said that they wanted to have the president leave, which -- who, in their opinion, was a dictator and did not allow the refugees to return to the country.  And the political parties who were in support of the RPF ideology were set up thereafter.  So you may understand that there were various political parties, and that people became members of one party or another, and that even ruffians and scoundrels were seeking disorder in order to do what they wanted to do.  And it is that sort of disorder that led Rwandans to fight each other.  
Q.	Thank you.  

Mr. Mathias, can you recall the meeting held during the month of May 1994 in your préfecture in Kibuye -- more precisely, on the 3rd of May 1994 in Kibuye?  
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  

I remember the meeting, indeed, and I did participate -- attend it personally.  
Q.	Thank you.  What was the agenda of that meeting?  
A.	The meeting was chaired by the new prime minister, that is to say, the head of government of the Abatabazi, Mr. Jean Kambanda.  And following the massacres and the uprisings that occurred after the deputy of the head of the republic was killed, the prime minister had come to tell inhabitants of Kibuye to calm down and to install peace and quiet, and to resume normal development activities.  That was the point which was on the agenda of the meeting.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  There was a second meeting on the 16th of May 1994.  Were you in attendance?  
A.	With regard to the meeting of the 16th, I attended it, and it was chaired by the new president of the republic, Mr. Theodore Sindikubwabo. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. Issa, I would like to seek your assistance to give the spelling list to all parties, although I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief, and you'd see under number 19, the spelling of the name of President Sindikubwabo. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, I believe you were talking to us about the -- the meeting of the 16th of May 1994.  Could you carry on, please?  
A.	The meeting of the 16th was chaired by the head of state, Mr. Theodore Sindikubwabo.  I attended the meeting.  But, as a matter of fact, it was not a big meeting.  The president was just stopping over.  And it was not a meeting which had been convened to be -- meant to be presided by the head of state.  When the prefét knew that the president of the republic was around, he invited the people who were nearby, as well as civil servants, to welcome the president.  He presented the president to them, and they welcomed him.  

And it is the president who said that the people had to carry out their ordinary tasks, as the prime minister had asked them to do.  And he said that he was simply stopping over to see how far the implementation of the prime minister's instructions were, and he was also there to see if there were difficulties which he could assist the people in overcoming.  
Q.	Thank you for your explanations.  

Do you know that the explanation that was, rather, given is that President Sindikubwabo, when he asked the people if things were returning to normal, it was said that he had insinuated that the work had to be carried on, namely, killing the Tutsis?  
A.	I believe that's not what the president said.  He came by helicopter, which landed in the gendarmerie groupement.  And from the gendarmerie groupement, he drove in a vehicle to the préfecture, and he said that wherever he had been, the people were working in their farms and that pupils were at school, and that where these type of activities had not yet resumed, the people had to be incited to carry that on.  That is all he said.  And he said that in that regard -- he said, "I stopped at Gitarama, 
	Ryange, and I noticed that there were farmers on their farms, and that shows me that the unrests had ceased." He also talked about his stopover at Rubengera, R-U-B-E-N-G-A-R-A (sic), Rubengera; Ryange, R-Y-A-N-G-E. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Mathias, allow me to insist on being surprised.  Would you be surprised if you were told that these people claimed that it was that meeting of the 16th of May 1994, chaired by 
	President Sindikubwabo, which gave the green light to the attacks on the Bisesero hills?  
A.	I would be truly surprised.  We're talking about the 16th of May, yet people had begun to seek refuge at the Bisesero hills.  And the attacks there begun as on 13th of April up to the date you're referring to, that is to say, the 16th of May.  

Now, under those conditions, how could the president of the republic have had the chance to incite people to carry out the killings in Bisesero, whereas the killings had already begun?  And the préfet told the president of the republic that the road to Garongi, and the road that leads to the Bisesero was still closed, because, the problem -- the only problem in Kibuye at the time in the month of May were massacres that were continuing in Bisesero, that is to say, the massacres had already begun in those hills. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
For the record, spelling of Rubengera:  R-U-B-E-N-G-E-R-A.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	So two meetings were held.  That of the 3rd of May 1994, was Mr. Édouard Karemera there?  
A.	Édouard Karemera attended only the meeting of the 3rd of May, the one which was chaired by Mr. Kabanga.  Édouard Karemera was not -- did not attend the meeting of the 16th.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Thank you, Mr. Mathias.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour, I would like to, with your authorisation, have admitted as exhibit, the sheet on which both names have been written, which -- the sheet which was given to Mr. Mathias a while ago.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Issa.  
MR. MORLEY: 
For completeness, the first list needs to be exhibited, because the witness has constantly referred to names two and three, and the second sheet only has two names on it.  So, if one wanted to try and connect the transcripts to the exhibit, the second piece of paper isn't the right one to work with.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa, the document is there?  

Yeah, we think both lists should go in.  

And Mr. Issa, what is it, A and B?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour, I had submitted the first list for Mr. Mathias to recognise them.  He did not recognise the three; he recognised only two.  So I want to have admitted the list with the two only names he recognises.  And, under the incitation of Mr. Morley, I have been told that the first list that means nothing to me has to be submitted as evidence.  Is that what I understood?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Even if the suggestion came, initially, from Mr. Morley, Ms. Diagne, the Chamber has considered it.  The first list has numbers against the names, and it is for that reason why we think it should go in.  And the second list, the one to which you referred, should also go in.  And so they will be numbered with number A and number B.  So the record will be complete, and when we come to review in due course, we'll be able to understand what we're reading.  That's the purpose of it.  It's not to exercise preference of Mr. Morley over you.  That is not part of our decision-making at all.  

Mr. Issa, what's the number?  
MR. MJUI:
The list will be D. K95 A and B. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. K95A and D. K95B admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, are you completed?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, your Honour.  As I said earlier, I have completed my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  
We've also come to a mid-afternoon recess.  We'll break for about 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed at 1530H)
(Pages 36 to 50 by Lisa Smith) 



































(Court resumed at 1550H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, good afternoon.  

Do any of the other Defence teams wish to examine the witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Your Honour, we don't have any questions to put to the witness from the Defence team of Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Your Honour, for Joseph Nzirorera's Defence, I would have one question to put to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please. 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Thank you, Your Honour.  As you are well aware, I like to state the basis from which I am going to put my question, the logical basis for which I ask the question.  

Your Honour, we have, up to now, had very good witnesses, as far as Defence is concerned, because we are trying to overcome a very, very difficult uphill task.  We are, indeed, breaking down this form of terrible mechanism of fabrication.  

I am sorry.  Maybe I'll stop, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are now cross-examining the witness.  You'll have the opportunity to address the Court in due course.
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Your Honour.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness Mathias Hitiyaremye, good morning (sic).  
A.	Good morning (sic), Counsel. 
Q.	My name is Maître Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi, José Patrick.  I am counsel -- I am co-counsel with 
	Mr. Peter Robinson, who is unavailable, who is lead counsel for Joseph Nzirorera.  And I am going to put one question to you.  

Mr. Mathias, where were you in 1993, and more specifically, in the second half of that year.  That is, from June to December?  
A.	I was in Kibuye. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you -- do you know the Gatwaro stadium? 
A.	I know the Gatwaro stadium, as it is the préfectoral stadium.  
Q.	And did you attend any rallies or meetings there?  
A.	In 1994, you say?  
Q.	Yes, 1993, for example, yes.  
A.	Yes.  There were football games on that field in that stadium, yes.  Those are events I recall having attended in that stadium.  
Q.	Thank you.  But apart from those events, do you recall a political rally which might have been organised at that Gatwaro stadium in June 1993?  
A.	There were no MRND rallies in that stadium during the period you're referring to.  And, as a matter of fact, I never heard about any other meetings that allegedly held during the month of June. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The reason I'm asking this question is that before this Chamber is a witness, came and asserted that in June 1993 a meeting -- a rally was held in the Gatwaro stadium.  How do you react to that?  
A.	Considering the fact that I was in Kibuye, as I have stated earlier in another answer, I did not attend any form of meeting allegedly held at the Gatwaro stadium regarding the MRND.  One thing's for sure:  There was no MRND meeting at that time in that stadium.  Regarding all the political parties, I can't tell precisely, because I did not attend -- I did attend them -- I attended their meetings only when I was invited to.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What interests me is the MRND meeting.  And you answered that as far as you were concerned that had not been held and, therefore, the witness who had alleged that there was an MRND meeting in Gatwaro stadium did not say the truth.  

Could you wonder, as a result, that during that meeting a member of the MRND, namely, Nzirorera, took the floor?  What do you say to that?  
A.	I believe there was no MRND rally during that period.  And that year I didn't see Nzirorera in Kibuye -- in Kibuye, and I was there.  Nzirorera was a minister.  Had he come to the guest house in Kibuye or to attend a rally, everybody would have known about it.  Because usually when people of his rank came, everyone knew about it.  Had he been there, I, who was in Kibuye, would have known about it.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness Mathias Hitiyaremye.  We should allow the Chamber to assess the credibility of the witness that made that testimony before this Chamber.  
MR. NIMY: 
I am completed, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

Mr. Witness, you are now going to have to respond to the Prosecutor who will be cross-examining you now.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Is it right you were in Kibuye in April of 1994? 
A.	That is correct.  In April, as from the 6th up until the 11th of April, I was in the city of Kibuye. 
Q.	Where were you after the 11th of April 1994? 
A.	After the 14th of April, I went home to Gisovu, and I stayed there until the 3rd, when I attended a meeting chaired by Kambanda.  And I stayed in Kibuye because at that time we had been requested to return to our various offices.  
Q.	How far is Gisovu from Bisesero? 
A.	There is a distance of 15 to 20 kilometres between Gisovu and Bisesero. 
Q.	Did you go to Bisesero at any time between April and July of 1994?  
A.	That road was closed.  I didn't use it to go to Bisesero during that period.  
Q.	Have you ever met Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	When?  Which period, Prosecutor?  
Q.	Have you ever met Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Your Honour, I would like to ask Prosecutor to tell me what period his question refers to so that I won't be mistaken.  Otherwise, I will tell you I know Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question was have you ever done it, at any time?  
THE WITNESS:
Ngirumpatse -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Your Honour?  
THE WITNESS:
I met Ngirumpatse during rallies and -- or, meetings, and I met him at some other times in his office.  
MR. WEYL: 
Your Honour, this -- as far as I know, this is not an outcrop of the examination-in-chief.  
MR. MORLEY: 
These are questions which are relevant to issues before the Trial Chamber, Your Honour.  And Your Honours may be interested to know to what extent this witness is known to the seniority of the MRND.  We know he knows Karemera.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is permitted.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	How many rallies have you met Ngirumpatse at, approximately?  
MR. WEYL: 
Your Honour?  I didn't hear whether -- the Chamber's answer, because we have the same voice from the same interpreter.  And I feel that after the response of Mr. Morley there was a question regarding the very basis of that question.  Because that did not arise in the examination-in-chief, I don't think the question is pertinent.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I -- the Chamber has ruled that the question is permitted.  The rule which identifies what is permissible in cross-examination includes matters in addition to material arising from examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	How many rallies have you met Ngirumpatse at, approximately?  
A.	I have -- never saw him in any rally.  I did not attend national rallies of the party.  I only attended party rallies at my préfecture level. 
Q.	How many meetings have you met Ngirumpatse at? 
A.	Considering the fact that I attended rallies only at my préfecture level, while Ngirumpatse was in the préfecture of Kibuye, he did not come to meetings in the Kibuye préfecture.  
Q.	How often did you see Ngirumpatse in his office?  
A.	When he was secretary of the MRND, I went to his office once. 
Q.	Why? 
A.	I went there to have a mission order signed. 
Q.	Doing what?  What mission?  
A.	I was an agent of the MRND party.  And in his office in Kibuye, it was for -- to carry out work relating to the Kibuye office in that I was going -- of the MRND, that I was going to Kigali. 
Q.	You told us that you had met, as I remember it, although the Live Note is not now working, Ngirumpatse at his office.  But also I thought you said at meetings.  How often have you met him?  
A.	I never said I met him during rallies; that is, what we understand as a rally.  These were general meetings during which people were sensitised on the ideals of the party, and these were like working meetings. 
Q.	How many meetings of that nature did you meet Ngirumpatse at?  
A.	I saw him on one occasion during a meeting of services, because he was the MRND secretary general at national level. 
MR. WEYL: 
Your Honour?  I don't know if it is four times or five times that Mr. Morley's putting the question in one way or another to have an answer, which clearly does not please him.  I believe maybe he should stop harassing the witness to try and extort an answer from him which he is going to make by slip of the tongue.  I think the answer has been given.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I respectfully agree the answer has been given.  We now have the witness confirming he met Ngirumpatse at a meeting at least once, and in his office once.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When was the meeting?  Which year, please?  
A.	I don't recollect precisely.  I wouldn't like to venture into stating years or dates.  I can't recall because it's been a long while. 
Q.	You seem pretty clear about there not having been a rally in June 1993.  Can you not tell us when you had a meeting with the general secretary of the MRND, Mr. Ngirumpatse?  Have you no recollection? 
A.	I no longer remember the date at which I met him, but I recall that during that same period I was working for the MRND bureau in Kibuye. 
Q.	And when was that period?  
A.	I am unable to precisely state the period to you, considering the -- what I went under.  I was imprisoned for 13 years.  I don't have any focal point from which I can say such-and-such a date.  

	I would like Your Honours to explain to the Prosecutor that I met Ngirumpatse only during a working session.  And that after that working session, I got into his office to have my mission order signed.  
Q.	You were the permanent secretary working for the MRND in Kibuye leading up to the genocide.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	No.  After the Arusha Peace Accords were signed, all political parties were suspended, and the MRND agents at préfectoral level were also suspended.  And the others, and myself, went in search of work in government or the civil service.  
Q.	How long had you been working for the MRND up until you say the préfectoral office was closed?  
A.	Under one year.  Indeed, that office was set up because other political parties had begun seizing our members and to revamp the party.  The Kibuye office was set up. 
Q.	That would have been somewhere in around late 1991, sometime in 1992.  Would that be right?  
A.	That began in 1992.  I can't recall the date, but it continued until 1993.  It was thereabout.  
Q.	Were you working at the MRND office in Kibuye, then, between 1992 and 1993, is that right? 
A.	Yes, approximately, around that period.  
Q.	Prior to working at the MRND office, for how long had you been a member of the MRND? 
A.	While the MRND was single party, as from 1975, all Rwandans were members.  When the MRND was renewed in 1991, I took up membership of that party.  
Q.	Did you ever resign from the MRND? 
A.	I never left the MRND up until when political party activities were suspended. 
Q.	Did you ever meet Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	I met him during the national congress of the party.  Otherwise, I didn't meet him thereafter. 
Q.	Was that the national congress in 1993? 
A.	I recall that it was a congress during which Ngirumpatse was elected as party chairman.  I can't recall when it was held.  But, yes, it was at congress, indeed.  
Q.	Was that the congress at which Joseph Nzirorera became the general secretary of the MRND, and Édouard Karemera became the vice-president of the MRND? 
A.	I believe that is a different congress to the one you're referring to as the congress in which Nzirorera was elected as secretary -- secretary of the party.  I didn't attend that congress. 
Q.	What office did Nzirorera acquire during the congress you did attend, please?  
A.	I no longer recall which.  I can't recall if he was a candidate or he was a mere member of his Ruhengeri commune, because we all -- Ruhengeri committee.  Because we also elected préfectoral committee members during those congresses. 
Q.	When you say the congress that you attended was when Ngirumpatse became the party chairman, is that the same as Ngirumpatse becoming the party president?  Or was it something different? 
A.	Your Honour, I would like Prosecutor to repeat his questions for me to better understand it. 
Q.	When you say that the congress you attended was when Ngirumpatse became the party chairman, is that the same as his becoming the party president, or do you mean something different?  
A.	I believe that it is the same question, the question you had asked before.  You want to know if it is during that congress that Ngirumpatse was elected chairman of the party, or is it the congress that elected Ngirumpatse as the head of the party?  Yes, it is the congress during which Ngirumpatse was elected chairman of the party.  
Q.	Well, it's on record that Ngirumpatse became, as you put it, chairman of the party, in July of 1993.  And at that same congress, Nzirorera became the general secretary, and Karemera became the vice-president.  Did you see and meet all three of them at that congress? 
A.	I don't recall precisely if it was in the same congress, but I know that there were candidates -- Karemera and Ngirumpatse who were candidates to the chairmanship.  I remember Ngirumpatse had more votes, and he was elected chairman.  For the rest, I don't recall.  
Q.	That's helpful.  We fixed that in time.  Now, how often have you met Karemera?  
A.	From when to when, Prosecutor?  
Q.	How often have you met Karemera?  Give us some idea as to how often you have met him.  
A.	Your Honour, ever since I knew Karemera, I have met him on numerous and different occasions.  
Q.	Thank you.  When were you first approached by the Defence to give evidence in defence of Karemera?  What month and year, please?  
A.	I was in prison.  Let me see.  2006?  That is when I saw somebody introduce themself and ask me if I could be a witness in the Karemera case.  I remember I was in prison. 
Q.	When were you released from prison?  
A.	I was released in May 2007. 
Q.	You now reside in Uganda.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	After you were released from prison, is it right that you became aware that the Gacaca proceedings wanted to investigate you further?  
A.	I don't know if that was the case.  But when I was released from prison, I had just been tried before a Gacaca court.  
Q.	You left Rwanda because you were frightened of being further investigated by the Gacaca proceedings, isn't that right?  
A.	I believe that at the outset of Gacaca proceedings, a period during which people had the opportunity to confess to their acts, and in light of investigations conducted by the office of the prosecutor, I do not think there was any reason for the kind of investigations you are referring to, because I had had opportunity to appear before the prosecutor -- before the judges in open session.  I do not think that such further proceedings were necessary. 
Q.	Why did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda because I felt threatened. 
Q.	You served 13 years in jail.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When did you enter your plea? 
A.	That was in 2002 that we confessed in the prison where I was detained.  What I mean is that we confessed, and the guilty plea procedure and the law was promulgated to that effect, and detainees in prison proceeded to confess to their acts.  
Q.	Thank you.  You were arrested in 1994, and offered a confession in 2002.  Is that right?  
A.	That is right.  
Q.	Prior to 2002, you had not offered a confession, is that right?  
A.	That is right.  
Q.	The advantage of a confession, as promulgated under the new law of 2002, was that if it was put in the right way, you might be able to get released eventually.  Isn't that right?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Prior to 2002 you weren't offering any confession, admitting no guilt, taking no responsibility for what had happened.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	You are right in saying so.  Prior to that period, that is, the period you have referred to, I had not yet entered a plea, I had not pleaded guilty to my offences and asked for pardon. 
Q.	Prior to the new law of 2002, if you had been tried before then, between 1994 and 2001, you'd have fought the case, wouldn't you? 
A.	Mr. President, may I ask counsel for the Prosecution, to repeat his question?  
Q.	You had seven years in which to offer a measure of responsibility for events; did not do so.  And I suggest to you that had you been tried between 1994 and 2001 you would have fought the case.  
A.	No.  As a matter of fact, false charges had been brought against me.  I was accused of committing killings, whereas I hadn't killed anybody.  I subsequently explained that.  But the first law relating to the guilty plea procedure was not very clear.  And in that law, there were no provisions for the crimes I was charged with and guilty of.  But when the second law was promulgated in 2002 and that crime was provided for under that law, I then confessed to my offences. 
Q.	What were the false charges that were brought against you prior to your plea?  What were you accused of doing?  
A.	Mr. President, may I ask the Prosecutor to repeat his question?  Because it is not clear.  
Q.	What had you been accused of doing before you entered a plea?  What were the allegations against you? 
A.	Very well.  I was charged with having been the chairman of the movement at the level of the préfecture.  And it was alleged that in that capacity I was armed with guns and grenades used for killing people.  I was also charged with looting the cattle of people, many cattle.  Those were the charges brought against me. 
Q.	What was the movement you were said to have been chairman of? 
A.	The MRND. 
Q.	Was it suggested that you had weapons and grenades stored at your house, for example?  Anything like that?  
A.	Yes.  That was the allegation made against me.  I do not know where it was alleged that I had stored weapons, but I was accused of being in possession of a stock of weapons.  Besides, the office of the prosecutor in Kibuye conducted an investigation into that matter. 
Q.	Was it suggested, for example, that you were arming members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  That was not one of the charges in my charge sheet. 
Q.	Was it suggested, for example, that you had killed people? 
A.	As I have already told you, this was the allegation made against me.  I repeat it so that it should be clear.  It was said as follows:  "You, Mathias, for the reason that you were chairman of the MRND in Kibuye préfecture, in which capacity you were armed with a firearm and grenades, and you went to kill people and loot cattle."  That is how the allegation was couched. 
Q.	And how many people was it thought, then, that you had killed? 
A.	No figure was given in that allegation, in that charge. 
Q.	Was it suggested, for example, that you had encouraged people, other people, to kill Tutsis? 
A.	No.  That was not part of the allegation made against me.  Besides, no mention was made of the ethnicity of the persons I allegedly killed. 
Q.	And what is it you have confessed to?  What is the offence which you have accepted for which you served 13 years? 
A.	No.  It is not because of the offences I confessed to that I was imprisoned for 13 years.  What I confessed to was commission of the crime of failure to assist people in danger.  And I asked for pardon.  The offence was failure to assist persons in danger. 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness repeated. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And who did you fail to assist? 
A.	The person in question was a man I met who was found by assailants where he was hiding in the home of his mother's husband.  And that was a group of assailants that came from another secteur and met the victim in our secteur.  And I met the group of assailants in front of the person in question.  
Q.	And what happened to him?  
A.	On my way, after leaving that group of assailants, even before the assailants arrived in the place of origin of their victim, they killed him.  
Q.	Did you fail to assist anybody else during the period April to July of 1994? 
A.	That was the only person in distress that I met during that period.  I mean, the person I have just referred to. 
Q.	And why did you not assist him? 
A.	The group of assailants was very big, and I observed that there were some people among the assailants who had tried to coerce me to leave the MRND to join their party.  So I was afraid that those persons would kill me.  And that could have been the case, because other persons had been killed under the same circumstances.  That is why I preferred to keep silent.  
Q.	Well, you know that that is not an admission to any serious criminal offence:  Keeping quiet for fear of your own life in the face of an angry mob.  Your confession is meaningless, isn't it?  It was just a way out of jail.  
A.	I think you are making a mockery of my misery by making such a statement.  If I had been able to call on the general public and set up a group to go and assist that victim, I would have done it.  That was not a light offence.  I was someone in a position of authority.  You cannot minimise my role and my criminal responsibility.  I was afraid, and I did not act.  But you should not minimise that crime, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	How many people, as a person who was working in the bureaucracy of the state, how many people who were Tutsi were murdered between April and July of 1994 in the Kibuye préfecture?  Can you give us any idea? 
A.	I was not an employee of the administrative service that was in charge of conducting a census.  Besides, after the massacres we did not have the time to do a census of survivors in order to know the number of victims.  That is the reason why I find this question that you are putting to me very difficult to answer.  
Q.	Well, it's going to get more difficult, because you were in the ministry of family welfare, and the massacres affected families.  Are you seriously suggesting you had no information in the job that you were doing about what was happening to the families whose welfare you, as a bureaucrat, were supposed to be monitoring?  
A.	Mr. President, let me inform counsel for the Prosecution that the office for which I worked in Kibuye was a new office.  We did not have sufficient documentation.  That office was set up as part of the power-sharing process.  Because the government wanted to decentralise the organs of the ministries in the various préfectures, but it did not have enough materials and documentation and resources.  So I am unable to know the exact number of persons who were killed. 
Q.	I haven't asked you for an exact number.  I just want some idea.  Was it two?  Was it 200?  Was it 20,000?  Was it approaching 100,000?  Can you give us any idea? 
A.	Listen, the French say that more than one person already means several persons.  I did not count the corpses.  I did not even know the number of people in our préfecture.  I did not even have the ethnic distribution map of my préfecture.  That is something that comes under the remit of the census department. 
Q.	Do you accept there was a slaughter of Tutsi civilians between April and July of 1994 in the Kibuye area? 
A.	To my knowledge, there were victims of the massacres on both sides.  But there were more victims among the Tutsi because, after the war, and even till date, it has been observed that the number of Tutsis in Rwanda has dropped.  But -- Hutus and Twas were also killed during those events, but I believe that there were more Tutsi victims. 
Q.	How many more?  Give us some idea of the balance of events.  By what factor were there more Tutsi victims than there were Hutu victims?  Give us some idea.  Was it as many Tutsi as Hutu?  Was it twice as many Tutsi?  Was it ten times as many Tutsi?  Was it 20 times as many Tutsi?  Give us some idea.  
A.	I cannot offer a figure and say there was one or two or three.  I have already answered your question.  I am telling you that there were more Tutsi victims.  Because when you tour the country, you find many ruins of homes in which the Tutsi lived.  And even as you pass on the road, it's not possible for you to identify either the person who lived in that house or identify their Tutsi origins.  But if you ask any person in the area, they will tell you that they were homes of Tutsis.  But I am unable to give you any figure as to the exact number of Tutsis. 
Q.	You sat in jail for 13 years, on your version of events, an innocent man, surrounded by lots of inmates who you've told us were making confessions.  So you must have got some idea as to the scale of the killing that was going on.  Now, please, give us some idea of the scale of the killing of the Tutsis.  
A.	I did not give a tally of the figures given by those who confessed.  The records of those who confessed were forwarded to the department of public prosecutions, and I believe that that service tried to keep statistics, such as to know the number of victims.  

But you should also bear in mind that it is not only those who are in prison who confessed; even people who were outside the prison confessed.  Only those who gathered information on the basis of data called during Gacaca proceedings throughout the préfecture could have answered that question to say, "Look, this is the number of persons who died and this is the number of survivors." 
Q.	You've suggested that you're quite the expert on the confessions, because you suggested that you know enough about the confessions to be able to say that nobody ever suggested Karemera was in Bisesero.  That would suggest that you had a lot of information -- if what you're saying is true -- about the scale of events, and what was being confessed to, and what it is that had happened.  

I'll ask again, and for the last time:  Some idea, please, of the scale of the killings of the Tutsis in the Kibuye area.  
A.	Mr. President, this will be my first answer.  There were about 4,500 detainees at Gisovu prison.  The detainees who confessed numbered more than 2,600.  And that was about 62 per cent of the prison population at Gisovu prison.  I am unable to know what each of those accused persons confessed to; I mean, those who had confessed to the role they played during the massacres.  

Regarding a figure like Karemera, if charges had been brought against him, that person is known to everyone, so such information would not have eluded me.  If his name had been mentioned, I would have known about it.  And you should make the distinction between the mention of a public figure like Karemera and the names mentioned in the records of other persons who confessed.  

Furthermore, Mr. President, let me add something to my answer.  At a point in time, a list of the former government officials was drawn up -- these were officials who participated in the massacres -- and I did not see Karemera's name on such lists.  Those lists were drawn up by the Gacaca committees in the prison. 
Q.	Who was killing the Tutsis? 
A.	There were even criminals among the Tutsi who killed other Tutsi, and there were Tutsis who also killed Hutus, and there were Hutus who killed other Hutus.  So, generally speaking, people killed one another. 
Q.	What sort of answer is that to the question?  Hutus killed Hutus, Tutsis killed Hutus, Tutsis killed Tutsis.  Do you think any of the Hutu might have killed Tutsis and been largely responsible for the scale of the Tutsi slaughter? 
A.	Mr. President, could you please ask the Prosecutor to repeat his question so that I could better understand it?  
Q.	Some might be forgiven for thinking that your last answer suggested that the Tutsis killed the Tutsis.  Is that right?  Because you gave us three categories:  Tutsis killing Hutus, Hutus killing Hutus, and Tutsis killing Tutsis.  So the only description of persons killing the Tutsis, in your last answer, was the Tutsis, who were criminals.  And that's farcical, isn't it?  It's a farcical answer which avoids the question, "Who killed the Tutsis?"  
A.	In my answer, I told you that there were Hutus who killed Tutsis and Tutsis who killed Hutus, and Tutsis who also killed fellow Tutsis, and Hutus who killed fellow Hutus.  That is my answer.  And in the prison, it wasn't only Hutus accused of having killed Tutsis who were imprisoned.  There were Tutsis who were also accused of having killed other Tutsis.  
Q.	Do you accept the proposition that the vast majority of the vast number of Tutsis slaughtered were slaughtered by Hutus? 
A.	Yes, I agree with your proposition that the overwhelming majority of Tutsis were killed by Hutu.  But let me put another question to you:  Do you agree that a Tutsi could have killed a Hutu, and that Hutus could have also killed Hutus?  
Q.	Who was responsible for the Hutu killing the vast majority of the vast number of Tutsi?  
A.	The criminal and personal and, indeed, is (unintelligible) -- it's criminal and individual, and people have to be judged for the acts that they committed.  And the people who are responsible for assassination and murder have to be apprehended and be brought to trial.  
Q.	We're not talking about isolated moments of murder.  We're talking about wholesale slaughter by Hutus, largely, of a very large number of Tutsis.  Now, who was responsible?  Was no one responsible?  This is the movement of one ethnic group against another.  Who was responsible?  
A.	I would like to state my answer once more.  The criminal -- the responsibility is criminal -- criminal and individual, and you have to be judged personally.  No one can be charged or sanctioned by (sic) crimes committed by someone else, unless the person is an accomplice or a co-perpetrator. 
Q.	You told us there was a functioning government.  The prime minister came along on the 
	3rd of May of 1994 to Kibuye to discuss the security situation.  Now, if you have a functioning government, do you think that the government should bear any responsibility for the slaughter of the Tutsis?  What do you think about that? 
A.	As I stated before, individual criminal responsibility is, indeed, individual and the prime minister did not come to Kibuye to incite people to carry out massacres.  When he arrived Kibuye, he knew that massacre had already occurred there, and he asked that these massacres should stop.  But since the people had been involved in the massacres, the prime minister mentioned intervention of the national army.  And since the army was involved in fighting off, fending off, the enemy, they were unable to intervene, and they were unable to have the means to end the massacres.  Therefore, you cannot incriminate the government, whereas they had asked the people to stop the massacres so that government should be in a position to negotiate with the RPF in order to set up a broad-based government including the RPF and to have peace once more. 
Q.	What were the police doing during these massacres, under the authority of the préfecture authorities?  What were they doing? 
A.	There was no police in the commune, and there was a gendarmerie in Kibuye that intervened when there were unrests, and often the gendarmes lost their lives.  And at times at communal level, some communal police also intervened during unrest and would -- lost their lives during this unrest as a result of the fact they did not even have enough and adequate equipment.  The police and the gendarmes were, therefore, overwhelmed and were unable to contain these unrests.  That is my point of view.  
Q.	There were no investigations or arrests after the massacres had occurred.  There were no people put in jail by this interim government.  There were no people shot or disciplined for these massacres.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	I believe that even during the meeting of the prime minister -- chaired by the prime minister on 
	3rd May, the préfet raised this issue with the minister stating that some gendarmes had set aside some of their commitments, and that some of them had even killed people and looted.  The prime minister promised to submit that to the gendarmerie chief of staff for the gendarmes to be arrested and detained.  This was raised during a meeting, and I was there.  

In the Gisovu commune, a communal police shot down someone, and that communal police officer was jailed.  When it was said that the bourgmestre had asked him to kill that person, investigation -- investigations were launched for the bourgmestre to be arrested.  And Mr. Ntamagurivu (phonetic) contacted the préfet.  I can't remember the decision that was taken.  But the préfet had been asked to relieve the bourgmestre.  And when the government, which had lost the war --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Interpreter did not hear the part concerning what happened to the police officer.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Was there an Interahamwe in Kibuye on the 3rd of May of 1994? 
A.	Your Honour, I have already explained this when Defence counsel was putting questions to me.  There were no -- never were there Interahamwe in Kibuye.  Had they been there, their activity would have been identified.  No, there never was any Interahamwe in Kibuye.  And if you're talking about the MRND Interahamwe, I know that subsequently people who perpetrated massacre identified themself as Interahamwe in order to sully the name of the MRND.  I did not see the MRND Interahamwe in Kibuye, unless everybody who participated in the massacres should be considered as Interahamwe.  It is true that people tried to misuse the name of Interahamwe, whereas from the start it was a noble name. 
Q.	Well, surely something was said about the Interahamwe at this meeting on the 3rd of May of 1994, perhaps by Karemera who was in charge of the MRND.  Didn't he talk about the Interahamwe?  Was there no reference to Interahamwe?  Can you help me?  
A.	Let me -- I'm going to tell you, because I was present at that meeting.  In Karemera's message in his capacity -- capacity as MRND representative, as he was national vice-president, regarding the Interahamwe he stated -- he said that for the areas where the Interahamwes were -- and he was referring to Kigali, because this speech was made at national level -- he asked this Interahamwe to be present during the civil defence which is about to be launched and which, unfortunately, was not set up.  He also asked other youth who supported MRND ideals not -- not to allow themself to be sidelined; that it was possible for these youth to work with the Interahamwe.  He did not talk about Kibuye Interahamwe, as there was no Interahamwe in Kibuye.  
Q.	And what did the bourgmestre, Sikubwabo, S-I-K-U-B-W-A-B-O, what did he talk about was going on in Bisesero?  
A.	Sikubwabo, the bourgmestre of the Gishyita commune, made -- reported during that meeting that in Bisesero some RPF soldiers had infiltrated, and that this -- and those soldiers were encouraging people who had sought refuge in Bisesero to attack other people and kill them and loot their goods.  He even said that -- that some of this Inyenzi, who were -- was a name given to the RPF members -- had been killed by the same Sikubwabo.  Sikubwabo was a retired soldier, and many people who were there believed what he said.  As a matter of fact, it would appear that he had made a sort of report to the gendarmerie long before.  And the prime minister told him that security organs, including the 
	security -- the police and the gendarmerie would go and find out more about what he had said as they had the -- the skills and the means, and they had to go out and see.  As a matter of fact, the FPR (sic) soldiers had infiltrated Bisesero.  The prime minister stated that before someone was killed, one had to know if it was, indeed, an RPF soldier in order to distinguish between RPF soldiers and ordinary citizens.  

I have told you loyally what was said during that meeting.  And if you have the document on that meeting, I'm sure that you would be able to see that what I have told you is the truth.  But subsequently, I cannot say what was said in the report that was made by Mr. Sikubwabo. 
Q.	We know quite a lot about this meeting that you've been telling us all about.  We have transcripts of things that were being said on the radio at the time of the meeting.  We also have the meeting's minutes.  Sikubwabo described to everybody shooting people coming down from the hills in Bisesero who were looking for food.  Do you recall that?  
A.	I remember that Sikubwabo said that in Bisesero there were FPR soldiers -- RPF soldiers, and that he had killed some of them himself in Mubuga when they had come with other people to loot food in Mubuga.  That's what I heard.  If I misunderstood it, well, or not, in any event, that is what I heard from Sikubwabo's own mouth. 
Q.	What did he say of the one police officer who had had to deal with people coming down from the hills looking for food? 
A.	No, I can't recall that minute detail.  I can't remember him referring to a police officer. 
Q.	Well, you call it a minor detail.  He described how one police officer had managed to shoot 40 people who were looking for food.  Now, are you seriously suggesting that people in that meeting understood those 40 people shot by one police officer were armed RPF soldiers, who might, you think, have shot back?  You all knew in that meeting that you were describing an environment where there had been massacre. 
A.	That fact relating to 40 people which was referred to during that meeting -- but I can't remember that fact --  I can't remember the details, because that was a long while ago.  Because Sikubwabo said that there were RPF soldiers there and that he, Sikubwabo, had killed some in Mubuga.  That's what I remember.  But those details which you are referring to I don't recall.  Therefore, it would be better for you, better to use the minutes of that meeting.  
Q.	He also referred to having killed 300 people over in Bisesero.  Do you remember that small detail? 
A.	No, I don't remember that detail. 
MR. MORLEY:
In Prosecution Exhibit 82, Your Honours, page 10, the minutes in English; and it was page 44 of the bundle in respect of LSP.  Prosecution Exhibit 82B, the minutes in English, third paragraph.  The minutes record Karemera offering a message to the participants at the meeting.  And the minutes read, "That message called upon the Interahamwe to continue being vigilant in flushing out, stopping, and fighting the enemy in collaboration with other youth members from other parties."  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I've offered you a long opportunity to speak at length about that meeting, and other things.  And I suggest to you that much of what you are saying was taking place in Kibuye you know is rubbish.  There was an Interahamwe; there had been a massacre of Tutsis by Hutu and which the gendarmerie had not done very much; that the government bears a responsibility for that; and that what took place in the 3rd of May of 1994 was an assessment of what else needed to be done in the area with regard to the Tutsis.  You disagree with that, do you? 
A.	Thank you, President.  I believe that what the Prosecutor has just said is a sentiment, or a judgement, and this is what has been said by counsel.  The minutes of this meeting exist.  Karemera's message exists.  With regard to the Interahamwe, I told you that such a message, which was even broadcast over radio, targeted all Rwandans.  Karemera was talking to the Interahamwe of the entire country, and the youth of other parties, and asking them to respond to civil defence and give a hand to the army.  That is the framework with which this message was made.  If you want this message to say something that is not in it, that is your point of view.  It concerns you, alone.  Karemera sent a message as an MRND official.  He was not a minister.  He had not yet been appointed minister during that period.  In any case, at that date.  

So, you are trying to make him bear the responsibility of the government, and I don't see on what basis you can do that.  I think the Bench would assess it.  
Q.	They may very well assess it.  

Do you agree that you, as well, were being sent to assist the army? 
A.	Such were the messages, as the civilian defense was about to be set up.  
Q.	And it's right, is it, that the civilian defense was a jolly good idea, from your point of view.  Would that be right?  
A.	This was a good idea, because it sought to reinforce the army which was at the front, to assist the army in countering the infiltrations, for the soldiers to be in a position to distinguish between civilian population and infiltrators.  I don't know what sort of training was going to be given -- or meted out to those youth.  As a matter of fact, in Kibuye, there was no such training, as an embargo was decreed against the Rwandan army and there was no way of finding -- of getting rifles or firearms.  That decree was made against the interim government, or the Abatabazi government. 
Q.	The civil defence which was set up, was it set up in Kibuye?  And if so, who did it rely on?  
A.	As I have earlier stated, that civilian defense was not set up.  It could not have been set up while there was no equipment, because there was a military embargo against the government.  And in Kibuye, the civilian defense never saw the light of day. 
Q.	Were you enthusiastic about setting up the civil defence in Kibuye?  Were you positively encouraging it?  Were you involved in trying to make sure that there was a civil defence force recruiting youths in Kibuye?  
A.	I had no role to play in setting up the civil defence.  But when a country comes under attack, people who are attacked have to do everything in their capacity to beat the enemy and overcome them.  
MR. MORLEY: 
With Mr. Issa's assistance, please.  

Your Honour, I'm conscious of the time.  What I would ask is that we sit until quarter to 6 and I will have finished.  

Now, Your Honours, there are two documents.  One is a radio broadcast in English, French and Kinyarwandan from the 25th of May of 1994.  The other is a report from June of 1994 on the events in Kibuye.  And, if I may, when Mr. Issa comes back, conscious of the fact that the witness has difficulty reading because he does not have glasses -- 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we have a transcript of you on the radio from the 25th of May of 1994 talking all about the civil defence and what a good idea it was and how you were proud of the government.  Do you remember going on the radio?  
A.	On what date was that?  
Q.	25th of May of 1994.  
A.	And where was I at the time?  
Q.	Well, I'm asking you.  Do you recall speaking on the radio in favour of the civil defence programme?  Do you remember that?  It was the day that it was announced, the 25th of May of 1994.  That was the day that Karemera, as the minister for the interior, in fact, filed the paperwork that a civil defence system should be put in place.  Now, do you remember speaking on the radio? 
A.	Mr. President, may I request the Prosecutor to specify the radio station he is referring to, and over which I allegedly spoke?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President?  On the document disclosed by the Prosecutor the witness is not mentioned as a speaker. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If I may borrow Mr. Morley's rhetoric, the ever-helpful Mr. Issa seems to have recovered the spectacles of the witness and he's now permitted to deliver them to the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
That's very helpful.  Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, may I proceed with my submission?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, not with the witness's headphones on.  And, anyway, the witness can deal with it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  The -- the -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
In that case, why doesn't the witness take off his earphones?  

Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, the first statement you made, we know it's not accurate, because we can see the witness's name.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Now, Mr. President, you have not even allowed me to make my submission, and you say that what the witness is saying -- or, what the Prosecutor is saying is correct.  I will, therefore, sit down and you can confirm that the witness's name is on the list, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I -- I didn't say anything about that.  I said what you said.  You said the witness's name was not on the document disclosed; and I told you, I could see it.  So it is on the document disclosed that I received.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes, and I know the direction of all of this.  Can we just deal with the witness, please, now that he can read the document with his glasses, and we'll find out if that is him?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, can you -- can you read the document which Mr. Issa has in Kinyarwandan -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you ask the witness to replace his headphones?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President?  It is indicated, "speaker, Mathias Habiyaremye."  This witness is not known by this name. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, that is not permissible comment at this stage.  That's a matter of fact for the witness to address.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sure we can clear it all up in just a moment.  Can the document be placed under the witness's glasses, please?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, the question is very simple.  I don't want to take a bad point.  But do you see there, there is reference to somebody whose name is Mathias?  Is that you?  
A.	I can, indeed, see the name Mathias Habiyaremye, H-A-B-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  I also see a place where it's indicated "speaker, unidentified."  It appears to me that I am not the person mentioned here, because in 1994 I never gave an interview over the radio.  
Q.	Well, that would have cleared the whole matter up if you'd answered that way to begin with.  

All right, put that document to one side and let us look at the next document, please. 
MR. MORLEY:
Can we put the other document, please, under the nose of the witness?  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	If you look at that document, it's a report faxed in respect of the U.S. committee for refugees, and the fax date is the 17th of June of 1994, we see at the top of the second page.  And in this document there is a record of what happened in Kibuye; and we see that on the first page and over the second page.  And at the bottom of the second page we see under the heading, (French spoken).  Number 17, your name appears.  Do you see your name? 
A.	Yes, I can see my name. 
Q.	And if we turn over the page under heading number 2, the heading, (French spoken), do we see your name as the -- those who have stocks of weapons in their homes -- (microphones overlapping)? 
A.	Yes, I can indeed see that my name is mentioned on it.  
Q.	Now, on the face of this document, this is a document created in June of 1994.  What do you say about it?  Your name is linked to being involved in the massacres in Kibuye and being a person who is carrying arms and hiding them at your house, which you've also told us was specifically one of the charges you faced up till 2002.  Do you deny the content of this document? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I object, Mr. President.  Mr. President, again, we have before us a forgery, a forgery that is attributed to the U.S. committee for refugees.  There is no fax number on this document.  The Prosecutor has, indeed, stated that it is a fax that they received.  However, on the second page it is clearly indicated "Sent by PSD, Belgium."  That is, perhaps a political party, with a Belgian fax number.  

Now, Mr. President, we should absolutely set aside this document, because it is a gross manipulation.  Otherwise, we should be told what is its exact origin before we can start considering it seriously. 
The first page does not contain any fax number; the first page, which is supposed to certify that it comes from the U.S. committee for refugees.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The document has the appearance of being a fax.  If one looks at pages 2, 3 and 4, dated the 
17th of June of 1994, originating in French from number +32, which my learned friend helpfully tells us is Belgium, and has come into the hands of the OTP from the U.S. committee for refugees.  

Now, what we're interested in is the document in French because of its date.  The fax at the top of it refers to the 17th of June of 1994, which is very close to the events taking place in Kibuye.  And I'm drawing the witness's attention to what, on the face of it, is his name being mentioned in association with the massacres within six to eight weeks of events taking place in Kibuye.  Now I'm asking for the witness's comment on this.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What say you, Mr. Witness?  What do you make of this document which seems to originate about six weeks after the 3rd of May meeting with the prime minister?  Your name's there as a principal organiser of events in Kibuye.  What do you say about it?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  This document is a forgery.  And that does not surprise me.  I am not surprised that my name is mentioned on it.  Because I note that a position is attributed to me in that document, a position that I did not hold during that period.  The position was held in 1993 and 1994.  I was not permanent secretary of the MRND in Kibuye.  That is the first point.  

The second thing is that the person who mentioned my name on the report did not know me, and that person was not aware of my duties and responsibilities at that time.  That was the first point.  
Now, second point.  It is said that this report was drawn up on behalf of genocide survivors in Gitesi, and it is by a person called Jean Marie Vianney Nkurunziza.  If that person had drafted this document on that date, and claims to be a survivor of the massacres, what makes him say that on that date he was a survivor?  But I do not want to insist on this point.  

This gentleman called Jean Marie Vianney Nkurunziza was the first bourgmestre of our commune, Gisovu, when the RPF came to power.  He was a person who asked the soldiers to arrest me, and he was the person who fabricated the charges I referred to, the charges that the department of public prosecutions brought against me.  I am, therefore, not surprised that he is the author of this document; a document he fabricated after he arrested me and after he arrested other persons.  Besides, although we were in custody, we were aware that such documents were being forged under the auspices of Ibuka association.  And that association identified people who did not have to be released, and they were classified in category 1 of genocide perpetrators.  This document is, therefore, a forgery.  

Another reason is that this man is one of the persons who continued to threaten my life, who continued to look for me, which is one of the reasons why I left the country, to avoid being killed.  I, therefore, object to this document.  I did not have a stock of firearms in Kibuye, I was not an arms trafficker, I did not buy weapons to sell them in the open market.  

Let me, therefore, assert before this Chamber that I have never been in possession of a firearm.  Furthermore, I could not have kept firearms in my home.
MR. MORLEY:
Well, that's helpful, Your Honour.  And the witness having told me that he, in fact, knows who the author of this document is, I'm afraid I'm going to have some more questions about the document, and I don't think I'll be very long.  And I would invite Your Honours to consider whether we rise now, and I'll be maybe 15 or 20 minutes tomorrow on this document specifically, or whether I should just continue.  It's a matter for Your Honours.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President?  Mr. President?  If you can take our opinion into consideration, I would say that we are tired.  And according to the rules, the Accused should return -- the Accused have to go back to their detention facility.  And if counsel for the Prosecution wants to continue cross-examining the witness tomorrow, I would say that it is truly a catastrophic situation.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, you have one other witness who is ready for -- to give testimony during this session, is that correct?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I am sorry, I only heard half of your sentence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I was enquiring whether it would be correct to say that you had one more witness who is available to testify during this trial session.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, you are right in saying so, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How long do you anticipate his examination-in-chief will be?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
But perhaps I should, first of all, inform you that I don't have only one left, but three or four witnesses left, Mr. President.  Three. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Available for trial -- available for this trial session?  Are they in Arusha?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President, they are here in Arusha. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Constant?  

Ms. Diagne, we don't have the confirmation. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I fear you have it, Mr. President.  I heard Mr. Sow, from The Hague, giving you an update, and he gave you an order of appearance of witnesses confirming who would appear.  That is why I am afraid, Mr. President, you are informed of that situation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we probably have to take the adjournment now.  But, nonetheless, the witness who is your next scheduled witness, what's the anticipated duration of that witness's testimony?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, an hour or two. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will take our adjournment now for the day.  

Mr. Witness, I have to let you know that while you are a witness, during this or any other adjournment, you're not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  

We take our adjournment now. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, you promised the witness that you would allow him to answer certain questions this afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I will address them tomorrow.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness made some requests, and you did respond -- promised to respond to his request. 
(Court adjourned at 1800H)
