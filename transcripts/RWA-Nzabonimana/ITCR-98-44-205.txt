WITNESS 4/12
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You told us yesterday that you attended a meeting in Kayanga of the MDR, you think some time in 1993.  That's right, is it? 
A.	Yes, that is true, but as concerns the year, I told you I was only giving an approximate date, or year. 
Q.	It might have been early 1994; would that be right? 
A.	That was prior to 1994. 
Q.	I don't follow the answer that it may have been in early 1994, this meeting of the MDR in Kayanga.  
A.	It is possible that the meeting was held in 1993 ending. 
Q.	Very well.  It's right, is it not, that there were other MDR meetings in the commune in late 1993? 
A.	That is possible. 
Q.	It's right, is it not, that there were meetings in Gicaca and in Rutunga secteur? 
A.	Yes, and you can also add the Gikomero secteur.  There were meetings in that secteur as well. 
Q.	And in Nduba? 
A.	I know nothing of it. 
Q.	It was a time in late 1993 of many meetings throughout the commune of the MDR, although you only attended one such meeting.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, I attended a meeting held in Kayanga.  Now, regarding the meetings that were held in the secteur, there was a rally in the Gikomero secteur, and since I lived in that same secteur and that the rallies ****************************************, I also went and attended the rally, too. 
Q.	Was that a rally of the MDR?  
A.	Are you referring to the rally that was organised in the Gikomero secteur?  Well, if that's the one you're referring to, yes, it was an MDR rally. 
Q.	Was Rwamakuba present? 
A.	No.  Rwamakuba did not come to Gikomero. 
Q.	When was that rally? 
A.	That rally was held -- that was the one that had taken place at Kayanga. 
Q.	Did you attend all of the rally, or just some of it? 
A.	The rally that was held in Gikomero didn't last for long, since there weren't many people that had come to attend it.  It was a rather short rally, after which participants returned to their homes. 
Q.	Did you attend all of it, or some of it?  
A.	Yes, I attended all of it. 
Q.	André Rwamakuba was the most prominent member of the MDR from the commune; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	There were other influential figures.  Now, regarding the meeting that was -- the rally that was held at Kayanga and which I -- I saw him there, he is the one who introduced guests, and I saw him.  I don't know if he should be considered the most -- one of the most influential members of MDR because he's the one who introduced guests. 
Q.	If it was suggested that there was a rally in Shango towards the end of 1993 of the MDR, do you know anything about that? 
A.	I know nothing of it.  I have told you that the rally that I attended and during which I saw Rwamakuba is the one that was held in Kayanga.  I did not see Rwamakuba in another rally and I didn't attend any other rally in Kayanga, except the one in Gikomero. 
Q.	If it was suggested there was a rally of the MDR in Nduba in around October 1993, do you know anything about that? 
A.	I know nothing of it. 
Q.	If it is suggested that the Kayanga rally that you attended took place in January 1994, would you disagree with that, or do you think that may be possible? 
A.	I have told you that as concerns the date, the year, in which the Kayanga meeting was held, I was only giving you an estimate.  If you have precise information that can enable to you say that it is during that month that the meeting was held, I would agree with you.  You know, I did not take down notes and I didn't pay much attention to the date, wherefore I cannot be very specific.  And I have told you that, in my opinion, the meeting was held in late 1993.  But if you tell me and you are sure of this, that the meeting was actually held in January 1994, I will not be in a position to give you the lie if you have information that makes it possible for you to say so.  
Q.	At the various MDR rallies throughout the commune, you would have expected Rwamakuba to be present at many, if not all of them, as the local, prominent MDR person.  That would be right, wouldn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	If the Kayanga rally that you attended was in late 1993 or January 1994, and at that rally you remember seeing Rwamakuba, it would follow, would it not, that Rwamakuba was not then in Belgium? 
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, that question is a little bit unfair, in the sense that the witness has indicated that, to his knowledge, it was prior -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Headphones off, please. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry, could the witness take his headphones off?  Sorry.  

The witness has indicated that, according to his knowledge, he doesn't know the year, but he thinks it was prior to 1994, and all my learned friend has done is put to him, "Is it possible that it was in January 1994?"  And the witness has indicated, "Well, I told you that I'm only giving an estimate, but if you have specific information to that effect, that might be the case."  But he has not confirmed any knowledge whatsoever of it being in January 1994, so I'd ask my learned friend to be careful how he phrases his questions, not to indicate to the witness that it is the witness's own assertion that it's January 1994 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to do a double act, but I think one can add to that and say this.  It was this witness's testimony that the Kayanga meeting that he attended was attended also by Twagiramungu; Gasana, Anastase; Ndengejeho and Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  And if the Prosecution is putting that those parties were present at a meeting at the end of '93 or indeed, as it seems to have been emphatically put, at a meeting in Kayanga together with Rwamakuba in January 1994, then if that's the case, then that must be clearly put. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think those really are matters for us at a later stage. 
MR. HOOPER:
No, the last matter wasn't.  May I just helpfully repeat it?  If it's being -- this witness had said that the meeting he attended in Kayanga was a meeting that was attended by Twagiramungu, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, Gasana and Ndengejeho.  Now -- and André Rwamakuba was there and introduced the parties.  Now, the Prosecution are effectively trying, in my submission, to try and slip -- slip that meeting into '94.  

Now, is it their case that in fact a meeting with those personalities took place in early '94?  Is that their case?  Because if it is their case, they should put it fairly and squarely so that we can respond to it and so can this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
I thought this particular line would set the cat among the pigeons.  The witness yesterday, in response to some of my early questions, helpfully told the Tribunal that he thought the Kayanga meeting was in late 1993.  My learned friend Mr. O'Shea remembers the evidence-in-chief but has perhaps forgotten what was said in the early stages of cross-examination.  

And as for who was at the rally, it's a matter for Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues to judge the reliability of the witness's testimony.  I'm simply trying to establish that if this rally, on the face of it, took place in late 1993, it makes it a little difficult for Mr. Rwamakuba to be in Belgium. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That, also, is eventually a matter for us.  It will be obvious he couldn't be in Belgium at the time the rally took place.  So there's a level at which whatever the witness says is still a matter for us at a proper stage. 
MR. MORLEY:
Of course, Your Honour, yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, but I submit that this goes further than that, that what's happening is that the Prosecution are trying to create potentially a false fact and the appearance of false fact here.  Now, after six or seven years we should consider that they know their case, and we've had evidence in respect of meetings.  

Now, this is a very specific meeting with leading lights:  prime minister, future prime minister, foreign minister, Ndengejeho.  And are the Prosecution asserting as a fact that such a meeting took place in January?  Because it's been the Defence case, as we all know now, that such a meeting took place in the summer of 1993.  So if this is a displacement of fact, is it done on a proper basis?  Is this an assertion by the Prosecution, or are they merely trying to assemble the appearance of a case through perhaps memory fault, and the like, of a witness?  Which is it?  Is this solid fact being put and asserted, or not, or is it a sort of fishing exercise with the witness?  Which one of those it is will excite, obviously, a different response from this side of the court, as you'd expect.  And it's my submission that we, the Defence, are entitled to know what the Prosecution are putting, not the speculation of a meeting -- or if they are doing that, then spell that out -- but the fact and assertion of a meeting on instructions.  There's a world of difference.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend simply wants me to agree with his case.  We have Prosecution evidence that suggests that the meeting in Kayanga was in January 1994.  It's all a very long time ago now, Your Honour, in the previous session, but one of the witnesses -- in fact, I think it's one of the ones I called, GLM, who referred to meetings in the area and he referred to Kayanga in 1994.  

So all I'm doing is exploring.  I'm not particularly interested in who was there, but I'm interested in the timing, and the timing is embarrassing, potentially, to the Defence proposition that between September 1993 and March 1994 Mr. Rwamakuba was in Belgium.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we all know, of course, that there were Prosecution witnesses who mentioned all manner of meetings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I don't think this warrants further discussion.  We are aware of what the Prosecution witnesses said.  We are aware of what the Defence case is.  We have a witness who has said, "I saw Rwamakuba at a meeting in Kayanga.  I am not sure of the date."  Now, whatever date he saw Rwamakuba at the meeting, then he could not be in Belgium at the time.  Now, it is a matter for us to determine in due course.  

Now, his description of who was present at the meeting is a factor which we will take into account in assessing his reliability on the question of dates, but I think this is a matter which is a matter for our deliberation in due course.  I don't see any real harm in the question.  I mean, the witness has already said, "I saw Rwamakuba at a meeting."  It's whether the question is put to the witness -- in fact, the question is quite an unnecessary question, because whether the question is put or not, whatever date Rwamakuba attended this meeting, he could not have been in Belgium on that date.  And so the question is a superfluous question; I don't see any particular menace in it or any particular magic in it.  And that is a matter we are going to have to address during our deliberations. 
MR. HOOPER:
My strongest inclination is to sit down, but I'm going to come back to what is the concern.  It's not a question, in my submission, of the witness attending any old meeting.  It's a specific meeting with these leading lights there, and they are the prime minister, foreign secretary, Twagiramungu, Ndengejeho, who was a leading figure in the MDR, and Rwamakuba.  And that labels this meeting as something special.  

Now, the Defence say, well, there was a meeting in the summer, or June, I think, of 1993 -- that's our assertion -- where these parties, prior to divisions in the party, met in Kayanga.  And while I obviously wholeheartedly agree with your analysis, Mr. President, which is, I suppose, going to be a matter at the end of the day, what concerns me is that the Prosecution, who have a duty to the Chamber over and above making points with the witness, are asserting here -- asserting -- that this was a meeting in 1993.  

Now, is there a basis for that?  Is there information in respect of that?  Because we haven't heard it from any witness at all that these luminaries were present in early '94 in Kayanga.  If that's the case, then such information should be disclosed to us because it would be an essential element of the Prosecution case, and if it is in fact an asserted fact that is based on some basis other than a fishing expedition -- and I've got no objection to fishing expeditions, but if it's more than that, then we need to be alerted to that because we've seen nothing to indicate that and we can, in what is technically the short time available to us, respond to that.  

So it's not just a question, in my submission, of a meeting -- and I may not have carried Your Honour on that -- it's a specific meeting at a specific time.  And if there's evidence that that meeting is being displaced to January 1994, which has a significant feature -- aspect to our case, then that's significant.  It's not just a question of a cat among pigeons; it's a question of the Prosecution asserting a fact which is not known to the Defence and apparently on the basis of -- some proper basis.  And if that's the case, then we should be let in to what that evidence is so that we can assess it and respond to it.  

So, those are my further observations, and perhaps I can diplomatically say that I don't request a further response from you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Yes, Mr. Morley.  

MR. MORLEY:
I don't propose to respond either unless Your Honour wants me to say something.  With Your Honour's leave, I'll simply continue questioning the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've told us you saw Rwamakuba once.  Did you meet him so that you had a conversation with him, or did you see him simply on a podium, introducing prominent personalities? 
A.	I saw him when he was introducing the invitees, but I didn't have to greet him since I didn't know him.  He was a prominent figure and I saw him as an official.  I did not have personal knowledge of Rwamakuba.  I didn't have any personal ties with him.  You know, an official, a prominent figure, is known to all members of the population but the prominent figure in question is likely not to know all members of the population. 
Q.	Would you recognise him today? 
A.	Well, it has been a long time.  At the time he was a rather slender person.  Probably, he has put on some weight.  Well, I know nothing about this, but at the time he wasn't very tall; he was a person of average height. 
Q.	Can you remember if he wore glasses? 
A.	Yes, he used to wear glasses. 
Q.	Thank you.  You told us yesterday about a man named (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) from Kabere secteur.  I want to ask you about another man.  
MR. MORLEY:
I pause there and I look to Your Honour.  I wonder whether my questions should be in closed session.  I may be being oversensitive, but it may be the Defence would prefer any questions to be in closed session, for reasons of previous orders relating to their witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we agree this should be in closed session, for the reason you have given.  How long do you think you are likely to be?  
MR. MORLEY:
English time, about two minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Two minutes. 
MR. MORLEY:
English time.  Possibly ten minutes.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I ask that the reference to witness be redacted?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is redacted.  I make the order for it.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are back in open session.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You have told us that people were killed at the Gikomero school near the parish by soldiers and locals; is that right? 
A.	I told you that the soldiers went up, followed by assailants, and after a few moments we heard heavy firing and I learned that the soldiers had shot at the refugees, had shot at their livestock, and the assailants helped the soldiers to kill the refugees, but I also told you that some of the refugees managed to escape. 
Q.	You were not at the school; is that right? 
A.	No, I never went to that school. 
Q.	You were not at the Gikomero centre that day; is that right? 
A.	No, I did not go to Gikomero trading centre.  I told you that I was below where the soldiers found us, near the crossroad of that road with the road that goes to Gicaca.  They asked us where the Inkotanyi were, and we told them that the Inkotanyi had left.  There were many of us.  There were street boys, strollers, people hanging around; there were quite a few of us.  So they went up and killed the people at the school. 
Q.	You did not see who was at the Gikomero centre that day? 
A.	After the soldiers had departed, I don't think anybody stayed at Gikomero trading centre.  Everybody followed the soldiers.  I personally did not follow the soldiers because it was late; it was about 1 p.m.  I had no business at the school, which is why I did not follow the soldiers. 
Q.	You do not know who was there; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	You're speaking of the primary school?  I told you that the people that participated in the massacre at the Protestant school pleaded guilty.  They explained how they accompanied the soldiers and everything that happened when they arrived at the primary school.  So I don't know what the Gacaca court will dish out as a sentence for those people. 
Q.	It is suggested that two young men were killed at the Gikomero trading centre prior to the slaughter at the school.  You know nothing about that; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	No, I have heard nothing about that.  I told you that ******************************.  In those days people were killed by their neighbours, who hunted them down, and when they caught them, they killed them.  So I don't know.  Nobody ever informed me whether people were killed at the trading centre.  I don't know if they were really killed because, in any case, nobody's ever mentioned it to me. 
Q.	A third young man, it is suggested, was driven off his motorcycle and killed by the trading centre.  You know nothing about that; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	No, I know nothing of that. 
Q.	You lived about one and a half miles away; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, approximately a kilometre or a bit more.  And the trading centre is on top of the hill, ******************************* so it is not easy to know everything that occurred at the trading centre, all the more so since the killers did not chat much, did not talk much with the people that didn't kill with them. 
Q.	Because the killers did not chat much with the people who did not kill with them, it follows, doesn't it, that you didn't learn everything that happened in Gikomero centre that day? 
A.	I say that because when the people went off to kill, some of them went to kill but others went to pillage, to loot, and when they came back we didn't talk with them.  What interest -- what advantage would there be in talking with those killers?  Some people went off to kill people; others went off to seek the possibility of looting. 
Q.	Do you know who sent the soldiers to Gikomero centre on the day of the slaughter at the school? 
A.	No, I don't know anything about that.  I only saw the vehicles.  I told you there were four vehicles, carrying soldiers.  Well, if they were soldiers, I don't really know, but they were wearing military uniforms and they were with people who were armed with machetes.  So I can't tell you who their leader was or who had sent them to kill. 
Q.	You described four vehicles driving past.  Were they full of people? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth is requesting the Prosecutor to repeat the question, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, certainly.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You saw four vehicles driving past.  Were they full of people? 
A.	The vehicles carried soldiers but also people in civilian clothes and they carried machetes, but the majority of the occupants of those vehicles were soldiers. 
Q.	Did these vehicles stop at your house or did they simply drive past? 
A.	The vehicles stopped ****************************************************** road to Gikomero.  I told you that there was a shot, and after the shot the vehicles went up.  I told you that when I heard that noise, I was -- I went near the road to see what was happening.  I saw the soldiers asking the population where the Inyenzi were and the locals answered that the Inyenzi had gone.  That is why the soldiers then went on up, and then the locals followed them, and after a while we heard shooting at the Protestant school.  And after a while the vehicles came back and returned whence they had come from. 
Q.	Did you inspect each of the four vehicles to see who was in them? 
A.	They were pickup trucks, open, not enclosed.  We could see all the passengers and their weapons.  I told you that some of the soldiers climbed down, chatted with the locals.  They were armed with guns.  I don't know whether you'd approach uncovered vehicles.  There wasn't even a tarpaulin.  Pickup trucks, there was no way you couldn't see the occupants of the vehicles and their weapons.  
Q.	If you add them all up, between the four vehicles, how many people were there, approximately? 
A.	I'd say altogether there were about 30, but I didn't count them, of course.  But I'd estimate their number to be -- to have been 30.  So 30, that's my estimate, 30 people. 
Q.	When you say 30 people, do you mean 30 soldiers or do you mean 30 soldiers and people? 
A.	I'm speaking of altogether.  You could say maybe -- you could call them Interahamwe, young people armed with pangas, machetes and clubs and spears, hammers -- and hammers.  So I couldn't say the majority were civilians.  They were mixed.  It was a mixed group of soldiers and civilians. 
Q.	Do you know where they had come from? 
A.	I told you that they came from Rubungo, they arrived at Karama, Rugarama.  They arrived at the crossroad of the road to Jurwe, where they stopped -- or, rather, they stopped at the crossroad of the road to Jurwe and the road going to Gicaca.  That's where they stopped, talked to the locals and then went on to Gikomero.  
Q.	Who had sent them? 
A.	I have told you that I don't know at all. 
Q.	************************* from the road.  You told us that yesterday.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct; that's what I stated yesterday. 
Q.	While at your house you do not observe everything that happens on the road.  You told us that early in your testimony yesterday.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I told you that when I am at home I cannot see everything, everyone that passes on the road.  You could perhaps ask me how I came to notice those vehicles.  I heard the engines, the rumbling of the engines of the vehicles.  I heard the noise the people were making.  That is how I was alerted and came near those vehicles and that's how I heard the soldiers asking where the Inkotanyi were.  It was because of that noise and the brief halt of those vehicles very near my home that I came to notice those vehicles and those people. 
Q.	Other vehicles passed your house without you knowing about them.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I told you that subsequently it wasn't the same day, of course -- I told you about a bus carrying the soldiers, going to fight the Inkotanyi who had captured Rutunga.  I told you that I also saw that bus.  I don't know if they did actually fight the Inkotanyi or if they didn't find any Inkotanyi but, in any case, they came back.  

I told you that I also saw the bourgmestre's vehicle with his communal policemen, the bourgmestre who was fleeing.  Those are the only vehicles I've mentioned that I observed, or noticed, passing on the road. 
Q.	Thank you; that's very helpful.  It doesn't answer the question.  It's right, isn't it, that you are not saying to the Judges that you see every vehicle on the road?  There are vehicles that pass your premises that you don't see, don't hear, don't have any knowledge about.  You wouldn't say you see everything; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	I could not notice anybody that passed because I have activities at home.  Sometimes I was inside; sometimes.  But these were difficult times or special times, a peculiar time.  When you heard a noise, you'd exit from your house to see what's going on.  But sometimes when you see a vehicle passing, you would know who that vehicle belonged to.  But I told you that when the bourgmestre passed with the communal policemen and the people from the communal office, we saw them.  

I remember, moreover, that some members of the population spoke to the bourgmestre to ask him why he was fleeing, why he was abandoning the local community to flee.  I know there are other people who did not see the bourgmestre's vehicle.  That is why I tell you I cannot say I saw everything that passed on the road. 
Q.	Thank you.  I'd like to talk to you about Gacaca proceedings, please.  Have you attended Gacaca proceedings in your local secteur? 
A.	No one can be absent from the Gacaca sessions unless they have a very good reason, or a valid reason. 
Q.	Is it right -- start the question again.  You have told us that you have never been charged or imprisoned for any offences in relation to what happened in 1994.  Do you remember telling us that yesterday? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	Although you may not have been charged, have you in fact been accused of being a member of one of the roadblocks in the area of Gikomero at Gacaca proceedings? 
A.	I can tell you that at the time it was an order -- there was an order that people should take part at roadblocks.  However, nobody has accused me of having been at a roadblock during the Gacaca hearings.  

At the time of the events everyone was compelled to go to roadblocks, even if some people were carrying out -- were exacting on others, even if they didn't have activities that stopped people from stealing or killing whoever they wanted to.  At the time many roadblocks were set up.  And today in Rwanda people are forced to take part in nightly shifts or rounds and nobody can disobey authorities.  This is also what happened at the time of the events.  I therefore was involved in the activities at roadblocks in my secteur, but I was never accused of having perpetrated depredations at any of those roadblocks.  Nobody has accused me of anything whatsoever during Gacaca hearings.  
Q.	For how many days did you attend roadblocks in your secteur? 
A.	On the 12th, when the Interahamwe perpetrated massacres, we remained at a roadblock throughout the night, but nobody died at our roadblock.  The second time was on the day that the bourgmestre fled and when the local community stopped the bourgmestre.  

The bourgmestre spent the night at the roadblock, and the following day, since refugees had come from Gasabo and Rutunga and who were above the centre on an empty piece of land, the bourgmestre said at around 8 o'clock in the morning that he was going to see the refugees.  He had spent the night at the roadblock with policemen because we had stopped them from going away.  He told us that he was going to see how the refugees were that morning, after which he would go to Kanombe in order to look for firearms.  He got into his car with policemen and he left and went towards the summit of the hill, where the refugees were, and thence forward we never saw him again.  

In short, I was at the roadblock for two days.  The roadblocks did not remain there for a long time since the Inkotanyi had conquered Rutunga and Kayanga and other locations that were close.  We were ordered to dismantle the roadblocks, and those who remained behind could be killed by the Inkotanyi.  So when the bourgmestre left our roadblock, he never came back.  
Q.	What happened to the refugees that were stopped at your roadblock? 
A.	The refugees I have talked to you about were actually displaced persons of the population from Rutunga and Gasabo and these people were displaced by the Inkotanyis.  And some members of the local community that were moving about could pass through the roadblock.  

During the night in which Rutaganira fled, some members of the community remained with -- outside of the roadblock, and certain displaced persons went back to their homes the following day, up until when the Inkotanyi arrived at Gikomero and people fled.  Some people were killed -- I'm referring to members of the population -- while others, including yours truly, went away or took flight.  And at the end of all of the above, that is at the end of the events, everybody went back to their respective homes. 
Q.	So that I'm clear about this, you're telling us that you were part of a roadblock on the night of the 12th of April, after the slaughter at the school; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	It was your function to stop people as they passed along the road; is that right? 
A.	No, that isn't the case.  I have told you that during that period we were ordered to spend the night at roadblocks.  And in the aftermath of the massacre that took place during the day, I do not know why the officials had decided that members of the population had to stay the night at the roadblock, but as I have told you, no one died at that roadblock.  There was no violence or cases of assault against passers-by or those who were passing through the roadblock on that first day.  
The following day, when the bourgmestre fled, we spent the night at the roadblock and at that point in time we stopped the bourgmestre, to ask him why he was leaving -- fleeing, leaving behind the population.  

Now, regarding the massacres, we knew that people were killing each other, and those of the population that did not want to take part in the massacres could stay home and go about their daily chores or be involved in their manual labour.  So not everyone killed; not everyone was involved in the massacres.  And as far as I am concerned, I remained at my home most of the time and I only went to the road on the few occasions.  And I only spent the time at the roadblock during the two days that I've mentioned to you. 
Q.	That was a very long answer in respect of the question:  Did you stop people at roadblocks?  I'll ask it again.  What is the point of a roadblock if it isn't to stop people there?
A.	Roadblocks were erected in order to stop people who were being hunted down or sought after, but on the night that I was at the roadblock, there weren't people who were fleeing and who passed through that roadblock.  Probably those who were fleeing passed through other roadblocks or through other ways.  

Probably my answers are long, but if there had been deaths at that roadblock, I would have talked to you about them.  Since people died most everywhere, I wouldn't have had any cause to hide the fact that people died at the roadblock where I was. 
Q.	Your function at the roadblock, if I distill what you've just told us, was to stop people who were being hunted; is that right?  You were part of the method of gathering the people who were being hunted, but in fact nobody came through your roadblock so there was no one to stop? 
A.	As far as the roadblocks were concerned, I've told you that they were erected for the purpose of stopping people that were being looked for.  However, it is possible to order members of the community to stay at roadblocks.  It is also possible that some members of the population go there, whilst some of them commit atrocities at the roadblocks.  That is what happened.  

There were many people at the roadblocks, at all roadblocks in general, and amongst the population there could be some evildoers who organised things and who committed atrocities without informing others.  For most of the population or community, they learned about what was happening.  They learned that massacres or atrocities were perpetrated in one locality or the other, but they were helpless.  There was nothing they could do.  They merely observed what was happening, helplessly, and could do nothing.  And as far as our own roadblock was concerned, nothing happened there on that night. 
Q.	Was that more by luck than by judgement?  
A.	There were survivors at the Protestant school and some survivors passed by that roadblock and they are still alive today.  After the events the criminals were arrested and there are some who confessed to their crimes.  They are being prosecuted at the Gacaca hearings.  Some others were arrested and put in custody in ordinary prisons.  This means, therefore, that those who are responsible for those crimes and atrocities will be prosecuted, either by the Gacaca court or by ordinary courts in the country. 
Q.	Have any people who were with you at the roadblocks been prosecuted as criminals for bad things that they did? 
A.	In our cellule ** people were arrested, but some others were arbitrarily arrested.  By the way, this has happened to many people -- or this was the case of many people who are today in custody.  There are innocent people who were arrested, even though they were innocent.  

As to my cellule, ** suspects were arrested, and some have even confessed to their crimes.  Those -- and they have been released provisionally.  Some of them are awaiting judgement. 
Q.	Of the ** in your cellule, were some of them with you on the roadblock? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you think you share any responsibility for the events at roadblocks? 
A.	If I had indeed participated in what happened or played a role in those crimes, I would have had to account for my actions.  Those who committed crimes have confessed to them and they have also said who their accomplices were.  These ones have been put in prison.  From the latest news, nobody has told me or mentioned that I was with him when he committed a crime or the other, for instance, when he killed.  So nobody has accused me of anything whatsoever insofar as what happened at that period is concerned.  
Q.	Do you feel you share any responsibility for the events that took place at roadblocks? 
A.	In all conscience, I can only talk about things I witnessed and which happened.  I cannot invent anything, and I have no concern or worry.  My conscience is clear, since those who committed crimes have confessed to them and have said who their accomplices were or who their co-perpetrators were.  As for me, I collaborated with no one.  I was an accomplice to no one in any crime whatsoever. 
Q.	But your colleagues at the roadblock have been accused and have been condemned.  You, perhaps, have been lucky, do you think? 
A.	As far as I'm concerned, it's a matter for the conscience.  And for those who committed crimes, they have those crimes on their conscience and in their blood.  They committed the crimes wittingly.  As for me, I had no criminal intent.  I had no intention to commit crimes because my conscience forbade me from doing so and that is why I didn't commit any crimes, and that is the reason wherefore I was not prosecuted for any crime whatsoever. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The rules of our Court require that you be asked a few other questions by Mr. Hooper, the lawyer for the accused person, so now you have to answer him. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I just go, as it were, backwards to some of the questions you've been asked this morning and start with this issue of roadblocks?  And you've told us the circumstances in which you came to be on a roadblock and that you did no wrong.  

Now, you were asked about other people who were with you on roadblocks and whether they had been arrested, prosecuted, and you said that some had.  Did you yourself witness crimes being committed at the roadblocks by those people, or by anyone?  
A.	At our roadblock there were no victims during the night in which I was there.  I left that roadblock the following day.  So, personally, I didn't see anybody killed at that roadblock, either at night or in the course of the day, and I must specify that I was not -- I didn't stay at that roadblock during the day.  At other roadblocks, however, there were persons who were killed there.  

In my cellule, nobody died at a roadblock, but there are persons at our roadblock or from our cellule who went to other cellules to kill people, to carry out attacks and kill people, and that is the reason wherefore those people are prosecuted.  In our cellule, nobody killed anybody at our roadblock.  

There are persons who were killed in our cellule, but those ones were killed by other people who had come from other cellules, and those people -- those criminals have confessed to their crimes 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about passing vehicles and what you noticed in your home.  Now, first of all, in this home, were you living alone or were you with any other people? 
A.	I was living with my wife and our children. 
Q.	Was there any discussion among you as to what was going on in these exceptional circumstances, as you described it, what was going on in terms of traffic, passing vehicles, or not? 
A.	During the war people talked quite a bit, and when you are at home with your wife and children, you definitely talk to each other.  But we were at a time of war and vehicles were passing by.  For instance, Rutaganira's vehicle used to pass by the road, and Rutaganira was intercepted at that roadblock and he spent the night there.  His vehicle stayed parked on the road.  And when people died or when there were other incidents, we did talk about them in our family. 
Q.	Now, how many times have you set eyes on André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I saw Rwamakuba only once, during the rally that was held at Kayanga. 
Q.	You were asked by Mr. Morley for the Prosecution whether Rwamakuba wore glasses, and you said, yes, he did.  
A.	Yes, I have already answered in the affirmative. 
Q.	So how many times did you see him wearing glasses, as far as you can remember? 
A.	I saw him on that day.  That is the only time I saw him. 
Q.	Can you remember how else he was dressed? 
A.	He was wearing a jacket, a pair of trousers and a shirt.  Don't ask me to tell you what colours those clothes were; it's been a long time.  And it is clear that he was also wearing shoes or any other items of clothing that elegant persons are wont to wear. 
Q.	Let me ask you about the meeting.  You've described who was there and you named as present Anasthase Gasana, who you said was foreign minister; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Faustin Twagiramungu, who was president and leader of the MDR, and later -- later prime minister for a year under Paul Kagame's RPF government from 1994 to 1995; is that right? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Agathe Uwilingiyimana, can you remember was she in office at that time, or not?  I mean, did she have a ministerial position at that time or not, Agathe? 
A.	She was prime minister. 
Q.	Ndengejeho, I think you mentioned.  What was he; can you remember? 
A.	He was the minister of information. 
Q.	Were these people calling on the population to exterminate the Tutsis? 
A.	No, those figures did not incite the local population to massacre the Tutsis.  During that rally those personalities were criticising the Habyarimana regime and took stock of the exactions or depredations of the regime.  They also called on the resignation of President Habyarimana.  In fact, those prominent figures insisted that President Habyarimana should resign and leave the chair to other persons. 
Q.	Was that meeting conducted in a peaceful manner? 
A.	Yes, it was a peaceful meeting. 
MR. HOOPER:
No other questions, Mr. President.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper. 
 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have now come to the end of your evidence.  We thank you for coming here and giving testimony before our Tribunal.  You are now excused and you may leave.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our break now.  I just want to mention that we want to try to maximise our effective sitting time and we will try to resume precisely within 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed at 1035H) 
(Pages 11 to 20 by Karen Holm)

























(Court resumed at 1051H) 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, before I start this witness, there is a matter that doesn't concern this witness at all that I would like to raise in closed session.  It doesn't concern this witness, but it concerns somebody else, but I would ask that this witness, in the circumstances, remove his earphones, and I'm quite happy if he remains in court, if Your Honours are.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long are you going to be in closed session?
MR. HOOPER:
Five minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're going into closed session for approximately five minutes.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 22 to 32] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper and Mr. Morley, were there any exhibits for the last witness?
MR. MORLEY:
On the part of the Prosecution, no.  The one exhibit we referred to, the sketch, was P. 2 already.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper?
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I forgot.  There were two exhibits, the witness identification form, which we understand will be D. 168, and the sketch of the Gikomero commune where the witness marked his house, and that will be D. 169 -- both those exhibits in respect of witness 4/12.
MR. PRESIDENT:
They will both be under seal; is that right?
MR. HOOPER:
They will both be admitted under seal, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 168 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. D. 169 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now you're in open session and, just for the record, I have to state that you took the oath to tell the truth during the closed part of your testimony.

Now you continue your examination in open session and Mr. Hooper will question you.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	And in closed session you were able to tell us in some little detail about your general background, where you lived, your functions as such, and any particular difficulties that you had following the war.  And you also told us essentially that your knowledge of the commune was good.

And now I want to ask you about the Accused in this case, André Rwamakuba.  Do you know him?  How do you know him, but bearing in mind be careful in respect of identity issues?  How well do you know him, can you tell us, please?
A.	I knew the Accused when he was young.  Actually, Rwamakuba and his parents came from Congo, and that is where Rwamakuba underwent primary education.  I knew Rwamakuba when he came to Rwanda to pursue his secondary school education.  I think his parents had ended their contract, or had come to the end of their tour of their duty and they came back to settle in Rwanda, and Rwamakuba came to continue his schooling in Rwanda, in particular in Nyanza, and when he came to undertake his studies I used to meet him and you have to understand that I knew him when he was still pretty young.
Q.	In Nyanza, do you recall the name of the school that he attended?
A.	He attended Christ the King College -- Christ-Roi College of Nyanza -- N-Y-N-Z-A -- N-Y-A-N-Z-A -- Nyanza.
Q.	Can you tell us anything about his subsequent education and work, that you know of?
A.	To my knowledge, he finished his studies at the Christ-Roi College and proceeded to Europe to undergo further education.  So he was in Europe.  However, he did not finish his university education in Europe, but came to complete them in Butare, where he ended up as a medical doctor.  Thereafter, he held medical duties.  He actually headed the region sanitaire.  That is the health region in Rwanda.  He was also responsible for the management of the department of hygiene in the Ministry of Health.  Those are the duties that I know that he performed.  Probably he held other positions, but to my knowledge those were the positions he held prior to the war.
Q.	You've described to us where his parents lived.  How well did you know them?
A.	I know his parents in general terms.  When I saw them, they were of a certain age; that is, they had gone on in years.  I said they were -- had been living in Congo, but when they came to Rwanda, I know them, so I knew their parents just as I know some other inhabitants of that secteur.  I'm referring to the inhabitants of the entire area.
Q.	Did you know André Rwamakuba's brother-in-law -- I should specify a brother-in-law who lived in that area?
A.	Are you referring to someone who might be related to his wife, that is, a man who is related to the Accused, or a brother to his wife?  Who is it you're referring to?
Q.	The husband of his sister who lived locally.  
A.	Yes, I know him.  Actually, I knew him when he was still alive, since he was living in the same area as yours truly.
Q.	And that man, is it right that he was murdered in the genocide?
A.	Yes, that is true; that man was killed during the genocide.
Q.	And if asked, can you tell us the circumstances, as you understand them, of his death?
A.	I was not on the hill or in the cellule when he died, but I learned that he was killed during an attack that was led by the person responsible for his cellule.  I was told that he had taken refuge in Rwamakuba's father's house and that the assailants found him there.  Other people said that he was found in his house.  So the information that we received at Gacaca hearings in our cellule let us know that he was arrested in Rwamakuba's father's house and taken to another location where he was killed.
Q.	Now, you've told us that at the time you had no political affiliations in 1994.  But I want to ask you if you heard at that time, or have heard since, of any political meetings that were held in your area in your side of the commune, or elsewhere in the commune, that were attended by André Rwamakuba and where he incited anti-Tutsi feeling among people, to the extent, for example, of calling for the Tutsis to be exterminated.  Have you ever heard of such things then or since?  
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers, may I just ask for the question to be broken down?  There are a whole variety of different factual propositions within it.  It may be that the witness will be of assistance if the question is broken into smaller chunks.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	If you feel able to answer the question, can you answer it?  
A.	May I answer the question?
Q.	Yes, please do.  
A.	To answer your question concerning the rallies of political parties, there were rallies held in our commune, because there were various parties -- the MRND, the MDR, the PLJ (sic) and the PL.  The four parties organised rallies.  Rwamakuba was a member of the MDR, and the MDR used to hold rallies.  Personally, I never attended rallies, but when the rallies are organised, those who attend them talk about them.  Personally, I never heard that the MDR party had incited people to kill or massacre Tutsis.  The objective of the MDR, which was well known and which people talked about at the end of rallies, was that the MRND should be opposed and weakened so that power can be wrested from them.  But I never heard people say that during a rally MDR members had called for the extermination of Tutsis.
Q.	Right.  Thank you.  Can I ask you this: did it ever come to your ears that André Rwamakuba was expressing anti-Tutsi feelings -- pointedly anti-Tutsi sentiments?
A.	Rwamakuba's statements were never reported to me.  I have never heard any person talk of Rwamakuba having made such statements.
Q.	In your knowledge of André Rwamakuba, growing up with him from being a boy and onwards, has he ever expressed anti-Tutsi sentiments to you, or in your presence?
A.	No, I have never heard him making anti-Tutsi pronouncements.  To my knowledge, Rwamakuba is a rather introverted person.  He didn't have the habit of talking of others or to entertain ties with certain people, so it was difficult to have an understanding of his personality.
Q.	In terms of MDR meetings, do you know of any meetings in the year or so before the war started in April 1994 -- do you know of any MDR meetings in Nduba, for example, or Sha or Shango, that were MDR meetings and which, to your knowledge, André Rwamakuba attended?
A.	There's one thing that I know.  A rally was held in Nduba, but I can't recall the year in which it was held.  I believe he was present at that meeting.  Since he was a native of that area, and that he was a prominent person, it would be unthinkable that he failed to attend that meeting.  However, I did not see him there, since I wasn't there at the meeting, at the rally.
Q.	Do you know if any other MDR figures or authorities were present at that rally?
A.	I know nothing of them.  I can't remember any, even if those figures were there.  You know, I am naturally not a very curious person.  I did not seek to find out and nobody told me who was at that meeting in attendance.  All I know is that Rwamakuba was almost inseparable from Anasthase Gasana, since they were both natives of the same commune and since they were members of the same political party.
Q.	Prior to the war, prior to April 1994, when was the last time you had seen Rwamakuba, that you recall?
A.	I do not have a recollection of the precise date on which I saw him for the first time prior to 1994, but I think I saw him in 1993, and before April -- and before April 1993.
Q.	So on that assessment, it is something like about a year before the war was the last that you saw him in the commune; is that right?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	All right.  When was the last time you saw André Rwamakuba?
A.	I saw Rwamakuba for the last time in 1994, towards the end of May, and I saw him in Gitarama.
Q.	In what circumstances?
A.	As I have told you, at a certain point in time I fled and took refuge at Gacurabwenge in Gitarama.  At a certain point I went to Gitarama, the prefecture chief town, because it was being said that the government was paying the salaries of civil servants in Gitarama.  At that time the so-called Abatabazi government was in flight somewhat and they got to Gitarama.  So I went to Gitarama to see if I could be paid my salary, and that is where I saw Rwamakuba for the last time.
Q.	Did you have any conversation with him?
A.	Yes, I talked to him.  You cannot meet an old acquaintance and fail to hold a conversation with him.  On that occasion he asked me for information regarding our commune and I told him that there wasn't much that I knew, since I myself had left the commune.  I told him, however, of the death of his father, because I was aware of the death of his father.
Q.	And what was his reaction to your telling him of the death of his father?
A.	The news aggrieved him.  I don't see how he could have reacted in any other manner.
Q.	Were you able to tell him the circumstances of his father's death, or not?
A.	No, I didn't know very well the circumstances under which his father had died.  I only learned of them upon my return from exile.  I therefore learned of it in greater detail when I returned home, but at the time I informed Rwamakuba, I had learned it from rumours; that is, from people who were talking about it without having been a witness to the circumstances of his death.
Q.	Let me take you to April of 1994 where we know, of course, that things were ignited by the death of President Habyarimana.  That was the 6th of April.  But can you help us, please -- what your impression was in the commune of relationships between Hutus and Tutsis in the months or year or so preceding that event of April?
A.	The relationship between the Hutus and Tutsis prior to Habyarimana's death was very good.
Q.	Now, we've heard that there were numerous displaced people settled in or near the commune.  Were there any difficulties caused by them?  How were they interacting with the commune before April of 1994?
A.	Yes, it is true, there were war-displaced persons who had come from Byumba, because war was raging in Byumba.  Those people settled in our secteur at the border of the Buriza region, so there were displaced persons in Rutungo commune, while others were in the Gikomero commune at the border, or in an area that was astride the two communes.  Amongst the displaced persons were people who were not happy, and since those people were not happy, their unhappiness was the cause of conflict between them and members of the population who were living where the refugees had settled, and the bourgmestre of the commune had to go to where these displaced persons were settled in order to iron out their various conflicts or disputes that arose between the refugees or the displaced persons and the local community members.
Q.	And so we remind ourselves, that bourgmestre was the youngish gentleman you've referred to called Telesphore Rutaganira; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  Yes, he's the one I'm referring to.
Q.	Now, I'm going to just pass a sketch map which from time to time you can perhaps assist us with, and yourself with, I hope.  Mr. Issa, sorry to trouble you.

And we all have this, but looking at it you'll see -- you've seen it before, I've shown it to you before, Mr. Witness, but it's a sketch of the area.  And in relation to Nduba on that plan, on that sketch, where were the displaced people settled, and in what sort of numbers?  Can you help us with that?
A.	In the Nduba secteur, you can see the road going across near Bumbogo and leading to Rutongo.  You'll see a location marked Nyacyonga in Rutongo.  There were displaced persons at Nyacyonga and others who were opposite in Nduba.  There were many war-displaced persons, say 10,000 or so.  There were other war-displaced persons at Gishaka, but they were fewer in number, and others at Gasabo, and these were also few in number.  Other war-displaced persons had found hospitality with the local population and lived in the various houses of the inhabitants of the commune.
Q.	And now we come to the events of April the 6th, the death of the president.  I want to ask you to tell us how things developed after that.
A.	After the president's death, which death we learned of from press releases that were broadcast ordering the members of the population to remain at home -- all professional activities were halted, and ordinary citizens remained in their homes.  On the 7th, everyone was at home and people were asking questions about the death of the president.

On the 8th, the war-displaced persons of Nyacyonga that we have just mentioned started attacking the houses of members of the population in search of Tutsis.  They did not know who was a Tutsi and who wasn't, since they originated from Byumba, and that is why they were assisted by the members of the local community of that secteur.

The displaced persons started by attacking the Sha secteur, where you had the highest concentration of Tutsis.  In the Nduba secteur there weren't many Tutsis.  I think, therefore, that they began attacking at Sha, because you had the highest number of Tutsis there.  So we heard the din and noise coming from the attack, and people started fleeing.  And since I live opposite Sha, that is opposite the cellule that was attacked, and since I was hearing the noise, and as other people passed by Karama in my secteur and passed through my house, they said that Abakiga had massacred people.  

I went to the communal office in order to seek the intervention of communal authorities.  This is something unusual or exceptional that had come to us as a surprise.  The bourgmestre therefore intervened and I came with him, but he went right to Sha and put paid to the attacks.

He went back home, but subsequently the attacks resumed.  The displaced persons of the Karama secteur came to my house and the others spent the night in my house.  In the morning of the 9th I paid a visit to Tutsis, who were my neighbours, in order to find out whether they were in good health, but I realised that there was no problem, with the exception that the goods belonging to the Tutsis had been looted.  Soldiers that had come from Kami in Rukokoma commune had arrested a Tutsi who had been a member of the army, but who was no longer a member thereof.

The said Tutsi was taken to the Butare centre in Shango secteur.  I went and saw him and realised that he was no longer there, or I went to see him but realised that he was no longer there.  He was later killed publicly by those soldiers.  It was a --
Q.	Can I pause you there?
A.	It was a signal they had to trigger to massacres.
Q.	I'm sorry, I'm just having to cross over the witness.  Right.  Thank you very much.  

So you've taken us to the 9th of April and to events that have now developed within your secteur where you were and to the killing of a Tutsi by soldiers who came from Kami camp -- that's K-A-M-I -- is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Soldiers killed that Tutsi.
Q.	And the name of the man who was killed, can you give us that, please?
A.	Cesar Rubuyiza.
Q.	Just pausing there, please, that's Cesar -- C-E-S-A-R -- and Rubuyiza -- R-U-B-U-Y-I-Z-A.  Now, killings having started in your secteur, and you told us that you had people hiding now in your home, and you've told us that your wife was of course Tutsi.  Did there come a time when your own home was attacked, and when was that?
A.	No, I was attacked on the same day.  The refugees had come to my house, spent the whole day in my house.  We could hear shouting, screaming, on the hill, but there was one Tutsi with his wife and children decided to go and hide in the bush, but others stayed at my house.

At about 2 p.m. my place was attacked -- a massive attack, more than 50 people.  They arrived in my place.  They found the responsable of the cellule who'd just arrived.  I don't know if they were in connivance, if they were conniving.  In any case, he didn't do anything to prevent them, so they asked if there were any intruders in my house, and they were told, "No."  They immediately concluded that my wife was an intruder.  They made her sit on the floor.  I began to plead in my wife's favour -- plead for my wife.  They began to debate my wife's fate, because there were refugees among them, but also locals that I knew very well.

But, by chance, by good fortune, some of the assailants started looting, so their interest turned rather to my property and they left my wife alone.  Of course, in my house there were some youths and children, and my own children who were hiding in the house, and when they saw the refugees were entering the house, my children and the others hiding in my house ran away, but still one person was hidden in my house -- who was hidden in my house was killed on the spot.

So they looted everything they found in my house.  And they said, "In any case, we'll have time to come back to you."  And after having seen all that, I decided to take my wife and my children and we sought refuge at the communal office.  We thought perhaps there are communal policemen who will protect us and all that happened on the 9th of April 1994.
Q.	Right.  So on the 9th of April is it right you and your wife go to Gishaka where the communal office is; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And as far as you can remember, how many days were you at Gishaka?
A.	So we stayed at Gishaka, but directly after I arrived, I must say I met the bourgmestre, who confessed to me that he didn't know what to do to stop that sort of thing happening.  He took me in at his place for two days, but after two days I left his residence to go elsewhere.  So I left Gishaka on the 14th of April.
Q.	Was your wife with you in Gishaka at the bourgmestre's, or was she elsewhere?
A.	My wife was hidden at the bourgmestre's place.  I told you I only spent two nights there, but my wife stayed at the bourgmestre's house until the 13th.  Otherwise, my entire family left Gishaka on the 14th of April.  She left the bourgmestre's house on the 14th, but all of us, my entire family, left Gishaka on the 14th.
Q.	And when your wife left, do you know where she went?
A.	On the 13th, since the bourgmestre had nonetheless tried to re-establish order and peace in the commune, he admitted to me that he was incapable of ensuring public safety, our safety, because there was a communal policeman who had betrayed him, who had gone to seek the killers elsewhere.  So he said to me, "Here, you and your wife, you must fend for yourselves, because I'm no longer in a position to ensure her safety."  So I took my wife and children with me to where I was hiding.

And then at one point my wife said to me, "Let me go off alone so that I die alone, rather than being killed with you, my husband, and my children."  And that is why she went to Gishaka church, which was a parish, a Catholic parish, and there was a large crowd of refugees who sought refuge inside the church, and were awaiting their deaths.

So I went and got her and convinced her to come with us so that we could continue hiding here and there and perhaps we would be lucky enough to survive.  She refused, and that is why I went to see the priest in charge of the parish -- the parish priest -- who assured me that he would find them a room.  That priest was speaking with my wife's uncle and promised to find them a room.  He did find them a room, but when the night came, when the killings began, since my wife was afraid, she went outside the room that had been made available to her.  Her uncle stayed in the room, but he died subsequently.

As for my wife, she went into the bush and we again met on the 14th of April, on which date I told her that we had to go very far away, since, moreover, the war was drawing nearer to us, RPF soldiers were closer and closer, and that is why on the 14th we decided to leave Gishaka.
Q.	Right.  Thank you.  So you mentioned that the bourgmestre had confessed to you that he could not control the situation, could not protect you, and that this was, in part, because of the betrayal by the communal policeman, or a communal policeman.  Do you know who that communal policeman was?
A.	Yes, I know that brigadier.
Q.	And can you give us his name, please?
A.	His name is Michel Nyarwaya.
Q.	And you mentioned that he'd gone off to get the killers from another place.  What circumstances are you talking about there?
A.	Yes, he went to Rubungo commune where there were some well-known killers -- famous Interahamwe.  He took them to Gishaka, but when he took the killers up, the other had already fled.  He had been alerted and warned that the brigadier, the communal policeman, had already gone off to fetch killers.
Q.	Do you know where he'd fled to, the bourgmestre?
A.	The bourgmestre sought exile in Congo, former Zaire.
Q.	Coming back to where you left off on the 14th, what were the circumstances that brought you and your wife together?
A.	I have stated that my wife spent the night in the bush and the following morning she went through the banana trees and arrived somewhere where she saw the people being killed.  So she found a house of a local whom she knew very well and there was a Tutsi lady at that house.  That man also had a Tutsi wife.  So I was alerted and told that my wife was with that family, and so I went to collect her so that we might leave.
Q.	And where did you leave and go to, if you did leave?
A.	We climbed Gishaka hill to the top.  We went through Nkuzuzu and when we got to Nkuzuzu we rested, but towards evening we could see everything happening in Nkuzuzu.  People were running up the hills, others were being chased by the killers, but in the evening we heard firing, shots, so we decided to move on, and we went towards Jurwe and Gikomero.  A bit further on --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We can't hear you, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, we're coming up to the time to break, Mr. Witness.  I'm going to, I'm afraid, interrupt you there and we'll pick up the events tomorrow.  That's the events of the 14th, continuing after you arrive at Jurwe, which we can see on our plan.  Can I just add that I understand Nkuzuzu is spelt N-K-U-Z-U-Z-U.  We'll leave it there if we can, Mr. Witness, and see you again tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, we don't have access to the courtroom in the afternoons, so we have to take the adjournment for the day now.  Your evidence will resume tomorrow morning.  

Now, I must advise you that during this or any other adjournment, while you are a witness in this case, you are not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody at all.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

We will now take the adjournment until tomorrow.  
(Court adjourned at 1230H)
