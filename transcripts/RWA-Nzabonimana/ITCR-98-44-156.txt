MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Apologising at the start is becoming the norm, and I'm sorry for our late start this morning.

Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Karin Hökborg; and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, 1st September 2005 for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
The session will resume this morning, and your testimony will continue.  You remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began your testimony.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS XV
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Are you feeling fit and strong today?
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Are you feeling fit and strong this morning?
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar has made an observation, which he'd like to do something about.  One moment, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, whilst that's being attended to, may I just mention that my learned leader, Ms. Fall, apologises for her hopefully brief absence this morning.  She hopes to be back in court for 10 o'clock.  She has a personal matter to attend to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
And I hope you've got the plan of the hospital and the tick list of -- of names that we've been dealing with.  I hope you've got both of those there.  If not, can you be given them, please.  

Thank you very much, Mr. Issa.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And while that's happening, can I just ask you this:  Of course, it's been several years, many years, in fact, since these incidents, and we know circumstances of your employment and we've heard about that yesterday.  Can I ask you this:  Have you discussed aspects of this case with any of the people on the list?  I may have asked you it before.  I'm sorry if I have.
A.	Since the trial commenced, I have not discussed the proceedings with anyone on this list.  There are names of persons with whom I have discussed the genocide in general as it happened at the time.  When the genocide was being perpetrated, we discussed certain events that occurred at the time.  
Q.	Well, since then, since the genocide, have you discussed aspects of the case or cases with anyone on the list?  
A.	After the genocide, as concerns this doctor, I'm talking about André, I think there is a procedure related to this case that was followed at a certain point.  So I can't say I have ever met those who have appeared before this Tribunal.  

During the genocide we did not discuss any specific individual.  We talked about people in general, the killers.  We said, for instance, the doctors did this or that, participated in this event or that, or the killers and attackers did this or that, but we did not target or discuss any particular individual or any specific ethnic group.  We talked in general terms of what we had seen.  
Q.	So, as you said, you have not -- you haven't met, you said, since then those who have appeared before this Court, those who have appeared, as you put it; is that right? 
A.	My answer is as follows:  I was in Butare.  I cannot tell you that I never met them, as was the case during the genocide.  I also met them then.  Probably could go further and put questions to me regarding the scope of our meetings or the manner in which we met each other.  
Q.	Let me just ask you about number 6 on that list in front of you.  

And I apologise if this is something I may have asked you before, but I haven't had the transcript of that aspect of the case yet.  

First of all, did you -- remind me, did you see number 6 during the genocide, and, if so, when and where? 
A.	Regarding the person numbered 6, I met him or her when we were trying to seek refuge.  Each and every one was trying to look for where to hide.  This must have been towards the end of April or beginning of May.  So it was between April ending and early May.  Subsequently, after the war, ************************************************ that we have talked about, and it so happens that that is where he had taken refuge.  
Q.	Have you ever discussed aspects of any case with that person since the genocide? 
A.	Going by the information that one hears, in particular, information that we get from the radio to the effect that there are trials going on in Arusha, we could have discussed in general terms.  I cannot refute the fact that we've never broached the subject of genocide.  But what I can confirm is that we've never discussed any aspect of the case of any particular individual.  We talked in general terms, and we talk about the events that took place during the genocide.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And earlier on the witness said, "It is possible that the guy had taken refuge at the hospital."
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	How many times -- you say you saw HF.  How many times during the -- your time in the hospital did you see that person? 
A.	Which person are you referring to?  Is it the one numbered 6?  I don't quite understand your question.  I don't know the one you're referring to.  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	If I have to go back a little bit, I'd like to tell you that during the genocide I did not meet him every day.  I have told you that I met him once where she had taken refuge -- 
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping) -- this person is a she, for -- for the booth, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry.  I'm sorry to have interrupted you, for the transcript.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You didn't meet this person every day, you were telling us.  Can you -- sorry to have interrupted you, Mr. Witness.  Can you please continue about -- about her.  
A.	Yes.  I was saying, therefore, that it wasn't under happy situations that we met.  We were facing difficult times.  There was a day I met her.  I don't know for how long she stayed at the location.  And as far as I'm concerned, my problem was my fate.  I was feeling that I could be killed at -- that I could be killed.  And I can tell you that, when the government came to visit the hospital, I talked to that person, and we said that these were members of government.  You are, therefore, not surprised if we discussed with Rwamakuba.  As concerns the conversations, I didn't even discuss with my wife.  You know, this was not a time that was opportune for easy conversation.  
Q.	I think, Mr. Witness, with respect, you can take it for granted that we will understand the total disorder and chaos and fear in which you were living, and the difficulties.  And I don't think, with respect, you need to repeat it in every answer that you give.  I merely asked you how many times did you see this person.  Your answer so far has been to that, that you didn't see her every day, you remember when the government came to the hospital, you spoke to this person about that.  Roughly, over the period you were there, how often did you meet number 6?  How often did you see her?  
A.	I met her twice.  
Q.	Can you tell us, first of all, did you know her before the genocide or did you know her for the first time when you met her during the genocide in the hospital? 
A.	I got acquainted with that person during the period of the genocide.  
Q.	I didn't know her before then (sic).  Now, when was the first time that you -- please just listen to the question.  When was the first time that you can remember meeting her, and where was it?  What was going on that you can remember? 
A.	I have already told you that that person had the habit of -- usually he hid near the maternity department.  And as this sketch shows, that is where she was.  I also met her near the women's hospitalisation ward.  So these are places that are close to one another.  And please remember that I'm talking about the time of the genocide.  We're talking about when the genocide was taking place, so it is in that area that I met her.  
Q.	You told us yesterday you didn't go to maternity, so where was this person -- where did this person have the habit of hiding near maternity?  Where was she hiding near maternity that you remember?  
A.	No, I am not saying that I went to the maternity services.  The only time that I passed close by the maternity was when people were being put on board vehicles and taken away.  I never got into that ward, or room.  I didn't even ***********.  What I've just told you is that the place where I saw her was near the maternity.  And I can give you an example concerning the distance that separated both of us --
Q.	I don't need -- 
A.	-- the distance (microphones overlapping) is -- it was the same as the distance that is separating me from the security officer.  
Q.	Where was this person hiding that you tell us about near maternity?  Where was it?  Simple question.  Can you answer it? 
A.	I have told you that it was in the hospitalisation ward of the surgery department.  There are rooms there, I think.  You have taken photographs of the place.  There are rooms and wards.  But for somebody who doesn't know the configuration of the area, it is difficult to describe the premises.  And, besides, I didn't tell her where I was, nor did she tell me where she was.  Do you think that she trusted me hundred percent?  She didn't have full confidence in me, and she didn't have any reason for this to be so.  
Q.	Now, you told us yesterday that you couldn't, for example, have spoken to -- and we're talking about -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Excuse me a moment.

Various lists.  I'm just checking I've got it right.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Number 7 I'm talking about, and you said you couldn't have seen her before the 4th of May.  You're very emphatic about that.  You may remember yesterday saying how, in fact, you were hiding and all the rest of it and that you saw her, it must have been after the 4th of May.  

So when -- when did you see HF, then, in her hiding place that she had the habit of staying in, which is in the hospitalisation ward?  Where -- when did you see her there?
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Headphones, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, perhaps if he removes his headphones, please.  It's just a short point. 

Your Honour may notice that I don't leap to my feet all the time, perhaps three or four times in the day.  May I express a concern about the number of times my learned friend, Mr. Hooper, doesn't so much ask a question as summarise a long comment.  Just a moment ago, Your Honour may recall that my learned friend, Mr. Hooper -- and one understands why he's done it, but it's not strictly proper cross-examination -- he summarised as a comment the suggestion that the witness was very emphatic about not seeing the witness until after the 4th of May.  And listening to the way Mr. Hooper dealt with that, it cannot have been for the benefit of the witness because it wasn't a question to the witness.  It seems to have been a comment directed for the attention of Your Honours.  

Now, I know that Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues are professional judges, but the number of times that Mr. Hooper does this, I respectfully submit, means that there is a danger that my learned friend's comments will start to influence the Court's mind as to what is and what is not quality evidence, what is and what is not emphatic on the part of the witness, and so on.  
I would invite my learned friend to stick to the usual rules within cross-examination, which is simply stated as question the witness rather than summarise what you may think the evidence has said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper's commentaries are not evidence and will not be so considered by the Chamber.  I, myself, on occasion have had some concerns about it because -- for that very reason.  I had, in fact, given Mr. Hooper the benefit of the doubt in the sense that it seemed to me to be an effort to shorten what might have been along the techniques of cross-examination.  But I think you should bear in mind the comment because it is true that your commentary is not evidence and will not be so considered.  What we are interested in is the answer given by the Accused -- by the witness.  I do apologise.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. Witness -- yes, can you put your -- 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you remember yesterday telling us how you could not possibly have met RJ until after the 4th of May?  That's number 6 -- sorry, number 7.  I'm sorry, number 7 on the list.  
A.	If I said that I did not meet her at the beginning of April, is there a problem with that?  There are other persons that I met while the genocide was raging on, that is, when the killings had intensified, and it is vis-à-vis those events that I -- I base myself.  I don't know, you know, where you -- I don't know what you want.  Do you want me to contradict something vis-à-vis number 6?  Or, I don't really know what is your point. 
Q.	Stop worrying about what I want.  Just answer the questions.  I'll ask the question again because you haven't answered that question.  Do you remember saying yesterday, and I suggest emphatically, clearly, that you had not meant -- met number 7 until at least the 4th of May?  Do you remember saying that?  Do you remember telling us that you couldn't see her before then?  
A.	And yet I told you that the room in which she was was opposite the building in which I was.  I am telling you that I met her in May.  I have said that it is possible that I might have seen her at that time in month, but I must acknowledge that we were not always together.  Or, do you want to refute the fact that I met her at that time?  
Q.	Do you remember telling us yesterday that you could not possibly have met her before the 4th of May and explaining to us why that was?  Can you remember saying that just yesterday, yes or no? 
A.	I do state that I even gave a reason explaining why the situation was as it was, so please remind me of the reason that I gave.  I can no longer remember it.  
Q.	Let's come back to H -- let's come back to number 6 on the list in front of you.  You met her twice.  What were the circumstances?  What was going on when you met her?  Was anything in particular going on when you met her? 
A.	Regarding the first occasion during the genocide, we -- people were being abducted.  This was the topic of discussions amongst many people who were hiding.  We discussed the -- this case when people, like Rwamakuba and the others, were abducting people or taking people away.  There was another occasion when the government came to visit this situation, and the next day many people were abducted.  And this was due to the sensitisation campaign carried out by the government, you know, amongst people who were youths.  So such were the kinds of situations that we talked about during that period who were at that location. 
Q.	Now, would you like to answer the question.  When and where did you first see that person, and what, if anything, was going on at the time? 
A.	When I saw her, the acts of genocide were being committed.  Do you want to claim the contrary, Counsel?  
Q.	Will you please answer the question, not for me, but for the Judges. 

Are you going to answer the question? 
A.	I thought I had already answered the question.  I thought it was the comments that you were making.  If you want me to give the same answer, I will do so.  
Q.	That witness told us that she hadn't seen you since the war.  Is that right? 
A.	If she made that statement, well, that is up to her.  What I'm saying, that I met her where she was hiding at the hospital.  
Q.	Listen to the question.  
A.	This must be something that she must have forgotten. 
Q.	No, listen to the question.  She -- she said that she hadn't seen you since the war, not during the war, after the war.  She hadn't seen you since.  Is that right? 
A.	Oh, now I understand.  You're saying that she stated that she never saw me again.  I don't know if she has any interest in this case.  I don't know.  What I am saying is that this person came to work in that place.  I, myself, I worked for at least three years in the same place.  I think we used to see each other.  I mean, if it's just a matter of seeing somebody -- because I don't agree with her statement because at least I was working where she was working after the war for at least three years.  
Q.	Let's go back to the -- to the statements and finish those off.  We were dealing with them yesterday, and we'd got to what was effectively your -- your eighth statement overall, dated the 5th of June, 2001.  And unless you want to see it, I'm going to deal with it fairly quickly. 

Just before I come to that, you remember we'd spoke about your evidence in the Twagirayezu case yesterday?  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I remember.  
Q.	Is it right that you claimed damages against him for 4 million francs?  Is that right? 
A.	I remember that at a certain point in time the lawyers who were holding brief for the third party have talked about that issue of claims.  But I'm not the only person who was making claims in that matter.  There were many people who did the same.  
Q.	Now, the statement of the 5th of June, '01, which is our page 51 and 52, deals with essentially a priest called the Reverend Kabalira, Martin.  And I'm not going to go into detail about that, but I see that you mention in it very particular details of times and dates, and also you spoke of the specific killing of two young persons by soldiers and the killing of another person by a soldier in that statement, specific reference to specific events.  I also see that it's your friend, as you describe him, Twagirayezu, Appolinaire, who first told you about Father Martin.  And do you accept that those things are said by you in the statement? 
A.	Yes, I acknowledge that. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  That's dealt with that very quickly, you see?  

Now, I'm going to move next to the statement of the 28th of June, 2001.  And, again, I'll deal with this briefly.  

Now, this is a statement -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Counsel Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
You're most welcome. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	This is a statement, and I'm looking at page XV63, and at the bottom that relates to a separate and side issue, though perhaps not without some relevance, concerning an investigator or investigators for Kanyabashi, and it's essentially a complaint by you where you say that they seem to be asking just for the good things about Kanyabashi.  That seems to be the complaint.  And towards the end you say this:  "After I'd met this group of investigators --" this is seven lines from the end of that page XV63, in English.  "After I'd met this group of investigators, ************************************ later talked to me about the same people and the fact that they, too, had been approached and interviewed by this group, wanting to know the good things Kanyabashi did during genocide.  I remember ************************************ --" and you then name number 7 on the list, if you look at your list; number 9 on the list, if you look at the list; and number 6 on the list.  

So it would seem shortly after this incident -- I should add, you name those three and you also say "among others," which suggests, does it not, that there was -- it would seem quite a -- a quick telegraph, as it were, between -- between you -- between all of you here?  Do you agree it may perhaps suggest a closer association than you've indicated in your evidence so far? 
A.	That is not true.  You know, often people make mistakes and they say that there is -- there is an association.  Is it we?  Are we the ones who started this case?  Unless you do not want there to be any witnesses.  You know, if we're talking about survivors who are on my hill, these people come from everywhere, from all over.  These are people who apparently do not know each other and who come from all corners of the country.  But if at some point in time they need to talk about the events, it does not signify that there is an association or that they have any links between them.  I would like the 
	Trial Chamber to understand this.  This is not the case.  These are people who live here and there, but there is no association between anyone, as you are trying to suggest there is. 
Q.	Then you made a statement on the 5th of December, 2001, at our XV69, which refers to particular people that you'd earlier spoken about and is a clarificatory statement, in its way, again dealing with specific -- specific events.  

It's right to say that at no time in any of these statements do you ever make an allegation that a doctor participated directly in killings within the hospital.  Is that right? 
A.	What I can say is this:  I never said that a doctor personally killed anyone, unless I said it in my dreams.  However, I do not recall having ever said something like that.  If that has been written down somewhere, please read it out to me, and I will explain.  Because sometimes people take down statements and might make errors in doing so.  But I know that I have not said at any time that a doctor personally killed anyone.  
Q.	You also speak of specific examples of people being killed, some of which you witness and some of which you've heard from others.  And you make specific reference to those people, and where you can, you name them.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Most of the time as I walked about, I observed things.  I mean that where I saw people being killed, I saw on some occasions how this was happening.  In addition, it is normal for someone else to tell me what happened.  I do not see what the difficulty in that is.  I would like you to understand it from that point of view.  I witnessed some events.  And, as to the others, I heard about them from other people who told me about them. 
Q.	And at no time in that long list of statements and references by you over many years is there any reference to Dr. André Rwamakuba nor of any incident where you yourself were on the point of people taken away by him to be killed.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Look, you cannot use the pretext that I did not mention Rwamakuba on several occasions.  To date, the information I have given are not exhaustive insofar as Rwamakuba is concerned.  Even today there could be supplementary information incriminating him that might come to light.  If we start the trial today, you will observe that there are allegations that will incriminate him.  You say that I have never put forth any arguments to the -- to say that Rwamakuba committed crimes.  I have told you, of course, that I have given some statements and that I had made mistake (sic) and that I had given these statements for Rekeraho.  But it does not signify that Rwamakuba himself committed no crimes.  I told you that there was a link between Rwamakuba and Rekeraho. 
Q.	We'll come back to that.  Now, the -- the commander of soldiers, the military commander for the district that we're concerned with here, was Colonel Tharcisse Muvunyi; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  I think that you have conducted your own investigations and you know full well that it is he. 
Q.	And that's -- just answer the question, please, and we'll get on much quicker -- M-U-V-U-N-Y-I, and "Tharcisse" is T-H-A-R-C-I-S-S-E. 

Was he there when the government delegation came? 
A.	Even if I didn't mention the name of -- the names of everyone who was present, he was, of course, present as the military commander of the region.  Even the head of the gendarmerie was there.  All the authorities were there, so Muvunyi had to be present.  Do you not think that it is normal for it -- it would have been normal for Muvunyi to be there? 
Q.	And I'm looking at your -- a transcript of your evidence in the Muvunyi case on the 16th of May, 
	17th of May, and 18th of May, maybe the 19th of May, over which days you gave evidence.  And I'll just very briefly refer to what you say.  You say, "In the month of May officials came, some of whom were soldiers, including their commander of -- or, their chief."  

And that was part of the government visit.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  I never denied that these civilian authorities were accompanied by military authorities. 
Q.	Now, how did you know that that was Tharcisse Muvunyi? 
A.	All I can say is that I would like one thing to be clear.  I knew Tharcisse Muvunyi even before the genocide, but in this delegation of 70 people that I told you about, I did not see him inside the group because there were very many people.  However, what I can see is that they were soldiers.  And based on my experience when such authorities come, it is normal for him to be there, to be amongst them.  I would also like to add that, in view of the prevailing situation, I could not be close to them.  I was hiding.  
Q.	I'm sorry.  You just said you knew Colonel Muvunyi before.  Can I just ask you this:  In the statement we dealt with yesterday, dated the 7th of December, 2001, at page 4, our XV15, six lines from the bottom, I'll read you what you've written in 2001.  "Sometime in mid-May, Colonel Muvunyi, the commander of ESO, came to the hospital.  I did not know him before.  He was pointed out to me *************************.  He was with many soldiers from ESO, and he directed that all the Tutsi patients and refugees should be cleared out of the hospital."  

Now, did you know him before or did you not know him before?  Was he pointed out to you ************* or was he not pointed out to you *************?" 
A.	Can I answer?  
Q.	Well, it was a question.  The question was, Did you know him before?  Or is your answer in your statement the correct answer?  Was he pointed out to you, or is your answer that you didn't see him but assumed he was there correct?  Which is it? 
A.	When I say that I knew him even before the war, let us start with the month of April.  The month of April is before the war.  Please understand that I couldn't stand just in front of him like that.  I knew him by sight.  When I said that it is *************** who pointed him out to me, even when he arrived at the time, it is ***************** who reminded me that that was Muvunyi.  I do not know whether that is clear.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  But what is clear is your answer a moment ago that you did not, in fact, yourself see Muvunyi but you assumed he was there because there were soldiers there.  Is that -- is that right?  Is that the position?  
A.	No, that is not my position.  I said that there was a military commander with his escort.  You must understand that this military commander was indeed Muvunyi.  I saw him, but I was not near him.  I didn't go near him.  
Q.	Your answer, page 20 on 16th of May, "When I was -- when I saw him, he was standing near the operating room, and I was some 12 steps away."  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is clear.  I told you that I couldn't put my life in danger by approaching him or going near him.  It was during the genocide.  I do not know whether -- why Defence counsel does not understand.  

Let me ask you a question, then:  How many people are you defending here?  Are you defending Muvunyi or are you defending Rwamakuba? 
Q.	Well, certainly your evidence today should be referred to those who are representing Mr. Muvunyi, but I am not.  

And you also say this, and I'll just read your answer:  "How did you identify the person as Muvunyi?"  And you've told us that you knew him.  This is your answer:  "One **************** was a member of Power, and so I would ask him who are these people who would come to the hospital; particularly I asked him who the soldiers were.  And I asked him what the soldiers wanted to do, and he told me that that person was Muvunyi and that he was the commander of the soldiers who were both within the hospital and those who were outside."  

Is that right? 
A.	I don't understand.  I don't know.  Are you making an appeal in the Muvunyi trial here?  What I can say is that I was present.  I was on the scene.  I do not know why you're asking me about the past.  All I said is that Muvunyi did come to the place.  As to the details, I do not think that they matter much.  I think that things occurred as they were taken down in the statement.  
Q.	And now we come to, in a way, a further statement dated the 8th of July --
 
MR. MORLEY:
May we have, for the record, the date of the transcript which was referred to and the page references? 
MR. HOOPER:
You'll find those on the transcript, as I read them.  I gave them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You didn't mention the year or the page. 
MR. HOOPER:
May 16th, 17th, 18th, and I believe 19th, 2005.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you have the page numbers? 
MR. HOOPER:
They were mainly page -- the references are 16th of May, page 20, 21 are the relevant pages. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And I'm reminded in that, that, of course, that evidence was only a few months ago, three months ago.  That's right, Mr. Witness, isn't it? 
A.	It's possible.  
Q.	"Irshook" (phonetic) means "it's possible," doesn't it?  Mr. Witness, it's possible that it was just three months ago in May, or is it a fact? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  
Q.	Now, can I come to your confirmation statement -- this is found at XV90 in our bundles, and it's dated the 8th of July, 2003 -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Chamber will be aware that the Defence is served -- this was only served on the Defence three weeks ago and creates a radical alteration in the basis of this evidence.  

It's a document which has -- appears in the -- in the bundle in French.  Have the Prosecution got a translation in English?
MR. MORLEY:
No.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can we tentatively produce one in those circumstances to fill the gap?  And I hope to facilitate the proceedings.  And I believe the Tribunal, in any event, has sufficient knowledge of the French language to rectify any mistakes that exist. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, this is a confirmation exercise, and we're familiar with what that means, Mr. Witness.  Essentially investigators come to see you.  And this would have been, in fact, two months before the first trial of this case was due to start, in September of 2003.  Now, just pausing there, you had been, up until the summer of 2003, an -- a redacted -- that is, you were a witness on the witness list under the pseudonym that you carry today of XV.  You were then removed from the witness list, and you were no longer on it when the trial took place.  ****************************************************************.  And then more recently you've been put on the list.  Can I ask you this:  How long have you been in Arusha this time? 
A.	Let's say that I have come to Arusha on two occasions, for the Muvunyi trial and for the Rwamakuba trial. 
Q.	Well, let's answer the question instead, much simpler.  How long have you been here this time? 
A.	I arrived here on the 19th. 
Q.	Nineteenth of August? 
A.	Yes, 19th of August. 
Q.	You get 20 dollars a day, is that right, in all found; is that right? 
A.	I have come to give testimony in this trial.  As to the dollars, that is not my concern.  If you want to give me dollars, give me dollars.  I won't say no. 
Q.	No criticism of that.  

Now, when you were here in May for Muvunyi, how long were you here for? 
A.	I don't remember.  I don't know.  You are talking about money.  I don't know why you're so keen on that.  I do not know whether in this trial we're concerned with what I'd receive as a daily stipend.  I have come here to assist the cause of justice.  As to the dollars, as to the stipend, I don't see the importance of that.  I didn't come here to earn a salary.  
Q.	Now, on the 8th of July, 2003, your statement of the 25th of November, 1997, is read to you, according to this document.  Do you dispute that or do you agree with what the official document shows? 
A.	Look, I do not have copies of all the documents that were read out to me.  If you want us to talk about this statement, then read it, read it out before the Trial Chamber.  I did not learn by heart all the statements.  And you must also (microphones overlapping) remember that I'm not educated.
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)  French one is the -- let me -- let me try and get this to you before we rise so you can at least glance at it before we resume.  But it was the one I showed you yesterday, and you -- you went through it in great detail, looking at all the signature, and you agreed that it was your statement.  But here it comes again, so you have it in mind.  This one's in French, and you sign it.  This was the statement that was taken on the 25th of November, 1977 -- 19 -- sorry, '97, and you signed it two days later and certified it.  And this is the statement that's read to you.  It's the one that refers to Rwamakuba from Sovu; the driver for the day, JB; the PARMEHUTU; MDR man; the Interahamwe leader. 

Now, that statement is read to you on the 8th of July, 2003, and you, according to the statement, confirm it, that is, you agree it.  And you're also asked if you want to correct anything, and you do.  You correct -- correct paragraph 9, the bit that deals with Rwamakuba.  And you say, "It should be Nkirwamakuba."  You add N-K-I to Rwamakuba instead of Rwamakuba, André. 

Now -- and then when we come to the body of the confirmation, we see there's no mention of André Rwamakuba trying to abduct you and you escaping the jaws of death.  None of that is here.  But for the very first time, there's a reference to André Rwamakuba as someone you knew as a student and who came to the hospital.  And we'll be going through that after the break.  There's nothing here about Rekeraho, is there, Mr. Witness?  Nothing about Rekeraho.  Why is that? 
A.	Look, I think you want to defend all the members of government.  What is crystal clear is that I do not know whether you are trying to defend all the members of the UN or all members of government.  

You talked of dollars a while ago.  I don't know whether you do get paid many dollars.  When I talked of Rwamakuba, I told you that I was mistaken.  I wanted to talk about the other person who was in the same party as they -- as them.  I know that this person is called  Emmanuel Rekeraho, and he is in prison.  

As to what I said in regard to André Rwamakuba, I think you are trying to confuse people.  You want that the crimes that he committed be forgotten.  That has nothing to do with it.  If you want to start another investigation, well, you can start.  You will conclude that everything I have said is true.  I know that you are defending your interests and that you are prepared to defend the interests of your client, or clients.  I know that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 10:30. 
MR. HOOPER:
It's a very convenient moment, thank you, Mr. President.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take a short recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1032H) 
(Pages 1 to 14 by Ann Burum)





(Court resumed at 1100H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can now resume our sitting.  
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, we were dealing with the witness confirmation of the 8th of July, 2003.  
Mr. Witness, you gave a long and lengthy reply.  You don't mention in your witness confirmation the name Rekeharo.  Do you agree?  
A.	What I would say is that you showed me the photograph of Mr. Rekeharo and I recognised him.  Do you want us to change something in the subject?  That man exists?  He is alive?  I don't know why you keep coming back to that person.  What I may add is that Rwamakuba was part of a government and did what everybody knows.  Now, what do you want to make of it?  Rekeharo did what he did and Rwamakuba did what he did, but I do not know what your point is.  I don't know what you want me to tell the Judges.  I don't know if you really succeed in exculpating your client, because you keep asking the same questions on the same event and if I'm the one who constitute a problem for you, you can put me aside and you continue with your proceedings.  But in any case you'll not succeed to exculpate him, because that is your intention. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you think it will be possible for you to just answer the questions?  Could you do that, just keep your answers to the point because we can get on much quicker.  Otherwise we will be here all today and into tomorrow.  The question is this, is it right when you saw the investigators and confirmed your statements of the 25th of November 1997, you made no mention to them of a man called Rekeharo?  Yes or no? 
A.	I think that question has to do with my testimony and it is connected with the utterances that I made concerning an individual, but I would say clearly that I had made a mistake and that it was rather Rekeharo.  What else do you want me to say?  Can one be more direct than this?  Probably, you can come up with other arguments, but I think I've already explained things.  There are certain points -- attributed certain facts and I gave information, particular information that concern a different individual.  I think I have explained this.  I don't know where you actually want to take us.  
Q.	Six years after making the statement in which you referred to the man by the name of Rwamakuba, when you are given the opportunity to correct it, you make no mention of Rekeharo.  Can you tell the Judges this?   When did you realise that the Rwamakuba you spoke about in your statement was in fact, Rekeharo?  When was that? 
A.	I told you that the person came to see me concerning that matter.  It wasn't a discussion concerning that fact.  Nobody had ever forced me to say anything whatsoever.  There is a Rwandan person who came to see me and I explained that I had made statements and that had given information concerning Rwamakuba, whereas, the person I meant was Rekeharo, a person who was very active while the government was in place.  Now, you are saying that I am delaying proceedings.  I think you, youself, have some responsibilty in this.  Let's talk about André Rwamakuba and I've said that there are statements that do not concern him, but there are others that concerned him.  Let's retain that there were statements that were made, but that does not concern him and I have explained this.  Otherwise, Mr Defence Counsel, I really don't have anymore, or other explanation to give on this subject.  I think I've already given enough explanation. 
Q.	When did you first realise the man you called Rwamakuba was, in fact, called Rekeharo?  When was that? 
A.	But do you think you can remember everything that you have to think about over a period of three years?  I will put back the question to you.  I didn't write anything, I don't have any document and you asked me a question as if one could remember everything that one would have said during a period of, at least, three years.  Are you in a position to do that yourself, Counsel, if you were to be asked to carry out such an exercise? 
Q.	Now, in July 2003, shortly before the first trial is due to start, we can see, I suggest, from this document, that you are now focused on André Rwamakuba, the Accused in this case.  Why is it that you did not tell the investigators in July 2003 that André Rwamakuba had in fact tried to kill you and you narrowly escaped death by running away?  Why didn't you mention that?  Do you understand the question?  Why didn't you mention that to the investigators?  Simple question, perhaps you can give us a straightforward answer? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I am answering questions for which everybody has an interest.  Now, he is asking me why I didn't explain one thing or the other.  Well, I would tell you that there are many things that happened and which concerns me one way or the other, but one cannot say everything all at the same time.  Can he show me a document where at any point in time I try to exculpate Rwamakuba.  This is the approach that we should use.  I don't think I am trying to make things difficult.  I am telling you that there are lots of things that happened and we talked about them when one remembers them and when one is opportune to talk about them again.  Otherwise show me a document where I exculpated Rwamakuba or where I contradicted myself. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Mr. Witness, yesterday, I suggested to you that making lengthy comments and arguements sometimes create reasons for additional questioning and makes the whole examination much longer.  I think things will get by much better if you try to understand the exact questions, which has been put to you and answer it in a brief and concise manner as possible.  Do you understand me?  
BY MR. HOOPER :  
Q.	And so following the confirmation statements, three years have passed -- two years have past, rather, you've been here for an unknown period of time in the Muvunyi case.  Again, you tried to say -- you didn't mention Rwamakuba at all in that trial.  That's right, isn't it?  You didn't mention Rwamakuba in that trial, you mentioned other people like Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, but you didn't mention André Rwamakuba in your evidence in the Muvunyi case.  Is that right? 
A.	Let's take it that I did not mention Rwamakuba's name.  How is that a problem?  We are dealing with the Muvunyi case, so where is the problem, and as you say, we are dealing with the Muvunyi case. 
Q.	Now, that's in May.  You came here on the 19th of July.  May I ask you this, has there been any way in that time that, in fact, you had been able one way or another to have some contact with other witnesses in this case, while you've been here in Arusha, all that time?  
A.	Are you talking about meeting those persons?  In what capacity would I have met them?  Were they judicial police officers?  Were they prosecutors?  I don't know in what capacity Counsel, I don't understand. 
Q.	With number 5 for example on the list? 
A.	What I can confirm is that she appeared in this case.  Certainly, there is a prosecutor who was responsible for interviewing her.  As far as I am concerned, I had someone else before me.  I don't quite know what you mean when you talk about meeting, because in that case, I will be in a better position to understand you.  I know that that person is present in this case and the person is involved in this case, but I don't know what you exactly mean by to meet, because it will be good if you were clear in the use of the term. 
Q.	Let me be clear.  Have you discussed with her in any way, this incident were you are taken -- you are not taken away, but you run for it and save your life --  with Rwamakuba.  Did you ever discuss that with her? 
A.	If I have understood the question well, you've asked me if I met her here in Arusha?  You know that is not possible.  Since we got here, I couldn't discuss the case with that person, because the proceedings are on.  However, we talked about this case before the proceedings and that is when the events were occurring or when things were being done.  It was only then that we discussed, but since we came here to Arusha, this hasn't been possible, because every person lives on his or her own side and there is no way we could discuss it.  What is certain is that I can't  refute the fact that we might have talked about this factor during the time of the events. 
Q.	Indeed, I understood your evidence was that you discussed it with her the next day.  Is that right?  The day after you escaped.  Is that right? 
A.	I'm not changing anything to what I've said.  It's precisely during the time of the genocide, that's the day following the day on which I was almost killed. 
Q.	You see the first time I understand anyone heard about any suggestion that you had been abducted or was in the process of being abducted by Rwamakuba, was when that person, that woman gave evidence before this Chamber last week on Thursday.  That would be the 25th.  Now, you made a will-say statement or a will-say statement was prepared as a result of a meeting between you and 
	Mr. Morley on the 26th.  I am going to refer to that and for that reason, as I understand it the Judges of this Chamber will have that will-say statement.  Is there a French translation of the will-say statement? 
MR. MORLEY:  
	No, there isn't.  
MR. HOOPER:   
	I'm afraid we haven't had time to prepare it.  Mr. Issa, can I please invite you to pass this document up?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I can say that the Judges do not have the will-say statement. 
MR. HOOPER:  
	Well, there are copies coming to you now.  I thought you did have it.  I am sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I'm sorry, we do have it, but Judge Kam notes that he hasn't got a French version.  
MR. HOOPER:  
	Which is a nuisance really, to put it mildly, and I'm sorry.  It's a significant document, in our submission, in the history of this witness.  Together with the Prosecution, we will undertake with their agreement to produce one by first thing this afternoon, with their help.  We can do half each, perhaps.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, this will-say statement is dated, as we can see, last Friday the 26th of August and Mr. Morley, very helpfully given details of how long he met you in the safe house between half past four and  six o'clock on the 25th.  It's dated the 26th, but he met you on the 25th with, of course, the assistance of an interpreter.  

	Now, I am going to come in detail to the 2003 confirmation document and the will say statement, but the significance of this moment, My Lord, might be this: that at paragragh six of your will-say statement and I'll read it through, you described going to the hospital on around the 22nd April.  And then it reads as follows:  "Within around a week or more, Rwamakuba came with Interahamwe, some soldiers, other doctors and with a man named Athanase.  XV  tried hiding, but was caught and led to a pickup truck and minivan.  As he approached the vehicles, he could see Rwamakuba from a distance of around four metres over a period of not less than three minutes, ordering Interahamwe to load Tutsis into the vehicles.  Rwamakuba was gesticulating with his hands and vociferous.  He was wearing civilian clothes including a jacket.  XV suddenly bolted and knowing the hospital, he was able to hide successfully."  

	I'll come back to all the matters in this document, but that was the first indication of this incident, other than the passing reference by witness number 5, on the same day.  It is right, Mr. Witness, this was the first time you mentioned this to anybody involved in the preparation of this case, or indeed, any other case anywhere.  That's right, isn't it?  It's your first reference anywhere, at any time, to the incident. 
A.	You are talking about a certain matter, but I don't know what you want.  The relevant case or matter is the one that is beforehand.  Would you have wanted me to talk about it in a case that didn't concern the individual in question?  There have been many cases that were tried in Rwanda.  I do not think that I committed any error for not having provided that information to anyone before.  The important thing is that I talked about it at a certain point in time. 
Q.	Now, in these two documents, you deal with your knowledge -- the basis of your knowledge of the man you identified as being present at the university hospital in April 1994.  At this point, I just want to look at what you said in the documents, the confirmation, that is and the will-say, and of course, your evidence, about your knowledge of him.  Now, in your confirmation statement of July 2003, when you first mentioned André Rwamakuba, you state that you knew him since and I quote, "1982 when he was a student at the faculty of medicine at the hospital ****************."  That's at paragraph one of your confirmation.  Do you accept that you said that, and is it true? 
A.	I said that I knew this gentleman even before he began his internship, he was still a student.  Do you agree that I knew him well before I even **********************? That's one point.  
Q.	I am asking you for answers.  In your will-say statement of just last Friday, you said that *******************************.  Is that correct? 
A.	I agree with you on that. 
Q.	And then you said this, you remembered Rwamakuba became a medical student for four years in 1982 and then did around two years internship at the hospital, leaving around 1988.  Did you say that? 
A.	I never said that he had done two years internship.  What I said and what I can confirm is that he did six years at the university insofar as the faculty of medicine is concerned, at least.  In the faculty of medicine, the course last six years.  What I can confirm is that he did his internship at the hospital, but you need six years to finish university and not four years, as you say. 
Q.	Now, before ************************************************************ for students you told us, that you ************************************************************.  There you said you never did that for Rwamakuba.  Do you remember saying that and is it true? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Now in your will-say statement, paragraph 3 you talked about starting work in 1981 and then in that context, remembering Rwamakuba as a student in 1982 and going on.  Will I be right in saying that your memory of Rwamakuba as reflected in this will-say statement is, of his being there when you *******************************************************************?  Is that right? 
A.	Counsel, I am not a device that tapes things.  If you would just please understand.  Since you started speaking here in this courtroom, if you were asked now, to say everything you said word for word, you wouldn't be able to do that.  You might say, give it an overview, but you cannot do it word for word.  I said that he carried out his studies at the university and after that he did his internship.  As to the final details, I cannot be as precise as you seem to wish. 
Q.	But at the time he was doing that, you had a -- you were working as (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) *************.  Is that right? 
MR. MORLEY: 
	Just a thought.  The occupation has gone in -- in open session.  I would ask that it is struck from the record, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Mr. Registrar, redaction. 
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Morley.  What's your answer please, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Did you hear that he was an employee in 1991 or whether he was an intern?  You, too, conduct investigations.  What were the results of your investigations?  Did you find any such thing?  Did you hear that he was employed by the hospital in 1981?  No. 
Q.	Now, you can answer questions when you want to in a very straightforward way, and I suggest when you don't want to, you can do that too.  Now, it's a straightforward question.  Is it right or not that when ****************************** -- sorry, I've fallen into that trap again, when ******************************* that André Rwamakuba was at that time, there, at the same time?  Is that right or wrong? 
A.	It's no use insisting on the formulation of one sentence or another.  It cannot be anything definite, you know.  I said from 1975 to 1982 and I said this is an estimate.  I think it was during that time I got to know him.  It's an estimate.  I hope it is clearer now. 
Q.	You see, when you gave your evidence, you said he was a medical student.  He attended the faculty from 1974.  He was six years there.  But that's a position that's changed, changed since just last Friday when you put him there between 1982 and 1988.  Evidence that is different also from your confirmation statement where you said that you knew him since 1982.  So, your confirmation statement and your will-say appear to be the same and then suddenly something changed.  Why did it change between Friday and your evidence?  Changed by almost 10 years.  Why is that?  
A.  	Do you want to take the will-say statement as a reference point?  I don't know what you mean.  If it suits you, well, go ahead.  You know what you are talking about.  I, for my part, I've always said the truth.  If by chance, we don't  agree, well, that's normal.  It can be understood. 
Q.	In your evidence, you said that André Rwamakuba took part in an incident in Xavier Ramana's time when Tutsis were chased away by Hutus, that was in 1973.  Do you remember saying that, yes or no? 
A.	Yes, I remember that.  
Q.	In 1973, there were ethnic problems in Rwanda.  That's accepted.  In your will-say you referred to Rwamakuba involved in a strike at the university, making anti-Tutsi speeches.  Is that right? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	Would you be surprised to hear that between 1970 and 1974,  André Rwamakuba was studying at the University of Louvain in Belgium?  Would that surprise you? 
A.	If you show evidence of this, I wouldn't be surprised.   It is possible that you just made that up, because that is your assertion without evidence. 
Q.	Well, that's your privilege and you are quite right.  I don't give evidence, so, you comment on it.  But André Rwamakuba was only at the University of Rwanda from 1975 to 1978.  What do you say to that? 
A.	What I say at the very least, is that, I am pleased that you admit that he actually set foot at the university during those years. 
Q.	And that he was a qualified doctor in 1978, working in Kibungo and then in Ruhengeri, miles away from Butare, and that in 1981 he went back to Louvain to do a postgraduate course for two years.  So, why did you put him there at the university in your confirmation and your will-say, very specifically in your will-say last Friday, between 1982 and 1988.  And why did you then change it when you gave your evidence? 
A.	Counsel, what did I change?  All I said was that he'd studied at the university.  If he didn't study at the university, it means that this is something that I must have dreamt of. 
Q.	How many -- there is only one university, isn't there, or there certainly was then, in the whole of Rwanda to study, and that was Butare?  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	That's right.  There was only one university in Rwanda. 
Q.	In your will-say statement, you said -- it says:  "He knows him well." That's you, "recalling he wears thick glasses."  What do you mean by thick glasses?  Do you mean the frames of the glasses were thick or the lenses of the glasses were thick?  What do you mean by "thick glasses"? 
A.	I remember that I talked about glasses.  As to the thickness, I cannot remember having given any such detail. 
Q.	Well, let me read it again.  It says, "He knows him well."  This is your will-say last Friday -- Thursday.  "He knows him well, recalling, he wears thick glasses."  What sort of glasses, then, do you say he wore? 
A.	All I confirmed is that he wears glasses.  If I make a mistake, then I am sorry for that.  But I do remember saying that he wears glasses.  No, I didn't give further details about these glasses.  
Q.	But you remember him wearing glass, and indeed in your evidence, you said, "I do remember he wore glasses."  And so the man you remember as Rwamakuba at the university, to the best of your memory, he wore glasses? 
A.	I remember that he wore glasses at the time. 
Q.	Well, that's a quite important identifying feature, isn't it?  So, the man you saw in the hospital, was he wearing glasses or not? 
A.	I didn't pay attention to the glasses at the time. 
Q.	But the one thing you said obviously to Mr. Morley, by way of description, and the one thing you said to this Court by way of description was that the man wore glasses.  That's part of your recognition process, isn't it?  People look quite different without their glasses on, don't they?  
A.	Yes, I did say that Rwamakuba wears glasses. 
Q.	Can I show you a photogragh, please?  Did he look like that? 
A.	It's been several years, Counsel, but I think that this person resembles Rwamakuba.  It's been 
	11 years.  Their government didn't last very long, and it's been a long time since I saw him last.  I cannot, therefore, be 100 percent certain that this is Rwamakuba, nor can I deny that, nor can I say that it is he. 
Q.	So you are going to hedge your bets, really, are you?  That may cause a problem in the interpretation.  So, you are going to sit on the fence on this?  You are going to go one way or the other? 
A.	Yes, I am sitting on the fence.  I've told you that it's been a long time.  Perhaps, his appearance has changed in the meantime.  You might know someone when he is 25 and not recognise him when he is 50. 
Q.	What about the glasses there?  Are those the sort of thick glasses that he may have worn that you saw him with?  What do you think? 
A.	Yes.  He's got thick glasses if you compare them with the sort of glasses I see here in this courtroom. 
Q.	Did you mean the lenses, the actual lenses of the glasses are thick?  
A.	The glasses are big, but at that time I couldn't take a photogragh of him or remember all the details about him.  My memory could not recall this.  I'm sorry, if I'm not able to give all the details concerning his appearance.
MR. HOOPER: 
	I wonder if I could have the photograph back.  I wonder if the registry could just mark this, at this stage, as the photograph that was shown to this witness or put an indices on it.  And if I could have the photograph back, please.  

	Earphones off, please, Mr. Witness.  I'm sorry to trouble you.  
MR. MORLEY:   
	My learned friend is quite right.  Earphones off.  

	Your Honour may recall my offering a week ago about the presence of photographs, photocopies being placed underneath the witness's noses whilst in court 11 years later.  On the last occasion, we had the benefit of my learned friend, Mr. Hooper, telling us who the photograph was of.  Are we going to get a similar piece of information or is this just a disembodied face that was shown around the court? 
MR. HOOPER:  
	I would prefer to reserve my position, but it would be clarified very shortly -- relatively shortly.  Certainly by tomorrow. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	So can I, in fact, go to -- sorry, Mr. Witness.  Thank you, very much.  I hope that satisfies my friend.

	Now, again, looking at the confirmation statement and the will-say statement, taking them together, your confirmation statement makes no reference at all of seeing that man you say is 
	André Rwamakuba at any rallies or at all at any time between being a student and the genocide.  Nothing in your confirmation statement at all about rallies or coming to the university or meeting that man or the cabaret bar, Huye stadium, MDR Power meetings, nothing at all.  Why didn't you mention it on your confirmation in July of 2003? 
A.	Look, Rwamakuba did not occupy my whole mind.  Don't you wonder why he was arrested and imprisoned if he is innocent?  This means that there is something that matters, don't you think?  Does this mean that if a  witness comes and gives a statement, which is not corroborated by other people, this witness would be lying?  
Q.	In part, he was arrested on an indictment and supporting material that contained your statement of André Rwamakuba, the man from Hewe.  You said in your evidence that you saw him at the end of 1993 -- or towards the end of 1993 in Butare involved in political meetings -- I'm not going to go into details, and specifically you refer to seeing him in January 1994.  Do you remember saying that, and is it true? 
A.	There is something I don't get.  When you started your investigations on him as a suspect and a member of the government of killers, I do not know whether you are trying to refute my arguments.  Are you trying to refute everything I've said in terms of my testimony?  Are you going to try to refute the other statements that will be given against your client?  
Q.	The question was, do you agree -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Mr. Witness, I had, on more than one occasion, used this formulation of suggesting to you that your testimony will go much smoother and would finish quicker if you confine yourself to answering the questions in a precise manner that the advocate put to you.  There is no -- absolutely no need to become argumentative with Counsel.  That's not really your function.  The prosecution is represented by very competent lawyers, and any argumentation that is necessary will come from that source.  As a witness, you should confine yourself to trying to understand the nature of the question that is being put to you and give a concise answer as possible.  Do you understand me?  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:  
	Yes, I understand, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	Can you confirm that your evidence is that the man you remember as a student, the man you remember as being at the hospital and who almost had you taken to your death, the man you did or did not speak of to others at the time, that man was a man you saw towards the end of '93 and, as you told us, in January 1994?  Can you confirm that, please?   Yes or no might do.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You've told us of seeing him with Kanyabashi.  What party did Kanyabashi belong to?  Do you know? 
A.	For a very long time, Kanyabashi was a member of the MDR Parmehutu.  When the MRND was installed, it was named MRND, and as you know, there were many poltical parties such as PSD.  Indeed, there was a merger of certain political parties, and the MDR Power was created.  He was a member of that party. 
Q.	Were you interested in politics?  Were you a member of any party yourself? 
A.	Yes, at that time, I was a member of a political party. 
Q.	Do you know which party that was? 
A.	I was a militant of the PSD party. 
Q.	I am not going to go into detail, because we can all look it up, It's easy, but let's start with your first statement of November 1997, where you said you were a member of the Parti libéral in 1993, for four months.  Is that right?  Were you a member of the Parti libéral in 1993 for four months, because that's the only reference to any political party that you belong to?   Is it right or wrong? 
A.	That is not true.  I wonder, I think there was a discussion on that subject, and it was concluded that that was wrong.  Before, all Rwandan citizens were members of the MRND party, that is, before the multi-party politics were ushered into the country. 
Q.	If I may, we don't need a lecture on the political history of Rwanda.  It's a straightforward question.  If you were a member of a political party, we would expect you to know which party you belong to.  Now, you've told us that you were a militant member of the PSD.  Now Kanyabashi was, in fact, a prominent member of the PSD, wasn't he? 
A.	Well, I know nothing of it.  Wherever we went to hold rallies, I never saw him attending those rallies.  He was, rather, of the MRND party.  Let's say he went to other parties to spy on them and to gather information here and there. 
Q.	Well, I am not bothered which party he belongs to, and we can all find out, because he is on trial here and has been for several years.  
	So, December of 2000, you made a statement where it is recorded you were a member of the 
	Parti libéral from 1992 to 1994.  That's another mistake, I suppose?  Is it? 
A.	That is another mistake. I have never been a member of the Parti libéral even if you carry out investigations on the matter, you realise that that is not true. 
Q.	2nd of February 2001, it's written "NA", not applicable.  We don't have a reference.  19th of April, 2001 -- let me just find out.  Forgive me, Mr. Witness, just taking a little moment.  19th of April, 2001, PSD ordinary member 1992 to 1994.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is not true.  I think that subject was discussed in the Muvunyi trial and, finally, it was realised that it was mistake.  I was a member of the PSD, and besides, I remember that one day I was hit by certain people because of my being a member of that political party.  
Q.  	The next two statements also have you as a member of that party for two years, and then on the 
	28th June 2001, you became an ordinary member of the party PSD 1993 to date.  Is that right, 1993 to date?  Well, until that time in 2001, is that right?  
A.	That is not correct.  I would refer, for instance, to the page before me.  There it is indicated that I am a member of the Liberal Party in 1993, and there it is also stated that I was a member of that party for four months.  I've never said that I was a member of the Parti libéral.  You probably can say that I had signed the document , but I didn't verify all of that.  I have said those who wrote down the statements that we gave, made mistakes.  They committed errors and we have a very patent example.  For instance, I have never stated at any point in time that I was a member of the 
	Parti libéral. 
Q.	All right.  Let's move away from Mr. Kanyabashi and the Parti libéral or the PSD.  In your evidence, January 1994, Huye Stadium, a rally, he addressed the rally you told us.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, he took part at that meeting, at that rally that was organised at the Huye stadium in Butare town. 
Q.	Would it surprise you to learn that Dr. André Rwamakuba was on a course at the university of Louvain - sorry, of Antwerp from September 1993 until his return in mid-March of 1994, that when you say you saw him in Butare with your own eyes, he was five or six thousand miles away?  Does that surprise you? 
A.	That wouldn't be a surprise to me.  He knows -- well, you know how you carried out your investigation.  This brings to mind what was being said in the Muvunyi trial of where his counsel was saying that from time to time, he went to Kigali and that he wasn't informed of the events that were taking place at l'Eso.  That is the same strategy, it's the same approach; you know, you are adopting.  Now, you can think whatever you want to think. 
Q.	Well, I'm not talking about Kigali, I'm talking about Belgium.  I am talking about six months in Belgium.  Now, if he wasn't there -- let's just assume for a moment he was in Belgium -- who is this man, this man who wore glasses, this man who was in Huye stadium addressing the crowd?  If you are telling the truth, who could it be if it wasn't André Rwamakuba?  Can you give us a helpful reply, one that will live with your conscience?  
A.  	I have stated that there was a rally that was organised by the MRND and MDR Power was in the process of being formed.  You are telling me that that individual was in Louvain?  You gave hours and dates.  I will state the contrary, and I will say he was present at that rally.  He wasn't alone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Mr. Witness, we are going to take a lunch break now.  I remind you as I've done on all other adjournments, that during this adjournment you are still a witness of the case and you are not to discuss this case or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:  
	Yes, I do.  
MR. PRESIDENT:   
	We want to resume at 1415.  We take a recess now. 
	(Court recessed at 1235)
(Pages 15 to 25 by Sheriffo Jammeh)



(Court resumed at 1436H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  Can I apologise for the late start, but we are now ready to resume.  

And, Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue.  You remain under the same oath that you took to tell the truth when you started giving your testimony.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, over the lunch adjournment I've made my own inquiries, as it were, and I'm going, on the basis of my inquiries, to assert to you that Kanyabashi was a member of the PSD.  Will you accept that?
A.	I do not agree with you inasmuch as I attended several meetings, took part in several meetings organised by that party.  On the death of Gatabazi, a figure head of the PSD party, I did not see Kanyabashi, so if he presents himself as a member of the PSD, it would be untrue, contrary to the facts. 
Q.	Right.  Well, the Prosecution can make their own inquiries in respect of that. 

Now, can we come, then, to the events of the 15th of May.  I suggest, in fact, Kambanda came to the university on the 14th of May.  Would you accept the 14th rather than the 15th?  
A.	Whether it be the 14th or the 15th matters little.  
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	What I am sure is that it was in the month of May.  Now, it might be the 14th or it could be the 15th, the exact date. 
Q.	And you've made reference, of course, to this official visit in various statements, as we've seen, and I'm not going to go through all that with you.  Now, my understanding of your evidence is that you claim to have seen the man you say was André Rwamakuba on two occasions during the genocide, and you told us in your evidence that you saw him the first time, as you put it, when the government delegation came, and the second when he came to -- and effectively tried to abduct you.  That's the way you put it when you were talking in your evidence-in-chief.  So we've got a visit by him on the 14th or the 15th, and you told us that the abduction was about -- something like two weeks after you first arrived at the hospital.  So there's the picture that we're dealing with. 

Now, can I come to what you said in your confirmation statement of July 2003?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Before my learned friend does so -- perhaps if the witness takes his headphones off.  

My learned friend's summary of the evidence-in-chief was substantially incomplete.  It is right to say that when the witness began his testimony in chief, he said, in describing the two occasions that he says he saw Rwamakuba, that there was the first occasion, which was the government delegation and the second occasion, which one might shortly put as the abduction, when the detail of his evidence-in-chief was developed, it was clear that the abduction was something which took place about two weeks after his arrival at the hospital.  His arrival at the hospital was around the 21st of April so that he was saying, as far as he could remember it, the abduction event was sometime around the beginning of May -- and Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues will recall my learned friend going on about the 4th of May quite a lot -- and then described the delegation event taking place on the 15th of May.  So whilst my learned friend is right in the way that he starts his summary, his summary is completely incomplete and doesn't reflect the way the evidence ended up.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, thank you.  I hope that's clarified it.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So let's go to your confirmation statement, and let me ask you a few things about it.  You say here -- or it says here, "The witness stated that he saw Rwamakuba in May accompanied by Interahamwe and soldiers who circulated in the hospital.  The witness stated that he saw Rwamakuba order the hospital workers 'to treat only the wounded soldiers and to leave the Tutsis to die.'  Rwamakuba was holding some rolled up sheets of paper." 

Let's deal with that, because I don't think we've heard about that in evidence.  When did that happen, do you say?  
A.	Personally, I don't remember having said that.  I never said that he was a chef de service, head of department, among the hospital authorities.  I don't think I said anything like that.  
Q.	Can I stop you, please.  
A.	If that was said, it would be a mistake. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I interrupt you?  There's been either misunderstanding or mistranslation.  I'm going to read it back again slowly so that it can be translated for you.  Please listen carefully.  "The witness stated that he saw Rwamakuba in May accompanied by Interahamwe and soldiers who circulated in the hospital.  The witness stated that he saw Rwamakuba order the hospital workers 'to treat only the wounded soldiers and to leave the Tutsis to die.'  Rwamakuba was holding some rolled up sheets of paper."  That's my translation.  I think it's -- I hope it's correct. 

Right.  And you say you didn't think you'd said that.  Whatever.  Having heard it again, my question was, we hadn't heard that in evidence.  Can you tell us about it, please? 
A.	To the best of my recollection, it was the heads of department that said such things, and I situated him with some Interahamwe when some people were taken away.  Moreover, in the course of the visit we've been talking about, he was in the company of heads of departments, chef de service, and they said that they should essentially dispense care to the wounded soldiers, but there were practically no more Tutsis, so to speak.  There were some here and there.  But I didn't ever say that he personally had said that.  But if others said such things, they should be asked to explain.  I personally did not ascribe these words to him.  Maybe others heard -- maybe others said it or others heard him say it.  I hear -- I have heard that he even tore drips away from patients, but I personally did not see that. 
Q.	Right.  So I can just put a line through that.  

Now, paragraph 5 of your confirmation, let me read that to you and read it slowly.  "The witness stated that on the 15th of May 1994, when he was hiding in the showers and toilets of the hospital ward of the university hospital, an Interahamwe, ***************, who came to see him in his -- in his hiding place, had informed him that the prime minister, Kambanda addressed the population of Butare to ask them if they were ready to follow him in his actions against the Tutsis, because he estimated that the work was going too slowly in Butare, and he was not satisfied with the Butare people." 

Now, I've read that.  I'm not concerned so much with what you were told Kambanda had said but, rather, with the fact that it's recorded here that this ********************** had come to tell you about Kambanda's speech on the 15th of May.  Now, we've heard quite a lot about it.  I don't need you to, with respect, to go into detail about it.  Just answer this please if you can:  Is that right, that it was a *****************, an Interahamwe, who came to tell you, in your hiding place, what had been said by the prime minister, Kambanda?  Is that right?  And it's capable, I think, of a yes and no -- or no.  It's up to you.  Is that right?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	At number 6 it states that you said that the prime minister visited the hospital with Dr. Gatera and Rwamakuba, who was himself accompanied by Interahamwe who were all armed with hoes.  The visit you specified had taken place before the prime minister had held his meeting referred to in the previous paragraph that we just dealt with.  Did you say that, and is it correct? 
A.	I did not say that the prime minister had made that speech after Gatera and Rwamakuba had passed with Interahamwe.  No, I don't remember having said that.  What I do remember is on the occasion of the visit, the heads of department, the deans, faculty deans and vice-deans, had come by and then went to hold a meeting -- a meeting devoted to the killings, to preparation -- preparing the killings.  Is it stated somewhere that Rwamakuba was armed with a hoe?  Anyway, if someone has written that, someone says I stated that, that is not correct.  I did not say that the Interahamwe accompanied the official delegation on its visit to the hospital. 
Q.	That's the point I was interested in, because it's right to say, is it not, that yesterday you made it clear that such riffraff couldn't associate with such higher ups as that delegation was composed of?  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, there were times they met to speak to them, but on that specific occasion, there was no need for them to be present.  They couldn't be seen by the sides of those figures, permanent figures.  They were undertaking a tour which was something more or less technical.  The presence of the Interahamwe was not necessary.  It's true that they would occasionally meet, but that was in order to give instructions and not on this specific occasion. 
Q.	Right.  
MR. HOOPER:
Now, the government tour itself, there were some photographs, if those could be distributed.  There's a set of three which we'll identify in a moment.  And these are printed out from a CD-ROM.  There's three there for the witness, and there's three each for each of the Judges.  Give it to the witness first.  Oh, sorry, there is one from the CD-ROM.  The rest are from our bundle.  

And, Mr. Issa, if you could let me have one set for myself eventually.  Sorry to drag you back.  I've given you them all.  Thank you very much.  One for the witness.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And looking at that, if we can indicate that the photograph, if we compare it to our plan, is taken, I suggest, from the -- basically the junction of the corner where the surgery abuts paediatrics.  The surgery, number 8, abuts on the paediatrics department on number 9.  
A.	I'm sorry, are they in the bundle?  
Q.	No.  They have just been distributed, and there's three photographs, and the first photograph is looking out across the grassed area, Mr. Witness, and looking at that, in the far right-hand corner there, in the building on the other side of the grass, is where your hiding place was; is that right?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	But your shower room hiding place didn't look out on this side, it looked out to the other side of the building; it looked out towards the other hospitalisation wards.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, I can see in the photograph the house -- the building following.  You pass the paediatrics, you come to the first building, that was the admissions hospitalisation ward.  That was the side of the noninfected injuries.  And then there is the corridor and the second part, and there's the nurses' office, and then the showers and toilets and the sterilisation room.  It really is quite clear on this photograph. 
Q.	Yes, thank you very much.  Now, in fact, just to identify the building in the photograph on the other side of the grassed area is, for the transcript, 11C.  That's photograph 1 with your hiding place on the right-hand side of that building but on the other side of the building that we can see in the photograph. 

Photograph 2, XV2, is taken from approximately the same position as the photograph in photograph 1, but it's looking much further to the photographer's right, down the covered corridor where we can see the church, the chapel, with its cross, and we can see again a covered walkway similar to the one in the foreground that stretches down and comes out at the top right of photograph 1, same grassed area, in other words.  

And photograph 3, can you help me with this, Mr. Witness?  Is this the same building but taken -- taken -- a picture taken from the same spot as the first two photographs but more to the photographer's left, so that we're looking at the building that we see in photograph 1 but the bit that joins the main corridor that runs from the administration to maternity?  Is that right or wrong?  Can you help me?  
A.	According to me, I can see number 1, two thousand -- 210, but the paediatrics portion that you're talking about is not visible.  This is another photograph, that is, photograph number 3 that shows the maternity where we see the corridor that leads to the surgery.  That is building B. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
So it is the building that is opposite the paediatrics unit.  And then when you're moving towards the maternity, I can also recognise photograph number 2, which shows the portion that is close to the chapel.  These are photographs that I think are useful.  As for photograph number 3, it, rather, seems to be showing the faculty of medicine that we talked about. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, let me just come back to photograph number 3 that I'm talking about at the moment and just help me with this -- just help me with this, please.  
A.	Number 3. 
Q.	These photographs were taken at different times, right, different days?  Is the photograph -- in -- in photograph 1, the building on the other side of the grass, which is ward 11C, it runs along -- and is it the same stretch of building as we see in photograph 3, yes or no, please? 
A.	Yes, it is the same building. 
Q.	Okay.  
A.	And it is the building on which was written "hospitalisation", and on the left side is the building of the hospitalisation for surgery. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, I think if we turn to photograph 2, it was your evidence that the delegation in May passed down the corridor, past that chapel, and then if we come to photograph 1, entered, is this right, entered at some point ward 11C or wards 11C?  Is that right or not? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  It would appear that you were present, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, on the 15th or 14th of May, whichever it was, doesn't matter, as you say, we're looking at your will-say -- or I'm looking at your will-say statement.  It reads -- and this was the statement you made, as it were, on the 26th of August, 25th, 26th, of this year -- that you recalled before you fled from the hospital that around the 15th of May the interim government toured the buildings.  "He watched them process from a distance of 50 metres."  Just pausing there, is that right?  Did you see them from 50 metres? 
A.	Well, it's visible.  If you try to measure the distance between chapel and the second building, you would have about 50 metres, that is, you can take about 50 steps.  You have just talked about metres.  I wonder if a step is the equivalent of a metre.  I'm talking about steps. 
Q.	It says here -- 
A.	I wonder if a step is equivalent to a metre.  I'm talking about steps. 
Q.	-- that -- sorry.  You say here in the will-say that Rwamakuba was among, and you number some people here, Kambanda you name, Karemera.  Which Karemera was that?  Do you know his first name? 
A.	His first name is Alphonse. 
Q.	And who was he? 
A.	He was the dean of the faculty of medicine. 
Q.	Now, we had a strange name written down, but there's a name that appears clearly in the will-say as Ngirumpatse.  Do you know his first name? 
A.	I think the name is Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, that's right.  And then in your evidence you mentioned Nzirorera.  That's Joseph Nzirorera; am I right? 
A.	I mentioned all of them as ministers of the government.  Those officials were members of the delegation that were visiting -- that was visiting the hospital at that time. 
Q.	And did you know that this trial was originally the case of a Karemera, a Ngirumpatse, a Nzirorera, and a Rwamakuba?  Did you know that? 
A.	I hear of the case referred to commonly as Government.  I don't know if that is the case. 
Q.	And the 26th or 25th of August is the first time you mention the names of Karemera, Ngirumpatse, and your evidence yesterday was the first time you mentioned the name of Nzirorera.  Can you confirm that, please? 
A.	Counsel, tell me, if I say that the person's name was Nzirorera, it's because I recall the name.  If elsewhere I gave a different name, it's because that is the name that came to mind.  Each time that we give explanations on the various points, you can always give additional information.  In any case, I would understand you if you said that Rwamakuba had nothing to do in this business at hand.  I'm talking about the case at hand. 
Q.	And in your evidence you told us that there were very many of them, 70, and you said this:  "I couldn't get all the names, but I must always mention André Rwamakuba", and you added, "He was, if my memory serves me correctly, minister of education."  Is it right that the first time you described André Rwamakuba as minister of education was in your evidence yesterday in this court? 
A.	You see, nobody had ever asked me a question to the fact that he was, first of all, a director and that he was subsequently appointed minister.  I am talking about this man as a person who was a doctor, and I have told you that since the government was formed, there were broadcasts over the radio.  You are putting the question to me as to -- to the effect that I didn't say earlier that he was minister in the government.  Do you want to claim the contrary?  Do you want to say that he wasn't a member of the government -- interim government that was Abatabazi?  
Q.	And was your friend Appolinaire Twagirayezu, known as Sukisa, was he there by your side pointing out and naming who these people were for you? 
A.	No, he wasn't in charge of protocol at the time.  This was a person who had a middle-level status, but he was, rather, on the side of the faculty of medicine, and he was preparing to welcome those officials.  Besides, the citizenry hadn't been invited.  There were Interahamwe who were normal workers but who were getting ready to welcome those officials.  And he talked to me about this when he came back from that meetings.  I think you should understand what I'm saying properly. 
Q.	You told us, didn't you, about how Muvunyi was there?  And I read that bit out to you this morning on page 20 on the 16th of May 2005.  I'm not going to repeat it.  "He told me that person was Muvunyi."  Is that right? 
A.	You should draw a distinction between the visit of the 15th.  At a certain point, Muvunyi came close to the plastic tents.  Apparently there was a meeting in town, and the préfet had decided that all the Tutsis had to be ordered to vacate the premises.  Those are two different occasions.  That is not what happened at that time, that is, at the time that those officials paid a visit to the hospital.  It was a different occasion that Muvunyi was standing near the plastic tents. 
Q.	And then, finally, we have what I call the -- the abduction or the attempted abduction.  And the first time, as we know, you mention that is in your will-say of last Friday.  And I'd just like to hand you again the map or plan of the hospital, and I'd like you to put a cross -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
We've all seen it.  This is all right.  It's just got 11A, 11B, and 11C written in the ward that -- oh, this is the one you've been using, very well.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	This is your plan, as it were, coming back to you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
We've all seen it, Issa.  It can go straight to the witness.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you just put a cross where the pickup or van -- the pickups and van were that you saw and which you narrowly escaped being put into.  

Right.  So we can have a look at that. 
A.	I'm done, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  While that's going round, Mr. Witness, I've forgotten to ask you or put to you one thing.  Would it surprise you to know that on the 14th of May when Kambanda came to the hospital, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was out of the country on government business?  Would that surprise you to learn that? 
A.	Listen, don't talk to me about missions.  I don't know if you were following closely or monitoring closely the missions that they undertook abroad.  Let's say that on that day that was the day of the government's visit.  I was not able to look at each and everyone in the face.  I only saw the backs of them.  Do you want to say that Kambanda came alone and that he alone represented the government?  
Q.	So you only saw the backs of them, did you?  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, I saw them from behind.  I must admit that when they came from the chapel, I was seeing them from the front. 
Q.	From the shower room?  
A.	Yes, I was in the shower room.  I could not look at them very well as if I were a photographer.  I merely threw a quick glance, since they were circulating, they were moving.  And as they went ahead, they continued on their way, and at a certain point I was seeing them from behind, from the back. 
Q.	And the shower room looks out not towards the chapel but to the other side of the building, doesn't it? 
A.	Yes, I acknowledge that that window is opposite the chapel.  I will point it out to you.  If you're coming from the chapel and you continue near the paediatrics, you could see and you pass on to the chapel. I've told you that as a witness, was at such a level that I was in a position to see what was happening outside.  I have given you specific, precise dates.  I think this is enough for you to -- this is enough to convince you to believe me.  First of all, when I looked through the window, I saw them, you know, from the front because they were coming towards my direction, and when they continued making their round, I was able to see them from behind or see the backs of them. 
Q.	And you told us you were suicidal at the time, you were devil-may-care about being seen.  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	No.  I wasn't afraid because those people had neither machetes nor guns, and then I didn't move close to them to greet them.  I was afraid.  Let's say I was scared, but I was able to look at them.  I was awaiting my death at any moment. 
Q.	Now, can I come to your will-say to the -- to the final paragraph in the will-say, paragraph 10.  And it's written here that XV, that's you, volunteered, when asked if there's anything else that he wants to add --  and then I'll read out part of what it says:  "Sometime last year a Rwandan called on XV saying he was working for the Tribunal and asking the question of whether XV had confused Rwamakuba with a certain Interahamwe leader named Rekeraho" with a question mark, concerning the spelling, as I understand it.  "He was shown a photo.  XV became confused and gave a statement.  He now thinks that the Rwandan was working with the Defence." 

So let me ask you this, first of all:  When you met this gentleman, at the time, who did you think he was working for?  
A.	I asked him questions.  I saw somebody who came alone.  I did not understand the purpose of his visit.  I was worried.  I was suspicious of him.  I didn't trust him and I asked him, "Are you a liar or are you an investigator?"  Finally, he said, "No.  I collaborate with the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but you shouldn't be scared.  Trust me."  Now, I do not know if he wrote down the purport (sic) of our interview.  I don't know if you have the notes, the written notes that that person took down, then you would be in a position to analyse what he wrote down and criticise what you will find in his notes, if you have any criticisms to make. 
Q.	Well, I'll come to that but -- 
A.	And -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	-- please read out to the Chamber what I said on that day. 
Q.	Well, we may do that.  Let's see where we're going.  In your will-say here it's recorded that, "He now thinks the Rwandan was working with the Defence."  Does that suggest that before, you didn't -- you thought he was working for the Prosecution?  Yes or no, please.  
A.	Yes, I think that person was working for the Defence for the Accused.  He did not reveal his identity for me to be able to know him well.  He had promised me that he was going to come back, but he never returned.  Only he told me that I should expect to be called to appear before the ICTR, and since I have come here, I've never seen him here, and I don't know where he works. 
Q.	It says here that you were shown -- I'm sorry, I lost my earpiece -- that you were shown a photo.  Were you shown a photo? 
A.	Yes, he did show me a small photograph, but one could see that he did not want to give me explanations so that I could know why he had come to see me.  By the way, our interview only lasted some minutes. 
Q.	What was the photograph of? 
A.	He found me where I was attending a meeting.  He was on board a vehicle, and he was accompanied by somebody who knew me.  So he started by telling me, "Can you give me information on Rwamakuba?"  I asked him who he was. 
Q.	I asked you a specific question.  You get like this when you don't want to answer questions, don't you?  Did he show you a photograph?  You said yes.  What was the photograph of? 
A.	He showed me his own photograph. 
Q.	What was it of? 
A.	He wanted me to trust him as a person who collaborates with the Tribunal. 
Q.	So the photo he showed you was his own photo, a picture of himself, was it? 
A.	Yes, it was his own photo. 
Q.	Let me just read what it says here.  "He was shown a photo.  XV became confused and gave a statement."  What does that mean?  Can you tell us?  
A.	That is how it happened.  He wrote down.  I think he covered a page and a half with what he wrote down, and he told me that if I were to be convened to appear before the Tribunal, we would meet again here.  I do not know if the information that I gave him served any purpose or was of any service to the Tribunal.  In any case, I believe that I would recognise him if I were to meet him here. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, was it a photograph like this, the one I'm holding?  
A.	Yes, the photo was on a card that looked like that one.  I did not pay attention to the colour of the card, but it would appear that it's a card that looks like the one you're showing me.  
Q.	And you've met loads of people, haven't you, over the last 11 years with cards like that?  They're identification cards for people who have some association with this institution or with the 
	United Nations.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I acknowledge that many NGO employees have such cards.  Why didn't he -- why did he ask me questions on Rwamakuba?  Now, coming back to the vehicle that is -- that he drove with -- that Sovu drove, Rekeraho, he also asked me questions.  It is on that occasion that I explained that I had committed an error and that I confused two people, that I confused Rekeraho with Rwamakuba.  It was on that occasion that I made it clear that I had made some errors. 
Q.	In your will-say statement it reads like this:  "XV volunteered, when asked if there is anything else he wants to add, that --" and there's various things, "XV recalls Rekeraho was present at some point at the hospital, perhaps the day after Rwamakuba had been present and believes --" and you then name -- you then name the lady who, on your -- which I believe is number 5, you give a name.  You give her name and later in the will-say some more detail.  You believe that lady and other refugees are also present.  Just pause there now.  

So you of your own -- without being asked anything about Rekeraho, when you were being seen by Mr. Morley, suddenly said to him or said to him something about Rekeraho in this way.  That was the day that that person that you name here identified a picture of Rekeraho as being Rwamakuba.  Did you know she'd made that identification?  Did you know that?  
A.	No.  It is true that Prosecutor Morley came to coach -- or to prepare me.  This is no secret to anyone.  He told me that I was going to come and give testimony before the Tribunal the following week.  And since he had talked to that person who said he was collaborating with the Tribunal, instead of being taken by surprise, I preferred to talk about it to that person before coming here before the 
	Trial Chamber.  I wonder if it is that person who gave you the document. 
Q.	I'm afraid you lost me on that, but which person?
MR. MORLEY: 
Perhaps if the witness might take his earphones off for a moment.  

A small point of inaccuracy.  The Witness GIO was shown the photographs, Your Honour and 
Your Honour's colleagues remember, not on the 25th but on the 23rd.  My learned friend a moment ago recalled for the Court that the photographs were shown that day, that's the Thursday the 25th.  They were shown, as I recall it, on Tuesday the 23rd.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So over those two days, did you get to hear -- I'm sorry, I'll say it again.  Over the -- we've just been told by Mr. Morley that, in fact, that person, number 5, identified the photograph here in the court of Rekeraho as being Rwamakuba on the 23rd.  So did you, between the 23rd and seeing Mr. Morley, get to hear of that?  Is that what this is all about? 
A.	I was not informed of that.  I never had any discussion with number 5.  We have not met.  In the meantime, you know, when a witness leaves, he doesn't come back to where the others are.  
Q.	Now, that -- that person you met in Butare who showed you a photograph of himself and at some point you become confused, in fact, he saw you twice, didn't he?  He saw you, first of all, on the 16th of December 2003 for a short moment, and then he came back and had a much longer chat with you at a meeting held at the Hotel Credo in comfortable, open conditions on the 26th of December 2003.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	And while you were talking, is it right that he was keeping, as far as you could tell, a note of what was being said by you? 
A.	If I remember correctly, he did note -- write down everything I was saying, took notes of everything I was saying. 
Q.	And did you then sign his notebook? 
A.	Yes, I did sign. 
Q.	Now, what you told him, did you, in fact -- do you remember, did you tell him quite a lot of detail about your history, your personal details, and the difficulties you had faced during the genocide?  Do you remember telling him that? 
A.	In any case, you have that all before your eyes.  It is written in a document you have before you. 
Q.	Yes, but I'm asking you about it.  It's your evidence that matters.  So come back to my question.  Do you remember telling him, indeed, quite a long history about yourself?  Do you remember that? 
A.	As on other occasions when I had to give evidence, when he put questions to me on what happened to me, I answered his questions.  I don't know what events you're referring to.  I know he put questions to me regarding Habyarimana -- President Habyarimana's plane crash.  If you see all those details in a document, it's because I answered his questions -- 
Q.	Well, let me ask you -- 
A.	-- and made that statement. 
Q.	Well, let me ask you questions and see if you remember whether you can confirm or deny saying things to him, all right?  Do you remember -- well, you remember taking about the plane that killed 
	President Habyarimana on April the 6th.  Do you remember telling him about events in your neighbourhood, roadblocks?  Do you remember telling him about that? 
A.	I told you that when I was speaking, he was taking notes, but I am not a recording machine.  All I know is that I gave him information that he wrote down, took note of. 
Q.	All right.  Well, I'm just trying to jog your memory, and let me -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel.  Sorry. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me jog your memory with some features.  
MR. MORLEY: 
This is the problem.  I'm on my feet again.  A matter of law arises, Your Honour.  It may take a few minutes to sort out, and maybe it's a convenient opportunity for the witness to have a coffee break.  
MR. HOOPER: 
May I disagree with Mr. Morley?  I don't think it would take very long at this stage at all.  I'm putting matters -- he's still got his -- can he remove his earphones, please. 

Witness, can you take your earphones off, please?  

I'm putting prior statements that I allege have been said by this witness, and he can agree them or disagree with them.  I'm not proposing at this stage to put any document in.  As and when that arises, there may be a point of law. 
MR. MORLEY: 
My learned friend and I think alike, which doesn't surprise me.  There is a very real issue which may arise before Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues about the provenance of notes taken by an investigator working on behalf of the Defence, supposedly, on the 26th of December of 2003.  If I address Your Honour further, is Your Honour comfortable with the witness staying in the witness box at the moment?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry, I just feel this is a premature application that just is taking time, precious time.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm not surprised my learned friend doesn't want me to put down the marker now.  I've waited until such time as he started to say that he was going to jog the witness's memory from the notes, and that is where we get into trouble.  Now, may I just inquire of Your Honour, before my learned friend gets on his feet again for the third time, whether Your Honour is happy for the witness to remain in court?  That's the first question for Your Honour, in my respectful submission. 
(Pages 26 to 37 by Sherri Knox)






1545H 
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry, Mr. President.  I just point out, at this stage I have got instructions and I am putting questions on those instructions. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness is making gestures in your direction, apparently, Mr. President.  I am sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We notice, but his earphone is not on yet.  

Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Please, forgive me, Mr. President, but I should beg the Bench's permission to go to the lavatory.  Please excuse me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Permission is granted.  
MR. MORLEY:  
Seems to have been a more eloquent submission than mine.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, (inaudible) is more successful than yours is going to be.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour hasn't heard it yet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
I have been waiting to see where we might go with the interviewer's notes, which were helpfully disclosed to me yesterday over lunch.  And may I, at this stage, as it were, put down a marker.  It's my respectful submission that these notes are not admissible in evidence.
MR. HOOPER:
May I interrupt my friend.  
MR. MORLEY:
Please, Mr. Hooper, let me develop the point.  
MR. HOOPER:
May I, please, interrupt?  
MR. MORLEY:
It's the fifth time you're on your feet.   
MR. HOOPER:
May I interrupt?  I am not putting in the notes, and the Tribunal need not be preoccupied by a marker.  At the moment it is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. You see, Mr. Morley.  That's what we thought why this submission was not going to be successful.  We thought that from what you said, your application was premature.  And we thought that there was nothing wrong with putting an alleged prior statement to the witness for him to answer about it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, what brought me to my feet was the comment that he is going to jog the witness's memory.  Now, the difficulty is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that's putting a prior statement to the witness (inaudible).
MR. MORLEY:
My concern for the Court is that what my learned friend has may not amount to an admissible prior statement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll get that answer when the witness denies it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Once -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a question of fact involved here which must first be determined on the witness's testimony. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, I agree. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we have not reached that stage yet.  
MR. MORLEY:
But when my learned friends starts, he is going to jog the witness's memory so that the witness is going to be led through cross-examination on what is potentially an inadmissible prior statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, this is cross-examination. 
MR. MORLEY:
But the difficulty is that while my learned friend will cross-examine, the import of the cross-examination will be to inform Your Honour, and Your Honour's colleagues, of the existence of potential prior inconsistencies.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper's questions are now testimony.  If the witness has answered the testimony --
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  The reason why I am putting down a marker at this stage is because when Mr. Hooper begins by saying he is going to jog the witness's memory with the notes which it said were taken, then it seems inevitable that the question of the provenance of those notes is likely to float before the Court, and there are some real concerns that the Prosecution have about those notes.  And I am simply on my feet at this stage to alert Your Honour to the blurred line which is likely to emerge between questions which my learned friend asks, based on what he has in his hands, which he says should jog the witness's memory, and answers that the witness gives.  

The reality is that we are likely to end up in a very blurred situation where my learned friend is challenging the witness with the use of the notes.  And the difficulty is, a challenge (sic) with the use of the notes is to be challenged.  And I am simply putting a marker down at this stage so that no one is taken by surprise if this matter develops further.  There are a large number of concerns about the notes, which I won't rehearse at this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you for the notification.  We won't stop the examination at this stage.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, do you remember sitting down with this gentleman -- I think you have told us that -- in the Hotel Credo, and I was beginning to ask you about what I suggest you discussed.  And I am asking you these questions, and you can tell me if you agree it or disagree it.  And we have spoken about the plane crash.  I am not going to go through it all.  In fact, it seems quite a long discussion you had, not just a few minutes on that occasion.  Would I be right in saying you spoke to him for about an hour and a half on the 26th of December?  Just a few minutes on the first occasion, and then when you met at the Hotel Credo about an hour and a half you were together.  Isn't that right?  
A.	In any case, what we do agree on is that I spoke with that man.  As to the duration, I really can't say anything on that score. 
Q.	All right.  All right.  And do you remember telling him about, for example, that you got ********************?  It was signed by various people and calling you to go work, as a result of which you went to work.  Can you remember talking about that, for example?  
A.	Even if I hadn't given that person that item of information, I know that I have mentioned it several times in the course of my statements. 
Q.	All right.  Fair enough.  Do you remember telling him that the route that you normally took, the ESO route, was closed and that you went by a little dirt road between Shishoza (phonetic) -- the land of baskets, I understand -- going towards the faculty of medicine, and that you went that way in order to reach the town.  Do you remember telling him that detail? 
A.	I don't remember that.  I don't remember having stated that, even in other statements I have made. 
Q.	But is it true? 
A.	No, it is not true.  You mean -- you are referring to the genocide that -- the time of the genocide or before the genocide, because there were roadblocks?  Which period are -- which moment are you referring to?  In any case, I never discussed -- mentioned that to that person. 
Q.	Well, all right.  In answer to your first question, I am talking of the period between the death of Habyarimana and the start of the genocide in Butare, the period between the 7th and the -- whatever it was, 19th of April.  That's the period I am talking about.  

I'm asking you, is it right that in that time because there were roadblocks and roads were closed, that you went on a little side track?  Can you remember telling him that, in order to get to town? 
A.	I should like to say that I never went to town after the president's plane crash.  I remember once I went in a vehicle from my place of work.  But the situation was beginning to degenerate, but I never could move by foot.  There was a period preceding the massacres, people who had -- would hold small meetings here and there trying to perceive what would occur, what would unfold.  But what you have just said to -- I think, it's probably the person taking notes that included that item of information. 
Q.	All right.  Can you remember telling him that at one point a soldier who saw that your identity and your card was Tutsi had said to you to go and change your ethnic group?  You also refused to give that soldier your radio, and that soldier was afraid to kill you because he could see you worked at the hospital near the ESO.  Is that true, any of that? 
A.	There is something I must explain.  There was one time, it was a Saturday, the genocide was being prepared, but hadn't yet begun.  And you have just said that I met him at the ESO.  It wasn't at the ESO it was in the wood below the hospital.  I remember I met a soldier in the woods below the hospital.  Yes, that did happen, I remember.  I have even discussed it with other people.  If I spoke to him about it, well, then, that's -- was the way it was, but it was a wood below -- in the woods below the hospital and not at the ESO.  
Q.	I didn't say it was, and that was either a mistranslation, a misinterpretation, or you are not listening, perhaps, as carefully as I'd like.  Do you remember telling that man that the first Tutsi refugees coming from Kigali had been killed in Mukura forest and that their bodies were taken to the hospital, that you thought it was the prisoners from the local Karubunda prison who buried the bodies?  Do remember telling him that?  Yes or no will do.  
A.	Yes, I acknowledge having said that to them -- to others.  I had a cover session with him.  I think I certainly talked about those events because I talked about them to other persons as well.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Do you remember telling him that about the 18th of April you learnt that Professor Karenzi had been killed in front of the Faucon, yes, or no?  
A.	Did you find that information in the statement?  Then that is the case because I believe that on the other occasions I talked about it.  I talked about the murder of that gentleman.  So that's reality, and that is how it happened. 
Q.	So, first of all, it's true, and secondly, you think you did talk about it.  Is that right; yes or no, please?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you tell him about circumstances of the death of the queen mother, Rosalie Gicanda, that you had seen a Cabriolette Hilux, that your brother who was hiding in a forest near the Dancing, at Kanyabashi's nightclub.  It seemed that they had been taken out of the car, laid on the ground and shot.  First of all, is that true and, secondly, did you discuss that or tell him that?  
A.	I don't quite recall that, but what I would like to repeat is that I certainly talked about it to other persons because these are events that occurred at a certain point in that locality; and as I have talked about it while I was with others, I am not sure that we discussed these same events.  I cannot confirm it.  
Q.	I am jumping a bit.  Can you remember telling him about how you -- you escaped from the hospital or was helped -- you were helped to flee by your relative there who showed you a vehicle which was driven by a Zairian chauffeur named Billoz, B-I-L-L-O-Z, who currently works at the KSP?  Is it true?  Did you say it?  
A.	I don't recollect the contents of that conversation, but you can refer to that document.  I talked to -- I talked about a person who worked at -- you are talking about a person who worked at KSP who helped me to flee.  You talked about a driver.  The fact is there is a driver who is of Zairian nationality who was driving an ambulance while I was in flight.  The ambulance -- and I am referring to the ambulance in which I was.  So, there was a driver, but there were also doctors.  That I agree. 
Q.	These are really simple questions, I hope.  Do you remember telling him -- and I am jumping again -- that when you got to the place of safety it was your wife who showed you a ladder which could be used to go into the ceiling?  Is that true, and did you discuss it? 
A.	I will repeat, once again, that I do not recollect the content of our conversation.  I did not have any copies of what is in the document and that contained our conversation.  I didn't -- I wasn't availed of a copy, but I must repeat that these are true facts and events that took place at a certain point in time, and it is quite possible that we talked about them just outside -- talked about them to other people, often. 
Q.	Is it true that Interahamwes came to loot the house you were in and found you there; yes or no? 
A.	I do not quite recall.  At what location did that happen, Counsel?  It's a clarification I am seeking. 
Q.	Well, towards the end of things, when you were hidden, hiding in a house, the house that your relative left you in with his domestic, a Hutu girl, with 3,000 Rwandan francs, the soldiers guarding the house.  When the fighting became heavy the soldiers left and the Interahamwe turned up to loot it and found you there, and they made you go off with them, and you turned back.  Is that correct?  Is that true? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Did you tell him of Dr. Twagirayezu, that he was a surgeon, that he refused to treat the Tutsis and the Interahamwes came to take them, the Tutsis, to their death?  Is that true? 
A.	No, I don't remember talking to him about that.  I don't recollect.  Are you talking about the fact that he refused to treat the Tutsi and that the Interahamwe abducted them?  I don't remember having told him that. 
Q.	Is it true though? 
A.	No.  I never heard that, because if you refer to your other statements -- 
Q.	Did you discuss Dr. Gatera? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	Did you discuss Dr. André Rwamakuba with him? 
A.	He mentioned that, and I think I told him that at a certain point I had given information concerning Rekeraho, who was in detention, but that, unfortunately, I had given this information by making them think that information concerned Rwamakuba.  And it is on that occasion that you talked to me about the trial and said that I will be called sometime to appear before the Tribunal.  I think that is the occasion on which we talked about that.  
Q.	Now, this man you understood was working for the Defence, so for him to hear you say that, you hadn't meant to say Rwamakuba, that you had meant to say Rekeraho, that would have been very welcome news indeed to him, wouldn't it?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, comment.
MR. HOOPER:
It's a question, don't you agree?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	That man was working for the Defence.  For you to tell him, "It wasn't Rwamakuba I was talking about, but a man called Rekeraho," that would have been very interesting information.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, before the witness answers the question.  
MR. HOOPER: 
He still has his earphones on.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  Earphones off, please.  

That sort of question of the witness is, I respectfully submit, not proper because it's calling for the witness to give an opinion of what another person might do, and really, it's for the other person to say what that person would do, not for the witness to give an opinion.  It's a well-known rule.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It might also go to the witness's motive.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the microphone was not on.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It might also go to the witness's motive.  
MR. MORLEY:  
The witness's motive for what?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't know what his answer is going to be.  
MR. MORLEY:
But Your Honour must have a motive in mind if Your Honour says it goes to motive.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was overruling your submission that the question was improper and was giving you a reason why.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you tell what you now understand, or did then, a Defence investigator on behalf of a man called Rwamakuba, that you hadn't meant to say Rwamakuba, you had meant to say Rekeraho.  Do you agree that that would be a significant change in your story, and something that investigator would be obviously interested in?  What's your answer, please?  
A.	Probably this may surprise you, but well, he came and he proposed that we talk about a certain Rwamakuba, and reminded me that I had given testimony concerning that person, and I have told you that I tried to ask him questions because I did not trust that person. I did not have confidence in his (inaudible) and he showed me a card with a photograph.  I said what I said to him, and if you find a document where -- which says that I tried to exculpate Rwamakuba, you show me.  But I don't see anything surprising in this matter.  
Q.	Well, you are now avoiding the questions again, aren't you? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it's time for a short break.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well, thank you.  
(Court recessed from 1620H to 1640H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume now.  

Mr. Witness, are you ready?  
THE WITNESS:
Mm-hmm
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	 So, I have just been putting to you bits and pieces of this statement, and a bit of it you say you discussed and the rest of it you don't know, but it was true what was said, that you discussed it with other people.  And I came to the point, and I was asking you this, can you remember being asked, and you giving answers to questions concerning Dr. André Rwamakuba?  Yes or no, please.  
A.	Of whom are you speaking, Counsel?  Which person that you said questioned me?  
Q.	Do try and help us.  We are talking about the man you met at the Credo hotel in Butare and we have been talking about him for the past three-quarters of an hour and your questions -- his questions and your answers.  The man who showed you the photograph of himself, that man; the man who was writing down what you said and -- in a document that you signed.   
A.	But why are you afraid to mention that person's name?  Because, subsequently, I heard that people were looking for witnesses to exculpate Rwamakuba, and you sent them.  I think that you work with that person.  Can't you mention that person's name out loud?  State the name of that person.  I know that you know that person.  
Q.	That person works with me, and I am quite content that people know his name, but I am concerned that people like you may abuse that knowledge.  

Now, you, in fact, accept that you had a meeting with this man.  At the moment, his name is not relevant.  I have asked you, did you discuss Dr. André Rwamakuba, the Accused in this case, with that man; yes or no?  Can you answer a straight question with a straight answer? 
A.	Yes, he did put questions to me concerning Rwamakuba.  I admit that we did speak of him. 
Q.	Do you remember telling him -- 
MR. MORLEY:
This is where we get into trouble, I respectfully submit.  "Do you remember telling him," amounts to putting a previous statement by the witness, and we are in the realms of a document going into evidence by one way or another.  My learned friend can ask what did he tell him.  He can ask specific facts arising out of the notes as to whether they are true or not.  But "Do you remember telling him" is where we blur the document going into evidence and the document being a question or part of a question.  

And, Your Honour, forgive me if I am on my feet again about this, but it is a source of some concern to the Prosecution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we have thought about this. We don't think the question is improper, and the question is not evidence.  Now, we are interested in the witness's answer; and we are interested in his answer.
MR. MORLEY:
I can understand that.  

Well, thank you for that indication about the way the questions are being put.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Put your earphones on again, Mr. Witness.  Thank you.  

Did you tell that person, in respect of André Rwamakuba, the Accused in this case, that you knew him as a student in medicine before he qualified? 
A.	I don't remember very well what I told that person.  I know that I made a mistake, and I told you that I had made mistakes.  I had alleged things about Rwamakuba where, really, they were against Rekeraho.  That's what I remember.  As to other ladies -- other details.  Perhaps you can refresh my memory, because I can't remember every item of information I gave him.  
Q.	Let me try and refresh your memory.  That's very fair of you.  

Do you remember telling him that you no longer knew if you would recognise Dr. André Rwamakuba?  Do you remember saying that to him?
A.	Yes, I remember.  But even when he showed me the photograph, I could not be 100 per cent positive in ascertaining that it's Rwamakuba.  I did not say that if shown his photograph, I could not recognise him.  In any case, I said nothing radical.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.

Can you remember telling him -- refreshing your memory -- you had spoken on a previous occasion which is a reference to a statement in 1997? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I am on my feet again; I apologise.  And if the witness might take his headphones off.  

The witness has invited my learned friend to refresh his memory from a document that the witness hasn't seen, doesn't have in front of him and is assuming will be an accurate memory-refreshing document.  At the lawyer's end, our concern is about the provenance of this document.  Just because the witness asks to be told exactly what's in the statement, to have his memory refreshed, as he puts it, the Prosecution invites the Court to say that that is not the appropriate way to go about this.  My learned friend can continue to ask the questions in the way that he did earlier.  But my learned friend is now relying on the witness inviting his memory to be refreshed as a vehicle for, basically, reading out the statement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That has not happened yet.  I don't see how the issue of prior inconsistent statements is clearly evidence that is relevant and important to a trial of this nature.  And there is no way it can be determined whether they are prior inconsistent statements without it being put to the witness and getting his answer.  So this issue is based on the testimony of the witness. 

What Mr. Hooper says or asks is not evidence.  He puts the question to the witness, and the witness's answer becomes evidence, and that's what we are considering.  There is no way he can get his questions asked -- answered, without asking them.  

MR. MORLEY:
It's the manner in which they are asked that concerns the Prosecution.  The invitation by the witness a moment ago is "to have his memory refreshed," which amounts, effectively, to inviting Mr. Hooper to simply read the statement bit by bit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the Witness can say what he likes.  The point is that here you are making an anticipatory objection, because what you are saying Mr. Hooper is going to do, he has not done as yet. Now, your comments are noted, if that's the purpose of doing it, as a warning, as a reminder, but there is nothing for me to rule on at this stage.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour is invited to rule on whether my learned friend, Mr. Hooper -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am not going to rule on a hypothetical question.  
MR. MORLEY:
But it's just been asked.  Mr. Hooper has said, "refreshing your memory then," and he has gone on to read a section of the statement.  And this is the difficulty, as I tried, perhaps clumsily earlier, to put down as a marker before the Court, the Prosecution has very substantial concerns about provenance of the document that Mr. Hooper has as a prior inconsistent statement and an accurate memory-refreshing document.  So the difficulty is that the witness thinking his memory is being refreshed, we at the lawyer's end are concerned about whether this is an accurate document with which to refresh his memory.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document is not evidence.  What is read to the witness is not evidence.  It's the witness's answer that is evidence.  And are you going to say that the witness's answer cannot be trusted?  
MR. MORLEY:
No, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that's all we are interested in, the witness's answer.  
MR. MORLEY:
However, the witness believes he is having his memory refreshed; that's the problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, you see, are you submit -- are you suggesting that the witness's answer is (inaudible) to what he believes his memory is refreshed about?  
MR. MORLEY:
The witness has said he doesn't remember very much of what it was that was discussed and he wants his memory refreshed.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
So a direct question has been put to him.  He can say X, Y, Z.  He can certainly say, yes, I said it; no, I didn't say it; I don't remember whether I said it or not.  His answer becomes evidence.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  He can certainly say, "I don't remember whether I said it or not," but the difficulty here is that he may believe he is being told, because it's a memory-refreshing exercise, that this is what he said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then that certainly will go to his credibility.  
MR. MORLEY:
Of course.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's what we'll be interested in finding out.  
MR. MORLEY:
Of course, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you're saying that because he believes his memory has been refreshed he will say anything -- is that what you are submitting?  You're saying his answer cannot be trusted if he believes he is merely repeating what he said previously?  
MR. MORLEY:
Excuse me.  If he doesn't have a recollection of what it is that he said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then he should say so. 
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully agree.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well.
MR. MORLEY:
But the difficulty with telling the witness, because the witness has asked for his memory to be refreshed, that his memory will now be refreshed, is that there is a danger that the witness will agree what he is being told is in the statement because he believes his memory is being refreshed, when the provenance of the statement is in issue; the accuracy of the statement is in issue.  So if the witness is adopting what's being put to him from the statement because he can't remember, but assumes his memory is being refreshed, there is a danger Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues are going to hear testimony which is inaccurate based on the witness believing he's been told, with accuracy, what he said.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that's a matter which we will have to decide on a question of assessing the truthfulness of this witness and the weight that we give to his testimony.  I don't think that we will resolve this matter by preventing the cross-examination.  
MR. MORLEY:
I am not trying to prevent the cross-examination.  I am trying to avoid getting into a long argument about the provenance of the statement.  And the way to avoid it, I'm hoping, is by the way Mr. Hooper asks questions.  And the one question which I am trying to avoid, with Your Honours' consideration, is the witness being told his memory is being refreshed from this document.  That amounts to, effectively, putting the document in and telling the witness that that is what he said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your comments are noted.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let him put back on the question -- let him put back on the earphones.  

Well, Mr. Hooper, you have taken note of what has been said.  
MR. HOOPER:
YES.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you may proceed.

	1700H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In your conversation, did you, in fact, speak about the man you'd originally called Rwamakuba in your first statement?  Can you remember talking about him?  The man that you now say you meant to say Rekeraho.  It doesn't matter.  You can call him Mr. X, that first man.  The man from Sovu.  The PARMEHUTU man, can you remember talking about that? 
A.	Yes, when we began to discuss Rwamakuba -- speak of Rwamakuba, when he told me that he'd come to seek information regarding Rwamakuba, that he was working with the ICTR, I could see that he was very crafty.  He was with someone who knew me and who was helping him.  I remember that we spoke of this trial.  Their visit was, in fact, suspicious.  So we spoke of Rwamakuba as you can see written in that document, and I took the opportunity to tell him that I had testified against Rwamakuba in respect of certain allegations and, in fact  -- that, in fact, those allegations concerned Rekeraho, that is how I indicated to him the mistake I had committed. 
Q.	Now -- now, I hope this isn't going to confuse things, it might, but you know in your first statement you spoke about Rwamakuba who came from Sovu, who'd been a sous  lieutenant in the Kambanda mach -- administration.  You remembered saying all that.  We don't need to go through that again, do we?  You remember saying that, don't you?  Yes or no, please? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	And you told us that, in fact, you meant to say Rekeraho or whatever.  You got the name misplaced, that's right, isn't it, that's what you're saying?  Yes or no, please? 
A.	But you're taking us backwards.  What is the matter now?  I will repeat to you --
Q.	Will you just listen to the question, please? 
A.	You're insisting on this, let me also insist on that as well --
Q.	Please, just listen to the question or we'll be here all tomorrow as well.  I'm going to call that man that you spoke of, the man from Sovu, Mr. X.  All right?  Let's not call him Rwamakuba and let's, for the moment, not call him Rekeraho.  Let's just say he's Mr. X.  Can we do that, please?  
A.	How?  We've already said it.  We know the name.  (Unintelligible) always used that name.  Now, is he a witness in any trial?  Say simply that.  Tell me, if, in the document, there is something I said of Rwamakuba that is attributable to some other person and then we close the chapter.  Now, I have said that there were certain statements that were made that concerned Rekeraho, but who, himself, is in custody.  What do you want me to add to that? 
Q.	Can you remember when you spoke to this man at the Credo hotel telling him that the man you'd referred to as Rwamakuba, was a native of Huye, who drove a vehicle from the Sovu dispensary, the sisters there, that you saw him at the university and when you saw him, he was bringing in Interahamwe who'd been wounded by a grenade thrown by another Interahamwe, who'd mistaken them for Tutsis.  In other words, there'd been a big mistake and the Interahamwe had blown themselves up.  And you saw him bringing those wounded people into the hospital.  Do you remember saying that?  Yes or no, please? 
A.	You -- you're talking about it as if you knew something already.  I did not give that information of my own volition.  He started talking about it and this was a person who seemed to be ill at ease.  He was saying that he had nothing to do with the Defence teams and that he was working in collaboration with the Tribunal and admitted on several occasions that there were allegations that were attributable to Rekeraho, but which unfortunately, were attributed to Rwamakuba.  And we have that only in one document, but we should forget about that and attribute those -- ascribe those allegations to Rekeraho and (unintelligible) would have been done. 
Q.	Is it true that you saw that man from Sovu delivering wounded Interahamwe to the hospital after there'd been a mistake when an Interahamwe had thrown a grenade at his colleagues?  Is that true, yes or no? 
A.	I -- think you're doing this deliberately.  We talked about this matter yesterday concerning Rekeraho, who came on board this vehicle that belonged to the reverences of Sovu.  I could not attribute those acts to Rwamakuba, except by error -- otherwise I know that Rekeraho did quite a number of things and investigations can already -- can be carried out about that and you'll see who did what.  I am not saying anything anymore.  I am saying that those allegations are attribut -- attributable to Rekeraho and not to Rwamakuba, and apparently you're doing this deliberately.  You still harping on the same issue, whereas we talked about it yesterday. 
Q.	You still haven't answered a straightforward question.  Why not?  You're trying to confuse the Judges with these interminable answers of yours. 

Let me ask the question again:  Did you see a man bring wounded Interahamwe to the hospital after there'd been, if I can call it like this, an accident with a hand grenade?  Yes or no?  
A.	I have heard the Defence counsel say that I wanted to mislead the Chamber.  I mean, what is this all about?  Do you think you're helping them to understand the complex nature of this matter?  I have told you that what you should understand from all of this -- well, you should demonstrate to the Chamber, if I'm trying exculpate your client, and I can confirm that at no time have I exculpated him of anything whatsoever.  I think, in the final analysis, justice will determine what really is the truth about this matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can you please speak closely to your microphone.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Witness, in the -- in this proceeding, different people have different functions.  At the end of the trial, after we have heard all of the evidence, the Judges will decide on the outcome of the case.  

Now, the lawyers who are representing the Prosecution on the one hand and the Accused on the other hand, they have to assist in getting the evidence by asking you questions. 

Now, your function is to give evidence, so we are interested in hearing your evidence in relation to the questions that are put to you.  It's not necessary to get involved in legal or other arguments with anybody.  So you should listen to the question that's been put and try to answer it as clearly as possible.  Do you understand?  Because that would be a proper discharge of your purpose in the trial proceedings.  Okay?  All right. 
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So I'm not going to use a name here to make it easier.  Did -- did you speak of a man who was an original PARMEHUTU, a native of Huye?  Yes or no, please? 
A.	Yes, I made that statement. 
Q.	And that this man drove a vehicle that belonged to the sisters -- the nuns at the Sovu dispensary?  Yes or no, please? 
A.	Yes.  I made the statement. 
Q.	And -- and that you saw that man at the university hospital where he drove some seriously wounded Interahamwe, who'd been injured when they made a mistake in throwing a grenade?  Yes or no, please? 
A.	Yes, I made those utterances because I heard people talk in that direction when they came to the location on board a vehicle. 
Q.	I -- I didn't ask you why you said it, merely did you say it?   And that you further said that this man was the head of Interahamwes?  Yes or no, please? 
A.	I said he was driving a vehicle in which there were Interahamwe.  As to his (unintelligible) as leader of Interahamwe, I don't believe I said so. 
Q.	Because you say the same thing in your first statement, don't you?  He was a leader of the Interahamwe.  Do you remember saying that?  Yes or no, please? 
A.	I don't believe that I made that statement because I never saw a document in which it was written that he was a leader of -- Interahamwe.  But then I've seen quite a number of documents concerning him.  I didn't see anywhere where it was mentioned that he was a (unintelligible) leader of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you say that it was him who'd had the houses of Tutsis in Huye demolished?   Yes or no, please? 
A.	I didn't make that statement. 
Q.	Did you say that the only thing you know about him is that he wore glasses and that he was a driver for the DJB (sic)?  Did you say that?  Yes or no, please, to either of those statements? 
A.	Yes, I said that. 
Q.	Did you say that he'd been a policeman under the Habyarimana regime? 
A.	After the war, I heard quite a number of things -- 
Q.	Yes or no will suffice.  We don't need to go into the history of it.  Did you say he was a policeman in the Habyarimana regime, yes or no, very straightforward?
A.	I said that that was information that was given to me by others because when he was a policeman, I never saw him in a policeman's uniform.  Other people told me about it. 
Q.	Did you say that when you were first spoken -- about Rwamakuba several years ago, a Rwamakuba arrested in Arusha, that you understood it as being the one who came from Huye at that time.  Did you say that?  Yes or no? 
A.	Is it mentioned anywhere that I heard that he was arrested?  Is that what you're saying, Counsel? 
Q.	Did you say that when you were spoken, first of all, about Rwamakuba who'd been arrested and was in Arusha that you thought that it was the one from Huye that you were being asked about?  A very simple question.  Yes or no?  
A.	No, I did not say that. 
Q.	Did you say that it was Twagirayezu Sukisa -- let me put it like this:  Did you tell him that 
	Twagirayezu Sukisa *********************************?  Is that true?  Did you say it?
A.	I didn't say that because this has nothing to do with that individual. 
Q.	Is it true? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, can you repeat your question because your microphone was off? 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is it true that -- 
A  	(Microphones overlapping) ********************* --
Q.	-- in surgery; is that right? 
A.	I didn't tell him that.  I don't know where he got such information -- the information contained in the document that you're reading. 
Q.	Did you tell him that it was that man Sukisa who had pointed out Dr. Rwamakuba to you on the visit on the 15th of May?  Yes or no? 
A.	No, I didn't tell him that. 
Q.	Did you tell him that you'd seen the Power Rwamakuba, the one from Huye, several times in meetings and the other one, the Rwamakuba from Kigali, that you only saw him once -- of the government of Kambanda?  Did you tell him that?  
A.	I had a conversation with that gentleman.  If I told him that I had met him at a certain point in time, you would agree with me that, we have (unintelligible) have understood each other.  That I had seen him on a number of occasions and we talked about it.  But if it were to happen that he included some information in that document, I can't tell, because I don't know what this points to. 
Q.	Question:  Did you tell him that it was Sukisa who'd pointed out Rwamakuba to you, 
	André Rwamakuba, at the time of a government meeting on the 15th of May; is it true?  Did you say it? 
A.	No, I did not tell him that. That is not true. 
Q.	Did you say you'd only seen André Rwamakuba once and that was the government delegation meeting?  Yes or no? 
A.	I have told you that it would be impossible for me to recollect all that was said, but the important thing is that, at least, in my testimony, it was agreed that I had seen him on a number occasions.  In particular -- as a matter of fact, that individual had lots of information concerning this case file.  And as for drawing some information from this file, I'm not aware of that. 
Q.	Did you tell him that the other Rwamakuba -- Power Rwamakuba is detained in the Karubanda prison?  Yes or no? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, can you please repeat your question because the microphone was off? 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you tell him that the -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- listen please.  Please listen, I haven't finished -- I haven't finished.  Just -- you know, there's a microphone problem, Witness.  I'm sorry to interrupt you. 

Did you tell him that with regard to the other Rwamakuba from Sovu, that he is detained in the Karubanda prison?  Did you say it, or is it true and did you say it?  And again, yes or no is quite sufficient.
A.	It is that person who told me, rather, that the Rwamakuba in question was in prison.  He is the one who suggested that information.  He knew about this and that subsequently we agreed that probably this was the case.  But he's the one who suggested that that person was in prison at Karubanda.  
Q.	Did you tell him that the sisters of Sovu, S-O-V-U, that's the nuns at Sovu who were tried in Belgium -- there were three sisters who were tried in Belgium, I believe -- had spoken about that Sovu -- that's Rwamakuba from Sovu.  Is it true and did you say it? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, you're quite right.  I have notes -- well, really a statement, they're not really notes.  Now, at no time in this -- in the document that I've seen taken by the man who saw you, does the name Rekeraho appear.  Is it right?  At no time did you mention Rekeraho in any context whatsoever in your meeting with that man in December 2003? 
A.	But you're talking about the absence of that name or for failing to mention that name, because you were talking about specific names.  I believe I have said that the person who was driving the vehicle in question was not Rwamakuba, but that it was someone else and I think we gave the name.  So you surprise me when you tell me that his name does not figure in the document. 
Q.	Well, I'm suggesting that at no time did you mention the name Rekeraho at all.  You haven't mentioned it to anyone until you mentioned it to Mr. Morley, and, that, in an oblique reference.  So I'm asking you:  Is it right that at no time did you mention Rekeraho to this man you saw in December 2003?  Yes or no? 
A.	This is not true.  In order to clarify the statement in question, I gave a name.  But your messenger and you yourself should have a name somewhere.  You called Sovu -- did you call it an ambulance (sic) by any chance? 
Q.	Excuse me.  I'm just seeing if there's something I missed.  I want you to look at a document -- I want you to be shown a signature on this document and I want you to tell me if it's yours - signature, or not.  It's that little mark.  There's the name.  It's that little bit there.  Okay.  Show it -- show the witness and I'll ask the witness be shown it and we'll go from there.  

Is -- is that your signature?  And is that -- first of all, is that your signature? 
A.	I don't think this is my signature.  Besides I haven't signed a document that is written in French; I don't think so.  I have never signed a doc -- a document that was written in French.  I think we should look at this matter closely and make things clear.  I think an investigation should be carried out to find out the provenance of this document. 
Q.	I see, yes.  You're a lap ahead of us, aren't you?  You're a smart chappy.  

Every document you've signed has been in French, hasn't it?   Every document in this case relating to the Tribunal has been in French and every one you've signed.  So what are you talking about, please?  Would you like another look?  Can I show you the original document, here?  Perhaps you should see it.  Not the scanned. 
A.	What I'm saying is that the documents were read back to me in Kinyarwanda and even if they were written in French, first, they would read it back to me in Kinyarwanda.  But I never signed any handwritten document in which there are any corrections.  No, that is not true. 
Q.	In doing this, it's right to say, is it not, that this document was read back to you?  In Kinyarwanda? 
A.	Nobody never -- I mean, nobody ever read the document to me.  Did that person tell you that he was writing -- taking notes in a language that I didn't know and then the document was read back to me?  No, I do not agree with you on that point. 
Q.	And we have lots of your signatures on documents, haven't we?  
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all my questions. 

Well, we got -- we've got a lot of exhibits.  I will deal with that.  Perhaps, we can deal with that as we did before, with a list that we'll compile and assist the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that sounds like a good idea. 

Now, Mr. Witness, the counsel for the Accused has completed his questioning of you.  You will now have to answer a few other questions put by the Prosecutor.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honour's leave, thank you. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When you spoke with the Defence investigator sometime ago, who did you say was the name of the man who'd come from Sovu? 
A.	(Unintelligible) it was Rekeraho, but at the time, I didn't know that man's other name.  But we did agree that it was -- that it was Rekeraho. 
Q.	And when you say at the time you didn't know his other name, what other name? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I -- I'm sorry.  Could the witness please repeat the answer?  Sorry. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that I didn't know that person's other name because yesterday counsel refreshed my memory and reminded me that it was Emmanuel, but I hadn't known his -- I didn't know his full name, Christian name. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When you spoke to the investigator for the Defence, did you mention any person as having the name Rwamakuba who was not Dr. André Rwamakuba? 
A.	No, I did not mention anyone. 
Q.	Who is the person that you understood was detained at Karubanda prison? 
A.	It's Rekeraho, Rekeraho whom the counsel for the Defence refers to as Emmanuel. 
Q.	When you were being asked questions two days ago, you were asked about the sons of a man from Huye who was named Rwamakuba.  Do you remember being asked about a man by the name of Rwamakuba who had sons from Huye? 
A.	That question was put to me. 
Q.	You were asked about a man who died somewhere around 1980; do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	And you were told, when being asked questions, that that man had had a son called Jean Rwamakuba.  Do you remember being told about that two days ago? 
A.	Yes, I remember that that was said. 
Q.	Did you know Jean Rwamakuba? 
A.	No.  It was those people who'd undertaken investigations who spoke of that person.  I myself did not know that individual. 
Q.	In a very long question, Mr. Hooper told you some details about the man Jean Rwamakuba.  Do you remember those details now? 
A.	I do not remember.  He spoke of that person's brothers.  I consider that had no connection with the matter in hand.  He, in speaking of that individual, you could clearly see that he had some interest in all the details, but I, from myself, considered it had nothing -- it bore -- it had no bearing on the matter at hand. 
Q.	Mr. Hooper put in his long question, among various details, that the man Jean Rwamakuba was a DGB driver.  Do you know whether a man called Jean Rwamakuba is a DGB driver? 
A.	I confirm that the person we'd been talking about who came in an ambulance transporting Interahamwe had been at some time a driver for the DGB project, but at the time of the genocide, he came with that -- on board that vehicle transporting Interahamwe, but at no time did I hear that his name was Jean. 
Q.	What was that person's name; do you know? 
A.	His name was Rekeraho.  Counsel added that it was Emmanuel.  It must be Emmanuel.  In the course of the investigations, he must have found that it was Emmanuel, but I'm surprised when I hear mention made of Jean -- Jean. 
Q.	In the course of a long question to you from Mr. Hooper, he suggested to you that there was a man called Jean Rwamakuba who wore glasses and boots.  Do you know any such person? 
A.	I don't know where he got that information from.  Perhaps he saw him wearing those boots.  I'm speaking of a man who came in an ambulance, he had spoken of his father's occupation and other details, but I don't know what his interest is in that.  It was a bit -- it was -- it was approached a bit bizarrely, but I don't know anything about that. 
Q.	Do you know any man named Jean Rwamakuba who wears glasses and boots? 
A.	I do not know that person.  He put the question to me as follows:  "Don't you know someone called Jean Rwamakuba from Huye?"  That's how he began to describe who was Déogratias Rwamakuba.  I told him that I heard -- but that had nothing to do with the driver of the ambulance.  The name Déogratias, I've heard of him, but it has nothing to do with the ambulance.  I think that's how we came to mention the name, the circumstances under which we mentioned that name. 
Q.	When you met with the Defence investigator who showed you his photograph on his identification card, were you shown any other photos or not?
A.	No, no other photograph was shown to me, nor did he mention the other names that are -- apparently counsel for the Defence knows. 
Q.	You will remember under cross-examination, you told us that a lad called Bosco was taken from his hiding place at around the same time that you were caught and you were led to the pickup.  Do you remember telling us about Bosco? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	Was Bosco intercepted -- stop the word intercepted.  Was Bosco taken away on the same occasion as you were led to the pickup, or was it a different occasion? 
A.	It was on the same occasion. 
Q.	You have been asked questions about your many statements, including a note made by investigators on the 8th of July 2003.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	You mean, was I put questions concerning Bosco?  I'm sorry, counsel for the Prosecution, I have not understand your question fully. 
Q.	Your note of the 8th of July of 2003 has gone before the Judges and been referred to by Mr. Hooper.  Do you understand what I said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	In that note, it is now before the Judges, that you say that Bosco was taken away on the 28th of April.  Do you understand what I said? 
A.	Yes, I understand, Counsel. 
Q.	How good do you think you are about the date on which you recall you say Rwamakuba tried to take you away? 
A.	I cannot give a precise date.  I can only make an estimation.  I remember the date of the 15th, and that's all. 
Q.	You've been cross-examined for three days, but you've not been asked very much at all about who you say you saw and at what distance and for how long by the pickup truck.  Do you understand what I've said? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you inviting me to state it's not a question for re-examination.  If it wasn't raised in cross-examination, why do you raise it? 
MR. MORLEY:
It's -- perhaps if the witness takes off his headphones. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was just a quibble on the way you put the question.  I don't have a firm recollection as to whether it was raised or not, but you suggested that it was not raised in cross-examination. 
MR. MORLEY:
No.  What has been challenged in cross-examination is the -- his headphones are off, fine.  

What has been challenged in cross-examination is the correctness of his being able to identify Rwamakuba, and what I'm going to ask him is who was it he saw that night? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is permitted. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Could you put back on your earphones.  Who was it you saw by the pickup truck on the occasion that you were almost taken away? 
A.	I saw Dr. André Rwamakuba very close to that pickup truck. 
Q.	And how do you know it was Dr. André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I saw him myself and I recognised him, as I knew his physiognomy, his face, previously.  I recognised him, even if I wasn't close to him, but I knew him because he had studied there.  And when I was shown his photograph and I asked whether his glasses were thick, I said that I thought it was him, although, I could not be a hundred per cent positive. 
Q.	When the government delegation you say came to the hospital on around the 15th of May, was Dr. Rwamakuba among the delegation? 
A.	Yes, I saw him in the delegation among them. 
Q.	Why do you say it was him? 
A.	I confirm, having seen him, he was not alone, of course.  He was in a group of about 70 people.  Even if Defence counsel maintains that he was on mission, I maintain that I saw him. 
Q.	Mr. Hooper has asked you to look at all of your various statements and your transcript when you gave evidence in the long period since 1997 to today's date.  Do you remember going through all of that material? 
A.	Yes, he showed me some of those documents.  He put them -- some of those documents before me, and he showed the same documents to the Judges. 
Q.	Mr. Hooper points out that you did not say very much about André Rwamakuba until your statement of the 8th of July -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Correction, said nothing about him. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Hooper points out that you said nothing about him until your statement of the 8th of July of 2003.  Do you understand what I have said? 
MR. HOOPER:
That's not a statement, it's a confirmation. 
MR. MORLEY:
I apologise to Mr. Hooper.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Hooper points out that you said nothing about him until you were spoken to by investigators on the 8th of July 2003.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, the Defence counsel said that I didn't talk much about a Rwamakuba in my testimonies, but I knew that I was going to come and give testimony before the Tribunal and that I was going to talk about him. 
Q.	And can you help Mr. Hooper and Their Honours with why in other statements you were not preoccupied with André Rwamakuba but mentioned other people? 
A.	The reason that I can give for that is that the persons about whom I spoke before were people who were already at trial.  When the Rwamakuba case commenced, that is when I deemed it useful to talk about him. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel, Mr. Prosecutor.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour might be pleased to hear that that is all I ask, and this may be a convenient moment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Now, Mr. Witness, over the last few days you have been examined by both the Prosecutor and the Defence counsel.  Their questions have now been completed, and the Judges of the Tribunal do not have any questions to ask you.  You are now free to go.  We thank you for coming and giving your testimony here, and you are now excused. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are about to take the adjournment.  I think it's necessary to say that we are going proceed with hearing tomorrow.  It had been previously been thought that we would not be able to do that because of another engagement, but we have made arrangements, and we will be available to start tomorrow morning.  

I presume that the Prosecutor is ready to bring on the next witness? 
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, we are ready.  By the way, the witness was here, but I asked her -- him or her to be taken away because we didn't think we were going to finish today.  So I have to point a raise, an issue to raise tomorrow morning before we start hearing the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  I suppose that we can also deal with the admission of exhibits arising out of the last witness's testimony tomorrow morning as well.  

Okay.  We can take the adjournment now, until tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1807H)
