         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the registry introduce the matter coming before the 

         4        Trial Chamber this morning, please?

         5   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 

         6        the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed 

         7        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, 

         8        Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and

        10        today, Wednesday the 2nd of October 2002, for the 

        11        continuation of the Defence case when Prosecution 

        12        counsel, 

        13        Mr. Fleming, will continue the cross-examination of 

        14        Witness RHU 31 (DW10) in the matter of the Prosecutor v. 

        15        Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  

        16        

        17        Thank you, My Lords.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you.  May we have the appearance of the  

        19        parties, starting with the Prosecution for the record, 

        20        please?

        21   MR. FLEMING: If the Court pleases, I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        22        trial attorney.  I appear with Ms. Ojemeni, trial 

        23        attorney and Ms. Marotine, case manager.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  May we also have 

        25        the appearance of the Defence, please?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Good morning, Your Honours.  Lennox Hinds, 

        27        we are representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by 

        28        Professor Bompaka and Mr. Emilien Dusabe, who is the 

        29        interpreter.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Yes, Interpreter,

         1        could you please tell Witness RHU31, that the Trial 

         2        Chamber reminds him of the solemn declaration he 

         3        previously made, and that he will continue with his 

         4        evidence today on that same solemn declaration.

         5   THE WITNESS: Agreed.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Thank you.  Mr. Fleming, yesterday  

         7        when we adjourned we were in closed session.  Do you 

         8        still  think that we continue in closed session?

         9   MR. FLEMING: No, Your Honour.  I think we can go into open 

        10        session.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right.  Tell the witness that we 

        12        are in open session and we will continue to be in open 

        13        session.  He should be careful not to mention names of 

        14        people and places which have a bearing on his identity.

        15   THE WITNESS: Yes.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Right.  Good.  Yes, Mr. Fleming?

        17   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

        18                         CROSS-EXAMINATION(continued)

        19   BY MR. FLEMING:

        20   Q.   Witness, you do know the Esimbi house, don't you?

        21   A.   Yes, I know that house.

        22   Q.   That's some distance from your place; isn't it?

        23   A.   This house is a long way away from my house.

        24   Q.   You didn't have to pass it in going to or from your work 

        25        home to your work; did you?

        26   A.   To go from my house to my work, I did not go by Esimbi 

        27        house because Esimbi is too far away and it is towards 

        28        Byangabo.

        29   Q.   So you wouldn't know what happened at Esimbi house on a 

        30        daily basis; would you?

         1   A.   Well, I wouldn't be able to know because I don't live 

         2        near Esimbi.

         3   Q.   No.  Thank  you.  Who were the Interahamwe?  Who are the 

         4        Interahamwe?

         5   A.   I heard people speak of the Interahamwe.

         6   Q.   But you speak of the Interahamwe in your statement, 

         7        don't you?

         8   A.   Yes, that's correct.

         9   Q.   So, who are the Interahamwe?

        10   A.   I heard people speak of the Interahamwe and people said 

        11        that they were members of the MRND party.

        12   Q.   MRND party?

        13   A.   Before the advent of the multi-party system, there was 

        14        only the MRND party.  All the Rwandans were members of 

        15        the MRND party, even foreigners who were residing in 

        16        Rwanda and we were all members of this party because it 

        17        was the only party.  But with the advent of the  

        18        multi-party system, it wasn't easy to know which party 

        19        to join. 

        20   Q.   Were you a member -- I am sorry, were you a member of 

        21        the MRND after multipartyism?

        22   A.   Yes, I remained a member of the MRND.  I did not change 

        23        my party affiliation.

        24   Q.   So you said a moment ago that after multipartyism, it 

        25        was difficult to know which party to join.  So, I take 

        26        it from that that you made a deliberate choice to remain 

        27        within the MRND; is that so?

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour, I am told the 

        29        witness did not say he was a member in Kinyarwanda.  

        30        What came through in English was that he was a member.

         1        That is what I heard but I am now told that that is not 

         2        what the witness said in Kinyarwanda.

         3   MR. FLEMING: No, the witness said with respect - -

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: No, no in English it came through that I 

         5        heard he was a member, but I am just being told that his 

         6        testimony is that he was not a member.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT:  What came through in English is that he 

         8        remained a member of the MRND, and he had not changed.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: That's right.  That's what came through in 

        10        English and I am told that this is not what the witness 

        11        said.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: And in French?

        13   JUDGE RAMAROSON: He said that he was still a member.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I am still being told that 

        15        that's what he said in Kinyarwanda by those who are 

        16        listening in Kinyarwanda.  That is not the English or 

        17        the French.

        18   Mr. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right.  Mr. Fleming, you can have 

        19        that one verified, but we have it on record anyway. 

        20   MR. FLEMING:  I am sorry, Your Honour, you have --

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: You can ask the witness to verify that.

        22   MR. FLEMING: Yes.

        23   BY MR. FLEMING:

        24   Q.   Witness the question I asked you, in fact, was this; you 

        25        said that everyone was a member of the MRND during 

        26        single party state, but you said that it was difficult 

        27        to know what party to belong to when multipartyism came.  

        28        Now, I am putting it to you that you made a deliberate 

        29        choice, didn't you to stay as a member of the MNRD?

        30   A.   Yes, I told you that when the single system was in

         1        place, there was only one party and I was a member of 

         2        that party, and with the advent of the multi-party 

         3        system, it wasn't easy to choose and I added that I did 

         4        not belong to any party.

         5   Q.   When did you add that -- just now?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  And, I think that 

         7        what Mr. Fleming is doing is not fair.  We are dealing 

         8        with -- in a serious matter with these issues.  The 

         9        witness said in Kinyarwanda what he says now and there 

        10        was a mistake. I brought it to the Court's attention and 

        11        Mr. Fleming as an officer of the court should be dealing 

        12        with this matter with the seriousness that it requires. 

        13   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, with respect, I deal seriously with 

        14        the translation which is provided by those who are under 

        15        oath to provide the appropriate translation and those 

        16        who have the appropriate qualifications to do so.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we will proceed, Counsel.

        18   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you.

        19   BY MR. FLEMING:

        20   Q.   Witness are you telling this Court that you, personally, 

        21        did not know of the existence of the Interahamwe?

        22   A.   Thank you.  I told you at the beginning that I heard 

        23        people refer to the Interahamwe, and as I heard people 

        24        refer to them, then I knew they existed.

        25   Q.   Witness, I will ask you again that; are you asking this 

        26        Court that you, of your own knowledge, did not know of 

        27        the existence of the Interahamwe?

        28   A.   The Interahamwe existed in the country and what I said 

        29        was that then I did not know them because they were not 

        30        present in my area.

         1   Q.   Are you telling this Court that there were no 

         2        Interahamwe in your area at all?

         3   A.   I am explaining what I know to the Trial Chamber and I 

         4        know that there were no Interahamwe in my area.

         5   Q.   When people started killing Tutsi, did they not claim 

         6        that they were Interahamwe?

         7   A.   I have told you that I heard the news of this massacre 

         8        from the mouth of Bourgmestre Emmanuel Harerimana and 

         9        when he informed me of that, he told me that the people 

        10        had been massacred in Rwankeli and Busogo.  He did not 

        11        mention Interahamwe or soldiers.  Therefore, I cannot 

        12        tell you who committed these massacres or provide a 

        13        name.

        14   Q.   Sir, are you saying that you have never heard it said in 

        15        your area that Interahamwe committed these massacres? 

        16        Is that what you are telling the Court?

        17   A.   Thank you. What I am doing here is providing details 

        18        about what I know and I am telling you that people were 

        19        killed, that they didn't commit suicide, and, therefore, 

        20        people killed them.  But, I cannot tell you anything 

        21        about those who committed the massacres.  I have no idea 

        22        whether they were soldiers or Interahamwe.  And I am 

        23        saying this because I was not present, and, therefore, I 

        24        cannot tell you anything about the perpetrators of these 

        25        massacres but the Interahamwe existed in our country.

        26   Q.   Witness, I want you to go back to something that we were 

        27        talking about yesterday -- the number of people who died  

        28        in the three locations that we referred to; Busogo 

        29        parish, Rwankeli and Byangabo with 381 people.  You knew 

        30        that, didn't you?

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  That was asked and 

         2        answered and, in fact, yesterday he talked about 321 and 

         3        now he has increased the number to 381.  But needless to 

         4        say, the question was put to this witness and he 

         5        answered it.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Mr. Fleming the numbers, he said he was 

         7        not aware of the numbers.  It was a clear answer from to 

         8        the witness on that point.

         9   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        10   BY MR. FLEMING: 

        11   Q.   Now, on the 7th of April, I am suggesting to you that 

        12        Kajelijeli came to the communal office between 7:00 and 

        13        8 o'clock in the morning, he had seven Interahamwe with 

        14        him and he requested the bourgmestre to give assistance 

        15        to him to go out and kill some Tutsis.  What do you say 

        16        about that?

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  This witness said 

        18        he got to the office at 8:30.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  He is suggesting.  I mean he can answer that 

        20        question.  He is not saying that is what he said, he is 

        21        suggesting to him.

        22   THE WITNESS: Thank you.  I told you yesterday that on the 

        23        7th, of April, I arrived at the communal office at 8:30 

        24        and I left the communal office at 11:00.  During that 

        25        time I did not see Kajelijeli, and therefore, I was not  

        26        able to see those you are saying accompanied him, but I 

        27        will add that I did not see Kajelijeli between 8:30 and 

        28        11:00.

        29   Q.   Sir, on the 8th of April 1994, Kajelijeli indeed came 

        30        again to the office of the bourgmestre, again

         1        accompanied, I suggest to you?

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: I do not know what Mr. Fleming is doing? 

         3        Is he making a suggestion?  I see.

         4   MR. FLEMING: That's normally what the words, "I suggest to 

         5        you", mean.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: In my area of practice, Counsel, that is not 

         7        the  proper way of putting questions to the witnesses, 

         8        but I understand that there is a different practice and 

         9        I am being understanding.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Thank you.

        11   MR. FLEMING: Thank you for your generosity.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        13   BY MR. FLEMING:

        14   Q.   Witness, on the 8th of April 1994, I am suggesting to 

        15        you that Kajelijeli came again to the communal office.  

        16        I am going to pause there, do you understand English?

        17   A.   No, I don't understand English.

        18   Q.   But you understood what I said about Kajelijeli coming 

        19        to the office, didn't you?  You responded to it?

        20   A.   And what was my reaction? 

        21   Q.   When I got to that point, that was what your reaction 

        22        was.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I object to this whole process.  

        24        The witness says that he does not understand English.  I 

        25        know that I have spoken with this witness for two weeks.  

        26        I can't communicate with this man.  So, I don't know 

        27        what Mr. Fleming is intimating and all of this 

        28        sneakiness and snickering and so on is improper. 

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Could you get on with asking questions and 

        30        let's get going?

         1   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honours have 

         2        observed the witness in the box.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  What is this 

         4        observation?

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: You proceed with the questioning.

         6   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

         7   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         8   Q.   Witness, Kajelijeli came, I am suggesting to you to the 

         9        office on the 8th April 1994, accompanied by seven 

        10        Interahamwe?

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: What time?

        12   MR. FLEMING:  In the afternoon before 3:00 o'clock.

        13   A.   Well, I thank you very much. This morning I was asked to 

        14        keep to my oath and I am keeping to my oath and what I 

        15        am saying here is what I witnessed.  I cannot tell you  

        16        anything that I did not witness because that would be a 

        17        sin as far as I am  concerned.  I saw Kajelijeli on the 

        18        8th going to Mukingo.  He was alone in his Toyota Hilux 

        19        pick-up.  There was nobody in the front or the back.  So 

        20        he left alone, sir.

        21   Q.   I am suggesting to you that he went to see the 

        22        bourgmestre and there was an argument.  Kajelijeli asked 

        23        the bourgmestre to bury the bodies and the bourgmestre 

        24        said he would refuse to bury the bodies until the 

        25        killings had been reported to the appropriate 

        26        authorities.  I suggest to you that is, in fact, what 

        27        happened on the 8th?

        28   A.   Thank you very much.  I told you that I was not aware of 

        29        that because I didn't witness it.  I only saw Kajelijeli 

        30        arrive at the communal office.  Well as far as that

         1        conversation is concerned, I did not witness it, sir. 

         2        One other thing is that Kajelijeli did not have the 

         3        power to give orders to the bourgmestre in his commune, 

         4        sir.

         5   Q.   Kajelijeli, let's put it in another way -- Kajelijeli 

         6        shouldn't have had that power to give orders to the 

         7        bourgmestre should he, because he was not in an official 

         8        position?

         9   A.   Could you repeat that question, sir? 

        10   Q.   Let us put it in another way; Kajelijeli shouldn't have 

        11        given orders to the bourgmestre because he was not in 

        12        the official position?

        13   A.   Yes sir, he couldn't do so, because he was not 

        14        officially in function.

        15   Q.   And he remained a very influential person in the 

        16        commune; didn't he?

        17   A.   Is that all, sir?

        18   Q.   I am putting you in his position, I am asking you a 

        19        question.  He remained, didn't he, a very influential 

        20        person even when he was not bourgmestre?

        21   A.   I don't know, sir.

        22   Q.   But you are the person who does know the workings, you 

        23        told us yesterday, how you knew the workings, you surely 

        24        must know whether he was an influential person in the 

        25        commune?

        26   A.   No.  I did not say that he was an influential person.  

        27   Q.   You misunderstand, I am asking you a question.  I am 

        28        asking you; did he not remain an influential person in 

        29        the commune even when he was not bourgmestre? 

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: I think he has answered that one he did not

         1        know whether he remained an influential person. 

         2   MR. FLEMING: With respect, Your Honour, he did not say that 

         3        at all.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is exactly what the witness said. 

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: He does not know.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: He said he does not know.

         7   MR. FLEMING: He does not know.  I am sorry, Your Honour.  You 

         8        are perfectly right, Your Honours, he said he does not 

         9        know and that was the proposition that I was just 

        10        challenging.  It is the knowledge that I am challenging 

        11        not --

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: But that is the answer that he gave. 

        13   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour, I am challenging his 

        14        knowledge.  Am I not entitled to challenge his 

        15        knowledge? 

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: You can, on the basis of what he has, but at 

        17        least, that is where you start from.

        18   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour. 

        19   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Microphone, please.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: The next question, he has just suggested to 

        21        the witness that Kajelijeli was an influential person.  

        22        The witness came back and said that is not what I said.  

        23        So, that is his suggestion, the witness has rejected it.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: You can go on Counsel, from there.

        25   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

        26   BY MR. FLEMING:  

        27   Q.   You must know, musn't you, from your knowledge of the 

        28        way in which the commune worked whether or not 

        29        Kajelijeli was or was not an influential person?

        30   A.   Kajelijeli was an influential person in the commune

         1        where he served as bourgmestre and that was the same 

         2        thing for his replacement and the second replacement.  

         3        So as to say that he was influential after having left 

         4        his post, it is tantamount to say that he was not 

         5        replaced, sir.

         6   Q.   On the morning of the 8th of April 1994, I am putting to 

         7        you, quite early on that morning, the bourgmestre asked 

         8        Brigadier Bazimenyera to go and count the bodies of the 

         9        dead, what do you say about that?

        10   A.   Thank you very much.  I told you that on the 8th of 

        11        April, I arrived at the communal office at 7:00 am.  At 

        12        that time, neither the bourgmestre or 

        13        Brigadier Bazimenyera were there so that if the 

        14        brigadier had received orders from the bourgmestre 

        15        before my arrival, I do not know.  The bourgmestre got 

        16        there at 9:30, sir. 

        17   Q.   Witness, I am also suggesting to you that from time to 

        18        time from 1992 to 1994, there was, in fact, a military 

        19        type of training conducted on the area in front of the 

        20        communal office?

        21   A.   I have never witnessed any training of young people in 

        22        the manipulation of arms in front of the Mukingo  

        23        communal office.

        24   Q.   Sir, you were in that region for the days 7, 8, 9, 10, 

        25        11, and 12 of April 1994, weren't you?

        26   A.   That's correct, sir.

        27   Q.   Is it your evidence to this Court that over that period 

        28        of time, you never saw young people carrying weapons?

        29   A.   The dates you just mentioned even after that period, I 

        30        did not see any young people armed.  I did not see any

         1        of them.  If they were in a location that I did not 

         2        know, I couldn't know whether they were there or whether 

         3        they were armed, sir.

         4   Q.   You do know, don't you, that there was a further 

         5        massacre at the court of appeal on the 12th-14th of 

         6        April 1994?

         7   A.   Thank you very much.  What I am saying here before this 

         8        court is true.  I am not inventing anything.  I do not 

         9        know about a court of appeal in the Mukingo commune, 

        10        sir.

        11   Q.   Did you not hear that there was a massacre in the court 

        12        of appeal, Mukingo -- I am sorry, Ruhengeri?

        13   A.   What I knew about the court of appeal of Ruhengeri was 

        14        that the building -- the premises was burnt, but there 

        15        were no victims, sir.  Ruhengeri is spelt, 

        16        R-U-H-E-N-G-E-R-I. 

        17   Q.   Witness the victims in Busogo parish, Rwankeli, Byangabo  

        18        were all Tutsi; weren't they? 

        19   A.   What I heard was that there were massacres in Busogo and  

        20        Rwankeli but as far as Byangabo is concerned,I didn't 

        21        hear anything.  People who fell at Busogo and Rwankeli  

        22        were indeed the Tutsis, sir.

        23   Q.   And, sir, you are a Hutu, aren't you?

        24   A.   Yes sir, I am a Hutu. 

        25   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour, that's the 

        26        cross-examination of this witness.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Any 

        28        re-examination? 

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour.

         2        please go ahead. And remind the witness that we are

         6        Witness, if I ask you any question, and answer to which 

         7        you think might reveal your identity, just indicate to 

         8        the President and he will then instruct you on how to 

         9        proceed.  Don't answer any question if you think that 

        10        the answer will reveal your identity.  Do you understand 

        11        that?

        12   THE WITNESS: Very well.

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        14   Q.   Sir, do you recall how many times you saw lawyers for 

        15        Mr. Kajelijeli ****, how many times?

        16   A.   Yes, I do remember.

        17   Q.   How many times was that, sir?

        18   A.   Three times, sir.

        19   Q.   Now, when was the first time you saw lawyers for 

        20        Kajelijeli **********?

        21   A.   It was on the 20th of March, year 2002, sir.

        22   Q.   And was that the time you signed this statement that you 

        23        have before you?

        24   A.   That is correct, sir.

        25   Q.   When next did you see lawyers for Mr. Kajelijeli in this 

        26        regard, if you recall?

        27   A.   I do not remember the dates, but it was in the month of 

        28        August this year, sir.

        29   Q.   And at that time, sir, can you tell the Tribunal what 

        30        happened at that occasion?

         1   A.   On that second occasion I was shown a document in 

         2        Kinyarwanda and the translation of the statement that  

         3        was recorded of the proceedings.  I read the document.  

         4        I saw some errors in it that I pointed out to the 

         5        Defence team, sir.

         6   Q.   Was that the first time that you saw errors in your 

         7        statement?

         8   A.   That was the first time, sir.

         9   Q.   And did you, at that time, tell the lawyers what those 

        10        errors were? 

        11   A.   Yes, sir.

        12   Q.   Now, sir, on the morning of the 7th of April 1994, what 

        13        time did you arrive at the communal office, that is on 

        14        April the 7th of 1994?

        15   A.   On the 7th of April 1994 I got to the communal office at 

        16        8:30.

        17   Q.   And sir, whom did you see in the office that morning at 

        18        8:30 am?

        19   A.   There was nobody in the office, sir.

        20   Q.   Was the communal vehicle present?

        21   A.   No, sir.

        22   Q.   Was the driver present?

        23   A.   No, sir.

        24   Q.   And what time did you leave the office?

        25   A.   On that day, I left the communal office at 11 o'clock. 

        26   Q.   By the time that you left the office, did you see the 

        27        bourgmestre or the brigadier at the communal office?

        28   A.   No, sir.

        29   Q.   Did you see the driver of the communal vehicle or the 

        30        vehicle itself by the time you left?

         1   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, none of this arises out of 

         2        cross-examination.  None of those facts were challenged.  

         3        The only proposition I put to him in respect to the 7th 

         4        was that between 7 and 8 there was a conversation.  My 

         5        learned friend is just taking the opportunity to go over 

         6        completely unchallenged material, and, with respect, I 

         7        object to the process.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the credibility of this witness 

         9        has been challenged.  The witness was, in fact, 

        10        challenged with respect to his ability to recall what 

        11        happened on the 7th.  His veracity with respect to the 

        12        7th was challenged and, certainly, I am entitled at this 

        13        time on re-direct to take the witness with respect to 

        14        those facts that he has so testified to and to have him 

        15        testify to that.  We are not going through all of his 

        16        testimony.  The issue that was raised was with respect 

        17        to the 7th and the 8th and the statement that he made at 

        18        that time and he went to the questions of what happened 

        19        in the morning of the 7th and that is what I am dealing 

        20        with, the morning of the 7th and the 8th.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, but the questions that should be dealt 

        22        with really are matters that should arise from 

        23        cross-examination.  You have indeed, for example, on the 

        24        7th asked him a question as to when he got to the 

        25        office, which I think is a matter that arose from the 

        26        suggestion and from the answer that he gave -- please -- 

        27        that needs to be verified.  But the other issues in his 

        28        evidence as for example, the details that are subsequent 

        29        in the examination-in-chief have not been challenged and 

        30        so they don't have to be gone over.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: What has been challenged, Your Honour, as 

         2        you will recall is whether or not Mr. Kajelijeli arrived 

         3        there with some people and, in fact, spoke to the 

         4        bourgmestre and gave certain orders to him or whatever.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: And the answer has been given in so far as he 

         6        got to the office at 8:30 and there was nobody in the 

         7        office at that time.  So, we don't have to go to all the 

         8        details of the vehicles and whatever issues that have 

         9        not been raised -- all these other subsequent details.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Oh, let me go to the --

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        12   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        13   Q.   Sir, what time did you arrive at the office on the 8th?  

        14        That is on the 8th of April.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Fair enough.

        16   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        17   Q.   And, Witness, can you just sit forward.

        18   A.   Are you talking about the 8th, Counsel?  I arrived at 

        19        8th -- the interpreter hasn't finished.  I arrived at 

        20        7:00.

        21   Q.   And when you arrived at the office on 7:00, sir, who did 

        22        you see there on the 8th?

        23   A.   When I arrived at the commune office at the morning of 

        24        the 8th, there were a few persons working there who were 

        25        there, commune employees, but I would not be able to 

        26        give you their names because I did not pay attention.  

        27        But as for the bourgmestre, he was not there.

        28   Q.   What time did he arrive?

        29   A.   He arrived around 9:30.

        30   Q.   Did you see him leave that day?

                  KAJELIJELI                                2 OCTOBER 2002




         1   A.   From 9:30 to approximately 3:00 p.m. which is the time I 

         2        left the communal office, he had not yet left the 

         3        communal office.

         4   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, I arise to object again.  Never did 

         5        I put that he left the communal office on that day.  My 

         6        learned friend is simply taking the opportunity to go 

         7        over the full history again.  He should be dealing with 

         8        propositions that I raised.  I didn't suggest that he 

         9        did, because, in fact, if he did he left in spirit that 

        10        day, he died in his office between 3:00 to 4:00 and it's 

        11        never been challenged.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, that question, in fact, was put 

        13        to the witness whether or not in his statement he said 

        14        he arrived at 7:00 and left at 3:00.  And the witness, 

        15        in fact, said that he had made an error there and I am 

        16        certainly entitled to ask the witness with respect to 

        17        the time of arrival and the time the witness left.

        18        I am not to be put in the type of straight jacket that 

        19        Mr. Fleming has suggested, because to do so would amount 

        20        to absurdity.  He is able to ask these questions and 

        21        then when I get up to redirect and just get the witness 

        22        through his full testimony with respect to that fact, he 

        23        is objecting.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, well in that context and within the 

        25        reference of the statement of the witness that question 

        26        can be asked and answered by the witness.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  Translator, do you 

        28        want me to repeat or you have the question? 

        29   THE INTERPRETER: Please Counsel, yes.

         1   Q.   Witness, between the time that you saw the bourgmestre 

         2        arrive and when you left office at 3:00, did you see him 

         3        leave the office?

         4   A.   No, unless he left the communal office after I had left, 

         5        therefore, after 3:00, but I have no knowledge of this.

         6   Q.   Sir, where were you standing when you saw Mr. Kajelijeli 

         7        on that day?

         8   A.   When I saw him on that day I was standing on the tarmac 

         9        road at a place where there are kiosks in front of the 

        10        communal office, in front of the Mukingo communal 

        11        office.

        12   Q.   And sir, what were you doing at that location, that 

        13        particular day, that is where you were there in front of 

        14        the Mukingo communal office?  What were you doing there?

        15   A.   I had come to that place to buy an envelope, but as 

        16        there was very little work to do that day at the 

        17        communal office, I remained in this location for a long 

        18        time.

        19   Q.   Now, sir, whom, if anyone -- did you see Kajelijeli on 

        20        that particular day?

        21   A.   I saw him alone in a vehicle.  There was no one else in 

        22        this vehicle.

        23   Q.   And where did you see him go, if anywhere, after you saw 

        24        him at that particular time?

        25   A.   When I saw him he was going towards the communal office, 

        26        and when he came back, he left going in the direction 

        27        from which he had come.

        28   Q.   And what direction was that, sir, what direction?

        29   A.   From the place known as Byangabo.  Byangabo is spelt, 

        30        B-Y-A-N-G-A-B-O. Byangabo.

         1   Q.   Now, sir, do you recall the time that you saw 

         2        Mr. Kajelijeli around what time?

         3   A.   It was around 1:00 p.m. a few minutes after 1:00 pm, but 

         4        not more than fifteen.

         5   Q.   And do you have any idea of how long Mr. Kajelijeli 

         6        remained at that location?

         7   A.   He didn't stay for a long time and I would say that he 

         8        didn't spend more than fifteen minutes approximately at 

         9        that location.

        10   Q.   Sir, can you tell this Trial Chamber why you remember 

        11        the dates and the times that you have so testified on 

        12        the 7th and the 8th of 1994?

        13   A.   If you ask me questions about the times and which events  

        14        took place, I can speak to you of them.

        15   Q.   Witness, the Prosecutor asked you yesterday that the 

        16        events you have testified to occurred over seven years 

        17        eleven months and two weeks, and the question that I am 

        18        asking you is; how do you remember these facts today?

        19   A.   With respect to the date of the 7th, I think that the 

        20        death of a person of a figure such as the president of 

        21        the republic is an important event not only to the 

        22        people of Rwanda who were informed of this event, but 

        23        everyone, the whole world knew that this event took 

        24        place.  I think that even amongst the people who are 

        25        here today, there are people who do not necessarily live 

        26        in Rwanda but who know this date.  You will understand, 

        27        therefore, that I cannot forget this date.  

        28        

        29        Secondly, with respect to the date of the 8th what will 

        30        allow me, what has allowed me to say that I saw

         1        Kajelijeli at the times I have specified is because when 

         2        I saw him on that day, it has been a long time since I 

         3        had last seen him and when I saw him, this occurred 

         4        during our break and this is the break that we have work 

         5        and so, therefore, it was those two elements that 

         6        allowed me to remember that specific time.

         7   Q.   Now, sir, you were asked questions about the court of 

         8        appeal, do you know any personal facts concerning the 

         9        incidents that occurred at the court of appeal?

        10   A.   What I learned and what was announced on the radio was 

        11        that the building in which the court of appeal in 

        12        Ruhengeri was burnt down during the war.  That is what I 

        13        heard about this court of appeal.

        14   Q.   Was that in 1992 or 1994?

        15   A.   It is in 1992.

        16   Q.   Sir, do you know Esimbi house?

        17   A.   Yes.

        18   Q.   How do you know the Esimbi house?

        19   A.   I know the so-called Esimbi house because the word 

        20        Esimbi appears on the building.  Moreover, the building 

        21        is near the tarmac road and it is near the Byangabo 

        22        market.  This is what has allowed me to know of the 

        23        Esimbi house.

        24   Q.   And, sir, how do you know of activities, what activities 

        25        -- of the activities which took place within that place, 

        26        the Esimbi house?

        27   A.   As I have told you that the house was near the road.  It 

        28        was wasn't difficult to know the activities that took 

        29        place in this house, and I can say that from the tarmac 

        30        road up until Esimbi house the distance is not more than

         1        five metres.

         2   Q.   And how do you know that no military training took place 

         3        in front of that house?

         4   A.   I said this because on any of the occasions I went by 

         5        that house, I never saw any military training taking 

         6        place there and I never heard anyone say any military 

         7        training took place in front of that house.

         8   Q.   Do you know whether there was a pharmacy at that 

         9        location in the Esimbi house?

        10   A.   That's correct.

        11   Q.   Do you know during what time period this house was used 

        12        as a pharmacy?

        13   A.   That was in 1993.  I know well before that.  I remember 

        14        that there was a pharmacy in that building.

        15   Q.   Do you know whether or not that pharmacy continued up to 

        16        1994?

        17   A.   After 1994, the pharmacy no longer existed because the 

        18        building was destroyed.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: No further questions of this witness.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.  Thank you very much.  

        21        Judge Ramaroson has questions to put to the witness.

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you, Mr. President.

        23   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  Witness, were you an Adventist all your 

        24        life?

        25   THE WITNESS: Yes, that's correct.

        26   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Why did you say that you went to mass and 

        27        that is where you got to know Kajelijeli?  You said that 

        28        you went to mass at Busogo parish?  Witness, I will 

        29        read, "We went to the same church at Busogo church and 

        30        that is where I got to know him".

         1   THE WITNESS: That is what I said.

         2   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  So, are you both a Catholic and an 

         3        Adventist?

         4   THE WITNESS: No, I will explain if you wish me to do so.  I 

         5        said that I went to the Busogo parish but that was for 

         6        the fourth year primary school.  I was instructed with 

         7        other young people.  I think it was at that time that I 

         8        knew Kajelijeli and I have just admitted that I was an 

         9        Adventist throughout my life because it was at that 

        10        church that I was baptised and I have never been 

        11        baptised as a Catholic.  Moreover, my parents were 

        12        Adventist themselves and they couldn't allow me to go to 

        13        any other church.

        14   JUDGE RAMAROSON: In 1994 therefore, you didn't go to the 

        15        Busogo parish?

        16   THE WITNESS: Even before 1994, I never went to that church 

        17        apart from the 68, I was 13 years old at that time, 

        18        apart from that year, the following years, my parents 

        19        wouldn't allow me to go to any other church apart from 

        20        the Adventist church.

        21   JUDGE RAMAROSON: You know the Mukingo communal office very 

        22        well?  Was there a youth office in that establishment?

        23   THE WITNESS: There was an office given to the person 

        24        responsible for youth but then afterwards, he moved 

        25        opposite that communal office and there was training and 

        26        it was called CCBFP.

        27   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Well, you seem not to know anything about 

        28        the Interahamwe but that person was trainer of the  

        29        Interahamwe, do you know that?

        30   THE WITNESS: No, I do not -- I don't know that because I

         1        never realised that and if there is this person who says 

         2        so that is his own responsibility.

         3   JUDGE RAMAROSON: My last question is; so far secteur 

         4        conseillers you knew their meetings.  How many 

         5        conseillers were there?

         6   THE WITNESS: Well, before the fusion Mukingo had eight.  It 

         7        means eight conseillers, but now it is joined with 

         8        Nyakinama secteur.

         9   JUDGE RAMAROSON: When the secteur conseillers met, what did 

        10        they talk about?  Did they talk about security, because  

        11        on account of the events and the troubled times did they 

        12        talk about security?

        13   THE WITNESS: Yes, that's correct.  During the meetings of the 

        14        secteur conseillers they talked about security but not 

        15        too much I would say because in that area there was 

        16        fighting and even in the neighbouring communes where 

        17        there was no fighting.  We are talking about secteurs 

        18        and all the neighbouring secteurs; Busogo there was 

        19        fighting.  There was killing in Busogo.

        20   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Did the conseillers not talk about that?  

        21        They didn't talk about that and made decisions?

        22   THE WITNESS: Thank you.  Well the events that you referred to 

        23        did take place during various periods of time.  It was 

        24        the death of the president of the Republic, it was after 

        25        that time that hostilities intensified and then we had 

        26        to run away.

        27   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  No, no. The secteur conseillers did not   

        28        meet after the 6th of April?

        29   THE WITNESS: They did meet.

        30   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Well, what did they talk about?  What was

         1        the agenda?

         2   THE WITNESS: During this meeting, they talked about security.

         3   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Did they talk about the assassinations and 

         4        the murders that took place at Busogo in the environs?

         5   THE WITNESS: Yes, they did.

         6   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And what did they decide?  Did they know who 

         7        were the killers, the assassins?  Did they talk about 

         8        that?  Did they talk about the Interahamwe and what were 

         9        the decision they arrived at?

        10   THE WITNESS: As far as that issue is concerned, the decision 

        11        was that they should resort to the military.  That was 

        12        their decision.

        13   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  What about the dead, what decisions did 

        14        they arrive at?

        15   THE WITNESS:  For the dead, they decided to bury the bodies. 

        16   JUDGE RAMAROSON: What was the military supposed to do?

        17   THE WITNESS: The military were supposed to protect people 

        18        where they found refuge.  That is what the participants 

        19        at that meeting thought. 

        20   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Those people, who were Tutsi? 

        21   THE WITNESS: Absolutely, they were Tutsi.

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And who were these people supposed to 

        23        protect them?

        24   THE WITNESS: The military was supposed to surround the places 

        25        where the refugees were but that was impossible as there 

        26        were no soldiers to do that job and people were 

        27        therefore killed.

        28   JUDGE RAMAROSON: But who attacked those people, who attacked 

        29        them?  Was it the population, Interahamwe, who?  It is 

        30        just not clear.

         1   THE WITNESS: I personally do not know.

         2   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you very much.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Judge Maqutu has a question to the 

         4        witness.

         5   JUDGE MAQUTU: The questions I am going to put to you follow  

         6        from what you have just said in answer to Judge 

         7        Ramaroson.  But then you see, there has been evidence on 

         8        record that Kajelijeli protected the Tutsi and even put 

         9        them in ISAE; is that so earlier whilst he was still 

        10        bourgmestre?

        11   THE WITNESS: That's correct.

        12   JUDGE MAQUTU: And there has been evidence that people had 

        13        been attacked by people who had burned their houses and 

        14        so they had to run to Kajelijeli as the bourgmestre to 

        15        protect them and even to provide some gendarmes to 

        16        protect them?

        17   THE WITNESS: Yes, sir, at the time he was bourgmestre that 

        18        did thus happen because that happened in 1992.

        19   JUDGE MAQUTU: So, young people did attack Tutsis and forced 

        20        them -- and burned their houses and forced them to go to 

        21        Kajelijeli for assistance?

        22   THE WITNESS: I was not aware of the fact that houses were 

        23        burnt, sir.

        24   JUDGE MAQUTU: But Tutsis were put in fear and they had to run 

        25        to the bourgmestre for protection?

        26   THE WITNESS: There are two periods to be distinguished 1992 

        27        and 1994.  In 1992 that was the time Kajelijeli was 

        28        bourgmestre.  People talked about the burning of the 

        29        court of appeal.  At the time I didn't hear anything 

        30        about houses being burned.  Houses were burned in 1994

         1        as far as I know, sir.

         2   JUDGE MAQUTU: I am interested in 1992 when the Tutsis had to  

         3        seek refuge at the ISAE as they were protected by 

         4        Kajelijeli.  I am merely trying to find out whether they 

         5        were attacked by young people and their houses burnt and 

         6        you said yes, but you were not aware of houses being 

         7        burnt?  So, I am not concerned with 1994.

         8   THE WITNESS:  Yes sir, 1992, it should have been, I wasn't 

         9        aware of any place where houses were burnt, sir.

        10   JUDGE MAQUTU: Thank you. 

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: I have one or two questions, trying to 

        12        understand to get some clarification; on the 8th of 

        13        April 1994 in the afternoon at about 1:00 p.m. or 1:15 

        14        p.m. as you said in your evidence, you saw Kajelijeli go 

        15        towards the communal office while you were on the road 

        16        at the kiosk; is that correct?

        17   THE WITNESS: That is correct, sir.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Do I understand that.  That is where I want 

        19        you to confirm -- he did not stop, he just passed by; is 

        20        it so?

        21   THE WITNESS: He did not stop on the road, sir.  He stopped at 

        22        the Mukingo communal office, sir.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Did he talk to you, did he see you -- did he 

        24        talk to you?

        25   THE WITNESS: No sir, he did not talk to me because he did not 

        26        stop at the kiosk where I was. He stopped at the 

        27        communal office, sir.  It is even possible that he did 

        28        not see me, sir.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Now, since that day, that date and that time, 

        30        when did you see Kajelijeli again?

         1   THE WITNESS: It was not too long after that I saw him again 

         2        on the 9th at the burial of Bourgmestre Harerimana, sir.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: After the burial of the bourgmestre when did 

         4        you see him again; when did you meet him again?

         5   THE WITNESS: I saw him again when he was appointed as the 

         6        person in charge of the commune.  That was for a short 

         7        period of time before we fled, sir.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: And after you had fled, I don't know that you 

         9        fled.  When did you meet again?

        10   THE WITNESS: It was yesterday that I saw him again, sir.  

        11        After we fled, it was only yesterday that I saw him 

        12        again, sir.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Did you keep in touch?

        14   THE WITNESS: No, sir. 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you. 

        16   THE WITNESS: I heard about him on the 20th of March, the year 

        17        2000 when I met the Defence team for Kajelijeli, sir. 

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Before we conclude the testimony of this 

        19        witness, Mr. Fleming, you made reference to the 

        20        statement of the witness in your cross-examination and 

        21        you did put to him a couple of specific paragraphs and 

        22        areas that the witness responded to?

        23   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT:  Do you intend to produce that statement as 

        25        highlighting the areas that you referred to in your 

        26        cross-examination as that has been the practice before?

        27   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour, we intend to do that.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Are you ready to do that now?

        29   MR. FLEMING:  Yes.

         1        objection to the --

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Not in principle, Your Honour, but I have an 

         3        objection with the process that we are proceeding with.  

         4        It has not been, in the past, an ex parte proceeding and 

         5        so therefore I do not know what we are doing now.  In 

         6        the past, we have submitted whatever is going to be our 

         7        submission to the Prosecutor for their objection and 

         8        observations, and that, I think, that is what has 

         9        happened, that they elected at some point in time to 

        10        submit statements of their own if there were objections 

        11        and etcetera.  So, what has happened, there have been 

        12        two submissions in most cases where we, in fact, have 

        13        highlighted certain areas, they highlighted the other.  

        14        And so if the record is seen, you would see that with 

        15        respect to witnesses where we submitted our documents, 

        16        the Prosecutor have generally submitted another 

        17        document.  And so minimally, we should be given an 

        18        opportunity to see whatever they are submitting, to see 

        19        whether or not we object to whatever -- whether it 

        20        should not be an exparte proceeding.

         1        1100H

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  It is not an exparte proceeding.  I think 

         3        what we are asking them to do, is to see whether or not 

         4        they are going to put formally the areas -- the 

         5        paragraphs referred to in their cross-examination in the 

         6        context or with regard to the statement of the witness.  

         7        Certainly, it cannot be formally produced and tendered 

         8        into evidence before the other side has been able to see 

         9        it.  We are -- perhaps one can see from the recalling of 

        10        the various parts that we are referred to, but I think 

        11        in fairness, of course, you will have to see and see the 

        12        areas that are highlighted and that in turn be formally 

        13        produced into evidence.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS:   What we have done also in the past, 

        15        Your Honour, because of the -- just the procedure in 

        16        doing it, we have waived the appearance of the witness.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, that is exactly why I am raising this 

        18        issue, because if it has to be done, it has to be done 

        19        in the presence of the witness, but that requirement can 

        20        be waived.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That is right.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  If you need to work out with your colleagues 

        23        on the other side --

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That has been the practice, Your Honour.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  And, we should imagine we will be using 

        26        the original English text.  We have had the practice of 

        27        making photocopies and highlighting copies so that the 

        28        originals are made available -- they remain available to 

        29        the parties.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, Your Honour.  In fact, we have 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

                  KAJELIJELI                                2 OCTOBER 2002




         1        provided copies of the original to the Prosecution side.  

         2        They have, and all of the witnesses were presented.  So 

         3        far where they are having statements, I think they have 

         4        compared the originals with the copies they have, but 

         5        that's up to them, whatever they want to do.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right.  So, in other words, you would 

         7        need, according to you -- according to the Defence 

         8        Counsel, you want to see first what areas have been 

         9        highlighted; is that correct?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That is correct, Your Honour.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  Before you decide whether to object or not to 

        12        object?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That is right, Your Honour.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right, that can be done.  Can we then get 

        15        agreed that we excuse the witness.  We can sort it out 

        16        either today or if agreed upon, if you need more time, 

        17        you can deal with it when we next meet, as long as the 

        18        witness is excused, because we are going to release him 

        19        immediately after this.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That is all right, Your Honour.

        21   MR. FLEMING:  Yes, Your Honour.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right.  So, you will get copies from your 

        23        colleague and see what use you will make of them after 

        24        that.

        25        

        26        All right.  Now, Interpreter, could you, please, tell  

        27        Witness RHU31, that this marks the end of his evidence.  

        28        We thank him.

        29   THE WITNESS:  Thank you, sir.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  We will have time at a later stage to 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        consider and view his evidence together with all the 

         2        evidence that is going to be adduced in the course of 

         3        this trial.  But, once again, we thank him, and he may 

         4        leave.

         5   THE WITNESS:  Thank you, sir.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Professor Hinds, how do we go from here?  

         7        Who is the next witness?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, as I have said on the record 

         9        before, and as the Chamber is undoubtedly aware, based 

        10        upon communications we have had with the victim and 

        11        witness protection, the latest that I have -- that I 

        12        know now, there are two witnesses; RHU24 and RHU29, who 

        13        I am told are scheduled to be here within the next day 

        14        or two.  I am told that.  Now, those are witnesses whom 

        15        we had not planned, quite frankly, to call at this 

        16        stage.  But, given the fact that the witnesses that we 

        17        had --

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  What is the problem?  The witness can leave.

        19   THE WITNESS:  I should like to make a request, Mr. President, 

        20        if possible.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Very briefly, please.

        22   THE WITNESS:  Sir, as I just said, the last time, that is, 

        23        ever since we fled, I only saw him yesterday.  Could you 

        24        allow me just two minutes just to greet him?

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Well, maybe we will ask the registry and all 

        26        those others concerned to see whether that is possible 

        27        afterwards -- the relevant organs.  Please, registry, 

        28        take note of that.

        29   MR. KIYEYEU:  We have taken note, My Lord.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can you translate that to the witness?

         1   THE WITNESS:  Most grateful, sir.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Yes, sorry, Counsel, we were 

         3        discussing the last two witnesses, 24, 29.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes.  As I have said to the Court, we had 

         5        not planned to call those witnesses at this stage of the 

         6        proceedings.  I sent a communication to Mr. Fleming on 

         7        September 6th, in which he sent out the order of 

         8        presentation.  We had hoped to present the detained four 

         9        detainees, but since they had not arrived and since 

        10        there seemed to be some problems whether or not they 

        11        would arrive, we then decided that we would bring these 

        12        other two witnesses.  And so, that is the plan at this 

        13        stage.  They are not here now.  I am also told that the 

        14        detained witnesses most likely will be here this 

        15        weekend.  At which stage, we would opt to put them up 

        16        first rather than RHU24/29.  In any event, if those 

        17        witnesses are here, we will make an evaluation with 

        18        respect to their presentation, but they will not, quite 

        19        frankly -- our plan was not to put them on at this 

        20        particular stage.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Of course, next week we have only four days 

        22        of trial.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Well, our plan as set forth in our 

        24        submissions, was to present a total of about 

        25        14 witnesses, 14/15 witnesses.  That was our plan.  

        26        To date, we have now submitted -- we have put on ten 

        27        witnesses.  These other two, it will be twelve.  This is 

        28        the situation where witnesses that we are producing are 

        29        protected witnesses.  Everything is not within our 

        30        control.  So, I don't -- I cannot have -- there are 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        certain limits that victims and witness protection unit 

         2        have given to us, in terms of the length of time that we 

         3        have to give them notice for them to have the witnesses, 

         4        the number of witnesses that they can bring, and our 

         5        estimation of how long it would take for these witnesses 

         6        to be -- to give their testimony and then leave so that 

         7        there would be enough room wherever they are being kept.  

         8        So these are some of the logistical issues we are 

         9        dealing with.  But at this point, I am told that two 

        10        witnesses are on their way and the four detained 

        11        witnesses just about all of the procedures, including 

        12        the authorisation from the Rwandan authorities have been 

        13        complied with, I am told.  So, therefore, we should have 

        14        them here to go full steam ahead.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  So, what do you propose we do today?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS:  What am I proposing?  I am making no 

        17        proposal.  We don't have any witnesses.  I don't know 

        18        what we will do.  Well, since the Defendant does not 

        19        have any witnesses at this particular time, we are 

        20        requesting that the matter be adjourned until Monday.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Mr. Fleming?

        22   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.  We can't propose that 

        23        at all, except we are disappointed that we cannot 

        24        proceed.  But there are a couple of other issues that I 

        25        want to raise with the Court.

        26        

        27        First, we need to know which witnesses are being called, 

        28        in which order.  We have been very, very flexible and we 

        29        will continue to be.  So, we would request that our 

        30        learned friends tell us that by, hopefully, tomorrow or 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        34


                  KAJELIJELI                                2 OCTOBER 2002




         1        something like that because we have to know what we are 

         2        doing.

         3        

         4        Second, we are concerned about the material that we are 

         5        receiving.  The last witness said that he corrected the 

         6        statement, yet we received a document which had the 

         7        errors in -- knowingly had errors in.  So, we are 

         8        working with erroneous material, that is, depending on 

         9        the view that one takes of that witness.

        10        

        11        Third, Your Honours will recall that I made a request of 

        12        my learned friend to know which witnesses they are, in 

        13        fact, calling in the whole of their case, given that 

        14        there were no longer the allegations of war crimes to 

        15        meet, and our learned friend said he would tell us when 

        16        he was ready.  We want to know whether he is ready yet, 

        17        and to tell the Court which witnesses he is actually 

        18        calling.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Counsel.  Yes, Professor Hinds.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS:  May I deal with this seriatim?

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, first of all, we have 

        23        attempted to communicate with Mr. Fleming.  In fact, I 

        24        do it almost daily, letting him know where we are with 

        25        the witnesses, what we propose to do and how we propose 

        26        to do it.  If he wants me to reduce it to writing, I can 

        27        do it, but I think that I have been trying to be as 

        28        communicative and as open with him on our situation.  

        29        So, there is no surprise.  I told him about witnesses 24 

        30        and 29 yesterday or the day before yesterday.  I gave 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        35


                  KAJELIJELI                                2 OCTOBER 2002




         1        him the progress report yesterday.  I told him exactly 

         2        what I am telling you.  So, I am not quite sure exactly 

         3        what he is trying to communicate to the Court.  But if 

         4        he wants something in writing, I am prepared to do that.  

         5        Concerning the order of presentation, we will let him 

         6        know when the witnesses show up, I mean, I cannot tell 

         7        him the order of presentation, except to say to him, if 

         8        we have the detained witnesses here first, I will go 

         9        with them.  They were scheduled and they had notice of 

        10        this on September 6th.  Those are the people whom we had 

        11        scheduled to testify as soon as they were available.  

        12        They haven't been, so, therefore, we have put other 

        13        witnesses in their place and he has indicated that was 

        14        all right with him.  The four witnesses who have 

        15        testified were out of order because the detained 

        16        witnesses were not here.  And so, as soon as we get any 

        17        word as to who is here, we will advise them, and we will 

        18        advise them in writing.

        19        

        20        Concerning whom we intend to omit from our list with 

        21        respect to the issue of war crimes, I indicated that we 

        22        are only dealing with expert witnesses, and that was 

        23        only going to go to the issue of whether or not the 

        24        conflict was of an international nature.  There are no 

        25        factual witnesses that we are calling with respect to 

        26        war crimes.  This is a case in which Mr. Kajelijeli is 

        27        alleged to be in certain places at certain times, doing 

        28        certain acts.  We contest all of that, and we are 

        29        meeting the Prosecution's case head-on, witness after 

        30        witness on the issues.   The war crimes, we maintain, 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        they could meet their burden; they agreed do it that's 

         2        out.  The only issue with respect to war crimes were the 

         3        issues relating to expert witness, and we felt we needed 

         4        an expert witness on that issue.  And so, since that is 

         5        not the case as I indicated earlier, we would advise 

         6        them.  Quite frankly, I just haven't had the time to 

         7        send them a note on it, but I will do it now that we are 

         8        adjourned for a couple of days.  I will do it today -- 

         9        tomorrow, but it is only one witness who is an expert 

        10        witness.  There are no other factual witnesses that we 

        11        are calling on that issue.  All of the other factual 

        12        witnesses that we have dealt with, material and relevant 

        13        facts with respect to the allegations in counts 1 

        14        through 9, of the indictment.  Thank you.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, thank you, Learned Counsel.

        16   MR. KIYEYEU:  I would like to have the floor, My Lord.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

        18   MR. KIYEYEU:  Maybe it is good at this point to inform the 

        19        Honourable Chamber that the witnesses have not been 

        20        brought to Arusha due to the late submission of the 

        21        identification forms from the Defence.  Now, we would 

        22        like, also, the Defence to undertake before the Chamber 

        23        that they will, in future, as we go along, submit their 

        24        requests in good time to enable the registry to work on 

        25        the documents in good time, so that witnesses could be 

        26        before the Chamber in good time.  We just need their 

        27        undertaking.  Thank you, My Lord.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, we have seen the correspondence and we 

        29        take note of that.  Yes, I think you can easily work it 

        30        out.  I know it is not easy.  And Professor Hinds, you

         1        have said that until the witnesses arrive in Arusha -- 

         2        to know exactly how things would be shaped up on the 

         3        ground.  But as your colleagues have requested, whenever 

         4        the witnesses arrive, I think it is good that they be 

         5        appraised as to the order, so that they too can prepare 

         6        their respective positions with regard to those 

         7        witnesses.  I think it is important.  I hope this matter 

         8        should be kept alive and by either tomorrow or Friday, 

         9        you can exchange this kind of information.  It is 

        10        important.

        11        

        12        We also appreciate the kind of arrangement you have 

        13        worked out, whereby we have been able to take all these 

        14        witnesses, sometimes at the shortest notice, between the 

        15        two sides, which has been very good.

        16        

        17        As we are approaching the end of this session, it may be 

        18        also appropriate, Professor Hinds and the Defence in 

        19        general, to see whether or not after the witnesses that 

        20        have testified, whether there would be any need of 

        21        cutting down on some of the witnesses listed, because it 

        22        is important, so that we may be able to plan how to 

        23        handle effectively the forthcoming session in November.  

        24        So, it may be important to have some indications on 

        25        that.  It may not be now, but at least by the end of 

        26        next week before this session comes to an end.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, Your Honour, bearing on -- we reviewed 

        28        Rule 73D and we are conscious of that.  In fact, this 

        29        weekend, our team will be going over our pre-trial brief 

        30        with respect to making some decisions about the number

         1        of witnesses.  We certainly don't want to deal with 

         2        redundancy and so, therefore, we are looking at the 

         3        number of witnesses.  But I can say to you, that the way 

         4        I am trying this case -- we are dealing with contested 

         5        facts and the witnesses dealing with those particular 

         6        facts -- and that is what they have been produced to 

         7        deal with.  And so, as we look at them, we are now 

         8        making some decisions.  We have only had four, five 

         9        witnesses so far.  Those four, five witnesses, one 

        10        witness spoke about Busogo, that is all.  We have had 

        11        another witness, who, in fact, talked about being saved 

        12        by Kajelijeli and so on, and relating to part of the 

        13        alibi.  We have had a third witness who talked about 

        14        contesting a Prosecution witness, with respect to 

        15        whether or not she was beaten, whether or not her child 

        16        was raped, and whether or not, she, in fact, was present 

        17        when she testified to that extent to the Court.  And 

        18        then, there was the fourth witness that we have just 

        19        heard, who is now talking about a number of events 

        20        relating to contesting, in particular, GAP.  So, as we 

        21        look at our case and as you look at it, you will see 

        22        that our witnesses are going to, in fact, deal with 

        23        discrete issues.  The Prosecution's case presented three 

        24        witnesses on Busogo; they presented two or three 

        25        witnesses on Rwankeri, and, so, we have to analyse their 

        26        case in terms of the number of witnesses they put 

        27        forward.  There is no issue about redundancy, I made no 

        28        -- you know -- they put on their case and we are meeting 

        29        it.  Thank you, Your honour.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  So, that is the invitation.  As to the

         1        question of correction, we will comment no further, 

         2        because we don't know how it will be shaped.  So, that 

         3        one can be worked out among the parties.  

         4        

         5        So, we will adjourn these proceedings to Monday,

         7        stand adjourned.
