WITNESS ALG
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness ALG.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	In the course of your testimony yesterday you made reference to a tour of the community that you did on the 13th of April 1994.  Do you recall that? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	Was that the only occasion on which you did a tour of the community over the period to July 3, 1994? 
A.	No, from time to time, when I deemed it necessary to go to certain places, I would go to those places.  Or sometimes I went to certain locations at the request of the préfet or at the request of those in charge of civil defence.  So, I went to certain places at different times.  I remember the time when I was working with************************************************************, because a (unintelligible) of the *****************************************on several occasions.  I do not know if I had already stated that*** ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************, and it was UNAMIR handling that issue.  So I travelled to Gitarama to check on my family.  

Those were the number of occasions when I travelled to certain places.  I remember that at some point in time ********************************************************************************************************* **********************************
Q.	Thank you.  Over the course of your touring of the community, did the general situation, roadblocks and killings of the Tutsis, remain the same? 
A.	Concerning the state of affairs at roadblocks or in people's homes, the situation gradually calmed down.  The situation wasn't in places where people had sought refuge like churches, mosques, classrooms, all those places where people had sought refuge.  Interahamwe, soldiers, gendarmes, and some policemen, would attack those locations and kill lots of people there. 
Q.	I'm not sure if I understood your answer.  In relation to the situation at the roadblocks, the killings that you said were taking place at the roadblocks and the killings that you stated were now taking place at the places of refuge.  Could you clarify that for me? 
A.	Counsel, I have told you that in the early days it is obvious that at the roadblocks people kept on requesting identification papers and other documents.  But what led to late April or even in the month of May and June attacks centred mainly around places of refuge.  I know that there were people who succeeded in crossing roadblocks and seeking refuge in the various buildings, believing that they would escape the massacres, however, the Interahamwes kept on attacking those places and many people died there.

So, you need to understand about something in people's homes or the various places of refuge or along the main roads or at the roadblocks there were casualties in churches, mosques or other buildings where people took shelter.  Those places came under attack, and the attackers killed lots of people who had sought refuge there. 
Q.	Apart from the observations that you made personally, were reports made to you by other persons concerning what they observed as taking place? 
A.	That's right.  I received the reports. 
Q.	How were the reports made to you, were they oral or were they in writing? 
A.	On account of the prevailing circumstances, I received the reports orally. 
Q.	And in fulfillment of your responsibilities, did you pass these reports on to Préfet Renzaho? 
A.	That's right, whenever I received reports I passed them on to Préfet Renzaho.  I'm sorry, there is one occasion when I did not convey a report to him, but most of the time I sent such reports to him.  I am thinking about the incident regarding the***********************.  It was realised that there were ICRC employees amongst the people there.  Not everybody knew me, so I was asked to identify myself.  I am talking about the ladies we found at the************************.  So I had to give my identity and other details concerning me.  Those people did not really want to receive me.  They wanted to meet the préfet to ask him about the whereabouts of their husbands who had been taken away by soldiers.  

	Even though I received such requests and grievances, I was afraid to convey same to him because I knew that there were other reports in that connection which I had already conveyed to him and in which I said, for instance, that Interahamwe were killing people.  But his reaction was rather negative.  When he met those Interahamwes, the Interahamwe would threaten me, accordingly.  On account of that experience, I did not brief him on such reports which I received from people who had grievances.  Otherwise, most of the reports I received were channeled to the préfet. 
Q.	I need you to explain, Witness, what you mean when you say Renzaho's reaction to your report was negative.  
A.	I would like to clarify this matter.  You see, what I was telling you is that I reported to him about some notorious Interahamwe who were killing people.  I even gave him names.  I asked him to summon those Interahamwe so as to sanction them.  There are examples which I can mention.  Instead of summoning and sanctioning those people, whenever those people came back from his office they would ask me why I had denounced them to the préfet and they would boast that they were not in any way punished, rather they were certainly telling me I was an accomplice and that I may suffer the consequences of that.  

I have in mind the example of that Interahamwe called******.  He was known as ******************but his nickname was********.  That gentleman called ********was once summoned by the préfet, he was accompanied by his bodyguards, and once he got out of the préfet's office he came and asked me why I had gone to report him to the préfet.  And he told me I could suffer the consequences of my act.  Instead of being sanctioned, he, rather, showed me a fuel coupon which he had just received from the préfet.  

So, on account of such circumstances, I realised that there were certain things I could not report to him about.  It was not only*******.  There were other Interahamwes whom I reported on but nothing was done to sanction them, and here I'm thinking about one *************(phonetic). 
Q.	Okay, Witness, apart from reports that Renzaho would have received, was he also present in PVK over the period to the 3rd of July? 
A.	That's right.  He was present at the Kigali-ville préfecture office, except when he went to a location where he had accommodated his family; otherwise, he moved around the various secteurs.  He would also go to UNEDEF (phonetic) and to general staff headquarters.  So, when he moved about he would go to those places.  Then he would not be in the Kigali-ville préfecture office.  But I would say that he was at the préfecture of Kigali-ville up until the 3rd of July, in general terms.  And, also let me add that it was the préfet who asked us to flee when the time came. 
Q.	Do you know if Renzaho made reports to the national executive bureau of the MRND concerning the situation in PVK? 
A.	What I can say in this connection is that on several occasions, when we were at the Kigali-ville préfecture office, he would tell us he was going or that he had gone to Murambi, which was the seat of the government.  He went in on several occasions.  We heard that he had gone to brief the people there regarding the situation in Kigali-ville préfecture.  That is when he went to Murambi, which was the seat of the interim government.  

Now, even before that government, I would like to clarify a small matter.  Once the government set up at Gitarama the director of cabinet and the ministry of interior and community development did not go immediately.  I think there was a meeting which he co-chaired with the préfet before he went to Murambi.  I am referring here to Callixte Kalimanzira.  So you certainly understand that Callixte Kalimanzira would report on the situation at Kigali-ville préfecture once he went to Murambi 
Q.	Are you aware of a meeting that was held on the 10th of April 1994 at the Hôtel de Diplomates?
A.	Did you say the 10th or the 11th?  I cannot remember the exact date, but since I did not attend that meeting I learned from other people that such a meeting had taken place, but I was not in attendance. 
Q.	Who told you about the meeting? 
A.	It was Pierre Claver, the former bourgmestre of Kacyiru.  There were certain conseillers, such as the conseiller of Bilyogo, the conseiller of the Nyarugenge who told me about it.  There were other Interahamwe who attended that meeting, and some of the names which come to mind are, well, just give me a moment, I will be able to remember the names.  Yes, Bernard Maniragaba, Joseph Setiba, there's one other fellow called Bisearenge Jean Nepomyscene.  There is another name which comes to mind, Conseiller Odette Nyirabagenzi also talked about it. 
Q.	What were you told about the discussions at that meeting?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to object to evidence concerning this meeting since it is not pled in the indictment.  I will acknowledge that it is contained in the witness summary that accompanied the pre-trial brief but inasmuch as it is not in the indictment, the indictment is defective in that respect, I ask evidence of this meeting be excluded.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
My brief response would be that the Defence were notified in a timely, clear, and consistent manner pursuant to the annex in the PTB in relation to this meeting.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As referred to in the pre-trial brief.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
The summary of the witness statement is an annex to the pre-trial brief, Mr. President, and it is clearly set out there, at least.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we see the reference in the -- Mr. Robinson I think we have to overrule this objection.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  I understand, Mr. President.  Mr. President just to inform you of what I'm doing, it is our position, if the indictment is defective, I'm going to make an objection.  The Appeals Chamber has held while the indictment may be cured by a reference to a pre-trial brief that that should be the exception and that the cumulative nature of curing may render a trial unfair.  So every time something is not in the indictment I'll point it out to you.  When it is in the pre-trial brief I'll let you know.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand the principle.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Well, Mr. President, it is actually paragraph 38 of the indictment.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, paragraph 38 of the indictment speaks of the pacification meeting that was held.  This is not the same meeting, so this is a meeting that is completely different than what is described in paragraph 38, although it occurred on the same day.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Am I allowed to proceed, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, proceed.
BY MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Q.	Yes, Witness, you can tell us what was reported to you on the discussions that took place at that meeting.  
A.	Madam Prosecutor, that meeting was organized, particularly for the Interahamwe.  It was chaired by party president, Mathieu in the presence of the secretary-general.  They discussed the prevailing situation in the country and they told them that what they had been told had, indeed, happened.  Once the head of state had been killed, it was necessary to mobilise so as to support the army and comply with the orders of the army.  We were requested to ensure security within the city and to man roadblocks, so as to prevent Inkotanyi infiltrations.  In a nutshell, that is what I was told, Counsel. 
Q.	Apart from Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Nzirorera, did they mention any other MRND leaders who were present at that meeting? 
A.	From what I remember, those two people's names were mentioned.  There was another meeting which I heard about which was chaired by Colonel Bagosora, but that meeting was different from this one because, in that meeting, ministers and other persons attended, but it is a different meeting.  In the meeting we are talking about the people who briefed me of the discussions mentioned those two names. 
Q.	Yesterday, in your testimony, you touched on the civil defence programme.  I would like to get into some details with you about that programme.  Did Préfet Renzaho convene a meeting to discuss this civil defence programme? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  He convened a meeting in mid-April 1994.  During that meeting he told us that the government had decided to set up in each préfecture a civil defence organ.  Should I carry-on with specifics regarding what he said during that meeting?  

If my memory is not playing tricks with me, this is what he said.  He was accompanied by 
Major Bivamvagara, who was the one in charge of that programme.  Bivamvagara had an assistant who was a lieutenant and whose name I cannot remember.  The préfet said that the major was an army officer who had retired and that the purpose of the civil defence was to ensure the security within Kigali city, and that amongst other duties in connection with the programme young people would be trained so that there they would be fit enough to ensure the security of the town.  And he also said that weapons would be distributed, in fact, firearms would be distributed to those young people and that roadblocks had to be manned and patrols had to be carried out.  He also said that the population had to participate in that endeavour.  That, in a nutshell, is what he explained to us regarding the workings of the civil defence programme 
Q.	Did you understand the civil defence programme to be an MRND programme? 
A.	No, he said it was a programme which had been decided upon by the government.  But from what I observed, the MRND was playing a major role.  I am saying so because, you see, the person who coordinated that programme at national level was Colonel Gasake, who was based in the ministry of defence, yet, I told you yesterday that the defence minister was from the MRND party.  That is the answer I can give you to this- question.  But allow me to add, ma'am, that it is obvious that the MRND was in charge of the president of the republic.  So the president of the republic was a part of the MRND.  Such a programme cannot be implemented without the approval of the president of the republic.  The minister of the interior, the ministry charged with security matters, was occupied by a member of the MRND.  So you can certainly understand that such a programme cannot be implemented without the approval of the interior minister, president of the republic, and army hierarchy. 
Q.	But what was the nature of the involvement of the ministry of the interior in the civil defence programme?  
A.	So you can get it from the name, the ministry of the interior is responsible for home affairs, responsible for territorial administration, responsible for ensuring public order and the security of all Rwandans.  He is the president of the republic`s counsellor in the area of administration.  Two  He played an instrumental role and it was not just anybody who was chosen to handle that office, it was someone with a world of experience in administrative matters and who had worked at the office of the president for a long time.  At that time Edouard Karemera was the one minister of interior.  He was a member of the MRND national executive committee.  He was also vice-president of the MRND. 
Q.	Do you know whether any of the other members of the national executive bureau were involved in the civil defence programme? 
A.	Of course the entire national executive bureau played a part in the civil defence programme.  Let me put it this way, yesterday I told you that there was discussions between the national executive bureau and the army to train the Interahamwe.  The intention was to train them so as to support the army, assist the army in the struggle against the FPR (sic) and I forgot to say yesterday that the préfet had explained that the Interahamwe would be entrusted with guarding the town, the city.  Also, the Interahamwe were established by the national executive bureau.  The Interahamwe were the first to benefit from military training, and when this civil defence programme was established, Interahamwe were the first to be selected.  Of course, once the programme began, other people also received military training, especially the youth groups of the power wings of the other parties.  They were immediately taken in to the civil defence programme, and the national executive bureau must have been in agreement, since Interahamwe would accept all they were ordered to do, instructed to do, everything that the soldiers told them to do. 
Q.	So what, exactly, was the purpose of the civil defence programme?  What was it suppose to do? 
A.	In point of fact, Madam Prosecutor, when we speak of civil defence, to understand exactly what it means, it means in protection of the people, the people had to be protected, so that they wouldn't be attacked.  It was important to ensure that the normal population did not suffer in this bid, but, instead of protecting the civilians -- because they said they were required to protect civilians against attacks by the Inkotanyi -- but, in fact, it was they themselves who wound up killing many members of the population because the Interahamwe and the soldiers were supposed to protect the town, guard the town.  And we were clearly told what civil defence was supposed to consist of.  So I would like it to be understood that instead of ensuring the protection of the civilian population, they just killed them even more. 
Q.	Who were the members of the population who were killed under the civil defence programme? 
A.	Well, as I was saying yesterday, when I began to testify, the Tutsi were killed, as well as Hutus who opposed the established regime, Hutu opponents.  Forgive me for explaining further, but I should like to stress that the Tutsi, -- many Tutsi were killed and one could clearly see that the civil defence was rather established to hunt down the Tutsi.  

Let me explain myself.  Major Bivamvagara, who is in charge of the civil defence programme, one day asked me to accompany -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Bivamvagara, 15.  
THE WITNESS:
-- asked me to accompany him one day into the military training, and when we arrived at Nyamirambo stadium where the young people were being given the military training by the soldiers and when we arrived in Kimisagara, also, he told them, "I hope that you know who is our enemy."  And he said, "The enemy is the Tutsi who protect (sic) our country."  And he emphasised -- it was the second time I heard him speak thus because another time I went with him to the meeting held on the 30th of April 1994, we had been invited by Nyamirambo secteur to the members of the crisis committee of Nyamirambo and when the same major spoke to the assembled people he spoke in much the same tones.  So, you must understand that it is a very sad thing.  I'm really ashamed of the person in charge of the civil defence programme.  Instead of defending the civilian population, he is the one behind the killing.  They were killed instead of being protected.  
BY MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Q.	You said Major Bivamvagara was a retired army officer.  Were other retired army officers or reserve army officers included in the civil defence programme? 
A.	The Interahamwe instructors or the instructors who trained the Interahamwe and other young people were, in fact, reservists, former soldiers, but at that time they were recalled to come and train the Interahamwe and the other young people, to dispense military training.  

I should also like to say that from what I observed among the Interahamwe were also many military reservists 
Q.	From what period did you observe that there were reservists among the Interahamwe? 
A.	I observed that there were reservists -- many reservists among the Interahamwe in about 1992, towards the end of 1992, especially at the time of demonstrations.  And I wish to stress not only were reservists part of the Interahamwe, but even soldiers still in active service would mix with the Interahamwe, would join the Interahamwe at the time of demonstrations. 
Q.	In relation to the civil defence programme, did you observe any involvement of the reservists and the soldiers with the Interahamwe in carrying out the killings? 
A.	I think I answered that in my previous explanation.  The Interahamwe and the soldiers in the civil defence, in fact, indulged in killing.  Of course the instructors and leaders of the Interahamwe and the young people trained knew the ideology.  I suppose that not only did they give them physical training, but they would talk with them and discuss -- speak to them of the ideology.  I know some Interahamwe and some soldiers who killed people.  I have a few names.  I was telling you that the soldier who assisted Major Bivamvagara was a soldier still in active service and the Interahamwe would call him boss.  When he came to see the Interahamwe at the préfecture -- at Kigali urban préfecture, when he came to fetch Major Bivamvagara and he wasn't present he said he was looking for his deputy. 
Q.	Just so that I understand you clearly, Witness, you are saying these are matters within your personal knowledge or they were told to you? 
A.	I heard that with my own ears, and I've told you under what circumstances I heard all that. 
Q.	You did mention accompanying Major Bivamvagara on occasion or occasions when he distributed weapons.  To whom were the weapons distributed? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I think I did talk of that in my preceding explanation.  He distributed those weapons, issued those weapons to the Interahamwe, in particular, whether they had been previously trained or Interahamwe that hadn't yet received training and Interahamwe themselves would go to the Kigali urban préfecture to collect weapons.  I saw them with my own eyes.  With my own eyes.  And I wish to be understood, at that time the term Interahamwe, in addition to the MRND Interahamwe, even the young people of other political parties, such as CDR or PSD power or PL power, even MDR power had come together in a coalition and they all were called Interahamwe.  One didn't speak anymore of the youth of PSD, the youth of the MDR, they were all called Interahamwe. 
Q.	During these events that you've so carefully described for the Court, did you -- did the administrative officials in PVK receive any assistance from the government to stop the killings? 
A.	No assistance could stop the killing, not once.  I never heard that any assistance had been given to halt the killings. 
Q.	Did you ever hear any call by Préfet Renzaho for the killings to stop? 
A.	Once in the course of a security meeting of Kigali urban préfecture I told you that the Interahamwe and other people attended, high-ranking officers, conseillers, per se.  In point of fact, he spoke of it, but not with his heart.  He said, really, it is time for people to stop killing.  He said that in May.  But instead of stopping the killing they went on. 
Q.	Well, were his actions, after making that statement, consistent with the statement? 
A.	What you've said is correct, Madam Prosecutor.  What he said was not from the heart, because what he was saying was in contradiction with his actions. 
Q.	Did you hear a speech by President Sindikubwabo made in Butare on the 19th of April? 
A.	Yes, I heard that speech on the radio. 
Q.	What did you hear and see?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, objection.  It is cumulative and not contained in any of the witness summaries this witness would be addressing this issue.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Well, in the witness summary, Mr. President, there is specific reference to the MRND, the interim government, and the army, doing certain things under the guise of civil defence.  I think it is proper in those circumstances to distinguish the guise from the reality of what was taking place and what was being said by persons in the interim government, in particular.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President -- 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
There is also the will-say statement from this witness of February 17, 2006.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I acknowledge that in the will-say statement of 2006 there is mention of Mr. President Sindikubwabo's speech, but in the summary in the pre-trial brief or the opening statement or the brief itself there is no notice this would be addressed by this witness.  But, moreover, as a measure of judicial economy, we know that there are over 50 speeches in evidence already about what was said by the interim government during this period, and if this witness is going to be addressing this topic we should be prepared for cross-examination on the same topics.
MR. WEBSTER:
I know the Court doesn't like a lot of repartee on legal issues, but this is something we encountered in other witnesses.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, just a second.  I'm trying to locate the reference that Ms. Wallace referred to in the summary.  I have not been able to do this yet.  Could you assist me?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I draw the Court's attention to the third large paragraph toward the bottom of the page, about an inch of the way up there is a -- I can read the statement itself:  "ALG, will also testify that the authorities," and in brackets it states, "MRND, interim government, and army, organised training for army and militiamen under the guise of civil defence."  So it is -- the question is intended to explore the difference between what was being said publicly by officials and what was being practised on the ground, and the speech that we are asking this witness to comment on would illustrate that, but, furthermore, a specific reference to the speech is made in the will-say statement of the 17th of February 2006.  So there is ample notice in terms of what this witness will testify about.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson's objection is that the speech is in evidence already.
MR. WEBSTER:
It is not the speech being in evidence, because we have not only the transcript but the tape, but what is important is how witnesses or persons on the ground understood the speech.  We've always maintained there has been a double language or double speak on the part of authorities and we would like this witness to explain to the Court how he understood that speech.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think that adequate notice was given and the matter about this was the issue of accumulation, but we accept the proposition that what is relevant is the witness's perception and we allow the evidence to be admitted on that background.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
I'm obliged.
BY MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Q.	Please state what you heard President Sindikubwabo say on that occasion, Witness.  
A.	They did not broadcast the entire speech, President Sindikubwabo's entire speech, but extracts were broadcast and the president especially stressed one sentence that was broadcast on several occasions.  The president said, "We have arrived here in Butare but we have observed that it would seem that the population of Butare does not know of the prevalent situation in the country.  They seem not to be concerned by the situation."  That is what he said in brief.  I haven't, of course, quoted word for word what President Sindikubwabo said, but in a few words that's what he said. 
Q.	And what did you understand him to be referring to?  What was your understanding of what he was saying? 
A.	The fact that he said that the population of Butare seemed not to be concerned by the situation, and a view of what happened subsequently, because I did subsequently meet people from Butare.  I was told that before the president came to Butare the local population had not yet begun to commit massacres.  After the president's speech, the local population began killing.  When he said, "It would appear that the population of Butare is not concerned by the fight with the enemy," when he said, "The population of Butare does not know what is happening elsewhere," and when you know that elsewhere the people and the military were killing people, well, he sensitised them to the killing.  And when the president of the republic makes such a speech at any given place it doesn't mean that he is calling on the local population alone -- it doesn't mean he's calling upon the local population alone.  He wasn't only calling upon the population of Butare to kill, he wanted to speak to the entire nation.  So if there were other places where the killing hadn't begun, that they should begin. 
Q.	You will be happy to know I'm on the final question, Mr. Witness.  You mentioned that the government did not do anything to assist the administrative authorities in controlling the killings or stopping the killings.  Given the position that you occupied, what could the government have done to stop the killings?  
A.	Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  That is a very interesting question.  The government -- as you know, the government represents the people and should ensure the people's safety and welfare and ensure them to stop the killing.  You've asked me what the government should do.  Firstly, the authorities, whether the president of the republic or the prime minister, should avoid making speeches that would be divisive.  That was the first thing to do.  You've heard the speeches that were made.  The prime minister made a speech.  The other parties made speeches and encouraged people to kill.  At no time did they say, "Well, we were mistaken, the killing must stop."  Never did any person -- figure of authority do that.  And, secondly, what we observed was that the prime minister, by which I mean all the members of the government, so the prime minister spoke, it was at the Kigali urban préfecture on the 5th of July 1994.  It was supposed to be ceremonies at Amohoro stadium because he said by that date the enemy would be vanquished.  But what he said never happened.  He merely wanted to invite people to come into Kigali, but subsequently he and his government left Kigali and went to Murambi and subsequently to Gisenyi.  So he was inviting the population to come into Kigali, whereas he and his government wanted to leave the city.  I spoke of the people who took part in the killing, it was the Interahamwe and soldiers.  Those Interahamwe were affiliated to a political party.  Most of the members of the government came from that party.  I told you the government was mostly made up of people from the MRND.  The minister of home affairs of the interior was MRND.  The ministry was MRND.  And no one ever spoke to the military and asked them to stop killing members of the population.  No one spoke to the Interahamwe to ask them to stop the slaughter.  

Another thing that I can say is that it was public knowledge that the Interahamwe were killing people.  So, the government should take the decision to arrest the members of that militia, the Interahamwe, because the law -- the introducing multiparty politics forbade political parties -- prohibited political parties from having militias.  Moreover, the radio station, RTLM, encouraged people to kill.  Everyone knew that that radio station only indulged in genocidal ideology and that radio station was never shut down.  That, Madam Prosecutor, is what I have to say in response to the question you put to me.  So the government supported the killing and you must understand that the killing couldn't stop when the highest authorities in the land encouraged them.  Thank you, Madam Prosecutor 
Q.	For completeness, Witness, did you observe any attempt on the part of the MRND national executive bureau to disarm the Interahamwe? 
A.	No way, nothing was done by the bureau, Counsel.
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Mr. President, at this time I am back to the position I was yesterday regarding certain detailed information that the witness would be required to give in closed session.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Short would like to put a question to you, Mr. Witness.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, you say that after the president gave the speech in Butare, to use your words, the local population began killing.  Who, in particular, among the local population, was doing the killing and who was being killed in Butare?  
THE WITNESS:
Just as in the other regions of the country, those being killed were Tutsi, as well as opponents of the regime, and those who were doing the killings were generally soldiers and Interahamwe.  I have explained to you what we ought to mean by Interahamwe during that period.  That is my answer to your question.
JUDGE SHORT:
Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the public, I have to explain that the witness in this trial has been the beneficiary of an order for his protection and one of the elements of that order is that his identity should be concealed from the public.  Now counsel for the Prosecutor has indicated that the next set of questions could produce answers which could reveal the identity of the witness and for this section of his testimony we have to exclude the public.  So we are now going into a closed session for that purpose.
(At this point of the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 14 to 16] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
That may please you, Mr. President, Your Honours, is the examination-in-chief.  

Thank you very much, Witness ALG.  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, your evidence-in-chief has been completed.  You are now going to have to be cross-examined by counsel for the Defence.  But before the cross-examination starts, we will at least have a mid-morning break, and you can commence your break now.  There are a few matters that we will discuss in your absence with counsel.  But you can go on your mid-morning recess now, and you will be notified when we will resume.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What we propose to do is to just have a brief recess now, and then we can come back and deal with the matters which have been -- which we have to address.  

Was there any additional comment that anybody wished to make in response to matters upon which we have to adjudicate, or do we deal only with that what we have at the moment?  Because we would like to give our decision right after the recess.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Oh, boy.  I should have known.  I should have known.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, we did receive the Prosecutor's response this morning, and I would like to, after the break, make a brief submission in response to that, since I haven't had a chance to do anything with it.  But I want to look -- check my jurisprudence and make a brief submission to you after the break.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, I don't really have a submission; I just want to add something from our discussion earlier, because Mr. Robinson's objection about the meeting of the 10th of April is actually stated quite explicitly at paragraph 89 of the pre-trial brief.  So it's not only a summary, but it's explicitly in the pre-trial brief.  But other than that I will rely on the written submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will take -- oh, yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, simply to draw the attention of the Chamber to be letter which we sent to you yesterday explaining to you the situation we find ourselves in, that is, the obligation to send written submissions regarding decisions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we have seen that as well, and we will discuss that after the recess.  

We will take our recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1028H to 1100H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we will hear you now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

So, Mr. President, this is my motion to exclude evidence concerning the presence of Mr. Karemera on the 23rd of October 1993 at the rally at Nyamirambo stadium, and at the meeting of the MRND of 16 January 1994, also at that same stadium.  

Paragraph 25.1 of the indictment deals specifically with that meeting, and alleges that only Mr. Ngirumpatse, among the three accused, participated.  And paragraph 25.3 of the indictment deals with the meeting of the 16th of January 1994, among others, and again charges only Mr. Ngirumpatse with having addressed that meeting.  

So this is a situation unlike other situations we have encountered before where the indictment is very vague or not specific.  This is very specific, and it specifically accuses only one of the three accused of actions in connection with those meetings.  And it's my position that because of that situation, the Prosecution should not be allowed, at this time, to essentially amend its indictment by charging Mr. Karemera with acts connected with those same events.  

Now, as far as the jurisprudence is concerned, in the Bagosora Trial Chamber decision they made a very comprehensive review of the steps in which material facts must appear in an indictment, and which that can be cured if they do not.  And that is the decision on the Ntabakuze motion for exclusion of evidence on the 26th -- 29th of June 2006, and also their decision on Nsengiyumva's motion for exclusion of evidence on the 15th of September 2006.  

And the Trial Chamber said that their approach was first, when a material fact cannot be reasonably related to the indictment, it will be excluded.  But where are the material fact is related only to a vague or general allegation in the indictment, then the Chamber will consider whether notice of that fact was given in the pre-trial brief or the opening statement so as to cure the vagueness of the indictment.  

It is my position that this is not a situation of vagueness of the indictment which can be cured by these other submissions.  The fact that the presence of an Accused at a meeting has been held to be a material fact by this Chamber, and also by Chambers in Nyiramasuhuko case, and the Bagosora case in other decisions, as well as by the Appeals Chamber in the judgment of Kordic and Cerkez, C-E-R-K-E-Z, on 17 December 2004, paragraphs -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry, Mr. President, could counsel slow down a bit, please?  Especially these quotes -- numbers -- names.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So the case I was citing is the Appeals Chamber decision in Prosecutor versus Kordic, that's K-O-R-D-I-C, and Cerkez, that's C-E-R-K-E-Z.  That's the judgment on appeal of the 17th of December 2004, and that's at paragraphs 147 and 148.  

So what we have here is a situation where the material fact, the presence of an Accused at a meeting, is not included in an indictment, not because the indictment is vague, but simply because the indictment only accuses one of the other Accused in that paragraph relating to those specific events.  And it's our position that that cannot be cured by subsequent disclosure, because that is in fact an amendment of the indictment, if it's allowed to accuse another Accused for those same events.  

However, if the Trial Chamber does believe that it's possible to cure such a defect in this instance, I would like you to look at whether in fact clear and consistent notice has been provided to the Defence of Mr. Karemera's participation in those meetings.  

We can start with the pre-trial brief, and as the Prosecutor has pointed out, in paragraph 79 and 80 of the pre-trial brief, they did provide notice that Witness GFJ and UB, among others, would testify that Karemera and other MRND leaders were present at the rally in October of '93, and that Mr. Karemera made a speech at the rally on the 16th of January 1994.  I would point out that in the summary annexed to the pre-trial brief of Witness ALG, while mention is made of the meeting, there is no mention of Mr. Karemera's involvement.  

The next piece of disclosure that we're looking at from the Prosecution relating to this meeting was a letter written by the witness on the 18th of May 19 -- of 2004 that was provided to us by the Prosecution in disclosure.  And in paragraph 2C, he discusses the meeting after the assassination of President Ndadaye, and makes no mention -- he talks of the speech of Karemera, and a speech by Justin Mugenzi.  Makes no mention of Mr. Karemera's participation in that meeting.  

The next document we have is an interview report from the 6th through the 31st of May 2004, and in that interview report he speaks about the protest march that ended up in the Nyamirambo stadium, and talks about Mugenzi making a speech on that occasion, and makes no reference to Mr. Karemera's presence or to any speech by Mr. Karemera.  

And then the Prosecutor, based on those interviews, submitted a will-say statement in June of 2004.  And in paragraph 72B, it discusses the meeting after the death of President Ndadaye, and it discusses speeches by Mugenzi and makes no mention of Mr. Karemera being present.  

And as far as I could tell in subsequent interviews of May -- well, of 2005 and of 2006 by -- of the witness, there's no mention of Mr. Karemera's presence at these meetings or any discussion about these meetings.  

So it's our position that if this were a case where the indictment defect could be cured by clear and consistent notice, that such notice has not been given in this case.  And for those reasons I ask you to exclude evidence of Mr. Karemera's participation in these two meetings.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Now, we had not intended to deliver a decision that was full of jurisprudence.  And, Mr. Robinson, I made that comment in deference to your learned acumen that you have just delivered.  

But I think as a preliminary point we should state that we accepted the argument that Mr. Robinson had made earlier, that curing a defect must be the exception.  And I would just include that the Chamber does agree that when the indictment suffers from numerous defects, there still may be a risk of prejudice to the Accused, even if the defects are found to be cured by post-indictment submissions.  In particular, the accumulation of a large number of material facts not plead in the indictment reduces the clarity and relevancy of that indictment, which may have an impact on the ability of the Accused to know the case he or she has to meet for purposes of preparing an adequate defence.  

Further, while the addition of a few material facts may not prejudice the Defence in the preparation of its case, the addition of numerous material facts increases the risk of prejudice, as the Defence may not have sufficient time and resources to investigate properly all the new material facts.  Thus, where a Trial Chamber considers that a defective indictment has been subsequently cured by the Prosecution, it should further consider whether the extent of the defects in the indictment materially prejudice an accused's right to a fair trial, by hindering the preparation of a proper defence.  

Now, it is quite clear that this jurisprudence requires continuous evaluation of this point.  And even if at this stage we make a ruling that's limited to the issue of the curing of a defect, it does not prejudice subsequent consideration on the concept of the accumulation of curing.  So I think I will just put that as a preliminary point, as we have accepted the proposition that has been advanced on that issue.  

Now, with regard to the specific issues, the first objection raised by Counsel for Nzirorera related to two incidents which were not pleaded in the indictment, relating to the presence of Karemera on the 23rd October 1993 rally at Nyamirambo, and his presence at the 6th of January 1994 rally at Nyamirambo, because his participation was not alleged in the indictment.  

Our view is:  At the moment -- is that the paragraph 79 and 80, although specifying other witnesses -- witnesses other than the current witness, did in fact provide information that testimony will be addressed -- will be adduced on Karemera's attendance with other MRND leaders at those rallies.  We think that that has been sufficient notification for the evidence to be adduced, and we don't -- we are not disposed at this stage to say that merely because the witness statement of this particular witness did not refer to this particular material, that the evidence should be excluded.  We accept it, at the moment, as an issue in the case about which adequate notice has been given.  

Now, on the other hand, we have come to a different view with regard to the complaint about the evidence on the three events on which Interahamwe were said to have killed Tutsis.  Although we have formed the view that the Prosecutor had given notice of this in the indictment in terms of the general allegations made concerning the killings of Tutsi throughout Rwanda, we are satisfied that no notice has been given to the Defence about these matters which would enable them time or facilities to prepare a defence to these allegations.  The first time they would have had notice of these killings was in the witness box yesterday afternoon, and it would be impossible for them to rebut or defend -- present a defence to these allegations.  So for that reason, the reason of fairness to the Defence, we will exclude those -- the evidence of those events.  

That's the decision that we wish to give on these two matters.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I thought there was a third, though.  Wasn't -- my understanding is that the evidence of examples of pre-1994 violence is excluded, but that the evidence of Karemera's presence both on the 23rd of October and the 16th of January of 1994 is admitted.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And then there was a third issue raised by Mr. Weyl.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Wasn't that to do with his letter?  Which we are about to come to.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay, I'm sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't think the third issue had to do with exclusion of testimony.  It had to do with how -- the method of proceeding.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, it was -- my understanding is that Mr. Weyl objected to testimony from ALG concerning Ngirumpatse's responsibility, or implication in the mounting of roadblocks in Kigali following the death of the president.  It's incorporated in my response, and I think he responded to that in writing as well.  So by my understanding, we were to address three separate issues, or three separate objections.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Wasn't that subsumed in the issue of the three events?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, it's a separate issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, could you clarify that, please?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, to my knowledge it is indeed a distinct objection, the objection I raised in the afternoon, and regarding which Mr. Webster filed a written response which is the reason for the discouragement, the tone of discouragement in my letter, where I used the word -- allow me to explain what this discouragement means.  

We make every effort to adapt to debates that are often in English, procedure that is communicated in English, and translations that only -- we only obtain sometimes many months later.  We're making efforts that a person with only one leg should in competition in a marathon with people who have two legs.  We don't understand English.  It's tiring, it's -- and stressful, extremely tiring and stressful, because we're not sure that we understand the language which is not ours, nor can we follow at the speed imposed on us in English, even with all the efforts we make.  

Yesterday morning we received a response from the Prosecutor to our objection.  We made an effort.  It is tiring, and it has tired us.  It is exhausting.  And then again in the afternoon we have another detailed, substantiated response in English which we only understand approximately, and now we have to multiply our efforts to answer in writing, in view of the urgency and the speed of your debates, a response to communications in a language that we only understand by making the biggest possible efforts.  It is no longer possible.  I should ask you, Mr. President, to have concern for the Defence counsel who are French speaking.  There are five of us -- are French speaking, out of six.  All the defendants are French speaking.  If everything is in English, we would -- we would no longer be in the group of athletes with two legs and we would be left by the side of the road.  

I haven't yet responded to the Prosecutor's response to our objection -- you have not yet ruled on our objection of yesterday afternoon.  I'm sure that when we have the translation of the Prosecutor's response, we will be able to produce a reply that will convince you of the very valid grounds of our objection.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, so my understanding your complaint is not about communication by email, your complaint is about the language of the communication?  That's the problem you wanted addressed?  
MR. WEYL: 
The language used, yes, Mr. President.  

Now, the email aspect leads me to another question:  How can the defendants follow a debate which is -- takes place in their absence, because they don't have access to email?  So for them to know what is going on, we have to give them a paper copy of the emails.  So the email is a rapid means of communication, but it excludes the defendants from their trial, which is also not legitimate.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't understand that.  What -- you see, the mere fact that it requires counsel to communicate to the -- to the defendants, why do you equate that with excluding the defendants?  It just means an extra step, that somebody has to make an extra step of service.  Why is that such a difficult thing to achieve?  
MR. WEYL: 
Because, Mr. President, when we receive an email in the evening and we can get it if there's no problem with saturation of the site or disruption of the electricity service in our apartments, we can only provide -- we can only serve on the defendants the next day.  They have no access to the argument, ongoing argument, if it's by email.  We have to give them the paper copy of the email for them to be once more included in the proceedings.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, we have considered the issues that you have raised.  

The first point on the issue of language:  The whole purpose of our -- the directive which we gave was to facilitate expeditious communication, and to maximise trial time.  And we had given an indication to the Prosecutor of the information which should be included in the note.  Now, that information related to identification of paragraphs of the indictment and the paragraphs of the pre-trial brief, or to other documentation.  All of these documents exist in both English and French.  So we do not think that there is a communication problem if the Prosecutor responds -- refers to the relevant documents by paragraph.  So we think that the -- we don't think we need to make any adjustment to our approach.  Your reply to -- if your responses follow the same pattern, it doesn't seem to matter what language you reply in, as the -- if you use a technique of referencing the paragraphs of the indictment or the pre-trial brief or the documents to which you are referring.  

With regard to communication by email, we don't accept this at all, because if the material was served to you in a hard copy, you'd still have to get it to the Accused.  And this is not the type of information where the input of the defendants are required.  These are purely legal arguments which, under normal circumstances, you'd have had to respond on your feet, immediately, without the opportunity for any detailed consultation.  In any event, by virtue of the existence of the document, the Accused would have an opportunity, even if very briefly, to contribute to your consideration if you want to consult them.  So, despite the fact that you think there might have been some inconveniences involved, we don't see them as material.  

With regard to the last issue, the -- your objection to the issue of Ngirumpatse's responsibility for the roadblocks, are you in a position to present your argument orally now?  Because if that is so, we could hear you, and you could put us in a position to make a ruling, either immediately or first thing on Monday morning.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, let me perhaps refer you to the Prosecutor's response to our objection.  It is not the quotation of the paragraph of the indictment that the Prosecutors propose.  It is a recent submission -- actually, two pages of email of submissions.  It is not a part of a paragraph.  If it was a part of a paragraph, as was the case this morning during our first objection, we referred to the paragraph and we realised that it did not support the issues raised by the Prosecutor.  But now, on our objection, he does not refer to a paragraph.  He makes a two-page submission, and we need to read into the submission and we do not need to refer to the indictment to respond to it.  

So the only response which I can provide to you now, as a reply to what the Prosecutor said, is that the Prosecutor did not follow your directives to challenge our own objection.  He did not refer to paragraphs.  He makes submissions.  

There is just one element on which he may have referred to a paragraph, and when you look at the relevant paragraph in the indictment, you realise therein that that paragraph does not in any way support his submission, because there is no paragraph in the indictment wherein it is stated that Mathieu Ngirumpatse participated in a meeting to instruct the Interahamwe to set up roadblocks.  Paragraph 37 of the indictment, which the Prosecutor refers to, does not mention anything of the sort.  

So the only development I can make right now, because I do not have the translation of the Prosecutor's submission, is that he did not comply with your guidelines, and he did not reply to our objection.  So you have to uphold our objection until we are proven wrong.  And if, in the Prosecutor's response, there may have been one element which he refers to a reference to the indictment, if you refer to that indictment, you will realise that the Prosecutor is mistaken and that there is nothing either in the indictment or in the pre-trial brief, or in any other document, which states that Mathieu Ngirumpatse attended a meeting during which instruction were given for roadblocks to be set up.  And for those same reasons which led you to sustain our objection this morning, you will have to sustain our objections again this afternoon.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  I will address Mr. Weyl's concerns, but I wanted to start out by addressing a matter of procedure as well.  I appreciated Mr. Robinson's submission earlier today, because it was very well researched, but I also attempted to liaise with him to get a list of his authorities.  Had I received some indication of what -- of his authorities, I would have been able to respond in the same way.  So while I appreciate the Court's favourable ruling on those points, I feel a little bit disadvantaged because I was not aware that that was the nature of this proceeding.  I followed what I understood to be the Court's instructions to indicate the paragraph of the indictment, the pre-trial brief, and so on and so forth.  If we were going to engage in the type of legal argument that occurred this morning, that's something that should have been given to us beforehand.  Mr. Robinson could have made that argument by email, or he could have made that argument before we took the break.  So I just mention that as a point of procedure, because I would like to be able to respond to arguments with the same degree of preparation.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, just to comment on that, we are trying to -- we are trying to suppress prolonged legal argument on issues of admissibility, because we think that the legal principles have been laid out.  I don't know whether -- if that answers you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, I appreciate that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, so our objective is -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
-- my only suggestion to the Court is that perhaps it needs to be explicitly stated if we're going to engage in that type of argument, that it be done on notice, that at least a list of authorities be provided, and I be prepared -- all parties be prepared to have that level of discourse.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I would not like to make that directive, because that's exactly what we want to suppress.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Obviously there will be occasions when there are exceptions to this rule.  If a new point of law emerges, or a point where there's a perception that is necessary to have a look, then that would be an exception to the principle.  But, except in such a case, we think the guidelines that we have given, we think, are sufficient to address the matter.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I get a sense that you're inviting me to stand up, but I'm not quite sure.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, my colleagues feel that I should have said -- added, that if there was such an exceptional case where legal argument was going to be presented, that notice should be given.  That's what we were discussing.  And whereas I'm -- I agree that in terms of fairness that should occur, that if there was going to be proper legal argument, notice should be given.  I had not really wanted to amend the directions which were originally given, because I would imagine that these situations would be exceptional situations, and I would think that counsel would be aware where such an exception exists, and would take appropriate steps to make certain that there is fairness in the proceedings.  So I hope that covers the point.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, but in trying to comply with your directives, we had -- I received the email this morning, and I didn't have a chance to do anything with it until the break.  And Mr. Webster came over to me and was asking me what are my authorities.  I was literally looking them up at the time.  I didn't have any opportunity to prepare this argument that I gave you, I just did it on the fly with my notes from cases.  I'm happy to give notice if I have enough time, but in that situation I really didn't have enough notice myself.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
With respect to Mr. Weyl's concerns, I can clarify matters.  It -- our response concerns paragraphs 36 to 41 of the indictment, the interview report of the 31st of May 2004, and a portion of ALG's pre-trial brief summary.  What I did is excise portions of that statement and that is cut and paste into the response, so it looks much longer than it actually is.  There is one paragraph where I clarify my thinking in relation to the paragraphs in the indictment, but if it would assist the Court, I will simply withdraw that submission and limit this exchange to listing specific paragraphs and documents, and that may simplify matters.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, I don't think it's necessary for you to withdraw it.  But what would assist the Francophone lawyers would be a clear identification of your reference in the transcripts that they have.  So that would facilitate -- prevent him having to worry about translation.  That's what my concern would be.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, may I be heard in support of Mr. Ngirumpatse's motion, especially in light of the fact that they haven't had such a good translation of what Mr. Webster said, because I understand Mr. Webster's email very clearly and I think there's some good arguments against it?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will hear you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, what we are dealing with here is an issue of testimony by Witness ALG that on the 7th of April, Mr. Ngirumpatse convened a meeting of the leaders of the Interahamwe, and I believe he also said Mr. Nzirorera was present, and at that meeting provided instructions that they were to set up and participate in roadblocks.  So that is what's being objected to, along with the second bit of testimony that Mr. Ngirumpatse delivered a letter to the Interahamwe giving those same instructions.  

And so then the issue becomes whether that is contained in the indictment.  And Mr. Webster says that it is, and we say that it's not.  You can review paragraphs 36 through 41 of the indictment, and it's our submission that while the general allegation is made that the Accused directed roadblocks -- directed Interahamwe participation at roadblocks, that there's no specific allegation with respect to this meeting.  And there is an allegation of -- specifically of a meeting of the 10th of April in which the Interahamwe were sent out to try and stop the killing, but there's nothing in the indictment that would have put us on notice that the meeting -- there was a meeting of the 7th of April with Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Nzirorera, and the Interahamwe.  So that's our point, the indictment is defective because meetings are material facts and it's not included in the indictment.  

So then we look to the pre-trial brief, including the witness's own summary, and we find nothing dealing with the meeting of the 7th of April 1994, or the letter.  We can then look to all of the witness statements which normally you wouldn't even look to with respect to curing an indictment, and I will tell you that there is not in a single witness statement from this witness any mention of the 7th of April meeting with Mr. Ngirumpatse or the letter.  Instead, we heard about this for the first time on the witness stand yesterday afternoon.  This puts this issue in the exact same category as the pre-1994 killings that you have excluded, and I would ask that you make the same ruling.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, in brief response, I would remind the Court that the reference to this letter -- the letter is almost triple hearsay, if not more, because the witness was simply asked to give examples of how he became aware of Ngirumpatse's implication in setting up the roadblocks.  And when pressed for examples, his reply was that someone recounted to him that they had seen a letter, so on and so forth.  So it's not -- the letter is not being used to establish Mr. Ngirumpatse's presence on the roadblocks.  The letter is being used to support this witness's ability to provide the information that he has.  His conclusion that Ngirumpatse was directly implicated in the setting up of roadblocks.  I don't see that this is a valid objection.  It's really to expand the basis for the Court to assess this witness's credibility and his reliability.  

I'm not aware that the meeting that Mr. Robinson refers to on the 7th was part of the objection.  My understanding of the objection was a specific reference to Ngirumpatse authorising or directing roadblocks to be mounted, and for that I refer -- refer the parties to paragraphs 36 to 41 of the indictment where it clearly states, over three or four paragraphs, that the MRND leadership, and specifically the national executive bureau, was responsible for the mounting of roadblocks.  

So I understand the Defence's concern, but our concern is to provide this Court with a basis to assess the witness's reliabilities, not so much to establish, with the second- and third-hand hearsay accounts, that these specific incidents took place.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Yes, Mr. -- 
MR. SOW:  
With your leave, Mr. President, I would simply want to say a word or two and draw your attention to fact that in the summary of witness lists, regarding Witness ALG, paragraphs 40 and 41 are not included in the paragraphs referred to by the Prosecutor.  So I'm wondering why, in his response to the objections, he referred to paragraphs 40 and 41.  Those paragraphs were not included in what was the framework for the testimony of Witness ALG.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, how many bites do you want?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, just a simple image, once again.  I do not think that your directive can be construed to mean you are urging the Prosecutor to refer to paragraphs 36 to 41 of the indictment, because this reminds me of what a French lawyer answered the presiding judge, who asked him what provision he was relying on, and he said he was relying on the entire civil court.  So when the Prosecutor answers and says he's referring to paragraphs 36 to 41, it's as if he would say he is referring to the entire indictment.  When you make an objection to say that this particular incriminating element is not on the indictment, you cannot simply refer us to the entire indictment.  You need to narrow down in the indictment the paragraph which gives a basis to new elements which, in addition, are punishable material elements as such, and which had to be identified as such in the indictment.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Well, we have heard the arguments.  We will consider them and I imagine that we will be able to make a ruling on Monday morning.  Thank you.  

Now, we have 50 minutes -- 40 minutes.  Are you ready to commence the cross-examination of this witness?  I think we should call him in and get started.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, sir, with the leave of the Court, I am ready to start my cross-examination.  I simply have a small question, and it concerns consistency and the possibility of having some consistent and logical flow, if I will have to discontinue in 40 minutes.  I'm in the hands of the Court, Mr. President, because it is possible that I may be interrupted in the middle of a line of questioning which would undermine the consistent and logical follow-up of my cross-examination.  I am sensitive to judicial economy, but you know, starting at ten minutes to 12 to stop at 12:30 is both frustrating and incompatible with a strategy and dynamics of the cross-examination.  

Well, if the Court feels otherwise, then -- well, Counsel Hounkpatin is whispering to me, Mr. President, that to reassure the Court I would like to pay resounding tribute to my learned friend on the other side on the way she was able to stay within and actually shorten her examination-in-chief time frame.  And of course I can pledge to comply with what seems to be a proper example and to say that I will not be handling this issue in two or three days as I had mentioned, because it would no longer be warranted on account of what we heard in examination-in-chief.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, we think you could start.  It would be up to you to select where you start.  You know that you have 40 minutes, and so you can programme your strategy to accommodate that time frame.  I thank you for your pledge, and I am -- would look for expedition in the cross-examination process.  

Mr. Witness, your cross-examination is going to commence.  You will first be questioned by counsel for Ngirumpatse.  We only have about 40 minutes, as we take our adjournment at 12:30.  You will have to answer Mr. Weyl, who will be putting questions to you on behalf of his client.  
MR. WEYL: 
Before saying hello to the witness, as is tradition, I would like to say, Mr. President, that already I have tried to readapt my strategy such that I will be ready to start this morning, whereas the timing we received from the Prosecutor gave me the impression we would start on Monday.  This will be unfavourable to me, especially regarding something which I wanted to do.  I would have loved to disclose my list of documents and exhibits before I started my cross-examination.  But it's only on Monday morning that I will be able to disclose my list of exhibits and any documents I may need for my cross-examination.  My apologies to all my colleagues, but you see, it was because I had the impression from the Prosecutor that the evidence-in-chief would last two days.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness ALG.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Before I introduce myself and before I start my cross-examination, I would like to point out a technical matter of detail.  You speak French, I believe, even though you have the time to think in your answer while you are receiving the interpretation into Kinyarwanda.  
A.	That's right.  I can speak French; I can write French.  But before this Court I decided to testify in a language I understand very well, my mother tongue.  But it can happen that sometimes I may use French words in testimony which is basically in Kinyarwanda.  
Q.	But you speak French.  I, too, speak French.  That is not the case for all those who are present in this courtroom, and it means, therefore, that you and I will need to observe the pause needed for my questions to be interpreted before you answer, and the time needed for your answers to be interpreted before I put other questions to you.  So please let us try and observe the pause.  And also, if need be, the interpreters should always prompt me if I happen to stray.  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I will try and oblige you.  As you have underscored, sometimes one forgets and answers immediately.  Well, if that were to happen, then I would request the interpreters to call me to order.  Thank you, sir.  
Q.	Witness ALG, my name is Frédéric Weyl.  I am an attorney in the Paris bar, and I am co-counsel of Counsel Hounkpatin.  I am one of the counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
I would like to tell you that in my capacity as an attorney at the Paris bar, I am particularly attached to the principle of the presumption of innocence.  That is why, knowing that you have to testified before a court to answer the charges against you, I consider you as innocent of the charges against you, even if I take into account the guilty pleas which you entered and which temperate (sic) the presumption of innocence.  

As a practicing advocate at the Paris bar, it's also happening that I defend people who are accused in my home jurisdiction, and before which court -- and here lies the difference with this court -- those people who stand accused have the right to lie.  But I always warn my clients, I always tell them that it is not good to lie in your defence, because the lie is always unearthed.  I can see you nodding and that we are in full agreement, or understanding.  But I will go to the end of my statement.  

I know that, you see, one's memory is often fragile, and I tell them that if you do not know, don't make up an answer.  You should simply say you do not know.  Otherwise the facts will prove you wrong.  I will also tell them that if you do not remember something which happened a long time ago, do not make up a story.  Simply say you don't remember.  Otherwise you may be caught in the act of lying.  From what I can see, you agree with me in total, and you are nodding to show that you understand what I'm saying fully.  So we are going to put that into practice regarding your testimony.  

Let us remember that here we are talking about things which happened some time back, that is, 1994.  I will ask you if you see yourself as having a good memory.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  If you would allow, you've just made an introduction, you've explained to me the procedure you follow in your country, you've spoken to me of the type of clients you have in France.  Well, I understand that you have defended French citizens before French courts, and you take account of national realities, and of course of French law.  I also understand that in this such type of trial, the question of crimes committed in France -- you've spoken of the fact that people can lie when questioned.  

Forgive me, as you have said, one can't remember everything, but I should like to tell you that I have been lucky enough to study.  I even studied French history.  But to my knowledge I don't believe I met -- saw any information concerning any genocide committed in France like the one committed in Rwanda.  So you tell me you are accustomed to this type of trial, but to my knowledge there was no genocide in France, so there are no procedures concerning the crime of genocide.  It is therefore understandable that you have clients accused of common law crimes, but it is also understandable that you come to defend people -- that it arrives that you defend -- it happens that you defend clients who have been accused of genocide.  

You're right about the presumption of innocence, that it is a principle, an important principle.  As long as there is no proof adduced to establish the guilt of one or another person accused, he is considered to still be innocent.  As far as I am concerned, I am a Prosecution witness in this trial, and I'm testifying against your client, and I am testifying as to acts he committed during genocide committed against Rwandans.  

I should like to add this:  Rwandans need the truth, even the international community need the truth.  And that is the reason why, Counsel, when you try to defend your client, aim at the truth and then you will have played a part in that the truth should shine forth.  A crime must not remain unpunished, and that will help Rwandans to achieve reconciliation.  Even if you say that you consider me as an innocent whilst bearing in mind that I made a guilty plea, while to participate in the process in the discovery of the truth and working for national reconciliation, I have done so.  And I would ask you, in the exercise of your duties, to consider doing the same, if you consider that your client has committed -- done one or the other thing, is guilty of one or another thing, you would do well to advise him along those lines so that he might follow the same -- take the same steps.  If you don't do so, you won't have done much to help international justice.  

I think I have explained myself at sufficient length on this topic.  If there is one or another point you raised in your introduction that I did not speak to, please remind me what it is.

1200H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do you remember the question I put to you? 
A.	That is the reason why I asked you to remind me of the question because, perhaps, I made a long speech on the introduction but I was trying to answer the introduction that you gave. 
Q.	Witness, I will remind you of my question.  My question, I remind you:  Do you consider that you have a good memory? 
A.	If I said that I remembered everything, it would be to lie.  I am a human being.  Moreover, at my age, I won't say that I still have a good memory.  I don't remember everything.  If someone claimed that they could remember everything, they would be lying.  However, I can remember many things. 
Q.	Witness, do you consider that your memories of the events of 1994 are better today than they were in 1998? 
A.	Counsel, forgive me, everything depends.  As regards the events in question, you might remember a fact that you might not have mentioned in 1998.  With time and distance one can remember some things that one couldn't recall previously.  It depends.  It depends on the facts in question. 
Q.	So you think that with regard to events that occurred in 1994, in 2006 you had more distance that you didn't have in 2004? 
A.	I think I have answered you, Counsel.  I gave you to answer to that question already. 
Q.	Well, Witness, the difficulty I am having in running through all of the statements you have made since 1998 until this morning, it is that the theories you put forward varied considerably from one statement to another.  And today you are speaking of things you did not speak of in 1998 you did not speak of in 2002, and did not speak of in 2004.  How can you explain that to me? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  You should not have any anxiety on this point.  We lived through very difficult experiences; I'm speaking of all Rwandans.  In view of the circumstances, in view of the way in which people question us, in view the changes, variations in living conditions, you might forget things that you recall later on other occasions.  On some occasions, you might realise that you mentioned such and such a thing in a certain way and later try and bring a nuance to what you said.  What I said before the Chamber in my testimony yesterday and today is the truth, since what I have said can be found in other statements or in other testimony.  I told you that it depends on the circumstances.  

At the time of our arrest, for example, I think I will try to dispel your anxiety beforehand; when we are questioned, we were afraid and did not reveal everything, all of the information available.  I told you that I came back from exile.  We were afraid.  The tendency was not to say everything.  In fact, the primary objective was not to incriminate one's self in view of the circumstances prevailing, and the understanding of the people at that time just out of the genocide.  Sometimes one would even try to limit to certain facts or events.  You must take that into account.  And once you have decided to plead guilty, you have accepted to say that -- the whole truth before men and before God.  And you must take that into account.  

Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, I have heard two things, essentially, in what you have just said.  You spoke of the circumstances.  Do you want to tell me that in 1998 it was dangerous for your safety to incriminate Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera or Karemera, the MRND, was that difficult for your personal safety at the time? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Regarding that question, at the time in question, what I accused your counsel -- your clients of is still what I am accusing them of today. 
Q.	Witness, perhaps we might have put off till Monday the exercise consisting of confronting you with your previous statements so that everyone has them in hand.  But are you sure that in 1998 in your first statement, first testimony you incriminated Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera or                 Édouard Karemera? 
A.	I don't remember very well, Counsel. 
Q.	We will endeavour to refresh your memory as to your statements.
A.	Yes, Counsel, it would help a lot if you helped me refresh my memory. 
Q.	Another thing you have said that is extremely important, I think; you said that the testimony you might give the statements you might make depend also on who is opposite you and how they are questioning you.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I think that is what I said.  You are not mistaken. 
Q.	The way your interlocutor helps you to marshal your memories is important, therefore? 
A.	Yes.  The way my memory is refreshed is very important on the condition that the information be necessary to me -- or, rather, useful to me. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  There is a third -- I miscounted.  In fact, there is a third thing you said which is heavy in significance for me.  You said that at one time it was in your interest not to speak the truth and as of a given moment, your interests were different than to say the whole truth.  Now, when would you situate that moment, approximately? 
A.	You just used the word "interest".  I don't think I used that word.  I merely said that the way I answered questions depended on the circumstances.  It depended on what the person questioning me wanted, and depended on my understanding according to the moment in time and the circumstances of that -- obtaining at that moment.  But in particular, my understanding today is aimed at determining the truth and obtaining justice and unity and reconciliation between Rwandans. 
Q.	Could I nonetheless ask you to be specific as to the question I put to you.  At what point in time -- is the point in time you identify as being that from which you felt it was necessary to speak the truth? 
A.	That depends on what truth you are seeking.  When I was being questioned, most of the information I provided reflected the truth since I started to give my statements, most of what I have said was the truth.  Perhaps, I didn't speak the entire truth, but most of the truth about -- most of the information regarding the genocide in my country was the truth. 
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are many ways of applying for adjournment.  And we have decided -- we have decided to take the adjournment now. 
MR. WEYL: 
I have two questions and I would have finished with the strategy I have followed in order to follow your instructions.  I have two questions to put.  And it will be 12:30, if the witness answers quickly. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	The first of the two questions is:  Witness, you believe that truth can depend on the circumstances therefore? 
A.	Counsel, I think you want to go into too much detail.  Truth is the truth; to say that which is true.  Never mind the circumstances; the important thing is to speak the truth.  You are encouraging me to be brief, but I think it is you who seek to prolong the debate. 
MR. WEYL: 
My last question, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, the things you have been saying in that box over the last day and a half are not in any way influenced in the way you present them by the fact that you will be appearing -- are called to appear in court next December to answer for your actions? 
A.	Counsel, I should like to say that I respect the Tribunal.  The International Tribunal for Rwanda is an institution that one should respect.  It is an international tribunal.  It is supreme.  It is not because I have a trial awaiting me that I have said what I said here; because the International Tribunal for Rwanda called me to testify here, to speak the truth.  And it behooves me that I should speak the truth, I should speak the truth.  And that is the answer that I have to your question, Counsel. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I said I had two questions.  I had two questions.  I thank the witness for the way he has responded to my first series of questions.  And I will be happy to continue with him on Monday morning, according to his availability. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of our court session today and for the week.  We will resume on Monday morning at the usual time.  And at that stage you will return to complete your -- continue your testimony.  I remind you that during this or any other adjournment, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody at all.  

Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I have one last question myself, Your Honour, if I can enquire of the Defence, through the Court, could we have an estimate of how long the cross-examination is going to last, because that will impact upon our logistics of bringing the next witness.  If Mr. Weyl and the other two teams -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You recall that we had already given the time; we had suggested that they should present revised estimates on Monday morning. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
On Monday morning?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
For -- that was for all of the witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, including this one. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, having already indicated that we expect to hear the revision of time on Monday, I wouldn't want to ask them now.  But Mr. Weyl has already indicated that he is going to reduce his time somewhat.  And I suppose on Monday morning, we will get a better, clearer picture. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  I don't think it would be unreasonable to ask them with respect to this witness because we -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but it is Monday morning.  And he is the first of three cross-examiners.  So, you will have enough time to make your plans.  

But what I do expect is that the question will be taken seriously by everybody, and I think it is fair to give them time to think about it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just so the Court understands my attempt to insist now is because we -- I had not participated a second witness next week.  And it would be -- it would assist me to know if the next witness is going to start before Friday.  But if what -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Webster, my suggestion is that you do consider a second witness next week.  We have already had the indication where the examination-in-chief occupied 75 per cent of the time estimated.  So, even if we make just a proportionate reduction of time, we can expect a 25 per cent reduction from the Defence.  And it is possible that because in the way in which the examination was conducted that there may be even a greater reduction.  And it is for that reason that I didn't want to put the question now.  I think they will revise their -- have a chance to look at the testimony over the weekend.  And I anticipate that we will get -- I anticipate a reduction.  But in the meantime I think you should think in terms of having a witness on standby. 

Okay, we will take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1220H)
