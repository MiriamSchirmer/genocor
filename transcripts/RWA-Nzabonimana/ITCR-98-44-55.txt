MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Could the registry introduce the matter coming before the Trial Chamber this morning, please?
MR. KIYEYEU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.    

Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday the 31st of March 2003, for the continuation of the Defence case in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Juvenal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-44A- T.  

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the Registrar.  

May we have the appearance of the parties starting with the Prosecution, if we may please.
MS. OJEMENI:
With all due respect, Your Honours, Ifeoma Ojemeni, I appear with Dorothée Marotine.  And in attendance is a legal officer from Kigali, Mohammed Hyatt for the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  May we also have the appearance of the Defence, please.
MR. HINDS: 
Good morning, Your Honours, Lennox Hinds, representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor Bompaka and Ms. Juliette Chinaud, who is our legal assistant, and translator interpreter, Emilien Dusabe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  

Yes, before we move onto the next witness, the Trial Chamber's attention has been drawn to a motion by, first of all, by the Prosecution, and then there has been a motion that has been brought to our attention this morning from the Defence, with regard to the motion for extension of time to deal or to raise issues with the expert testimony that is scheduled for this week.  We think the Defence was asking for two days to reply.  That's what we have been told this morning as we were coming down to court.  We were of the view we will hear the parties if this matter could be slightly expedited and maybe we would like to hear the parties on these various issues.  We had scheduled to hear the motion or these aspects of the motion tomorrow morning.  We were suggesting that perhaps instead of taking the matter tomorrow morning, and give more time to the parties, we take it up on -- we take it up in the course of the afternoon tomorrow so that we don't lose much time.  We would like to have these issues sorted out with the regard to the testimony of that expert witness.  Would that be all right, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, may I?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, with your respect to our request, as this Court knows, the Defence filed our notice pursuant to 94bis and we did that on December 10th, certainly with the 21 days within which our expert was scheduled to testify.  Under the Rules, the Prosecutor had 14 days within which to respond.  Certainly, the Prosecutor had the information in sufficient time in order to respond.  

The Prosecutor has indicated that the reason why she did not respond in a timely fashion was because of reorganisation in her office.

We respectfully submit that does not constitute good cause for the failure to provide the report, or her response, on time.  Pursuant to the Rules if the Prosecutor does not respond, then the Court -- that is, doesn't respond in opposition, then the Court may admit the report without even calling the witness.  

We -- the problem that we have is that Mr. Kajelijeli is being prejudiced in this matter.  It is not just a simple situation of the Prosecutor not following the Rules.  The Prosecutor served the notice on us at the time when counsel was travelling and you, as the Court knows, it takes two days for me to travel from New York here.  And so the Prosecutor served notice on my office while I was flying.  

And so, therefore, when I got the document, it was on the 29th, when I was scheduled to visit my client.  My client, as we speak today, was never served with the document.  So he -- the problem that we have, is that he has not -- he is not in a position now to give us his input with respect to this matter and he insists, and rightfully so, to participate in all stages of his trial.  He has a right to do that and we respect it.  

So the problem that we face is based upon this late notice.  We do not -- it is not only late to us, but the client himself, he is right here in Arusha; he hasn't received it.  The situation that we have is that we certainly we would like to deal with the merits of the issue and if the Court inclined to, in using its discretion, to grant the Prosecutor the extension of time to file, that is a ruling in the Prosecutor's favour for their motion to extend the time within which to file, noting that they are out of time now.  If  the Court is so incline to grant that, then minimally the Court should allow Kajelijeli to participate in his trial and that is making sure that we have at least under Rule, is it 73, under Rule 73 are required -- entitled to five days, even if we want to move on that, but if even we are taking one or two days.  But the defendant ought to have an opportunity within which to advise, and -- us.  So we were asking for a couple of days, assuming that Mr. Kajelijeli would have received the documents today.  But as he left the prison, he doesn't have it.  For us to deal with it tomorrow afternoon, does not in fact address this issue.  And the Court may not have been aware of this situation.  The Court may certainly have felt that we received the documents, everybody had the documents, and we would be in a position to proceed as expeditiously as possible.  But based upon this late filing, we now have a situation where Kajelijeli would be prejudiced if he is forced to proceed before he even is able to give us an input. Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, learned counsel.  Yes, on the scheduling aspect, we don't want to go into the merits of the issue, because that is not the time for that, if at all.  We shall be able to get to that, you know tat hat time.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  I would just to touch on two issues.  Firstly as I understand the Court to be saying, it appears there is a motion from the Defence but we don't have a copy if there is one.  And I saw my learned friend this morning in Court for the first time when I walked in, and if there is a motion pending which he has filed, that has not been served on us, I presume the Court demand that he should at least have brought it to my attention.  

And then secondly, we got a notice last week that the motion we filed will be argued tomorrow.  So if that is the position, I will reserve whatever comment I have on what my learned friend has said this morning.  So that will be all for now, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Professor Hinds, learned counsel for the Defence, you did mention Rule 73.  I do not know 73 of what rule?  Of Rules of Procedure, I suppose.
MR. HINDS:
Yes.  Your Honour.  Yes, it's Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and in particular I am referring to 73(d).
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see --
MR. HINDS:
In terms of the general provisions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, the general provision that you have cited deal with specific aspects that are contained -- that are contained in -- under that section.  We have, of course, in most of the practice that has been undertaken here given five days or whatever depending on the situation, so you know, for parties to respond.  But Rule 73 really addresses specific aspects that are contained in that, in those provisions.  If you deal with the entire - if you read carefully the provisions of Rule 73, it deals with the specific aspects that fall under that provision.  It is not a general provision for scheduling, you know, of matters in a general way.  You see. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I am reading the Rules, and it does speak to general provisions, and the Rules specifically say subject to Rule 72, either party may move before the Trial Chamber for appropriate ruling or relief after the initial appearance of the Accused.  And my assumption is that with respect to that sentence that any stage after the initial appearance.  Now, the Trail Chamber or Judge designated by the Chamber from among its members, may rule on such motions be -- solely on the merits or on the briefs of the parties unless it is decided to hear the motion in open court.  So we are not now dealing with --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I agree, but if you look at rules -- the beginning -- the substance of Rule 72(c), you see, which really gives the beginning of the motions that are envisaged and the time frames that might follow, when you read Rule 73(d). 
MR. HINDS:
Right.  Where a date has been set for the hearing of the motion including the preliminary motion, any additional motions to heard on that date and any supporting material to the motions must be filed at least ten days before the hearing of the motion.  Failure to observe this rule would mean that the latter motion will not be considered on hearing date nor will any adjournment of the original motion be granted on the basis of subsequent motions filed save in exceptional circumstances.  So this  provision essentially says that after the date has been set for a hearing -- Yes, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the responding party shall indeed -- shall file a reply within five days from the date on which counsel received the motion.  So this is the scenario of where a motion has been fixed for hearing and new developments must be done within the specified period of time.
MR. HINDS:
Correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, it is not a sort of general provision that would, you know, entail general scheduling aspects.
MR. HINDS:
Well, Your Honour, the situation that we have at this stage -- okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was only referring to provisions, you know.  The situation, otherwise, I think it is -- we appreciate and take note of it.

MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. KIYEYEU: 
I am sorry,  My Lords --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  This would be the ruling of this Trial Chamber on this matter:  We really would like to see things expedited so that we can hear the witnesses that have been scheduled for this session in a smooth and organised manner.  We do take note of the observation made by the learned counsel for the Defence of this matter.  But at the same time, in the interests of justice, in order to move things and to be able to deal with the issues that are planned to be addressed by this Trial Chamber in the course of this session and also taking note of the fact that the scheduled hearing of the testimony of the expert, if at all is to be called from the look going by the general lookout of things, and taking into account the number of witnesses that are scheduled before this expert is due to appear, it is most likely that he may be called by Wednesday.  So we will take -- we will give the Defence time to prepare for this matter.  Instead of hearing the motion tomorrow afternoon, we will move it to Monday. I am sorry, to Wednesday, Wednesday morning.  Monday will be even more than the five days there.
MR. HINDS:
I am just thinking you were being very gracious.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will hear the parties on this particular motion on Wednesday morning first thing at the beginning of the day and then, thereafter, we will see how move from there, in order to facilitate the speeding up of the trial in the interest of justice.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, just to serve notice that the Prosecution will be bringing another motion in respect of this matter, just -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are dealing with what we have.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, I'm just to serve notice Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so we will hear this motion on Wednesday morning at the beginning of the day's work.  Okay.
MR. KIYEYEU:
I am sorry, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. KIYEYEU:
Just a word from the registry.  Just to inform the Chamber for the record that the Defence motion that has been filed,  I am told has just been filed this morning while we are entering the Court.  Just is for the record, because otherwise the Prosecutor will say she has not been served of the motion, because of that.  

And also the Defence say that they did not get in good time the motion, actually from the Prosecution.  It was filed very late last week and it was actually processed, and maybe the Accused couldn't get it because of the security arrangements to serve on the documents.  

I am just trying to remind the Chamber, My Lords, that we have some interpreters who are supposed to be sworn under Rule 76 of the Rules. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, before we move on to the next witness for the Defence, we will have the interpreters sworn in terms of Rule 76. 

Yes, please. 
(Oaths made by two interpreters in English)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So let the documents signed by the interpreters be kept in the record of the Tribunal and the record of this case. 
MR. KIYEYEU: 
We have taken note, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Professor Hinds, your next witness, please?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, Defence will be calling Witness MLNA.  But before we do that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be Defence witness number?
MR. HINDS:
That would be witness number --
MR. PRESIDENT: Twenty-five.
MR. HINDS:
Twenty -five.

MR. KIYEYEU: 
That's correct, My Lord.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, before we proceed, just so that the Trial Chamber will be apprised of the health situation of Mr. Kajelijeli.  Court knows that Mr. Kajelijeli has been in the past victimised by chronic pain.  You recall the incident on October 2nd where he was so incapacitated that it nearly resulted him leaving this proceeding.  I am pleased to inform you that he underwent a surgical procedure on December 16 in Nairobi and it has relieved that problem that he had with the excruciating pain.  So at least we don't expect that to impede the trial as we proceed.  But I just felt that, given the situation that existed then, the Court ought to be aware.  You may already know this, but if you didn't, I wanted to, in fact, bring this to the Court's attention, and if it is appropriate for the Registry to provide the Chamber with information concerning his surgical procedure. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. HINDS:
We are now proceeding with our next witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor Hinds, we are pleased to hear and take note of that.
MR. HINDS:
We are now in a position to call our next witness, MLNA.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.   

Yes can he make the solemn declaration, Registry?
MR. KIYEYEU: 
Yes, My Lord, we are going to go do so well soon. 
(Declaration made by Witness MLNA in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we need a Kinyarwanda Translator for this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Can we have a --
MR. KIYEYEU:
It is being done, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is being done simultaneously. 
MR. HINDS:
Of course, new procedure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes maybe before you start, Witness MLNA, you have just made a solemn declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to how your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few essential elements before you begin your testimony.  You will be led in your evidence-in-chief by the Defence who are seated on this side of the courtroom.  Thereafter, questions will be put to you in cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front of you may also put questions to you as you continue with your testimony, if they will have such questions to ask you.  If a question put to you is not clear or you do not understand it, please say so and such a question will be repeated or explained to you.  These are the few essential things we want to bring to your attention before you begin your testimony.  

Yes, Professor Hinds, learned counsel for the Defence, you could start your examination of the witness.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.        
WITNESS MLNA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness MLNA, how do you feel today? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Is it translated, I didn't --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We heard Kinyarwanda words, but we didn't get the translation now.
MR. HINDS:
I didn't hear what he said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- in the other languages.
MR HINDS:
Okay.  Is anyone hearing me?  Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We hear Kinyarwanda but I do not hear what he said.
MR. HINDS:
We will proceed, Your Honour.  I would like to go into closed session hearing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will go into closed session to enable counsel to raise questions with the witness some of whom -- some of which could have a bearing on the identity of the witness at this stage.  

And Interpreter, could you please advise the witness that we are going into closed session.  He should feel free to mention names of places and of people, even those who have a bearing on his identity, as the public is at this stage excluded and the record to be made at this stage will not be available to the public.  So his security is protected and assured.

	1148H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, I will be asking you a series of questions, and I want you to bear in mind the instructions given to you by the President of the Chamber.  If your answer -- if you believe any of your answers may reveal your identity, just inform the Trial Chamber and the President will instruct you in how to proceed.  Do you understand this? 
A.	Yes, I have understood. 
Q.	Now, witness, when did you first learn of the death of the president? 
A.	I first learned that President Habyarimana had died on the morning of the 7th of April 1994. 
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber where you were, without identifying the names of the individuals, just the location? 
A.	At that time I was in a place called xxxxxx in xxxxxxx commune.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
xxxxxx is x-x-x-x-x-x.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	And were you alone or were you with other individuals that morning? 
A.	I was with other people. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber how you learned about the death of the president, by what means? 
A.	It was on that morning of the 7th someone came, came and knocked on our door, and he had a radio, and he informed us that the president with his -- the people he was with had died. 
Q.	Did the individual inform you of how the president might have died? 
A.	He told us that as the presidential plane was coming from Arusha, in a meeting, the plane was shot down and the president, with all the occupants of the plane, were killed. 
Q.	Do you know around what time of the day it was when you first got that information? 
A.	I do not remember the time, but I think it was between 5:30 and 6:00. 
Q.	Now, could you tell the Trial Chamber what, if anything, you did after hearing this news? 
A.	After hearing this piece of news, I was very sad because the president had died and I loved him.  I washed my face, put on my clothes, and then I went to the road. 
Q.	When you say you went to the road, did you proceed there alone or did you go with others? 
A.	I went with people with whom I had been with in that home, the wife of the house, of the house -- the wife from the house and the person who had given us this piece of information. 
Q.	And did you -- withdrawn. 

When you said you went to the road, how far were you, ah, the house that you were in, located from the road? 
A.	The road I'm talking about is a road that passes through the Byangabo centre.  The distance was about 500 metres. 
Q.	And that road that you are describing, was it a tarred road or was it a path? 
A.	It is a tarred road. 
Q.	Was that road showed (sic) in the sketch that you drew? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time when you got to the tarred road? 
A.	Yes, I reached that road. 
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber what, if anything, that you did when you got to the tarred road? 
A.	After reaching the road, I found there were many people.  Some were in groups; they were all talking about Habyarimana's death.  I tried to follow -- to get the news about the situation.  I did nothing else apart from that.  From the time I arrived there in the morning, I did nothing else. 
Q.	Now, did you -- were you able to identify the people who were gathered there.  Is there anyone that you saw whom you knew? 
A.	I saw many people that I could identify.  Actually, there were very many people, but I was able to recognise many among them. 
Q.	Now, could you describe generally the people who were there in terms of where they, in fact, may have come from, or their ages?  Can you assist the Tribunal by describing whom you saw, what the background of these people, if you know? 
A.	There were refugees who had been living there in Byangabo from Cyeru and Butaro.  Cyeru is C-U -- C-Y-E-R-U.  There were the youth from Byangabo and many people who were native to that secteur.  Because Byangabo is neighbouring on one of Nyakinama secteur, there were some people who had come from those hills in Nyakinama.  Actually, there were very many people from all walks of life, from all categories: young, old; there were women and there were men; young men and young women. 
Q.	Now, you said you saw individuals there whom -- some of whom you recognised.  You are free to name people whom you saw there.  Just tell the Trial Chamber whom you saw.
A.	I saw the conseiller of Busogo secteur.
Q.	And what was his name? 
A.	His name was xxxxxxxx, xxxxxx.  (Not interpreted).  I saw xxxxxx. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat the names, please, the answer again, and maybe spell the names of the conseiller, starting with the conseiller of Busogo, and then onwards, eh?
THE WITNESS:
I was able to see Conseiller xxxxxxxx, xxxxxx.  I spell the name.  The conseiller is xxxxxxxx, xxxxxx, spelt x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x, x-x-x-x-x-x (sic),xxxxxxxx, xxxxxx. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
xxxxxxl xxxxxxxx, spelt x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.  Another name is xxxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x-x.  xxxxxxxx is x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.  (Not interpreted).
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, perhaps the last two names can be spelt. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We didn't get the last two names after xxxxxx (sic) or whatever, xxxxxxx, and the rest -- the other two names in the witness's answer.  I don't know what happened to the translation. 
THE WITNESS:
There is xxxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x-x. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
xxxxxxxx, yes.  The others?
THE WITNESS:
xxxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x-x, xxxxxxx. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
Then there is xxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x, xxxxxx.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.  Okay. 
THE WITNESS:
There is xxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x, xxxxxx. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
Then there is another one called xxxxx, x-x-x-x-x, xxxxx. 

Those are the ones that I remember that I recognise, that I was able to identify. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	At that time when you saw those individuals, did you speak to anyone?  This is at the time when you said you were making those observations.
A.	I did not speak to any of them.  People were just minding their own business.  I just tried to move from group to group, listening to what they were saying.  I did not discuss anything with any individual. 
Q.	And can you describe, or tell the Chamber, what these groups were talking about, what you heard them talking about? 
A.	They were all talking about Habyarimana's death and that he had been killed by Tutsis, the accomplices.  And some other people were saying that it was Inkotanyi who had killed him; others were saying that it was maybe UNAMIR who had killed him.  That was the topic that was being discussed. 
Q.	Now, witness, you also said that some of the people were -- you described as refugees.  How could you tell these individuals were refugees? 
A.	These -- the refugees at the time were from Ruhengeri and Byumba, because they had been moving from place to place.  They had been displaced moving from place to place.  They were not clean.  They were not washing their clothes, they were not washing their bodies.  They had skin rash, rash diseases, so it was easy to distinguish them from other people who were not under the same circumstances. 
Q.	Now, you said that you saw the Conseiller Ndisetse.  When saw him, could you describe what you saw him doing, if anything? 
A.	Actually, where Ndisetse was, that was where the biggest group was, but most of these people were traders in that Byangabo centre as well as people who had good houses there, who were living there.  So everyone was talking -- had their own topics.  They were talking about -- they had their own topics to discuss, so I did not really follow what they were all saying.
Q.	Now, you say that you saw when you first saw Ndisetse, he was in an area where there were shops.  I would like you again to look at the photographs that you were shown previously, prosecutor's Exhibit 7 -- take a look -- photograph 24.  Do you have the photograph, witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What photograph?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have it before me.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Were you in that location the morning of April 7th? 
A.	Yes, this is where I was. 
Q.	Can you identify in the photograph the area where you saw the conseiller? 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, it may be useful for us to project that photograph so that the witness can point out.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can it be screened, please?  And then the curtains be drawn to enable the witness to move on to the projector.
MR. KIYEYEU: 
We shall do so, My Lord. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, you now have before you the photograph which is projected on a screen.  Can you point to the area in the photograph where you say you saw the conseiller that morning? 
A.	On this photo, the houses here I'm pointing belonged to xxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxx.  And if you continue along these houses, the group in which the conseiller was, between this tree and this row of houses, they were standing somewhere here where I'm pointing, between the house and that tree. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, just so that we can --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can he put back the pen where he says this person was? 
THE WITNESS:
(Not interpreted).  The conseiller and his group were standing in this area, and it was full of people. 
MR. HINDS:
All right, describing the area, Your Honour, on the photograph, the witness points to an area -- there is a tree in the forefront, the largest tree, the left side of the photograph that exceeds the top of the photograph in height, that is the height of the tree.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mm.
MR. HINDS:
To the right of the tree it seems to be -- looks like some kind of a structure, um, um, but I am -- I can't make out whether it is a, um, some sort of a temporary abode or shop or something.  The area that he is describing where the conseiller was seen was between the tree, which is on the left, and the stores, or the buildings, on the right, and in particular there is one, two -- the third structure from the right in between that, that is, and there looks to be a pole of some sort in front of that structure -- between the pole, which may be an electric pole and the tree. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  Yes, but --
MR. HINDS:
I'm trying to describe the structure to the right --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- and the structure to the left.  The structure to the left is the tree, which is the largest tree in the forefront, the height of which exceeds the top of the photograph, and to the right, starting with the buildings, one -- the first one is a red-coloured building, the second one is a neutral colour of some sort and then there is a pole. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why can't you say the first pole on the right?

MR. HINDS:
Okay; first pole on the right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Between the first pole on the right --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and the tree that goes --
MR. HINDS:
-- and the tree.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And, in fact -- well, he has just shifted it a bit, but I think it was -- the pen was right on, almost covering the second group of people --
MR. HINDS:
That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- after the structure near the tree and there are about two people -- is it two people? -- the two people who are seated -- seated after that structure below the tree, but it was covering the group, the second group of people after the two people that come after the structure.  I don't know how you can --
MR. HINDS:
Well, I think that there is a group of individuals who are right in between the tree and the pole. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
And that is, in fact, where he says the conseiller was, just where that group is.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Ojemeni, learned counsel for the Prosecution, what would you say to that?  We don't want to have to come back to this, because we have to finish it.  We'll move on. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Um.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take --
MS. OJEMENI:
Are we referring to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take -- where the pen is, we take the bearings as the tree on the left-hand side that goes up the sky, and then the first pole on the right.  Mm-mmm.  And, of course, then one could say that's the location where the -- the witness says the conseiller was, if you want to be more specific, and add about -- the people who were seated around that area. 
MR. HINDS:
Who are in the centre --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who are in the centre, yeah.
MR. HINDS:
-- the very centre of the photograph.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I have no objections.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that all right?
MS. OJEMENI:
It's okay.  I have no objections.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So let the record so reflect. 
MR. HINDS:
Okay. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Okay, witness, you can take your seat. 

Now, witness, when you saw the conseiller, could you describe to the Trial Chamber what you saw him doing at that time? 
A.	The conseiller was talking with the people, the group of people, most of whom were traders from Byangabo trading centre. 
Q.	Did you subsequently see the conseiller again that morning? 
A.	Subsequently, because a lot of bad things followed, I did not see him again. 
Q.	Now, you said that you saw him, can you describe what happened after you saw him talking to people?  What did you see?  What did you observe?
A.	People were going to where he was standing and they would then move back, and most of the people who were going where he was standing were youth from Byangabo, and some people were saying that he was an accomplice, and others were saying that he has refused, that he has said we should not.  And then after a while, after people were saying these things, a military vehicle came, and all the people there, especially the youth from the Byangabo centre, and the refugees came and surrounded the vehicle, the military vehicle.  After this the conseiller tried -- seemed to try to run from that place.  And what followed is that I saw that they brought a person called Rukara, R-U-K-A-R-A, then they started beating him and then that is when things went bad.  And so things went bad; there were a lot of -- there was a lot of violence and you could not see what was happening.  You couldn't see people again.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, if the witness could slow down as he gives his answer to enable the translation to come through smoothly and easily, and also to enable those who want to take notes of the answer he's giving, to do so. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, witness, when you -- I'd like to just take you back in your testimony.  You said that you saw the conseiller and he was surrounded by individuals.  During that time, from the time you got to Byangabo market to when you described what was happening with the conseiller, did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli? 
A.	I did not see Kajelijeli that morning at Byangabo. 
Q.	Did you -- did you at that time in April of 1994, did you know what type of vehicle Juvénal Kajelijeli drove? 
A.	I knew the vehicle because the name -- it bore the name -- the name of our school was written on that vehicle. 
Q.	Now what was the colour of that vehicle and do you know the make of the vehicle? 
A.	It was a Toyota Hilux.  It was red, and the words ESTBU were written on its doors, both in short and both in full.  They called it the Ecole des sciences Techniques de Busogo.  Those were the words, in full, written on the vehicle. 
Q.	Now, witness, if Juvénal Kajelijeli was anywhere in that vicinity, would you have been able to see him?
A.	If he had been in the vicinity, I would have known him, I would have recognised him, because I know him very well.
Q.	Now, witness, can you tell the Tribunal how far you were from the conseiller when you made the observation that you describe.
A.	The distance between me and this point where the conseiller was, it was between 20 and 25 metres approximately. 
Q.	Now, did you, um, hear what the youth, you say, was saying to the conseiller or what he was saying to them?  Were you able to hear that? 
A.	I did not hear what the youth were telling him, but I could only hear what they said when they came back.  They were telling people around there where I was that he had refused what they had told him. 
Q.	Now, after you saw that, could you describe what, if anything, happened, um, next?  Did you see any -- next, could you tell us?  
A.	I have not understood your question properly.
Q.	After you saw the youth talking to the conseiller, can you just tell the Trial Chamber, um, what happened, what you observed next? 
A.	What followed is that a military vehicle came.  There was a soldier in that vehicle called Mburuburengero.  I spell the name M-B-U-R-U-B-U-R-E-N-G-E-R-O, Mburuburengero. 
Q.	Did you -- had you seen that individual, that soldier before that day? 
A.	I knew him very well. 
Q.	And were you able to hear what transpired, if anything, between the soldier and the young people? 
A.	When they reached his vehicle, they surrounded it and everyone was trying to tell him their story.  But among what they told him is that they say the conseiller was an accomplice and he had refused them to kill Tutsis.  So Mburuburengero told them that before killing Tutsis they should first kill the conseiller.  So when the conseiller heard this, he ran away. 
Q.	Now, witness, did you see the conseiller leaving the area?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you slow down, again, witness.  

Go on, counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, when you speak, speak slowly so that everyone can take notes about what you are saying.  Use my cadence as an example. 

Now, did you see the conseiller leave the area? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Prior to that date, the person who you describe as being killed, Rukara, had you known him prior to that morning? 
A.	I did not know him.  I did not know him.  I had not known him before. 
Q.	Then how did you know his name? 
A.	As we were there, Michel and his group came, holding him.  The reason why I came to know him is because people who knew him were saying that Rukara has been caught, and then others would say it is Mburuburengero who had told them to go and bring him.  That is how I came to know that his name was Rukara. 
Q.	Did you see the individuals or individual who were beating Rukara? 
A.	I haven't understood your question well. 
Q.	Your previous testimony is that you said you saw individuals bringing Rukara and he was beaten; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's what I have just said.
Q.	My follow-up question is, do you know, were you able to identify, anyone who was involved in the beating of Rukara? 
A.	The person that I saw beating him with my own eyes was Musafili and Michel.  There were many other people holding him, but these two are the ones that I saw with my own eyes. 
Q.	Now, do you know around what time this was when you saw this unfolding before you? 
A.	I do not remember the time, but it was towards eight. 
Q.	Now, can you describe to the Trial Chamber what was the atmosphere there at this place where you saw this man being beaten that morning -- that morning around 8 o'clock? 
A.	The atmosphere prevailing and the words being spoken all were geared towards to go and kill Tutsi who were living in Rwankeri.  That was the atmosphere.  People were just talking about to go and kill the Tutsi who were living near Rwankeri. 
Q.	Around how many people?  Could you estimate the number of people who were at the Byangabo market at that time? 
A.	Actually there were very many; approximately there were more than 500 people. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time when the group left that place, Byangabo? 
A.	Yes, they left the place, but not all people from the group; some remained. 
Q.	And do you know which direction they took? 
A.	Most of the people who had been there left and went towards Rwankeri. 
Q.	Did they all go -- take one direction to Rwankeri or did they take different directions, and if so, can you describe the directions that were taken? 
A.	I did not see any people going -- taking any other direction.  The only people I saw who were going to Rwankeri -- because at Rwankeri there are two roads leading to Rwankeri.  There's one by ISEA and the one that goes through the market, the Byangabo market.  There are other paths that people take to go uphill.  So the people that I was able to see are the ones that took the direction of Rwankeri. 
Q.	All right.  I'd like you to have -- you have drawn a sketch which has now been marked as defendant's Exhibit 46.  Can you --
MR. HINDS:
Can the Registry facilitate the witness going to the sketch, to show the direction the crowd -- group that went to Rwankeri. 
THE WITNESS:
Some took this road, going upwards, then others passed through this other road, and then others took other small paths.  There were many paths like this going towards -- leading to Rwankeri through Mount Busogo.  So because there were many people, people just took the path that was nearest to them and that was accessible to them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Trial Chamber have any questions concerning what the witness has testified to concerning the path taken?

MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  I think the witness has indicated that some people used the road to the right, appearing on the right of the sketch, and the another one on the left, the other road on the left indicated as Busogo, and some, if we understand him correctly, used some footpaths from the road going upwards.  Would that be a fair presentation of the witness, counsels? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I apologise.  My learned colleague was telling me something.  But if you are talking in terms of the road, of course, I heard the witness talking about taking the path that the people took.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
But he hasn't said anything about the last route.  I don't know if he's also included.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The last? 
MS. OJEMENI:
I'm talking of the route on this side.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which side?
MS. OJEMENI:
The last route on this map.  The last road on the right, very close to ISEA.  I don't know if he also testified to that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, he did indicate that one, as well as what I said, to the right.  And then the other one on the left, indicated Busogo, and then some many footpaths going upwards, in addition to those two roads, going upwards towards Mount Busogo.  I think that's what the witness said.
MR. HINDS:
That is correct, Your Honour.
MS. OJEMENI:
That is a fair representation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So let the record so reflect. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, witness, did you remain at --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can he come back?
MR. HINDS:
No, I just have to put a question to him depending upon his answer. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did you remain at Byangabo or did you leave that particular place at that time when people were moving?
A.	I went with them. 
Q.	Um, and what path did you take to get -- to go with them?  
A.	(Not interpreted).
Q.	Right.  You can take your seat.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's describe the road first.  Remain there.  We want to get the bearing of the route.  The witness has indicated he went up by the road on the left-hand side of the sketch, that is Busogo, and then -- it's not very clear, Professor Hinds, whether he turned on the --
MR. HINDS:
All right.  Let me take him through it -- through the testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, can you again describe, looking at the map, the road that you took leaving Byangabo and then going to Rwankeri?  Slowly.
A.	I took this road, then I reached Rwankeri here at that junction.  From that road, I took that road, and then I reached Rwankeri at that junction.
MR. HINDS:
Witness is showing that the first -- the first road leading from the Gisenyi-Ruhengeri road shown on the map --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mm-mmm.
MR. HINDS:
-- the first road on the left travelling to the top of the map --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mm-mmm.
MR. HINDS:
-- which says Busogo --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mm-mmm.
MR. HINDS:
-- he travelled up that road and the next road which he previously described as a footpath.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mm.
MR. HINDS:
That is the junction at which he stopped.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is what --
MR. HINDS:
And that is the area that he described as Rwankeri.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  So that's correct.  So let the record so reflect. 
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, you can take your seat. 

Witness, were you at the front of the group or the back of the group that took this road to Rwankeri? 
A.	I was at the -- I was towards -- there were -- I was behind, but I was not really at the far end, at the tail of the group.  There were some other people, a few people, behind me. 
Q.	Now, could you estimate the distance, how far you were from the, in terms of metres, from the front of the group who had, who were travelling towards Rwankeri? 
A.	I was between 50 and 60 metres. 
Q.	Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was your question, counsel, sorry? 
MR. HINDS:
How far behind -- how far was he behind the front of the group. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, witness, were there at the time that you saw the group going towards Rwankeri, were there anyone in uniforms? 
A.	People were wearing their normal clothes.  I didn't see anyone wearing any uniform. 
Q.	Now, could you estimate the number of people who went towards Rwankeri?  You had indicated before that there were about, roughly, 500 people at Byangabo.  Can you estimate the number of people who left to go to Rwankeri, or in that direction? 
A.	There were approximately between 300 and 400 people. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber whether or not on the way to Rwankeri did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli or his truck? 
A.	I never saw Kajelijeli at Rwankeri, nor did I see his truck. 
Q.	Now, why were you following this group of people? 
A.	Actually, as all these -- all these people who were going to Rwankeri from Byangabo were not going to participate in the killings.  For me, it was just out of curiosity, because I believe, as we were all here -- when all of us see how people are dying in Iraq, and it is in that context that I followed these people to go and see what they were going to do there. 
Q.	Now, what did you observe when you got to the junction of that footpath leading between -- withdrawn.  Let me rephrase that question. 

What did you do when you got to that footpath at the junction of the place you call Rwankeri? 
A.	When I got there, that is, the place where the Tutsi were living, but actually there was no Tutsi who were still in their houses.  So those at the front of the group continued towards Mount Busogo, because they were saying that this is where the Tutsi were.  So we followed them closely in order to observe what would happen.  

Just below that mount they started -- Busogo mount they started fighting with the Tutsi who were at the top of that mount.  That's all -- that's all I can say about what I did when I arrived there. 
Q.	Now, witness, you travelled from Byangabo to this location, which was a junction where you say the Tutsis lived.  What was the distance, if you can estimate, in kilometres or the length of time that it took for you to walk from Byangabo to that spot?  I'm not asking you about the Busogo hill, but just at the junction, getting to the junction where the houses were, how long did it take you to get there or what was the distance, if you know? 
A.	There is approximately 1.5 kilometres from the road, from the main road to where the Tutsi lived.  As for the time you would take to get there, it would depend how you're travelling.  If you were running, you can use a shorter time, relatively shorter time, and if you were walking slowly, you would take longer to get there. 
Q.	Do you have any sense of how long it took you and the group to travel that distance that morning? 
A.	It took us about 20 to 25, because people were travelling quite fast. 
Q.	Now, what was the distance between where the houses were, the Tutsi houses were, and this place you call Mount Busogo?  What was the distance? 
A.	The distance was not so big.  It was approximately 500 to 600 metres. 
Q.	Now, witness, what -- were you able to see the people you describe as Tutsis who were on this hill, and if so, can you tell whether or not they were unarmed or armed? 
A.	They had traditional weapons. 
Q.	And when you say "traditional weapons", what did that consist of? 
A.	Did you ask about the people who were on that hill or the people who were heading to the hill? 
Q.	I'm asking about the people who were on the hill.
A.	Those ones, they had spears, some had bows, others had sharpened sticks; the majority of them had stones. 
Q.	And when you -- did there come a time when you saw attacks taking place of those people or against those people who were on the hill? 
A.	Those people never conducted any attacks, they were attacked actually.  The people on the hill were attacked; they never conducted any attacks.
Q.	And who attacked them?
A.	Those young men from Byangabo and a big number of the refugees who were staying there, they went and reached the foot of that hill and then they also started using the same weapons as those on the hill had, throwing stones and sharpened sticks at each other.  

So the fighting continued and those at the top of the hill, because they were maybe at the top of the hill, they almost defeated those at the foot of the hill.  After some time we heard gunshots.  After hearing the gunshots, we saw that it was soldiers who had surrounded this hill and they -- we were told to get out of this place and then they started shooting at these people and throwing grenades at them.  That's how these people were killed. 
Q.	Now, when you say there were soldiers, were these individuals in uniform? 
A.	Yes, they wore military uniforms and had guns. 
Q.	Now, how far were you from these soldiers when you made this observation of hearing gunshots and grenades being thrown?  How far were you away from them? 
A.	We heard -- by the time we heard gunshots, these soldiers had reached where we were, because there were very many, so I could see them. 
Q.	Could you identify by name individuals who you saw who were engaged in attacking the people on the hill -- that is, Busogo hill?
A.	I know some of them. 
Q.	You are free to mention names.
A.	There was one named xxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x.  xxxxxx.  There was xxxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x-x.  There was xxxxxxxx x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.  There was xxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x.  There was xxxxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.  There was xxxxxxxx, x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.  Those are the only people that I knew and whose names I can recall.  And with them -- they were with the refugees that I talked about. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, counsel.  Are these the soldiers or among the people who came from -- I don't know. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	These are the individuals that you have identified; were they soldiers or were they civilians? 
A.	These were members of the youth from Byangabo. 
Q.	Now, were you able to identify any of the soldiers who were there? 
A.	No, I did not -- I did not know -- I could not identify any, but we heard that they had come from Mukamira.  But that's all; I could not identify their names.  xxxxxxxx is spelt x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x. 
Q.	Now, witness, can you describe to the Chamber what took place, if anything, after the shootings and the lobbing of hand grenades at those who were on the hill? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Learned counsel for the Defence, we'll be stopping at 1:00, so you can organise to wrap up your questions at that time, with the witness.  

Yes, counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
Yes.  I think there's a pending question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, there is a pending question. 
THE WITNESS:
After the shooting on that hill, the Tutsis who were able to survive ran back to their homes.  After getting back to their homes, they were followed there and they were killed there and their houses were destroyed and burned down.  So after realising there was a lot of fire and the way people had been killed, all those who were frightened, and I among them, run away and went back to Byangabo. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did you observe the manner in which Tutsis were killed in their homes? 
A.	What I was able to observe is how their homes were burnt down.  I did not see how they were killed inside their homes, because I did not enter these homes. 
Q.	And you said that you -- withdrawn. 

When you saw this taking place, how did you personally feel? 
A.	Frankly speaking, what happened here, these are things that you can really describe to the extent that when I remember these events sometimes I cannot even sleep.  I was so saddened that I -- when I reached my home where I was living I slept for two days.  It was so sad and you would wonder if it was being done by human beings or animals.  It was so sad and frightening. 
Q.	Now, when you -- withdrawn. 

Around what time did you get back home to the place that you were staying? 
A.	I arrived towards the evening, after 4 p.m. 
Q.	Did you speak to anyone at your -- the place where you were staying, concerning what you saw, what you observed earlier that day? 
A.	From that place, I reached the main road, the main tarmac road.  I sat by the verandah, so I could not even -- my voice could not even come out.  I couldn't talk.  I was just thinking, hoping that I would get a vehicle that would take me to Ruhengeri, to my home.  I could not get a vehicle because vehicles were not travelling, so when I went back in the evening I did not talk to anyone and I went straight to bed.  I did not even eat. 
Q.	Did there come a time when --
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The witness says he can hear. 
MR. HINDS:
Okay. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did there come a time when you went back to your home -- that is, where you lived? 
A.	Yes, I went back to my home. 
Q.	And when was this? 
A.	As far as I can recall, it was three or four days after these events that I described had happened. 
Q.	During the time that you -- when you left Rwankeri, did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli or his vehicle leaving that place? 
A.	No, I never did.  I arrived in Byangabo in the morning and I left in the evening, and during that time I was there, I never saw Kajelijeli, nor did I see his truck. 
Q.	Now, witness, you said that --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, counsel?  Is it at Byangabo, where?  Was your question focused on Byangabo or some other place?
MR. HINDS:
I said "Rwankeri", when he was leaving Rwankeri, did he see Kajelijeli.  And --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
And the witness says he did not see Kajelijeli there, nor did he see him at Byangabo. 
MS. OJEMENI:
No, Your Honour.  I heard, arrived Byangabo in the morning and then he continued.  He never made any mention of Rwankeri. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can he repeat that answer, please?
MR. HINDS:
Okay. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, listen very carefully to my question.  When you left Rwankeri did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli or his vehicle there at that time when you were leaving Rwankeri? 
A.	When I left Juvénal Kajelijeli I never saw -- when I left Rwankeri, I never saw Juvénal Kajelijeli, nor did I see his vehicle. 
Q.	Now, you testified that you spent some time trying to get a vehicle to take you to your home.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you stop here counsel? 
MR. HINDS:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you can hold on to that question, when we come back, we'll start from there.
MR. HINDS:
Okay, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

So we'll resume our proceedings at 2:30, the usual time, and witness be so advised.  So until 2:30 this afternoon, these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court recessed at 1300H)
(Pages 29 to 46 by Geraldine O'Loughlin)




















	1440H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The proceedings are resumed.  We will continue with the examination-in-chief of the witness.  Learned Counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness MLNA, prior to the break, you were testifying concerning the afternoon of April 7th, when you are at Byangabo.  Did there come a time when you obtained a vehicle back to your home; that is, the place of your birth?
A.	No, I didn't get a car.
Q.	Did you get a car at some time at a later date, and if so, can you describe to the Tribunal, the circumstances under which you obtained the vehicle?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I think this question has already been asked.  Although the circumstances were not mentioned, the witness had testified on that, that three days later he went home, and it was at that point that we adjourned.
MR. HINDS:
I have no problem, if this was gone over.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we had between three and four days.  "There came a time that I went back to my home; this was about three or four days after these events -- these events I have described".
MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Tribunal how long you stayed at your home, your residence where you were born?
A.	What do you mean by how much time?
Q.	I am trying to find out how long you stayed there, was it one day or two days or just how long you stayed at home?
A.	Upon leaving Byangbo, I went home and as the academic year resumed, I come (sic)  back to school because our school had resumed -- had reopened, and when people fled we were still studying.
Q.	Did you  continue at school until you left for exile in Zaire?
A.	It's true we come back to school and continued taking lessons until people fled and we went to former Zaire.
Q.	Now, during the time that you were a student at ESTB between 1990 and 1994, were there any times when students were assembled at the request of Kajelijeli and Nzirorera in order for them to be recruited into the Interahamwe?  Are you aware --
MR. PRESIDENT:
During which time, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
Between 1990 -- between 1990 and 1994.  That is a time that he was a student at ESTB.
THE WITNESS:
During the time I was a student at ESTB secondary school, there was no meeting convened and I don't know of any meeting to which students could have been convened with Kajelijeli or Nzirorera because I was also one of students responsible for some activities in the school.  But what I remember is that on the anniversary of the foundation of the school, I would see Nzirorera and Kajelijeli, who would come to take part in the celebrations.  But I don't know of any meetings which could have been convened by those two gentlemen.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can the witness repeat that answer please?  He went to the celebrations -- celebrations where?  I didn't get it.
THE WITNESS:
The celebrations which I was referring to is the anniversary -- our school was actually called Saint Joseph, and on that day, the anniversary date, parents who had founded the school and Kajelijeli, would attend in his position of Treasurer, and that was the celebrations on which the students were enjoying because of the anniversary of the school.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Witness, were you -- were you familiar with a place called Ismbi house at Byangabo?
A.	I don't remember the place very well.  I don't seem to know it.
Q.	While you were at Byangabo, do you know whether or not there were any flags that were flown in front of any buildings at Byangabo?
A.	I know of only one flag, it's the only one I remember.
Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal what flag you could identify and where you saw it flown?
A.	It was a flag of the CDR party and it was in front of a house belonging to Ntamakemwa, I spell, Ntamakemwa -- it was the front of Mr. Ntamakemwa's house which was situated at -- on the road from Ruhengeri to Byangabo. I spell Ntamakemwa. It is N-T-A-M-A-K-E-M-W-A.
Q.	Witness, do you -- have you ever heard of the term Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, I heard of it many times.
Q.	Do you know what the -- withdrawn.  Do you know if there was an organisation called Interahamwe?
A.	As far as I know Interahamwe refers to the youth of MRND party.  That is how they were called.
Q.	Were you aware, between 1990 and 1994, whether there was any -- an organisation of the Interahamwe in either -- at the communal level in Mukingo or at the secteur level or at the cellule levels?
A.	No, I didn't know.
Q.	Did you know Michel Niyigaba?
A.	I know him pretty well.
Q.	And do you know if he was identified with any organisation, and if so, the name of the organisation?
A.	I knew Michel as a member of the MRND party.
Q.	While you were a student at ESTB, did you ever learn that Michel to be identified as a leader of the Interahamwe?
A.	No, I never learned it.
MR. HINDS: 
Your Honour, I think I may be at the end of our questions but I just have to check with my client?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:     
Just a couple of questions, Your Honour. 
MR. HINDS:    
Q.	Witness, you have indicated that you knew the Interahamwe was a youth wing of the MRND.  How did you learn of this?
A.	I heard it on the radio and I heard it in a rally of the party which had taken place in our secteur; it was a rally of the MRND party.
Q.	And did you at any time see anyone who identified themselves as Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, I saw them.
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber under what circumstances you saw people who called themselves Interahamwe?
A.	When I saw them for the first time, and I saw them many times afterwards, it was at the start of the violence in 1994 until the time when we fled. 

What was -- what could identify those people is that they were -- who were wearing funny uniforms to make sure that they are not recognised, and they would walk around with clubs and they were manning roadblocks.
Q.	Now, were you aware that Michel -- withdrawn.  Do you know what role Michel Niyigaba played in the events of April 7th of 1994?
A.	His role is -- I saw it through the attacks which took place in Ruhengeri and in Rukara -- 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPETER:
I correct.  It was "in the death of Rukara. 
THE WITNESS:
It is clear that Niyigaba, Michel, might be the leader of the attacks. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did you see him play any leadership role in any other place?
A.	Because I knew him even before the events, I couldn't know if he was a leader and, besides, he didn't tell me that he was a leader, in fact.
Q.	Did you know whether or not there were any organisation calling themselves the Interahamwe at the communal level in Mukingo?
A.	No, I didn't know.
Q.	And was there any organisation, to the best of your knowledge, calling themselves Interahamwe at the secteur level?
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not on) ...  Before you came down to Michel?  
MR. HINDS:
Q.	If it was asked and answered, then I withdraw the question?
MR. HINDS: 
No further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned Counsel. 

Any cross-examination?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you have just told the Court that you recognised people who called themselves as Interahamwe by the funny uniform they were wearing during MRND rallies; is that correct?
A.	I didn't say that I could recognise them through their uniforms when attending MRND rallies; I just said that sometimes they would be wearing banana leaves and walk around with clubs or man roadblocks.
Q.	Is that your description of a funny uniform you told the Court that they usually wore?
A.	When you run across a group of people who were called Interahamwe, this was the most distinctive signs, and this is the way they would be wearing.  They would be wearing banana leaves.
Q.	Is banana leaves, given your level of education, called -- banana leaves you described as uniforms?
A.	We cannot call them uniforms because it was not really uniforms.
Q.	Yes, but I heard from the interpretation that you said you recognised them by the funny uniforms they were wearing.  Could you describe that -- I mean, explain that to the Court?
A.	I saw them wearing banana leaves.
Q.	Witness, you told the Court that you knew Michel Niyigaba very well, to use your words.  Could you tell the Court how you knew him or how you know him?
A.	Niyigaba, Michel, was a young man of almost my age, and while I was attending the ESTB secondary school I stayed in Mugogo cellule, and I knew Michel mostly because he would often visit the family where I was staying, and this is the way I got to know him as a young man of my own age.
Q.	Yes.  To use your words, "very well", suggests that you equally knew his activities or you knew him very well to know who his friends were; isn't that correct?
A.	As regards his activities, I don't know him, any job, I know that he just lived with other unemployed youth in Byangabo.
Q.	Earlier on, you told the Court that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Earlier on, when you were recounting on what happened in Byangabo market or what you saw in the Byangabo market on the 7th of April in the morning, you referred to certain groups that you saw, and you said you saw Niyigaba. You said you saw Michel, and I presume you were referring to Niyigaba, Michel or Michel Niyigaba and his group and you saw him with his groups and you went on to mention names, didn't you?
A.	That is true.
Q.	You mentioned names like xxxxxx, and I presume xxxxxx is the short name of xxxxxxxxxxx;  am I correct?
A.	I simply knew xxxxxx.  I don't know if it was a short name for xxxxxxxxxxx; I only know xxxxxx.
Q.	Did -- the xxxxxx you referred to was a soldier, wasn't he?
A.	Dusabe to whom I was referring to was a soldier, but he was no longer a soldier when --- in 1994 in April.
Q.	He was --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is xxxxxx.
MS. OJEMENI:
xxxxxx, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And he is your relation, isn't he?
A.	It's true he was a relation to Nzirorera.
Q.	You also mentioned xxxxxxxx, didn't you?
A.	Yes, that is true.
Q.	And you know him very well, as well?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You mentioned xxxxxxx and I believe you are referring to xxxxxx; isn't it?
A.	I don't know his first name, but that I know is that he was also called Fiston so I didn't really mean xxxxxx because I didn't know him by the name of xxxxxx, I new him by the name of xxxxxxx, xxxxxx.
Q.	But he is a very good friend of xxxxxx; isn't he?
A.	I don't know about a friendship, but I knew him personally and the xxxxxxx I was referring to also attended the course at ESTB secondary school.
Q.	You mentioned Noheli, didn't you?
A.	Yes, I mentioned him.
Q.	And you know the connection between all these people that I have mentioned, you know that they belong to an association, don't you?
A.	I don't get your question very well, Counsel.
Q.	You know that xxxxxx, xxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxx, xxxxxxx are all Interahamwes; don't you?
A.	I knew them and I knew they were youth from Byangaba.  As for being Interahamwe, I don't know.
Q.	You've told the Court that the way you saw xxxxxx that morning of 7th April 1994, that he was leading -- that it was like he was leading the attack; didn't you?
A.	Yes, that is what I said.
Q.	And when you saw him, you saw him with these other people that you mentioned -- have just referred to, didn't you?
A.	Yes, he was with them.
Q.	Now, let's go back to P7.
MS. OJEMENI:
Can the witness be shown Exhibit P7?  Does he have it? 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Can you take a look at photo No. 24.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Twenty-four, learned Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
Photo No. 24.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Twenty four, yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you have identified this picture as Byangabo market; isn't it?
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  I said it was Byangabo market.  I said it was Byangabo because for me when you say Byangabo I just understand the area where the market was held, the marketplace, but this is actually at the front of the shops at Byangabo.
Q.	I didn't quite get you.  Are you then saying that this is not Byangabo?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  The witness has described in great detail the distinction between what he calls the market and the Byangabo where the shops are.  He has described it in a picture that he has drawn, he has described it in his testimony and so there is no inconsistency in what the witness has just said.  And as Counsel was -- is not focusing on what the witness's testimony is.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel can seek to verify, going by this picture, whether it is Byangabo market or nothing else.
MR. HINDS:
But she is attempting to impeach the witness by asking him if he has changed his testimony, and that is improper.  The witness has not changed his testimony, and that is the basis of my objection. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has said, "I said that is not Byangabo market" but Counsel can seek to verify, if she so wishes.  Can you go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you have just told the Court that this is the front of shops in Byangabo markets.  Can you then explain to this Court  ---
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  That is not the witness's testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
He hasn't said this is the front of the shop of the market; it's not what he said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, can the witness just answer my question then because --  I mean, I am not going by the description I gave earlier now.  Can you then tell the Court what this picture represents? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's a fair question.
THE WITNESS:
This photo No. 24, I see the road from Ruhengeri to Gisenyi or Gisenyi to Ruhengeri. I see shops at Byangabo, former shops at Byangabo.  I see trees that were in front of these shops at the roadside, and therefore I can affirm that this is Byangabo at the road in front of the shops.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, you referred to a road in front of the shops leading to Ruhengeri and -- Ruhengeri and Gisenyi; am I correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  This is the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road or the Gisenyi-Ruhengeri.
Q.	You are referring to where a man -- a road beside where a man is  -- somebody walking; is that the road you are referring to, the empty space there?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where do you --
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  There are a lot of people walking. 
THE WITNESS:
I can see a lot of people who seem to be walking.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.  Can I just -- yes, Witness, take it easy.

Looking at the tree now, in front of the big tree, there is a man beside it, can you see the man just in front of the tree?  You can see his back.
A.	Yes, I can see the man.
Q.	Can you use that man as a reference and describe where the road is --
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, can the witness come to the projector?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that would be the easiest way so that the witness can point out the road he calls Gisenyi-Ruhengeri road.  That might save time.  Wait, Witness, until the curtains are drawn. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you point out road that leads to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi?  Precisely, okay. 
A.	That is the road.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, are you seeing that? 

Maybe you have to move it on the other side.  Move it.  No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can you describe that, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
My Lord, it is between -- at the extreme end of the picture, the left of the picture, there is an electric pole --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
 -- and there's a man walking --
MR. PRESIDENT:
A man walking.
MS. OJEMENI:
We can see the back, the space between that is the route --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Is that all right, Professor Hinds?
MS. OJEMENI:
-- between the electric pole and the man.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Do you see? 
MR. HINDS:
That is fair enough.  I am not going to quarrel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let the record so reflect. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, witness, looking at the pole now, can you take -- the left, the pole that I have just referred to, you can see some buildings there; are you seeing it, buildings beside the pole?
A.	I can see houses here.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Where the witness pointed, and he is requesting for more clarification as to which buildings you're referring to.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Confirm whether you are seeing houses or you are seeing buildings by the pole, around the pole on the left by the road.  Did you see any building there?  The building beside -- Witness?
A.	To which pole are you referring to?
Q.	I am referring to the pole on the left, on your left, the left of the tree on the other side of the road.  Are you seeing buildings?  We are not talking about the shops.  You have told the Court what those buildings --  I am referring to the building beside the pole on the left of the road.
A.	Yes, I can see houses there.
Q.	They are houses that you are seeing?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Are those buildings an extension of Byangabo market?
A.	What I know is that those are some of the shops of Byangabo, so they are also shops in Byangabo.
Q.	Byangabo market is on both sides of Gisenyi road; isn't that correct?
A.	The Byangabo market that I know, that used to be held on Tuesdays and Fridays, was behind those houses to the left -- to the right of the photograph.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
As the witness pointed.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	But you have just told the Court there is an extension -- the buildings around the pole, that is an extension of Byangabo market.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour. The Prosecutor is confusing herself and the witness.  The witness has said repeatedly Byangabo market that he knows is behind the houses or the shops on the right of the photograph.  He said it in his -- in the picture he drew, he is saying it with respect to P7, photograph 24.  She is constantly mischaracterising his testimony.  He has not described the area we are looking at now as anything other than Byangabo.  Period.  Not Byangabo market; the market is a different location.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The witness is pointing -- the pen was moving very fast.  We would like to see, in answer to the Counsel's question, we would like to see the direction of the Byangabo market.  That is what we would like to know.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, prior to my last question, I asked the witness whether he would say that the buildings beside the pole is an -- that the area is an extension of Byangabo market, and he said yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  I think -- what we recall is that in answer to that question he said the Byangabo market that he knows was behind the, the -- the building on the right and he was pointing out -- unfortunately, the pointing was done very fast and we would like to have it done to know exactly what he is addressing.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you told this Court that you saw people in Byangabo market, we would like to  --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We already know this aspect. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, she constantly mischaracterises the testimony.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, let me get your directive clearly because I didn't quite get what --
MR. PRESIDENT:
In answer to your question previously about the buildings by the pole --
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- on the left-hand side of the pole -- in answer to the question the witness appeared to have said that the Byangabo market, as he understands it, it was behind the buildings on the right, and he was trying to go point out.  Our only concern was that the pointing was done very fast and it was removed before exactly taking positions of what he meant and exactly what his reference was all about.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you show the Court where you -- Witness, could you show the Court where you referred to as the Byangabo market that you used to know?
A.	The Byangabo market that I know was -- used to be behind these shops here.
Q.	So, what is the -- what does the area that appears on this picture represent?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we now take note of that?  That would be -- the witness points to the buildings on the right and that the Byangabo market would be at the back of those buildings; is that correct?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, so let the record so reflect.  We don't need to come back.  It takes a bit of time to go forth and back.  Yes, go on to the next question, Counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now Witness, tell the Court what the area that appears on this photo 24 represents?
A.	This place in the photo, No. 24, this is Byangabo, in front of the shops at the lower line of shops, as well as the upper line of shops, but this part is not very clearly visible.  But in general, this is Byangabo, in front of where shops used to be.
Q.	When you said in your earlier testimony that in the morning of 7th of April you left the house when you heard about the death of the president and went to Byangabo market, where did you go?  Is it here or -- is it the market you have just referred the Court that is situated behind the shops that you went?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  Again, the witness said he went to Byangabo.  You can look at the testimony.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I withdraw that -- can I -- I withdraw that question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you describe to this Court what is called the centre of Byangabo?
A.	What do you mean by the Byangabo centre.  I do not get the question properly. 
Q.	Can you tell this Court what is called Byangabo centre?
A.	Byangabo centre used to mean at Byangabo where shops used to be, the location where the shops were, the marketplace.  In general, it meant this area at Byangabo where shops used to be, as well as where the market used to be held.
Q.	When you said to this Court that you woke up, heard this news about the death of the president and you dressed and went to the centre of Byangabo, what were you referring to?
A.	It is here at the road between these two -- this main road, between these two lines of shops, the road that passes through Byangabo shops.
Q.	Does that then mean that the shops are on both sides of Gisenyi road and Ruhengeri in Byangabo centre?
A.	Yes, that is correct; shops are on both sides of the road.
Q.	It fair to say --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you indicate the area for the record that he has pointed out as Byangabo centre with --
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am coming to that.  I will.  I just wanted to get a sense of Byangabo before I do that. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Is it fair then for me to say that the Byangabo centre and the Byangabo markets are the same thing?  That you can say Byangabo market or you can say Byangabo centre, that they are interchangeable?
A.	For me, when I mean -- when I said Byangabo centre I mean these two lines of shops as well as the marketplace where the market used to be held behind the shops.
Q.	Now, can you show the Court where you refer to as Byangabo centre on that --
MR. HINDS:
Objection.  Your Honour, asked and answered. 

The centre encompasses the shops and the market, but the market obviously does not encompass the centre; it's logic.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am using the peak photo 24.  Let the witness answer my question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. That is why we wanted him to point out immediately for the record.  He can answer that question.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.  I just got the clarification of what market centre comprises.  Now, can he use this picture and describe it because I have follow-up questions.
THE WITNESS:
Using this --
MS. OJEMENI:
(Microphone not on)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wait a minute, Counsel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Follow it up and then move on to the next point.  Can you have that finalised? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.

Two words are being used here -- were used in his testimony previously and those are Byangabo market and Byangabo centre, so I am trying to find out the meaning of the two.  So, just to guide the Court on what I am trying to do before I move onto my -- my follow-up questions.  So if we can use the photo 24 now to describe what he has just told the Court -- I mean I won't have the Defence jumping up and down because I didn't mention a particular word.  If he said the Byangabo centre in some cases and in some cases he uses Byangabo market, I need that clarification before I proceed with my questions. 

I hope I am not tramping on the Court's patience.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the witness had done that, but you are taking us back, actually.  He can answer -- he can indicate -- he, what he calls the Byangabo centre and then whatever the follow-up question you wanted.  It was exactly what I wanted to spell out for the record, what the centre was.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, for purposes of clarity may I go back, may I crave your indulgence to go back to clarify the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, just ask your follow-up question.  I think the witness had pointed out --
MS. OJEMENI:
Do I then take it that the Byangabo market is behind the shops, because that's my own understanding, and that Byangabo centre encompasses both the shops -- I mean the shops on both sides and the market; is that what I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let the witness confirm that.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you point out, using photo 24, could you point out the area where you call Byangabo or you refer to as Byangabo market?  Could you once more do that for the Court?
A.	Byangabo market used to be behind these houses and used to be held on Tuesdays and Fridays.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That -- most of that had already been stated already, I think, for the record.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, when you say "used to", can you explain what you meant?  When, in which year?  In 1994, where was Byangabo market?
A.	I have not understood the question properly.
Q.	You said that Byangabo market used to be behind the shops, used to -- you used the words "used to", so I am asking you whether in April 1994 the Byangabo market was behind those shops as you used to know it?
A.	In 1994, the Byangabo markets was behind those shops.
Q.	Now, can you point out where you referred to us the Byangabo centre?  If you can find it on this photo, could you tell the Court?
A.	Byangabo centre, I know that was both lines of shops -- lines of shops on both sides of road and other houses that surrounded the market.  That is the Byangabo centre that I know.
Q.	Does this photo represent the whole Byangabo centre, could you tell the Court?
A.	No, this photo does not show the whole of Byangabo centre.
Q.	Can you tell the Court which part of Byangabo market this is? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Byangabo centre.
MS. OJEMENI:
Byangabo centre.  I am sorry, Your Honour.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Which part of the Byangabo centre does this area represent?  I am referring to the area where you have shops.
A.	What is more visible here where you see the lower -- the shops on the lower -- the lower line of shops in regard to that road from Ruhengeri to Gisenyi.  This is the lower line of shops.
Q.	Let's take that man, we are seeing his back.  The road in front of it, where does that lead to?  Which part is Gisenyi and which part is Ruhengeri?  Can you show -- could you tell by looking at that picture?
A.	Ruhengeri is in that direction and Gisenyi is in the opposite direction.
Q.	How can you tell?
A.	I can tell because -- I can tell from these houses on this side because I -- when I saw them I remembered them.  They used to belong to a man called Mpagezehe, Nathanael.  I spell M-P-A-G-E-Z-E-H-E and other -- I can also remember this by looking at these trees that are here.
Q.	About how long is Byangabo market?
A.	I didn't get the question, Counsel.
Q.	How long is Byangabo market -- sorry, centre; how long is it on the Gisenyi-Ruhengery road?  How long is the stretch of Byangabo centre?
A.	It is approximately 800 metres.
Q.	And what we are looking at now, if I am going to Ruhengeri, according to you it is on my right going to Ruhengeri -- going to Gisenyi; am I correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you mean, Counsel, by your right.  I think the witness said Ruhengeri is the direction which appears to be, you know --
MR. HINDS:
Left to right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry?
MR. HINDS:
I think it will be left to right on the road.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I used the man and he told me the man is facing Gisenyi road.  That is what he said.  I used the man as the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
And he told me --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Use that same man.  The direction the man is facing is what?  I thought that is what you said, that was what was Ruhengeri?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where the man is facing.
MS. OJEMENI:
The direction of Ruhengeri.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where the man is facing and the back.
THE WITNESS:
That man is facing Ruhengeri direction, in the Ruhengeri direction.  If you meaning -- you mean this man that I pointed, he is facing Ruhengeri, he is looking in the Ruhengeri direction.
MS. OJEMENI:
So how far --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the back of that man --
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we say -- can the record so reflect, Counsel, so we don't have to come back to this question again. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, now I am confused with Gisenyi and Ruhengeri because I had something else in mind.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	The man is facing Ruhengeri; is that correct?
A.	That man is facing in the Ruhengeri direction.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  Let the record so reflect. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Let the record so reflect Ruhengeri as the direction the man we see in the picture is facing and the back of that man represents the direction to Gisenyi.  Let the record so reflect. 
BYMS. OJEMENI: 
Witness, this tree, looking at this tree, it's not the -- it wasn't the only tree standing on Byangabo market in April 1994; am I correct.
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	There were other trees similar to this tree in April 1994; am I correct?
A.	Yes, there were other trees.
Q.	Looking at this -- the shops in front -- on the right of this tree, there are similar shops on Byangabo centre looking -- I mean that are like this -- the shops are uniform, aren't they?
A.	I have not understood the question.  Can you repeat it, Counsel?
Q.	You have told the Court there are shops on both sides of the Byangabo market; is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Byangabo centre.
MS. OJEMENI:
Byangabo centre, I am so sorry, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And the shops are uniform, aren't they?
A.	I did not say that the shops were uniform.
Q.	I am just asking a question:   Aren't the shops uniform?  Aren't they similar?
A.	No, that is not correct.
Q.	This portion of Ruhengeri -- Byangabo centre, how far is this tree to the end of Byangabo centre on Gisenyi road?  How far is this particular tree to the end of Byangabo centre on Gisenyi-Ruhengeri road, facing -- going to Ruhengeri, how far down Ruhengeri road is this tree?  If you don't understand me, you can ask me, I will explain.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not very clear, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
What was your question? 
MS. OJEMENI:
How far this road -- because he has told us that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
-- Byangabo centre --
MR. PRESIDENT:
What landmark are you using?
MS. OJEMENI:
I am using this tree. He said Byangabo  centre is about 600 metres long.  So, I am asking where, which particular -- I mean, the distance between this tree and the end of Byangabo centre on the -- towards Ruhengeri road.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you can say how far is this tree from -- is it from the, from the beginning of the centre, from the direction of Ruhengeri, if you want to know that, because there are two directions.  There will a direction from Ruhengeri --
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- from Ruhengeri and also a direction from Gisenyi, so which one are you addressing?
MS. OJEMENI:
I am addressing the Ruhengeri.  I am using now Ruhengeri road, because he has told us the man is going towards Ruhengeri.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Don't use the road because this road is Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road, so maybe the direction would be the determining factor.
MS. OJEMENI:
Towards the direction of Ruhengeri.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Maybe you can rephrase that question, maybe for the witness to be able to understand what kind of direction you are addressing and the distance, if any, that he is able to tell.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You have told the Court that the distance -- that Byangabo centre is about 800 metres; isn't it correct -- the area?
A.	I did not affirm -- I did not say that that was the exact measurement, but I said it was an approximate.  It was an approximation; it could have been more.  That was an approximation because I never measured, so it was just an approximation.
Q.	Now, you said the end of -- the beginning of Ruhengeri direction, the beginning of Byangabo on Ruhengeri direction, could you tell the Court how far this tree is from the beginning of Ruhengeri road direction -- Ruhengeri direction?  How far is it? 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I am not quite sure -- I am not quite sure, the present description or characterisation is not very clear.  Maybe the witness knows it, but I am totally confused about what the Prosecutor is asking.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let's see.  What does the witness say?  Does he understand the question?
THE WITNESS:
I do not yet understand the question properly.  I do not know -- maybe if you could ask me from this tree where the shops ended, but I cannot tell from this tree up to the Byangabo -- the distance between the tree and the end of Byangabo centre.  Maybe you could ask me where the line of shops ended from this tree because I didn't know the boundaries of Byangabo centre, where?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, perhaps in order not to waste the Court's further time, may I ask the witness to draw this on a sketch.  Perhaps that will explain better what I want -- what I am trying to get at.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if you understand what you want --
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, that that way I will then be asking him and he will point out.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He doesn't understand what you are trying --
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, he will draw it here and I will then break it down.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Can the witness be given a sheet of paper, please?
THE KINYWRWANDA INTERPRETER:
The witness says he has not been informed as it what he should draw.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You will be directed.  You wait.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you like the witness to sit? 
MS. OJEMENI:
If he can draw it on the projection, we will all see it.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the witness has been standing now for 30 minutes.
MS. OJEMENI:
There is a seat by the projector.  That will be fine.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Give him a chair and lower the equipment for translation.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I have just been informed that he will not be able to draw it properly here, so perhaps he can go back to his seat.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, looks like it.  Can the witness come up to the witness box, please?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you draw -- (microphone not on)?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Kinyarwanda interpretation is coming to us, not to the witness.  Is that okay?  Is it all right now.  All right, please go on.  Please go on Counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you just draw a road indicating the Gisenyi-Ruhengeri road, the directions?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Translation?  What did the witness say?
MS. OJEMENI:
I didn't get the translation, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDEN5:
What did you say?
THE WITNESS:
You asked me to draw -- to draw the road to Ruhengeri-Gisenyi and I said I can draw it.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, could you put on  that road the distance of Byangabo centre, just an estimate, indicate on this road the Byangabo centre, the area it covers?
A.	I don't get your question very well, Counsel.
Q.	My question is, you know the Byangabo centre very well, I presume.  Now, use that sheet of paper, draw a road Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road which I have told the Court that divided two areas of Byangabo centre and indicated shops on both sides, that is the area that the Byangabo market -- centre representing on that, on the sheet -- using your sheet of paper, give an estimate of the area of shops where it starts on Gisenyi  direction and where it ends on Ruhengeri direction.

You don't need to draw many shops, just put the beginning on the Gisenyi road, the direction, and then draw another box on the Ruhengeri direction that will indicate the end and beginning.  Can you then indicate -- have you finished with that?
A.	I have not yet finished.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, may I be guided, do you  intend -- will you be taking your usual break at quarter past four? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let the witness finish.
MS. OJEMENI:
No.  I am just asking. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can go on to the usual break and let the witness proceed to see how we proceed from there only.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, do not put anything other than shops starting from Gisenyi direction and shops ending on Ruhengeri direction and nothing more.
A.	You request me to draw a sketch of Byangabo so let me just draw so that I can explain later.
Q.	No, what you do is draw this road and you draw -- put a map as I tell you.  You draw the road indicating Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, then you put a box on the beginning where Byangabo starts towards the direction of Ruhengeri, Byangabo centre, then you show -- indicate again where Byangabo begins on the road towards Gisenyi.  That is all I want.  If you do not understand me, I will explain.
A.	If that is what you need then I have finished.
MS. OJEMENI:
Can I have a look at that please?  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Sit down somebody will assist you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Somebody will assist you.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the witness has not done what I asked him to do; he indicated other names.  I didn't ask him to do that.  I just want the beginning and the end.
MR. HINDS:
May I see the document?  She cannot just destroy it.  We would like to use this document at some point if she does not intend to use it.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I  wonder how my learned friend would want to use an exhibit that I am just trying to establish.  I don't know -- he doesn't know unless he is telling the Court that he's a mind reader, that he already knows what the witness is doing because what I am telling the witness is not what the witness is doing, so I don't understand why my learned friend will want to use this document. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour,  the document shows Byangabo market which we had not seen before and it shows a row of shops in front of the market.
MR.  PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
I am just saying that in terms of what I would like, to put it in, so that everybody understands.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it is a matter arising from cross-examination, you can see what bearing you can - do, can you give the direction that you wanted and the witness can draw whatever he wants? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, at this point I would like to use 46, let me now demonstrate on Exhibit 46.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it - can it be screened perhaps?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  And if I make marks on it, I wonder whether it will still remain as Exhibit 46, so that is why --
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you want to make a mark, what you can do, you can have this -- you can make a photocopy of this, because this one is an exhibit for the Defence, but you can still use it, and if you want to make, to introduce new elements that are not there then you can have a photocopy made and we can have that one screened.  That's what we normally do because you cannot alter your colleague's exhibit. 
MS. OJEMENI:
I know, that is why I am asking.
MR. PRESIDENT:
 Yes.  It can be admitted as it is.  In that case,  maybe we can take a break here.  During that period of time maybe you can have photocopies made of Exhibit 46 and when we come you can take it up from there.  Right.
MS. OJEMENI:
Very well, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take break for 15 minutes and resume our work at twenty past four, twenty past four.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned.
	(Court recessed from 1405 to 1427H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed:   Yes, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Has the witness been given the photocopy of Exhibit 24, Defence 46, Defence No.  46?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you -- do you have it now?  I would like you to (microphone off)  for projection.  Witness, could you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you can use Exhibit 46 as it stands and go through whatever questions you may, then when you come to an area that -- if you want the witness to put down anything, then you will have to use the copy, the photocopy of that exhibit.  But he could indicate the matter that you want him to indicate on that exhibit, but if you want the map or indicate formally by writing on the map, of course, you can use a copy that is separate or different from the actual Exhibit 46, Defence Exhibit No. 46. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, in order to move this case forward, it might be best to use the photocopy that the Court has done so we can make the marks.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, straightaway. Okay.  Can you do that?  We have taken quite a bit of time on this. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  I won't take more than 10 minutes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you indicate the tree that you identified on photo 24 of Exhibit P7, on the photocopy on the projection of Defence (sic) Exhibit P46.  You already have -- (microphone off) -- the tree is already indicated on the exhibit, can you point  --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you point out the tree?
THE WITNESS:
Here they are, they were on this side. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you indicate, using the road that you have indicated as Gisenyi-Ruhengeri road, can you indicate the beginning of Byangabo shops on that road?
A.	The shops of Byangabo centre started from the point where I am putting the edge of the pen, and on the upper side they start from the point that I am showing on the petrol station, and they go down across the road through to Gisogo and the end where I am showing.
MS. OJEMENI:
Could you indicate the Byangabo market on that?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe -- Counsel, did you see what the witness was indicating for the record so that we don't have to go forth and back?  From the upper side, if we followed him, his evidence was that the shops will start from the -- he start from the petrol station on the left hand side of the sketch, going on across the road on the left-hand side of the sketch to the road on the right-hand side of the sketch; is that correct, Witness?  If so, then of course, we can indicate.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, can the witness --
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you indicate with a pen, just indicate with an X on Gisenyi, looking at Gisenyi, the word Gisenyi -- could you indicate either below or above the filling station that you have indicated the beginning of Byangabo centre?
A.	I cannot give the exact measurements of Byangabo centre because I didn't know the limitation (sic), but what I can show is the point where the area that is occupied by the shops and the space that is occupied by the market. 
(Pages 47 to 69 by Judith Baverstock)




















	1630H
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	On the side of the petrol station where you've indicated "petrol station", if you have an idea where the shops started on the side where the petrol station is would you indicate, starting from Gisenyi, from the word "Gisenyi"?
A.	I don't remember very well where the first shop was, but between the shops there could be a tank.  I don't remember very well.  And from the tank there was a line of old shops were -- started from the tank, but I cannot remember very well what was the first shop.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, at this point I think I'll move on to the petrol station, because -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
It looks like the witness, now, cannot remember, like, if I understood him correctly, where the Byangabo market started.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not the Byangabo Market.
MS. OJEMENI:
The shops on the Byangabo Centre, looking at the filling station which I asked him to use, he indicated the station, I don't know if - did you find the filling station, using it as a bearing --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, as he said, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Let me try once more.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you tell the Court whether there is any shops beyond the station, after the filling station on this Gisenyi-Ruhengeri road?  Is there any shop that is part of Byangabo centre, after the station, the filling station that you've indicated?
A.	After the filling station, toward the Gisenyi direction, there were no other shops.  There were just residential houses.
MS. OJEMENI:
Can the witness be given Exhibit P7, photo 24.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you indicate where the big tree is on this map or on your sketch?  Can you indicate?
A.	I don't understand which big tree you are referring to.
Q.	Is this tree that you have identified, that is beside the man who is walking towards the Ruhengeri direction?  Can you indicate it on this sketch?  Just mark X and put C there.  "EBT", what does that mean, "EBT"?
A.	It simply means that there were many trees.  I can't remember the exact number, but there were many trees in front of the shops.
Q.	Now, does this indicate the particular tree that you saw or just a group of trees together?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are addressing the X, you mean?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, I am addressing Exhibit 24.
THE WITNESS:
These -- what we refer to, the particular tree you are referring to, I could look at it to the point.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Is it possible to locate other trees, since you say there were many trees on this road, as well?
A.	The only trees I can remember were starting from the tarpaulin and going to the direction that I'm sure that we entered, but I cannot tell exactly at which point they would end.  I don't know the number.  All I really remember is that they were in front of the shops.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, you indicate the Byangabo market on this sketch.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Interpreter's microphone on) ... in Prosecution Exhibit Number 7, photograph number 24, the tree next to the man walking, seen walking in the centre, and next to the man walking towards Ruhengeri; is that correct?
MS. OJEMENI:
If I understood the witness, he said there were many trees, so that is why.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are talking about X.
MS. OJEMENI:
I dropped that issue because he said there were many trees on the street.  That's what he said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you --
MS. OJEMENI:
Eventually I'll tender the document.
MR. HINDS:
But, Your Honour, the Prosecutor cannot edit a witness's statement.  The witness statement is the statement.  That is in the record.  He has marked the document.  She cannot just simply say, "I'm not going to use it."  You cannot edit the witness statement.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I asked a question.  I asked if he could indicate other trees and he indicated that trees went up to the end, and I asked if this was the tree.  He said this EBT and that was why I asked the meaning of EBT, and he said the meaning of EBT means many trees.  And looking at this sketch there are two trees there, so I had just asked if he could indicate Byangabo market, then I'll ask my next question to determine if this tree that he marked refers to the tree in front.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem is we go forth and back.  According to him, I think if we recall the evidence, was that where he put the X was the tree, which he thought would represent the tree appearing on picture 24 in Exhibit Number -- Prosecution Number 7.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I'm trying to get at something, and if I don't get at it, then there's no point continuing with this cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are telling you where the witness has gone thus far.  Because it's your cross-examination, you manage it.  But we are only telling you the evidence that the witness has talked about, if you want to follow it up, because we cannot be going forth and back.  I wish we knew what you were trying to -- the witness to demonstrate.
MS. OJEMENI:
I'm trying to get the witness to show the Court where, in particular, this tree is located on this sketch.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what you have done.
MS. OJEMENI:
In terms of the area that the Byangabo Centre covers it should be able to know where to place the tree.
MR. HINDS:
He put an X next to the tree, I thought.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what he did, according to the evidence.
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay.  Let me get that from the witness, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, the X, does it indicate the tree on photo 24?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not only the tree, there are so many trees.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, that's what I'm --
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Does it indicate the big tree, the first big tree on the right, the only big tree on the right where in front -- where in front of which there is a man walking towards Ruhengeri that you've identified?  Is that the sketch?
A.	It refers to the first tree but I cannot remember the question you had put when you asked me to put the X.
Q.	To show the position of the tree, the big tree in front, the big tree on the right of this photo number 24, does the X on the sketch represent this big tree that you've identified as the big tree on the picture?
A.	Yes, X refers to the big tree.
MS. OJEMENI:
Now, Your Honour, can the record reflect that X is the big tree?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let the record so reflect.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, could you identify the Byangabo market on the sketch?
A.	I think this is the first time that you put me the question, but the Byangabo market was behind the shops that I'm pointing at.
Q.	Can you indicate with a B there?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the witness is showing that the shops are in a location not shown on the map.  I mean -- not shown on the sketch, below the line of the - well, I guess he can testify.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what we understand him to be saying, the market will be below the blocks that are there.  

Can the witness indicate, you know, verify that, then indicate, if it's possible, the general directional layout of that market?
THE WITNESS:
I'm putting the B.  I'm just approximating; simply remember the market was behind the shops.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	(Interpreter microphone on) ... boutique beside -- behind these shops.  Are you saying the word "boutique"?
A.	I simply said those shops.
Q.	Do you know the meaning of "boutique"?  Are you referring to where clothes are sold?
A.	To me there is no difference between the shop and what I call "boutique".
Q.	Can you explain to the Court what is sold in those shops you've indicated now?
A.	Those shops were the foodstuffs, some -- one of those shops was a studio, and when I tell you this, I'm referring to both sides of the road, some of the shops would be selling foodstuff like rice, sugar, tea and other items which are sold in a boutique.
MS. OJEMENI:
Can the witness be shown Exhibit P, photo number 20?
MR. PRESIDENT:
So B stands for the general direction of the Byangabo market, is that correct?
MS. OJEMENI:
Byangabo market.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let the record so reflect.  Next.
THE WITNESS:
I've had a look at the photograph.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Do you recognise the area that the picture depicts?
A.	Yes, I know the place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which photo, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
Photo number 20.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Twenty, all right.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What is this place?
A.	As I told you earlier, this is the market, which is located behind the shops, and this is the side where clothes are sold, which we call Sekany.  I spell.  That's S-E-K-A-N-Y.
Q.	(Interpreter's microphone on) ... this area falls on it, does it, you indicated on the sketch?
A.	Yes, that's the place.
Q.	In effect, it's part of Byangabo market; isn't it?
A.	Yes, that's true.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I'll be coming back to this sketch so, in the meantime, I'll keep the sketch.  I'll come back to it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
MS. OJEMENI:
Can the witness sit down?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You told the Court that on the morning of seventh you left where you were staying and went to Byangabo with the wife of the house.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, but we went along with a man who had come to tell us that Habyarimana had died.
Q.	Could you tell the Court of this wife?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, would that be any --
MR. HINDS:
Well, I think that we need to just remind the witness -- I don't know what he's going to say -- but I think we need to remind him that we are in open session, so he can make the judgment.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, this might be an apropo time to go in closed session.  I didn't want to go into details, that's why I used just the wife of the house.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, if he's going to mention names, that might cause problems.  We'll go into closed session to enable counsel to raise questions on the witness, even those that might have a bearing on his identity.
