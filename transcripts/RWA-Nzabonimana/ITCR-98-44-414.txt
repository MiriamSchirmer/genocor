P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open -- could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 25th of February 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Appearances are the same?  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Your testimony will con -- thank you.  Your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began yesterday.  

You now have to respond to the Prosecutor, who will now have an opportunity to cross-examine you. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. SENDZE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Honourable Judges.  

Good morning, everybody.
LAURENT SEMANZA (continued) 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. SENDZE:
Before we continue, I would want to state that I have distributed a bundle of documents, but I have only made copies available to the Bench and to the interpreters.  I had sent electronic versions to the Defence, and I hope that the Defence have no difficulty, not having received hard copies.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, Mr. Semanza, yesterday you testified that -- 
MR. SENDZE:
First of all, do I have the assurance of the Defence teams that we will not have any difficulty?  
MR. NIMY: 
Good morning, Mr. President. 

Mr. Prosecutor, I am cross-checking on our computer, because I had not -- well, I -- I'll tell you -- I'll give you an answer in a little while. 
MR. SENDZE:
Okay. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, you testified yesterday that you met with Mr. Nzirorera in Gitarama on several occasions between April and May of 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That's correct. 
Q.	And you would usually meet him when he was not on a visit to Ruhengeri; true?
A.	Yes.  I also usually met him with other persons. 
Q.	To the best of your knowledge, could you tell the Court how many times Mr. Nzirorera visited Ruhengeri from Gitarama? 
A.	These things happened a long time ago, and it is difficult for me to remember the number of times that he visited Ruhengeri.  However, I believe that around the 13th or the 16th he returned to Gitarama; that is, he left Gitarama on the 13th for Ruhengeri and came back on the 16th.  Then he returned to Gitarama again after the 25th.  And I'm referring here to the month of April.  Those are the trips that I can remember. 
Q.	So you remember him going to Ruhengeri around the 13th of April 1994, and you remember him returning from Ruhengeri around the 25th of April 1994.  Is it -- are you saying that he left on the 13th and only returned on the 25th? 
A.	No.  He returned on the 16th of April.  Then he travelled again thereafter and returned to Gitarama on the 25th.  It was during that time that he transported the members of my family.  

Yesterday I was mistaken in my testimony when I said that he transported members of my family on the 12th of April.  The truth of the matter is that he transported them towards the end of the month of April, around the 28th of April 1994. 
Q.	Did you accompany Mr. Nzirorera on this trip with your family? 
A.	No.  I remained in Gitarama. 
Q.	Did you accompany him on any of the trips he made to Ruhengeri from Gitarama? 
A.	No.  When I left Gitarama, Nzirorera was on mission abroad.  
Q.	Mr. Semanza, we have on record two Defence witnesses who place you at the home of Mr. Nzirorera in Ruhengeri some time in late April 1994.  Did you visit that home during this time? 
A.	No, I did not. 
Q.	So the only time you went to Ruhengeri was in June 1994? 
A.	Yes.  The only time I went there was on the occasion on which I left Gitarama for good.  
Q.	Okay.  Back to Gitarama, you testified that you had several meetings with Nzirorera and others; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  We had a meeting on the 12th and 13th of May.  The other meetings were simple gatherings at which we discussed security and war issues relating to our experience at the time. 
Q.	You would agree that during -- at these security meetings that you had with Nzirorera and others, you discussed the ongoing killings; correct? 
A.	In fact, we didn't hold security meetings, as such, because I did not hold any position which would have authorised me to participate in such a meeting.  The only meeting I attended was the meeting of the 12th and 13th.  This was a meeting of the political bureau of the MRND, which I attended in my capacity as member of the political bureau of that party. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, a few seconds ago, you said, apart from the meeting of the 12th and the 13th of May 1994, you had other meetings in which you discussed the security situation in the country and in Gitarama.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	What I said was that these were not meetings, as such, because you couldn't call a gathering of two people as a meeting.  It was mere discussions that I had with him on the issues that we were facing.  So one couldn't refer to such a discussion among two people as amounting to a meeting. 
Q.	During these discussions you talked about the ongoing killing of civilians, did you not? 
A.	We talked and touched on almost every topic.  We talked about the war which had been caused by the RPF.  We talked about refugees who had contacted us and told us their experiences.  That was the nature of our discussions.  And we had similar discussions with other persons who were in Gitarama. 
Q.	Isn't it true that from the information you got from the displaced persons you understood that the Tutsis were being targeted and thus were fleeing from attack? 
A.	It was not only the Tutsis who were fleeing.  Even Hutus were fleeing during that period.  I have told you that I remained in Gitarama during that period because Tutsi and Hutu alike were fleeing the fighting.  The inhabitants were fleeing because they had witnessed the killings that the RPF was carrying out. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, while you were in Murambi, did you happen to see Mr. Karemera? 
A.	Yes.  I met Karemera, and we had some discussions. 
Q.	Could you be kind to share with the Court the content of your discussions with Karemera, briefly, please.  
A.	In general terms we talked about war issues and problems of the war-displaced persons with Karemera.  We also wondered how to behave in the face of these problems.  And we also sought ways for providing them with food, accommodation, and security, particularly given that the refugees were all over Gitarama town and did not enjoy any assistance. 
Q.	Did you meet Mr. Ngirumpatse in Murambi? 
A.	Yes, we met. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court approximately how often you met with Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	When he was not on mission, I could have met him whenever I wanted to talk to him. 
Q.	Okay.  Yesterday you also gave testimony on a meeting that is alleged to have been held at the Kigali préfecture office on the 30th -- on or about the 30th of April 1994.  And it was your testimony that you did not attend this meeting; is that correct? 
A.	I am not aware of that meeting.  And I did not go to Kigali on that date. 
Q.	Now, you explained yesterday that on -- in an attempt to justify why you did not -- or you could not have attended this meeting, you told the Court that you did not have the capacity to be present at this meeting.  Is that what you said? 
A.	Yes.  That was my testimony. 
Q.	But you were an MRND official at the time, weren't you?
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  I was an MRND official at Kigali-rural -- at the level of Kigali-rural. 
Q.	And you think that did not give you the required capacity to attend a meeting at the préfecture office in Kigali-ville? 
A.	The issues dealt with at that meeting were within the jurisdiction of Kigali-ville prefecture, and I was not concerned by those problems.  I would only have been concerned if problems to be discussed were matters for Kigali-rural.  So you must understand that I did not have any business with the agenda of that meeting. 
Q.	At the meeting of the 12th and 13th of May 1994 in Gitarama, the politburo meeting, were there any discussions about Kigali-rural? 
A.	I think we were looking at the nomination of the person who was to replace the minister of interior, who was said to have been missing during that period.  So the candidate to that position had to be an MRND member and native of Kigali-rural. 
Q.	You're saying the minister of interior, who had to be appointed, ought to have come from Kigali-rural?  Is that what you are saying? 
A.	That position was normally held by someone who was a native of Kigali-rural préfecture.  And even if this is not what ultimately transpired, the idea, initially, was for the person to replace the former minister to hail from Kigali-rural.  However, subsequently, there was a change. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I put it to you that inasmuch as you had capacity to be present at the 
	politburo meeting in Gitarama, you equally had the capacity to be present at the meeting at the Kigali préfecture office.  

Now, we have three witnesses who have placed you at this meeting.  And I submit to you that the only reason why you're trying to exclude yourself from this meeting is because you are aware of the allegations made to the effect that Mr. Nzirorera thanked and encouraged the Interahamwe for having killed Tutsis.  So your presence at this meeting would give you the status of an accomplice, and that is why you are very interested in excluding yourself from the meeting.  Do you have any comment? 
A.	First of all, during my own trial -- the alleged meeting you referred to was not raised in my trial.  And I'm surprised that you are raising this issue today, 12 years after my own trial.  

Secondly, if I were to consider the fighting in Kigali and the ongoing shelling in Kigali at the time, it would have been impossible for anybody to bring two or three persons together for a meeting when there was such a high risk that they may have been shelled.  

Thirdly, although I was a member of the political bureau of the MRND, it wasn't obvious that all members of the political bureau of the MRND would attend all meetings organised at all levels of the MRND.  I think it would be more relevant if you could produce an invitation that may have been forwarded to me to enable me attend the alleged meeting.  

Now, talking about the witnesses you have referred to, these are the witnesses that we are used to seeing here who come to lie, because you have promised to lighten their sentences.  I want to mention the example of Paul Bisengimana who alleged that I was with him during the Musha killings.  He said so because you had promised him something.  

That is why I want to ask the Trial Chamber to be very careful when considering the testimonies of Prosecution witnesses and even consider sentencing them heavily because of their false testimonies.  I say this because we have been victims of such false testimonies. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, yesterday you also touched on the Interahamwe.  It's true, is it not, that you have been a member of the MRND party since 1975? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you served as the bourgmestre of Bicumbi under the MRND party for 20 years? 
A.	I served as bourgmestre of Bicumbi commune even before the MRND was created. 
Q.	You would agree with me that the youth wing of the MRND party was called the Interahamwe; correct? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  The youth wing of the MRND was known as the Interahamwe.  But the organisation was not only made up of youth.  Even some elderly persons could also have been referred to as Interahamwe. 
Q.	Yesterday I understood you to be telling this Court that the organisation called the Interahamwe was really never established.  Did I hear you correctly? 
A.	Yes.  You understood me correctly.  That is what I said. 
Q.	The Interahamwe as the MRND youth wing did not exist in Kigali.  Is that what you want Your Honours to believe? 
A.	Yes.  There was no law or instrument creating the Interahamwe in Kigali.  Officially, there was no such instrument. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, I will give you another opportunity.  And leave the law aside.  Are you telling the Court that an organisation called the Interahamwe did not exist, did not function in Kigali?  You are under oath.  
A.	What I am telling you is the truth.  There was never any official structure so recognised to be known as the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural.  Other political parties had their supporters and members.  And the members of those political parties -- or, should I say, the members of the MRND party were the more dominant, and they were known as the MRND -- or, rather, as the Interahamwe.  

And you had such militants even with the PSD, known as the Abakombozi.  And the PSD and the MDR also had their supporters who were very active and who distinguished themselves by their activities at the political level. 
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. Issa, please avail the witness of all the documents in my bundle.  

And I would like us to look at document number 1, A in English and B in French.  And for the benefit of the Defence, this is Exhibit P. 013.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, do you read French? 
A.	No.  I do not know enough French to be able to understand this document. 
Q.	Okay.  That is fine.  But you have the French version of the document? 
A.	Yes.  It has just been placed before me. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. SENDZE:
I would like to draw the Court's attention and the witness's attention to the top left-hand corner of the document.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Are you there, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I am, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Could you read what you see on the top left-hand corner of that document.
A.	I have already told you that I do not master the French language enough to be able to read all these things.  So, Mr. Prosecutor, would you kindly read the document out yourself for our benefit so that it can be interpreted to me.
Q.	The top left-hand corner which I have referred to reads "Interahamwe Za-MRND, B.P. 1055, Kigali".  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Is that the post box of the MRND party in Kigali? 
A.	I do not have a clear recollection.  This document has just been handed to me a short while ago, and I have not had time to read through it.  

You see, you do not always tell the truth.  So I have to be very careful whenever you ask me to make a comment.  It is in your habit to lie. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, now, this is a letter that was written by the members of the 
	Interahamwe national committee on the 19th of January 1994.  Now, if you turn to page 5 of that document -- turn five leaves over.  Page -- yeah.  Where you have signatures.  You will see that the letter was signed by the national committee of the Interahamwe with Robert Kajuga as its president and Niyitegeka, Dieudonné as its treasurer.  Do you see those signatures? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And you also see -- 
MR. NIMY: 
Excuse me, Mr. Prosecutor.  I'm sorry.  I don't have the document you are reading which has to do with the Interahamwe of Kigali town.  I thought you were going to give me a document of -- in -- document of Interahamwe of Kigali-rural, because the witness talked about Kigali-rural.  Are you talking about Kigali town?  

I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I don't have the document. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. -- this witness is giving testimony now.  He can answer the questions.  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes.  That is not what I am saying, Mr. President.  I simply wish to have the document the Prosecutor is referring to.  That's all. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  You see, the -- the -- the -- the -- why I made my comment was what you are saying was capable of being interpreted of -- as assisting the witness how to answer the question.  

The Prosecutor, before he began his exam -- cross-examination, tried to enquire whether the electronic communication of these documents was adequate.  Now, if you have a problem with that, then the Prosecutor would -- would -- 

Mr. -- are you in a position to send those copies over?  You have done that now.  Okay. 
MR. NIMY: 
Okay.  Mr. President, this was simply to ensure that I had the document in my keeping.  Thank you. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, you have seen the document, and you've seen the signatures.  And there is also a stamp affixed at the end of the document.  Now, I give you an opportunity to review your answer that the Interahamwe did not exist as an organisation even in Kigali.  Do you maintain your answer, or you would like to correct that at this time?  
A.	I would like to say that when you talk about Kigali two things must be understood:  There is Kigali, that is, Kigali préfecture, the Kigali town préfecture, and then there is Kigali-rural préfecture.  All the individuals whose names appear here are people that I do know.  And these people who -- were in the Kigali-ville town préfecture.  There's nobody here of Kigali-rural.  

Now, secondly, all these persons wrote and signed privately.  I don't think I can bring any proof to show that the MRND party placed its seal on this document to say that these individuals were officially elected to be members of the MRND officially and at national level. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, let's move to Kigali-rural.  Bicumbi is in Kigali-rural, isn't it? 
A.	Absolutely. 
MR. SENDZE:
Now, I draw the Court's attention to document number 2, A in English and B in French. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, please look at document number 2. 
MR. SENDZE:
And for the record, it is Mr. Semanza's testimony in his own trial on the 13th of February 2002.

I have a French copy which I can hand over to Counsel Nimy. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, do you have the document? 
A.	Yes.  I have before me a document with 2A.  I have another one with 2B. 
Q.	You can look at 2B.  That is in French.  
MR. SENDZE:
Now, I would like the Court and the witness to look at page 120, line 14 in the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What page?  
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry.  102.  My mistake.  

I'm sorry.  I can't give the French reference itself.  I handed my copy over to Mr. Nimy.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	But, Mr. Semanza, you were asked by your counsel whether you were aware of the existence of a group known as the Interahamwe in Bicumbi, and your answer was this on line 17 in the English:  "Yes.  I knew the Interahamwe while I was bourgmestre of Bicumbi commune." 

You were also asked if this Interahamwe was associated to the MRND party, and you answered that the Interahamwe were the youth wing of the MRND party.  

On page 103, line 19 to 20, when asked the same question about the existence of the Interahamwe, you answered that you became aware of the existence of Interahamwe in 1992.  Again, on page 105 of the English version at line 24, discussing the same issue, you responded to your counsel when asked about the existence of the Interahamwe that, "I knew the Interahamwe in Bicumbi.  I knew of their existence in Bicumbi in 1992, because in each secteur, where the parties had many members, they had their youth wings."  

Now, as many as three times you admitted in your own trial that the Interahamwe existed in Bicumbi, which is in Kigali-rural.  How then can you testify before this Chamber that the Interahamwe did not exist in Kigali-rural?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is -- is there a problem, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I was expecting that a translation should be done for me.  The document I have in front of me is in French.  I was waiting for interpretation into Kinyarwanda to be able to answer, Mr. President. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, my question was interpreted to you.  And, trust me, I am not making up anything.  So answer the question on the basis of the interpretation you received.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have a problem.  I'm not saying that the Prosecutor is inventing anything.  But, technically speaking, Mr. Semanza has before him the French version, which he finds difficulty in reading.  And Mr. Prosecutor did not read what he's asking for Mr. Semanza to confirm but gave his own interpretation of the English version and not even the reading of the English.  He gave his interpretation, his exegesis of the English.  And you cannot ask the witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. -- I have the copy of the English translation before me.  And he was reading.  He specified the page and the line, and he read what was written there.  And that was translated to the witness. 

MR. WEYL: 
In that case, Mr. President, since I had before me the French version, I can tell you that is not what is exactly in the French transcript.  It was an interpretation.  And I have the French records, and that is what Mr. Semanza has before him.  Consequently, we should have a document which is harmonious.  What I heard from the Prosecutor was an interpretation of what transpires from the French transcript, and it is not the same thing. 
JUDGE KAM:
Counsel Weyl, I also followed the French version.  I would like that you explain to the Court the difference between the two versions, because I noticed that there's a difference in the paging. 
MR. WEYL: 
In any event, there is a difficulty.  And it is that when I read the French -- and it is for the Prosecutor to read it.  Since he is doing the cross-examination, he should read what is written in the French version.  He should get it read.  He has in his team French-speaking colleagues who can read what he's asking to the witness, to analyse what he is saying.  But the witness should not be asked to make a statement on what is an approximate rendition of what he has before him. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness has had a lot of time now. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, please could you explain to the Court the difference between your testimony in your trial in relation to the existence of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural and the testimony you have given before this Court under oath.  
A.	Well, you've asked me to trust you.  You're not making anything up.  But from what you have said, Counsel, it's difficult for me to trust you if I base myself on what you have done against me.  

In my testimony in my trial, what I said is true.  There was what was referred to as Interahamwe.  It existed.  People talked about it.  But that does not mean that the Interahamwe had a structure and existed officially and that there were laws governing this structure.  

The word "Interahamwe" was a source of a lot of difficulty.  It gave us a lot of problems.  And during the war, when all the members of the party were called Interahamwe, members of the RPF were called Interahamwe, and they killed people.  

And as I said, the Interahamwe existed.  They danced.  They sang.  They carry out -- carried out animation during marriage festivals during that period.  We did that so as to keep our members together within the ranks of our party.  And so I can say that from that angle then the Interahamwe existed. 
Q.	So you lied in your testimony in chief.  

Now, yesterday you also denied that a certain Joseph Setiba was not the president of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural; correct?  
A.	Yes.  That is what I said.  Joseph Setiba was never president of the Interahamwe within the Kigali-rural préfecture. 
Q.	Okay.  Please look at document number 3 before you.  
MR. SENDZE:
And for the record, this is Defence Exhibit D. NZ039 in this trial.  It is an RTLM broadcast of June 1994.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, this is a broadcast which discusses a communiqué issued by members of the Interahamwe.  If you turn to page -- the third page of that document -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Excuse me, Mr. Prosecutor.  When I look at the bundle which you offered to us, this document was distributed in how many languages?  Is it only in Kinyarwanda and in French (sic) that you have copies, or is there a French copy?  
MR. SENDZE:
Is Ms. Diagne asking for an English version?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Never.  I'm asking for a French version. 
MR. SENDZE:
Okay.  The document is in -- the first page is in Kinyarwanda, and the rest of it is in French.  And the relevant portion we'll be looking at is in French. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I thank you. 
MR. SENDZE:
You're welcome. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, are you on the third page of that document?  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	The last sheet.  
A.	I -- I am on that page.  But there's a portion that has been stricken off. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want you to concern yourself with the list of names you see on that last sheet.  You see the name of Robert Kajuga, don't you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And he was president of the Interahamwe at the national level? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	You also see the name of Niyitegeka, Dieudonné, which we have seen before, and he was the treasurer of the Interahamwe.  Do you see that? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Okay.  And now you see at -- the last name is the name of Setiba, Joseph, who is described therein as the president of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Now, on the second page, the second sheet of that document, at the bottom -- I think the 
	last paragraph -- in the communiqué, it says, "They decided that the Interahamwe of the Kigali town préfecture and those of Kigali-rural who were in the other préfectures should return to their secteurs of origin on 20th June 1994 at the latest to receive fresh instructions." 

In the communiqué Interahamwes of Kigali-ville and Kigali-rural were being called upon by their leaders.  And that explains Mr. Joseph Setiba's name at the bottom of the communiqué.  

Now, in light of this information which is before you now, do you still want to insist that Joseph Setiba was not the president of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, do you thank these people -- think that these people had leaders and they did just what they wanted, whenever they wanted, whatever they wanted?  

Now, concerning Setiba, if he had been a leader of Interahamwe in Kigali-rural, he wouldn't have associated himself with these people without my knowledge, without having sought my authorisation to do so.  Can you prove to me that he was elected to this office?  And who could have elected him to that office?  This just shows that people were doing whatever they wanted to do, whenever they wanted to do so.  

And so, to summarise, all I can tell you is that if you continue investigations -- I know that in Rwanda you have investigators -- the real Interahamwe of Kigali-rural will tell you that they did not know this person and that Setiba was never elected to this office.  Nobody will tell you that. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Semanza.  
MR. SENDZE:
Without having to bring these exhibits before the Court at this time, I would only note that the Court, in its deliberations, can consult Exhibit P. 220, and Exhibit 108 in this trial to support the point I just made about Setiba.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, let's discuss the swearing-in of Juvénal Kajelijeli as bourgmestre of Mukingo in 1994.  You testified yesterday that you were informed of the swearing-in ceremony by Mr. Nzirorera; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That's correct. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court approximately when Mr. Nzirorera gave you this information.  
A.	I do not have the exact date in my mind, given the amount of time that has gone past.  Nevertheless, since we were neighbours somewhat in Gisenyi, I think he told me about this ceremony two days before the ceremony in fact took place. 
Q.	So where did you travel from to attend the ceremony? 
A.	Gisenyi.  That was where I lived. 
Q.	And you testified yesterday that upon arrival at the ceremony you were given a guest of honour's seat; is that true? 
A.	Yes.  As a -- a guest, high-ranking guest who was visiting, I had one. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The exhibits -- do they -- are you con -- finished the -- using them?  
MR. SENDZE:
Yes, I am. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then perhaps the registrar could retrieve them.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, before the registrar withdraws the documents, I would have liked to raise a problem with you relating to Setiba.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, inasmuch as I would like to hear from you, I would request that you hold on and make your comments about Setiba on redirect.  I have what I need from you on Setiba.  So you can hold off until -- when it's time for redirect. 
A.       Mr. President, I will be very brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Prosecutor is entitled to conduct his cross-examination as he chooses.  Now, when he has completed, Mr. Nimy will have an opportunity to examine you again, and that would be an opportunity when you can address the issue, if he chooses to allow you to do so. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, you said you were given a guest of honour's seat because of your position.  What position are you referring to? 
A.	I was a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	And Mr. Nzirorera was also given a guest of honour's seat, I suppose.  
A.	He was in his native area, and it was not necessary for him to be given a guest of honour's seat.  It was his native commune.  It was as if he was at home. 
Q.	But given his position within the MRND party, which was higher than the position you held, you are saying that you were given a guest of honour's seat and Nzirorera was sent to the back? 
A.	When someone is at home, it is that person who receives and hosts the guests.  That person may even be standing while inviting the guests to seat -- to -- to sit down.  That shouldn't surprise you. 
Q.	Is that what Mr. Nzirorera was doing, ushering the guests to their seats? 
A.	No.  There were others in charge of welcoming the guests and taking them to their seats.  But what I am saying is that, because it was Nzirorera's native commune, he could have chosen to sit down or to remain standing, should there have been other guests who needed to be seated. 
Q.	But, Mr. Semanza, this is the person who invited you to the ceremony.  And you attended the ceremony in his company.  And I am asking you if he sat at the guest of honour's seat, and you are talking about would haves and could haves.  Were you not there?  Was Mr. Nzirorera seated as a guest of honour? 
A.	Yes.  He occupied a guest of honour's seat because there were sufficient seats in place.  So he was seated among the guests of honour. 
Q.	I'll submit to you that he was given that seat because of his high-ranking position within the MRND party and his position of influence within Mukingo commune, as a son or a native of that commune, as you've testified.  Do you disagree with me? 
A.	Well, he was respected across the country, not only in Mukingo commune.  So throughout the country he would have been given a seat of honour.  
Q.	Did you observe the presence of any higher authority within the MRND during this swearing-in ceremony?  When I mean -- when I say higher, I mean higher than Mr. Nzirorera.  
A.	I think there must have been some higher authorities, like the préfet and military officers and members of parliament.  Yes.  There were very many figures of authority.  And I do not remember all those who were present.  The fact is that there were many figures of authority in attendance. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, Mr. Nzirorera was the highest ranking MRND party official at this ceremony.  He was seated as a guest of honour, an influential and very well-respected son of Mukingo, and a personal friend to Juvénal Kajelijeli.  You want this Court to believe that he would attend the swearing-in ceremony and also attend the reception organised after the ceremony and would say nothing throughout this ceremony?  
A.	At the national level instructions had been issued requiring that, whenever we attend such meetings in our capacities as party leaders, no one should make any official speech.  In that particular instance Kajelijeli was being sworn in as bourgmestre.  He was being sworn into an administrative position.  And, therefore, as political leaders, we were forbidden from making any statements or any official statements.  That is why Nzirorera, as a leader of the MRND, did not take the floor and did not speak during the swearing-in ceremony of the bourgmestre.

1015H 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	During this ceremony did you observe the march past of the Amahindure? 
A.	It is true that there was a march past by some youth, some young girls and some young men and even some adults.  Yes, I noticed that there was a march past. 
Q.	And these Amahindure who marched past were carrying guns and clubs and other kinds of weapons, were they not? 
A.	I did not see a single firearm.  Those who were marching past did not carry any firearms. 
Q.	Okay.  Yesterday in your evidence in chief you discussed with Defence counsel some facts that have been imported into this trial from your trial -- from your judgement. 

Now, it is common knowledge, Mr. Semanza, that you have been tried on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity before this Tribunal.  That is true, is it not? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	During your trial you were represented by counsel, were you not? 
A.	Yes, I was. 
Q.	And you did call numerous witnesses to come and testify before the Honourable Judges in your defence; correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And you yourself even testified before the Judges over ten trial days, and during that time you told 
	the Judges -- 
A.	I think it was more than ten days.  My testimony lasted more than ten days, I think. 
Q.	Thank you.  And you fully explained to the Judges what your story is about the events; true? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And after carefully deliberating over the testimony -- or the evidence presented by the Prosecution, and by you in your defence, the Trial Chamber found you guilty of crimes against humanity and 
	sentenced you to 25 years in prison. 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, you were not satisfied with the judgement, so you exercised your legal right to appeal, and you filed an appeal before the Appeals Chamber contesting the findings of the Trial Chamber, including the findings that have been judicially noticed in this trial; true? 
A.	Yes.  That is what happened. 
Q.	You were represented by counsel in your appeal, were you not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, the Appeals Chamber read all your submissions and heard what you had to say challenging the Trial Chamber's findings.  And when it came back with its judgement, it confirmed these findings from the Trial Chamber and actually increased your sentence from 25 years to 35 years.  That is the fact, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Is there anything you have testified to before this Chamber concerning these adjudicated facts that you did not testify to in your trial? 
A.	I believe that when I was being examined in chief I stated that, although I was convicted by the Appeals Chamber, I am in the process of gathering evidence to request for a review of my case, because I believe that I was unfairly or unjustly convicted because the Trial Chamber relied on the lies told by Prosecution witnesses.  

And I have even provided examples of witnesses to whom you, Mr. Prosecutor, made promises.  You also called witnesses who worked with Ibuka and the Office of the Prosecutor to provide false testimony -- false testimonies. 

The Judges have begun to notice that your witnesses often lie, and that is why people are getting to be acquitted more and more today.  That is why I'm convinced that the Judges will not reject the evidence that I am going to file when I make my request for a review. 
Q.	Well, I submit that, in light of the fact that your testimony before this Chamber over the course of
two hours and one minute added nothing to what you testified to over the course of more than
ten trial days -- and this Chamber has no reason to attach any weight to the testimony you have given in respect of the adjudicated facts admitted in this case from your trial. 

Now, let's discuss one final thing. 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I note -- I notice that you have not changed and that your position is the same. 
Q.	You did admit in direct examination that you are -- you and Mr. Nzirorera are in-laws; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  But I married away my daughter to his father. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I think there was a slip of the tongue, which we all must have noticed because 
	the -- maybe the witness should repeat his answer. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, did you mean to say that you married off your daughter to Mr. Nzirorera's brother? 
A.	Yes.  What I meant is that it is Nzirorera's father who came to ask for my daughter's hand on behalf of Nzirorera's brother. 
Q.	Okay.  So you consider Mr. Nzirorera family.  You actually described him as a brother; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, he is a brother. 
Q.	And it is natural in Rwandan culture for family members and brothers to stick together, protect each other.  Would you agree? 
A.	No.  What you say is incorrect.  When one is a man of truth and when the Judges are looking for the truth, it is not prohibited for a brother to tell the truth in relation to the trial of members of his family.  

I am very thankful to the Judges for acquitting some of the accused persons whose family members appeared as Defence witnesses.  I say so because the Judges came to the conclusion that those family members were telling the truth. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, I submit that your testimony before this Chamber has been largely influenced by your relationship with Mr. Nzirorera, to the extent that you even had to lie about the existence of the Interahamwe in your own commune. 
A.	I have told you that during the popular entertainment rallies people talked about Interahamwe.  But that was within the context of such popular entertainment activities.  But there is no formal context in which the expression Interahamwe was used.  

Let me go, again, one step further and state for the benefit of the Judges that the other parties also had specific names for their members who were used for the purposes of popular animation, in view of recruiting members into the parties. 

In our party we had the Interahamwe, who were used for popular entertainment.  They were the Abakombozi for the PSD, and then all other political parties had such wings.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions to put to Mr. Semanza.  But before I take my seat, I would pray the Court to admit the prior testimony of Mr. Semanza in his trial on the 13th of February 2002, just the excerpts that I handed to the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
MR. MJUI: 
That will be Exhibit 442, Your Honour, A for French, B for English.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 442A and P. 442B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Nimy, do you wish to conduct any redirect examination of this witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
I didn't hear the interpretation of your question, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I was enquiring whether you wish to conduct any redirect of this witness. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, not -- not really for redirect.  All I would like to do is to ask Mr. Semanza to say what he wanted to say about Mr. Setiba a short while ago. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Semanza, you have the opportunity now. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Setiba had himself referred to as an Interahamwe, whereas he really was not one.  I have before me the document of his confessional statement when he was seeking forgiveness for the crimes he had committed.  That document is a five-page document.  And on page 3, to make the record clear, particularly in respect of the fact that he was not an Interahamwe, nor was he a chairman of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural, if you look at page 3, last paragraph, last line, this is what Setiba himself has to say:  

He states that he was in possession of documents that had been handed over to him by Renzaho, who was the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture.  You would agree with me that such a person could not have been elected to the chair of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural préfecture, whereas they were a native of Kigali-ville préfecture, and that such a person received identification documents from the authorities of Kigali-ville préfecture.  Therefore, you must understand that such a person could not run for the position of president of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural préfecture, because he was not a native of that préfecture.  That is what I wanted to ask (sic).  

Mr. President, allow me to avail myself of this opportunity to thank you and the Honourable Judges.  And I would like to state that I'm convinced that you are in a position to be able to correct some of the mistakes that were made in a number of cases.  I say so because the Prosecutor and his witnesses have misled the Tribunal.  I'm convinced that you are in a position to correct such mistakes.  

I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
          (No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Please, Mr. President, can counsel take over his statement from the beginning.  Mr. President --  
Mr. President, I just asked from the English booth that counsel should take over his statement.  
Mr. President, there is a problem.  Mr. President, we are asking for Counsel Nimy to take over his statement.  Is anyone hearing me in the Trial Chamber?  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, I'm hearing you, but I'm not sure what you mean.  I got the impression that the witness himself was reading from a document.  So why is it that you are asking the English booth to give you the document?  
Perhaps the registrar could collect it from the witness and give it to you, if that is what you are aiming to achieve. 
MR. SENDZE: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I think the English booth has been requesting that Mr. Nimy should repeat what he said from the beginning.  It looks like they had technical difficulties and they could not hear him.  So he could -- he could repeat his submission so that they would translate it. 
MR. NIMY: 
Well, that is what I also understood, Mr. President, because, as you just said, it is the registry that is supposed to give this document to me for me to be able to request that it is admitted in evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you seen the document yet, Mr. Nimy? 
MR. NIMY: 
Precisely, Mr. President.  That is what I want to do.  I would like to see -- see it, evaluate it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it belongs -- you'll have to ask the witness if he is willing to give it to you.  And if he agrees, the registrar can assist as a go between.  It's his document.  It's his document. 
MR. NIMY: 
But, Mr. President, if time allows, as soon as I have said it, you said it.  I'll just put the question to the witness. 

	Mr. Semanza?  
THE WITNESS:
	I have no objection to that.  I can hand the document over to you, Counsel. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, the witness will hand the document over to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Mr. Registrar, will you assist, please. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, maybe Counsel Nimy can ask -- look at the document during the break and we can address this issue during the break.  It's now 38 (sic). 
MR. SENDZE: 
Sorry, the Prosecutor is also interested in seeing the document.  Or we could be given the date of the document since it's --  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, is the only issue whether or not the document should be admitted?  Or are you likely 
	to -- what I will do, if you like, is discharge the witness now and then we have our mid-morning recess, and then we could address the document afterwards.  Or do you want the witness to remain, in the event that you have further questions to put to him or -- or can I discharge him now? 
MR. NIMY: 
No, Mr. President.  I agree with your proposal.  We can go on the -- take our break, and when we resume, we can address the document, except my learned colleagues have additional questions to put to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is redirect.  They didn't ask any questions before.  

I saw Mr. Weyl on his feet, and maybe I overlooked him.  Did you have any questions that you wished to put to the witness, Mr. Weyl, or were you just reinforcing your timekeeping duties?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, since you give me the opportunity to make things clear, first of all, I asked some questions to the witness and, secondly, I wish to not do -- don't go to redirect.  

And as you said, Mr. President, you are joining me in the proposal which I made earlier on, that we go on break and that after the break we should have a discussion on the eventual admission of that document as exhibit.  I think we are agreed on that, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, your testimony has ended.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  But now you are discharged and free to go.  

We will be taking our mid-morning recess now.  

Mr. Nimy, have you an application to make?  
MR. NIMY: 
The same -- well, as usual, I forget to request that the witness be authorised to meet Mr. Nzirorera, with your express permission, of course, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The registrar will make the usual arrangements. 
(Court recessed from 1042H to 1128H)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Nimy.  Have you had a chance to consider your position?  

MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Yes, I do not think that I will seek to produce this document into evidence, because it doesn't add anything to all what has already been achieved in this case.  I, therefore, withdraw my application for this document to be produced into evidence, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. SENDZE: 
Yes.  The Prosecutor also had a chance to look at this document and we will -- we make an application for the document to be marked for identification.  

The document reinforces the position that the Prosecution has taken in respect of Mr. Setiba's position in the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural.  So we seek that it be marked for identification so that we can later on refer to it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I see no objection to having that document marked for identification.  But, as for the other comments made by the Prosecutor, I do not understand them. 

The only purpose for marking for identification would be so there might be a subsequent opportunity to admit it into evidence. 

Because, as of now, the document is not signed.  It is in French.  It appears to be authored by someone whose name has not yet been mentioned but might need to be.  And now, if we have to call Mr. Setiba to address that document, why not?  So I do not understand the Prosecutor's other documents.  

Marking for -- for identification, yes.  What probative value and what weight to give to that document, I don't know.  And I think there really shouldn't be any, except we call Mr. Setiba to address or to speak to that document. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, Your Honours, I have a comment to make in light of Mr. Weyl's submission. 

This document actually was written originally in Kinyarwanda.  The Prosecution does have a 
signed copy by Witness HH.  What was circulated by this witness, Mr. Semanza, was a 
French translation.  We have the English translation, the French translation and the Kinyarwanda original.  In light of what Mr. Weyl has said, I see no reason why we shouldn't simply admit it in evidence.  I thought the Prosecution was being quite gracious by suggesting it simply be identified for the record.  

But in the second paragraph of that letter, it states quite clearly, and this is coming from Witness HH, who has already testified in this trial, "I was appointed president of the Interahamwe by 
MRND chairman, Laurent Semanza", who was the witness we just listened to, "on request of 
national secretary" -- "MRND national secretary, Joseph Nzirorera". 

And perhaps Mr. Nimy can pass up the document to the Court.  The Court can examine it.  But it certainly is the type of document that we have admitted in evidence in the past.  We have it from a witness who has testified in this case, and we have a signed version in its original language.  

So in light of what Mr. Weyl has said, the Court should have no problem admitting it in evidence. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I rise because the Prosecutor is attempting, poorly, to protect his own witnesses.  There is a lot that one can look at from the statement that Mr. Webster has just made.  I do not want to insist, but some of his comments need to be redacted.  

I simply want to say that Mr. Semanza referred to a statement by Mr. Setiba.  If that statement were genuinely from Mr. Setiba, it is only Mr. Setiba himself who can tell the Court whether the document from him can be admitted into evidence, particularly in respect of the veracity of what it contains. 

So that is my position, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I was to say any more, it would compromise the identity of witnesses.  What I would do is simply invite the Court to look at the document and look at other exhibits that I can mention by number, and it can make its assessment on that basis. 

	Before the Court rules, could I just indicate that it can -- the Chamber can refer to 
	D. NZ Exhibits No. 192 through 204.  All of those exhibits concern related issues with the document that I have just -- we've just been discussing. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, what -- what we were thinking might be appropriate is to reserve our decision in this matter.  We'd -- we'd also need to see the original document before taking a decision on this matter. 
So we would mark the document for identification now and reserve our decision on the application to have it admitted into evidence.  And we would like to see the original document before taking a decision on this matter. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, yes, we take note of your decision.  Maybe I should give you some information which may enlighten you as you give a ruling on this. 

We refused to submit the document because it does not add anything, for the good reason that what transpires from this document was taken into consideration by the Prosecutor to establish his charges. 

And we, in our preliminary statement which we -- brief which we disclosed to all the parties -- we put forward that which is in the document and we have mentioned that -- the witnesses who would show up to disclose that which is in that document.  And we have begun presenting these witnesses.  

Witness Karera was here.  Questions were put to him on what is in that document.  He -- he responded, and you will appreciate that the witness who just left the dock answered questions on that issue from that document.  And we have subsequent witnesses to whom we would put the same questions on that document.  

And so, unless we want to overburden the archives of the Trial Chamber, I am simply saying that you have all that you need for the Trial Chamber and the case to go on.  

We, therefore, did not see the need to tender into evidence a document which does not add anything to the Prosecutor, because all that the Prosecutor has requested has been taken into consideration in a preliminary brief.  And we have witnesses who will be answering on those. 

I believe, Mr. President, this could help you in your assessment subsequently. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Nimy.  The point is that the witness used this document in his testimony to address an issue which had been raised. 

Now, we had suggested that he should not do that unless you would allow him to do it in redirect, and you did.  So the document has featured in the testimony, and the application for its admission has been made.  We have to consider it.  We think that in order to consider it properly, we need to see the original. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it is not the original that the witness saw.  So he expressed himself on a document on which the Trial Chamber would not be expressing itself.  And so I do not know what the Trial Chamber would be deducing from the original to appreciate the purport of the witness to express what he expressed in that which was not the original document.  So I believe that actually we are talking about many things which, at the end of the day, are so out of order -- out of topic.  

And the fact that the Prosecutor did not think that he should use that document in his case when he had the possibility of doing so in putting evidence, and he has for the past four years, from the 
original -- from the origins -- he has had that document from 2004.  It is of no relevance.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, it is relevant.  If the witness uses a document to say, "This document shows that what I'm saying is the truth."  That's what the witness said.  We are entitled to look at the document to compare the document with what he said.  So that's the only issue here.  

And he did it voluntarily.  We suggested that he shouldn't do it, and his counsel got him to speak about it, and the document has featured in our trial in that context.  We have to consider the application which has been made.  

Now, if you wish for an opportunity to make further submissions, you can do so.  But we have to make a decision on this matter.  The matter is legitimately before us, and we will consider it. 

Mr. Nimy, are you ready with your next witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, before Mr. Nimy proceeds with his next witness, I just want the record to reflect the document that we admitted during the testimony of Defence Witness François Karera.  They have been assigned exhibit numbered -- numbers, and they are as follows:  The letter dated 24th of August 1993.  The text is only in French and it was given Exhibit No. P. 436.  

And number 2 is a letter dated the 21st October 1993.  It was signed by Mr. Karera, and it has been assigned Exhibit No. P. 437; A, French; B, English.  

And document number 3 is a letter dated the 20th of December 1993 signed by Augustin Iyamuremye, and it was assigned Prosecution Exhibit P. 438.  It is in French only. 

And the fourth document, Your Honour, is the Radio Rwanda transcript of the 20th of May 1994.  This was the interview that François Karera had with journalist Jean-Marie Vianney Kabengera.  It was assigned Exhibit P. 439; A, French; B, English; and C, Kinyarwanda. 

And document number 5, Your Honours, is the trial transcripts of François Karera in his own case,
The Prosecution versus François Karera.  And this was the transcript dated the 
28 -- 23rd of August 2006.  It's assigned Prosecution Exhibit P. 440; A, French; B, English. 
And the last exhibit, Your Honours, is the New York Times article of the 15th of August 1994.  This was rejected, but it was admitted for identification purposes, and it is marked ID -- Prosecution ID. 57, and is in English. 

Your Honours, I can pass these documents to Mr. Issa, and, as Your Honours pleases, that's all I have got. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, we will begin by looking at your personal identification sheet, which I suppose must be laying before you.  Can you see that sheet before you?  
A.	Yes, I have it here.  I have the sheet here in English. 
Q.	Now, do you want to kindly cross-check the elements, the information or the particulars in that document?  And if the information there is accurate and tallies with your identity, sign the document after adding the date of today to the document.  
A.	Today's the 25th; am I right?  
Q.	Yes, today's the 25th February 2010.  
A.	I have signed. 
Q.      Very well.
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, would you kindly admit as evidence this PIS with the reference D. NZ761.  And, of course -- and again, I'm talking under the supervision and subject to correction by Mr. Issa. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ761 admitted)  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY: 
Q.	Now, Mr. Niyitegeka, would you kindly write -- would you kindly describe to the Trial Chamber, I beg your pardon, your academic background? 
A.	Thank you.  I underwent primary school studies at the Ngoma school complex in the Ngoma -- in the Kibuye préfecture, and that was until 1966.  And in 1966 I passed my entrance into secondary school, and I did secondary school.  I did scientific humanitarian studies at the Adventist school in Gitwe, and from 1966 -- that was done from 1966 to 1972.  After my diploma in the humanities, I was admitted in the national teaching institute, IPN.  This was an advanced teachers' training school in Butare.  And I was there from 1972 to 1975.  

It was on the 7th July that I finished my studies, and two weeks after I was recruited at the radio as a journalist.  But in 1978 I obtained a scholarship for journalism, and I studied at the faculty of journalism in Bucharest from 1978 to 1981, at the end of which I had a bachelor's in journalism.  That is all that I did as studies.  
Q.	Thank you.  And after your diploma, what could you tell us about your professional career? 
A.	Immediately after I got my bachelor's degree in journalism, I returned home.  I left 
Bucharest, which is the capital of Romania, and I went back to my country.  At the time there was no parliament.  There was no national assembly in Rwanda.  And so with the constitution that had been --  recently been promulgated, the institution provided for a parliamentary organ known as CND, 
National Council for Development.  That was parliament for Rwanda at the time.  

On 15th September I tabled my candidacy to serve as a member of parliament, and you can imagine that was only two months after I returned from school or studies in Romania.  And even so, my candidacy was admitted.  Elections took place in December 1981, at the end of which I was elected member of parliament for Kibuye préfecture.  I took the oath of office as member of parliament on the 8th of January 1982.  I spent two years at the national assembly.  Thank you.  
Q.	And how did your career continue to unfold after your departure from Rwanda? 
A.	Immediately after the two-year term, which should have been five years, but it was shortened to 
	two years -- well, that was what was decided -- I did not renew my mandate.  Instead, I went into business, and I became a businessman, and things were going on well until the advent of multipartyism.  That was in 1989, 1990.  I decided to engage in politics as an opposition politician.  And with multipartyism I became a member of the MDR, the movement for launching democracy.  And this was an opposition party to MRND that was there in power.  

I was a member of the political bureau of that party.  I served as president of that party at the 
Kibuye préfecture.  And in 1993 -- in 1993, particularly on the 30th of December 1993, the 
political bureau of the party designated me as candidate for minister of communication in the broad-based extended government with the RPF.  Unfortunately, my candidature was not accepted by the prime minister who was appointed at the time, and government, which was supposed to be put in place, was not invested (sic) with necessary power with the events which unfolded, as you certainly do know.  

So after the attempt against the president -- the aeroplane of President Habyarimana on the 
6th of April, the party which had put in place a government at the time came together.  And since the government that was in place had been decapitated entirely, they agreed that they would put in place another government.  That was how I became part of the broad-based interim government that was put in place on the 9th of April 1994.  Until I went on exile on the 17th of July 1994, I was 
minister of information.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, it is twelve, midday.  Do I continue, or do I stop here?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I think we need to take our adjournment now, our lunchtime adjournment.  We resume at 2 o'clock.  

We break for lunch now, Mr. Niyitegeka, and we resume at two.  While you are a witness, during this or any other adjournment, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.

(Court resumed at 1415H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.

Mr. Nimy, you may continue.  
MR. NIMY:
Good morning (sic), Mr. President.  

Good day, Mr. President.  Good day, Your Honours. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, good -- good day.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel Nimy. 
Q.	We are going to carry on from where we left off before lunch break.  You were explaining the 
	last moments of your professional career before fleeing into exile.

Could you please carry on, Mr. Niyitegeka.  
A.	I believe that my career ended when I fled into exile.  When I went into exile, my career came to an end practically, in any case so far as we were concerned here. 
Q.	Thank you.  And where did you go to when you left Rwanda? 
A.	As I said earlier today, I left the country on the 17th of July 1994 through Rwanda's southern frontier border with current Congo, former Zaire.  I went and settled in Bukavu. 
Q.	So how were you arrested and brought to Arusha? 
A.	I stayed in Bukavu up till 1996.  The RPF military offensive chased us away from Bukavu.  I sought refuge in the Zaire forest.  And I only came out of the forest in 1998.  

I was in Nairobi.  I was in Nairobi, and that is where the officers from the Prosecution office came and met me.  But to be more specific, in July 1996 already, I learnt that an indictment had been issued against me.  

In July 1996 I went to the UNHCR original representative, Patrick De Souza, in Zaire and I told him that I was wanted by the UNICTR and that I was available for surrender if it was asked where I was.  And I gave him my address.  His name is Patrick De Souza.  

So I never went -- never went into hiding.  As soon as I learnt that I was wanted, I presented myself.  Nothing was done until the RPF attack in October 1996.  With the other people I sought refuge in the Zairean forest, which we left in 1998.  And in February 1999 I was arrested in Nairobi.  

And there is an internal memorandum of the Prosecution office which states that I did not resist arrest.  That memorandum was written by an officer of the Prosecution office.  His name is Pierre Ngessa, and he is Cameroonian. 
Q.	Thank you.  And how did you -- what was the outcome of your trial in Arusha? 
A.	When I was arrested, and I need to tell the Chamber this, the officers of the Prosecution office proposed that I should cooperate with the Tribunal by entering a guilty plea for some charges.  

And we discussed for four days with them, the 11th, the 12th, the 15th and 18th of February 1999.  The minutes of those sessions were drawn by Pierre Duclos, who is also an officer in the ICTR.  

And these sessions were ended because I refused to enter a guilty plea because I felt I was innocent, and to date I still feel I'm innocent.  In June 2002 the trial began and concluded.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, there is hammering and we cannot hear what the witness said as from the time when he was convicted in June 2002. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness, wait a minute.  The interpreters did not get this answer because there was an inter -- a noise interruption.  Please repeat.

Mr. Registrar.  
THE WITNESS:
The whole answer?  Should I repeat the whole answer?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please. 
THE WITNESS:
I was saying that I was arrested on the 9th of February 1999 in Nairobi.  I did not resist the police who came to arrest me.  And this can be found in a report of the circumstances of my arrest made by an officer of the Prosecution office, known as Pierre Ngessa, who is Cameroonian.

Subsequent to my arrest, officers of the Prosecution office approached me.  And I'm going to be specific.  It was Chief Prosecution Officer Mohamed Othman who was accompanied by 
Pierre Duclos and Pierre Ngessa.  The reason for their mission was to try and convince me for substantial cooperation, as they described it, which would have meant I would have entered a 
guilty plea for the charges that they were going to suggest to me and that subsequently I would testify against the other Accused.

We had a four-day session on the 11th, the 12th, the 15th and the 18th of February 1999.  The outcome of those meetings is found in an internal report that was drafted by Mr. Pierre Duclos of the OTP.  If the Chamber so desires, I may provide the reference of that document.  And I answered them that I was not ready, that I could not enter a guilty plea for things I had not done as I knew that I was innocent, and as a matter of fact I am innocent.

Let me add that the indictment, which had been presented to me at the time of my arrest, was amended four times.  The last version of that indictment was disclosed to me a few days after the presentation of Defence evidence.  A few days after the presentation of Defence evidence, that is when I received the last amended indictment.  

I was convicted on the 15th of May 2003.  I appealed -- and I was sentenced to life in prison, guilty for four counts.  I appealed.  The Appeals Chamber upheld the Trial Chamber's sentence by decision of 9th of June 2004.

This is an adventure I embarked on, and I have embarked on an adventure, and I don't know where it is going to lead me.  It is -- I'm asking for a review, about the seventh application for my trial case to be reviewed.  That is the fifth.  All the four were rejected.  And I asked that the fifth should be re-examined, and I await the outcome.  A while ago I was discussing it with an officer of the registry.

Thank you.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  But the conviction in your trial does not disqualify you as a witness before this Trial Chamber.  

Now, let me carry on my examination-in-chief with another form of exercise.

Mr. Niyitegeka, at the advent of multiparty politics, as I understand, you were -- you were a 
member of the MDR political party, is that correct?
A.	Yes, indeed, the MDR. 
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber briefly what the objectives of your party were. 
A.	The MDR was considered as a popular party, a people's party, a party that sought democracy, that promotes republican values and that promotes the tenets of justice.  As a matter fact, its slogan was liberty, justice and work. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Niyitegeka.  I would like you to describe to the Trial Chamber maybe how both phenomena, which Rwanda witnessed rather concomitantly, namely, war at the advent of 
	multipartyism -- how could that have impacted the political arena or landscape at the time? 
A.	The political landscape in Rwanda was impacted, particularly, by the summit of African leaders and the first African conference which took place in Bonn, and, if I'm not mistaken, that was 1990.  This was in June/July, while the war sparked off by soldiers of the Ugandan army, particularly from Rwanda who were Rwandan citizens, who launched an attack on the 1st of October 1990, and all this disturbed the political landscape in Rwanda.  

	And with multipartyism, mono-partyism found it difficult to die and give over to multipartyism or to separate or part with the advantages that it enjoyed at the time and while war sowed havoc, chaos, insecurity, looting, banditry, and all that would accompany war, as you all know. 
Q.	Thank you.  You're talking about war, but I would like you to tell the Trial Chamber, particularly the consequences of this on the Tutsi/Hutu relationship or even the entire cohesion or harmony of Rwandans as a people by comparing the phenomenon of war and the phenomenon of 
	multiparty politics.

Did you get my question?
A.	Yes.  If I got you right, multipartyism had its consequences on social relations in Rwanda and war had its own consequences on the said relationships, and you must be talking about inter-ethnic relations, if I'm not mistaken.  

And so, as I said earlier on, the war that broke out on the 1st of October 1990 by members of the Ugandan army but of Rwandan stock, these soldiers were particularly from Rwandan refugee families who had settled in Uganda since 1959.  Added to this were the children of Rwandan families who had found refuge in Burundi, in Congo, and in many other places.

While, on the other hand, multipartyism was a culmination of a process which was ongoing within the country.  For example, I joined an opposition party that was based at home.  We were all members of one party, the MRND.  That was the former scenario.  But after multipartyism was ushered in, we deemed it wise to break free from the mono-party system and to move forward independently of this party.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Niyitegeka.  But more precisely, from this multipartyism I would like you to tell the Trial Chamber exactly how political rivalry between different political parties and how the interaction of alliances between these political parties played out.  
A.	Well, I told you that I joined the MDR party, and that was not the only party in the opposition.  There were other parties that saw the light of day, such as the Parti libéral, PL; party social democrat --
	social democratic party, PSD; Christian democratic party; the green party, and so on and so forth.

But in all, if I am not mistaken, there were in all 17 or 18 political parties in Rwanda in 1994.  And so, as in every country of the world, the interplay of alliances evolved according to various interests.  We had an alliance in the opposition known as Democratic Forces for Change.  This alliance brought together parties, such as the MDR, the PL and the PSD and sometimes the PDC.  And at a certain point in time the socialist party, PS, also joined this alliance.

While, on the other hand, on the other side, there were parties that were part of the presidential movement and which was headed by the MRND.  This was part of the presidential majority.  And there were other smaller parties who -- which I really do not recall.  But this other alliance was known as ARD.  Yes, I think so.  Except you want some -- are you satisfied?  
Q.	No.  I just wanted to make sure that I was interpreting your silence appropriately.  

But the parties which you just mentioned, the parties that were of the opposition, what was their aim in the face of the MRND, given that all these parties and the MRND were hitherto all members of the MRND party?  Can you tell the Trial Chamber? 
A.	But the aim of political parties is to attend to power, conquer power.  It is to conquer power, to take over power democratically.  Opposition political parties came together.  We pooled our efforts together to be much stronger in face of the MRND, which came from or was borne of the former one-party system and which still had power, because it was the party of the president of the republic.  And so the aim was to conquer power.  

First of all, power-sharing before the elections, that was where we got to in the first place, and then to conquer power by the ballot box democratically through elections which were slated to hold, but which, unfortunately, never took place because of what you and I know. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, at that stage of the political history of Rwanda, since 1990 was there a focus against any political -- any ethnic group, particularly the Tutsi ethnic group? 
A.	To the best of my knowledge, no. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, you just talked about the Democratic Front for Change, FDC.  Do you recall a meeting which took place in Brussels on the 3rd of June 1992 with the RPF? 
A.	That meeting rather took place from the 1st to the 3rd of June.  And from that 1st to 3rd June 1992 in a hotel in Brussels where the FDC had sent representatives and MDR, of course, was represented particularly by Twagiramungu and Bagaragaza, if my memory serves me right.

And I might add, I myself -- I went there.  I stopped over at that hotel on my way back from a seminar on democracy which took place in Dakar.  And when I did a brief stopover in Brussels, I went to the hotel where this meeting was taking place, and the final communiqué after that meeting was signed on the 3rd of June.  
Q.	And what was this alliance of opposition parties expecting from this meeting? 
A.	This was in the heat of war.  What we were expecting from the RPF was to lay down their arms and to come over and to carry on the fight democratically, to come over and prepare elections, which we all desired at the time in the shortest possible time.  

There was a slogan which was very fashionable at the time.  It was the national conference --
sovereign national conference.  In Kinyarwanda it was referred to as Rukokoma.  Rukokoma.  I can spell it.
Q.	Yes.  I think that would help us.  
A.	R-U-K-O-K-O-M-A.  Rukokoma.  So we wanted to have this Rukokoma held followed by free democratic elections.  So the FDC was inviting the RPF to join this umbrella of parties.  And our hope was that the RPF would listen to us, and we felt that they were of good faith, only to later learn they were not, to our great dismay.  And that is why we had appealed to them to join us, to be able to jointly fight President Habyarimana and his party, the MRND. 
Q.	And as you say, Mr. Niyitegeka, on the morrow of your facts or alliance, Byumba préfecture was attacked by the RPF; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.  And if I'm not mistaken, that attack took place on the 5th of June, namely, two days after the signing of the agreement.  It was a big blow of disappointment to us, because when I returned 
	to -- from Brussels a meeting took place in Kigali, and I took the floor and I reassured the population that all was well.

Unfortunately, a few days after that the RPF attacked and I am one of those who was embarrassed.  I became the laughing stock.  I was ashamed to appear in public because I ran the risk of being lynched by the people. 
Q.	And this attack which took place on the 5th of June 1992, Mr. Niyitegeka, did it have an impact on the cohesion of the opposition political parties which had come together as a force for democratic change? 
A.	Exactly.  And I just told you people came up with different interpretations of this attack.  While some understood that the RPF was operated by bad faith, others came to the conclusion that there was still need to contact the RPF and seek union with them.  

And there was another meeting which took place in Bujumbura following the Brussels meeting with the aim of asking the RPF to put an end to all hostilities and to carry out the political fight and to accept negotiations in view of a final ceasefire agreement, which was finally signed in August 1993, putting an end to the war, a ceasefire agreement which was never respected until the 6th of April when the war broke out again, another sign of their bad faith.

1500H
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	But we will get there, Mr. Niyitegeka.  We will get there.  But for now, I would like you to confirm to the Trial Chamber whether the fissure between the different parties of the democratic front for change due to the -- following the disappointment that you felt with the attack of Byumba on the 
	5th of June 1992 -- can you tell us, was it a fissure, a splintering, based on political considerations with some calling for a process towards democracy and not through the conquest of power by war, or was it a schism based on ethnic considerations?  Have you understood me? 
A.	Yes.  I got you right, Counsel.  I have understood you perfectly.  Until that day there were no problems of ethnic considerations. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Niyitegeka, I really wish to avail myself of your presence here to ask you to explain to the Trial Chamber exactly what the political parties set out for by creating youth wings within their respective parties.
A.	Counsel, I find it difficult to answer that question because I know what we of the MRND wanted by agreeing -- by allowing the JMDR party, that is, the youth wing of the MDR.  It was a youth wing made up primarily of MDR party members.  But also people who were not members could also 
	become members of that youth wing because the JMDR, that is, the MDR youth wing, was a 
	non-profit-making organisation as a legal entity and with its own structures and did not depend 
	directly on the MDR.  

It had its own status, and there were conditions to become a member of the youth wing; whereas, in other parties you had the Abakombozi of the MDR.  Maybe I should spell it if you want.  
Q.	That will be a welcome idea, Mr. Niyitegeka.
A.	Abakombozi spelling, A-B-A-K-O-M-B-O-Z-I, Abakombozi.  It's a word from the Swahili word, the Swahili word meaning Komboa.  My Swahili is not very good.  Maybe someone here can assist me what it means, Komboa.  But in any case, that is where the word Abakombozi comes from.

For the PSD -- for the MRND you had what was known as Interahamwe, but I believe there is no need to spell that one because that is already found in the French Larousse dictionary.  But was the Interahamwe the youth wing of the MRND?  That is the crux of the matter, and I believe that it would be an aberration to say yes to that question because, firstly, the Interahamwe was not, as far as I am concerned -- I need to say it was not a youth wing so to speak.  

It was a group of people.  I'm saying it was not a youth wing because they were older than I was who were members because I was already in my 40's at that time.  The other party, such as the PL, apparently had a youth wing known as JL or the liberal youth.  It was not structured either.

So in sum, as far as I am aware, only the JDR -- no.  The JDR was structured; that is, the youth wing of the MDR was structured.  It had regulations.  It had a legal status which was recognised as ASBR.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  We would like to specify the nature of the Interahamwe maybe subsequently.  But at this stage I would like you to tell the Chamber whether the confrontations -- I am supposing that there were confrontations -- between youth of the various political parties was ethnic in nature.
A.	Clearly the confrontations between the MDR, that is to say, the JDR, and the Interahamwe was 
	rather of a political nature, not an ethnic nature.  One could stumble on people from various 
	ethnic backgrounds, both within the JDR and within the Interahamwe.  

And as I said, the Interahamwe were not a youth wing.  It is a misnomer to state that the Interahamwe was a youth wing of the MRND, but it was not a youth wing.  You cannot say that people like Nkezabera, who was my age, over 40, Rutaganga, George -- these people were old.  When you are above 40, you can't be described as being a youth.  
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, thank you.  But let me come back to the question I asked you to be more specific.  The confrontation between the youth of the various parties -- were these confrontations directed against the Tutsi ethnic group as a group? 
A.	I already answered, Counsel.  I was saying that the confrontations were of a political nature.  Each of the camps were defending their camps.  It had no ethnic nature, and the proof I gave was that within the JDR you had both Hutus and Tutsis as well as Twas while on the side of the Interahamwe, you also had Hutus and Tutsis.  For example, the chairman of the Interahamwe, Kajuga -- he was Tutsi, son of Kajuga, brother of Huss. 
Q.	Tell the Trial Chamber, Mr. Niyitegeka, you are aware that in this political competition between parties there were accusations that were made against the MRND and President Habyarimana during those war years and during those multiparty years; is that correct? 
A.	I didn't quite understand you. 
Q.	I said that during all those years of war and multiparty politics, accusations were made often against the MRND and President Habyarimana; is that correct? 
A.	Accusations by whom?  
Q.	By his political adversaries I mean.
A.	But this was politics, and in politics you have accusations against President Habyarimana and his party.  Especially we were accusing him of not properly managing the war, not leading the country in such a way that an end would come to the war.  We had had it with the war, and we wanted it to come to an end.

And of course, we were in politics.  And we kept saying that we were able to conduct it better than he was doing; that we could conduct negotiations with the belligerents, the RPF, to force them to accept the ceasefire.  But let me be clear.  It was a political fight that we were in.  It was politics. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  From 1991 to 1994, Rwanda was rocked by violence, mined and 
	bomb attacks, political assassinations, even leading up to a stalemate in the Arusha negotiations with respect to the setting up of the transitional institutions.

What is your understanding of this situation?  
A.	It is difficult to answer that question because I was a stakeholder to a certain degree.  Rather I would refer you to documents which were submitted during certain trials before this Tribunal.  You have, for example, Abdul Ruzibiza's book.  I read that book which was written by this Ruzibiza, who is a former RPF soldier, in which he explains in depth what that situation was and who were the perpetrators of those attacks.  I think that you should rather refer to that book. 
Q.	To be more specific, Mr. Niyitegeka, if you are giving me a chance to ask you whether, in your opinion -- or, rather, in your opinion, what was the role played by one of the parties, namely, the RPF, in the destabilisation of the country of Rwanda?
A.	RPF's role in this destabilisation is significant, very considerable, because every time that a shell exploded, opposition parties would say it was the MRND, especially when they bombed -- killed members of opposition parties.  

So it was logical for us to say that it was from the Interahamwe or the members of the MRND who had done so because we didn't have any major problems.  In any case, from the look of things, we didn't have any problems with the RPF up until at some point in time when we were certain and convinced of the bad faith of the RPF.  

Every attack in the country, especially as most of the attacks were in the area -- and I insist on this -- in the area where the opposition had a stronghold, not in the MRND, mostly in Gitarama and Butare.  So we felt that it was likely done by the MRND, the Interahamwe, who were bombing those areas.  We ultimately succeeded in seeing Ruzibiza's testimony who stated that it was rather the RPF which was behind these bombings in order to put opposition parties at loggerheads with the MRND.  And it's an unfortunate situation.  Unfortunately, we only learned about this when it was too late. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  Before raising another point with you, allow me to raise an issue regarding kubohoza.
A.	The pronunciation is kubohoza. 
Q.	Kubohoza.  Yes.  Tell the Chamber where does this come from, its origin.
A.	You need to understand that it is difficult to pronounce because the people -- the members of the 
	MDR party were the ones who were accused of that kubohoza act.  But I was never involved in all that, but there are people who did not tolerate cohabitation.  There are political party members who did not tolerate cohabitation with opposition members.  
This especially happened in the Gitarama préfecture which was the cradle of the former MDR party which at the time was called MRND-PARMEHUTU.  MDR members, some of them, not all, from that Gitarama préfecture were unable -- were incapable of tolerating cohabitation with people who continued to belong to the MRND. 
Q.	Well, you must say --  
A.	It is worthwhile stating that they did not attack them physically, but they wanted to force them to become members of the MDR and to leave the MRND.  This is what was called the kubohoza.  Or you had some authorities who were members of the MRND and who continued to be members of the MRND and those members of the opposition party did not tolerate their membership of the MRND and wanted to recruit them by all means and at times by abusing.  

You had abuses.  You had excesses.  It's unfortunate.  These were punished, but it happened one day in a commune in the Kibuye préfecture where I was the MDR chairman -- in a commune, the 
Bwakira commune, B-W-A-K-I-R-A, Bwakira, where the bourgmestre of that commune was called Kabasha, K-A-B-A-S-H-A, was stopped by MDR militants in a market.  They seized him and forced him into a sack.  They placed them on a weighing machine and told him that he was not worth anything if he did not take up membership of the MDR.

It was funny, but it was an attack against an authority.  It ridiculed him.  This needs to be stated.  That happened.  It is unfortunate.  These are incidents along the democratic journey which was faced.  There was very little we could do about it.  That's it. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  Because if I understood you well, the phenomenon of kubohoza was not created by the MDR, but rather it was a victim of the backlash.  
A.	But the MRND had everything.  They did not need a kubohoza.  Those who had nothing wanted a kubohoza, things that belonged to the people and which the people wanted to recover.  

For example, you had the case where administrative vehicles, especially belonging to the communes which had been given by the former MRND mono-party, were given to this administration.  Those people went and recovered this.  They said that it belonged to the people.  It did not belong to the MRND.

So the MRND had no kubohoza because they had everything.  They did not need kubohoza.  We wanted kubohoza because we wanted to recover some of what belonged to the MRND.  I would like to insist that isn't me.  It is the opposition as a whole; whereas, because I was not involved in any kubohoza act, and all my friends know this very well.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  Tell me -- rather, tell the Chamber, there were many ceasefire agreements followed by violations of those ceasefires by the RPF.  I'm thinking about the ceasefire of the 
	8th of February 1993.

What was the social and political consequences of this, especially with respect to displaced persons?
A.	It should be said that that ceasefire agreement was signed at a time when at the outskirts of Kigali, the capital, there were about one million internally displaced people, especially from the Byumba and Ruhengeri préfectures, close to one million internally displaced people.  That is about one seventh of the Rwandan population on the outskirts of the city of Kigali.  And you should remember that Kigali had a population of no more than 400,000 people.  These million IDP's had nothing to live on, nothing to eat.  Nobody came to their rescue.

I remember that the authorities asked the UN High Commission for Refugees to assist.  I don't know what political parties were asking for.  And the UNHCR answered that it was unable to intervene on behalf of the IDP's; that they only intervened for refugees; that these were IDP's.  They were not refugees.  And so the UNHCR could do nothing for them.

I am fully aware of this because the minister of social affairs who was supposed to be in charge of these refugees was from an operation (sic) party, and we used to share information, and he used to tell us that there was no way for things -- for anything to be done.  

So it was a serious problem, both for the entire population and also for Kigali.  It was a threat to Kigali.  The road to Byumba, because this was on the way through Rutongo, through Byumba -- you could not use that road and even more so for somebody like me who was a member of the opposition.  

People say, "Oh, he is collaborating with the RPF.  We are fleeing because of the RPF, and now he is coming in."  So you could get lynched.  In summary, you need to understand over 900,000 -- close to 1,000,000 people near to a capital with only about 400,000 people, nothing to eat, nothing to wear -- nothing at all.  No assistance.  It was a serious threat. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Niyitegeka.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I have noticed that it's half past three.  I believe this may be a good time to adjourn.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The issues on which this witness will testify -- about how much longer do you think you are going to have?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I am -- I believe I may need the morning of Monday -- Monday morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
A point of enquiry.  I suppose I could make this afterwards, but are we proceeding with Mr. Setako on Monday morning or with this witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, we shall continue with the present witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Yes.  We take the adjournment now until Monday.

Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I did at midday, that you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during the adjournment while you are on the witness stand.  
(Court adjourned at 1535H)
