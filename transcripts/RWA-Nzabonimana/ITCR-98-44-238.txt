P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you please open the proceedings?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, 21st February 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Appearances, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, everyone, for the Prosecution.  Don Webster as the trial leader, Iain Morley and Takeh Sendze.  Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  For the Defence of Karemera, Édouard, Dior Diagne-Mbaye from the bar of Dakar.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, everyone.  Chantal Hounkpatin for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, with Anta Guissé as my assistant.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, Your Honours, good morning.  For the second time it's my honour to present with my learned friend Peter Robinson, lead counsel for Mr. Nzirorera.  I am Joseph Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi, lawyer and co-counsel.  Mr. President, I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Miss Diagne, we note that Mr. Karemera is not here this morning.  We have taken the precaution to ask the doctor to come and indicate what he has to report on the matter.  

Doctor, would you be kind enough to report on what transpired yesterday afternoon?  We understood that you had an appointment to meet Mr. Karemera at 3 o'clock, to re-evaluate his position.  
MR. MHANDO:
Thank you, My Lord.  After leaving the court yesterday I went to the UNDF and requested the patient to appear for an examination.  He came to the examination room, but he refused to be examined by me and he requested for some of the medication he wanted to be given for his other conditions, which he got.  And I informed him that the specialist who is to see him would be coming today, after noon.  After that, he left the consulting room and went back to his cell.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Doctor, you used the verb "refused" to be examined.  Could you explain what transpired, please?  
MR. MHANDO:
My Lord, thank you.  When a patient comes, normally, you ask him if -- I asked him if I could make another examination, and he said, "For what?"  I said, "For the same condition.  I just want to evaluate you on your progress."  And he said there was no need and, "I don't like to be examined today."  So he -- he was not ready to be examined.  He refused.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It had been reported to us yesterday that he had been suffering from pain.  Did you address that issue at all?  
MR. MHANDO:
Yes, My Lord.  He still insisted that he had pain and he wanted his tablets, but he walked on his own from his own room to the examination place, and he sat in the chair.  Well, as a doctor observing a patient at that material time, I would say that he didn't exhibit features of having serious pain at the time I was with him.  But as I didn't examine to elicit if there was any change in objective findings from what I found the other day, the previous day, I could not measure the seriousness of his pain.  But he walked around, and we talked when he was seated in his own chair.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You used the expression that he wanted his tablets and he got them.  What tablets are you referring to in this context?  
MR. MHANDO:
He is getting tablets for his abdominal pain and he also is on a cream which he applies at the knee and at the site where he gets the pain.  Others are the ones which he uses at night, suppositories, and these were to be given later by the nurse yesterday.  And he was informed of that because that particular drug was not available at that material time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Ms. Diagne, are there any issues which you would request I put to the doctor to complete his report on this matter?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Actually, I have no questions.  However, I should like to make a few remarks.  We have all been ill and we all may fall ill at any time.  After what the doctor has said, I can just observe that Édouard Karemera needs medicine, that he's currently taking medication, and that this is clear proof that he's suffering from something.  I do not know what it is.  I can only base my conclusions on what he tells me.  He has abdominal pain and he has -- he has also acute pain in one of his nerves, the sciatic nerve.  

When I spoke to him on the telephone from the registry, he told me that the physiotherapist who had been recommended to him and whom he was seeing -- he was seeing a physiotherapist, but he did not have a problem with his muscles.  His problem was with his nerves.  

Regarding Dr. Mhando, he said that this doctor was a cardiologist and was therefore unable to treat or find out if there was a problem with his nerves and treat him.  He had accepted to see him the day before to show that he was of good faith, and most of all, since this is a UNDF doctor, he felt that this doctor could connect him to the specialist that he needed to see and that he still needs to see.  I am repeating what I said since yesterday.  Since Friday, if Édouard Karemera had seen those specialists, we would not be in the situation where we are today.  I observe that the Trial Chamber has taken all necessary measures to ensure that he will see the doctor today.  I think that tomorrow all of this will be behind us.  This is what I wanted to say, and I thank you for allowing me to address the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Does anybody else have any representations to make?  
MR. MORLEY:
It may help Your Honour to know that, unhappily, I am ill today, and although I am in a position to deal with the legal arguments which shall follow shortly, insofar as Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues are considering whether to go ahead with the Witness UB in the absence of Mr. Karemera, if that is what is in the Court's mind, may I put the Court on notice that I really don't feel up to dealing with a witness today.  I apologise for that.  I've got one of those bugs which I'm sure is known to everybody here, and I'm sure I'll be fine tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I can assure you we have not reached the stage yet as to the issue as to what's going to happen with UB's testimony, as we intended to hear arguments on those matters in a few minutes.  

What is of interest to us is that -- we've been looking at the provisions of Rule 82, and we feel that all reasonable provisions should be made to ensure that the Accused gets the medical attention that he needs.  We also expect that the Accused will respond in a reasonable manner, and we will have to decide at some stage whether or not his conduct amounts to a refusal.  We don't have to make that decision now, and we are not doing that.  What we would like to do is to move forward towards hearing the legal arguments.  And when we have ruled on those matters, then we will have to decide on how to proceed with our trial.  
I must indicate that we cannot avoid the observation of how long the accused persons have been in detention, and we think that one of our primary objectives is to ensure that they're tried without delay.  So we are going to try to get the trial moving as best we can, without prejudicing the interests of fairness to any of the Accused persons.  

Just before closing this matter, Dr. Mhando, we thank you for what you've done up to now.  This is a matter where the accused person is in the process of a trial before our Court.  We have an interest in his standard of health, and we expect that you would also follow up the situation.  As far as I understand the principles by which we will govern ourselves, he is entitled to have adequate medical care.  We have to recognise his condition, and we are not likely to move to a different level of adjudication until it is apparent that there's a refusal on his part to do what is reasonable.  
MR. MHANDO:
Thank you, My Lord.  I'll follow that up closely.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Doctor, you are excused.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Madam Diagne, yesterday, when you spoke to Mr. Karemera, did you tell him that the Chamber had taken steps to ensure that he would see the specialist and that we were expecting him to be present today, pending implementation of the arrangements which the Chamber was making for him to see the specialist?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, I did state that clearly to him.  Unfortunately, he told me that he couldn't sit here for more than two or three hours and that he would have difficulty.  Perhaps you may not have noticed, but on the last day between two or -- last week, he had to get up to go and move about a bit in the room next door.  So I forgot to mention that to you, but the Accused was forced to get up and walk about a little in the room next door because he did not have the necessary painkillers to be able to bear sitting down for long periods.  So he asked me to inform you that this is something he was unable to do, but that he was sure that it would be able to be sorted out today, because if he saw the specialist today, the specialist would provide the solution to his problem.  That is what he responded.  That is what he said yesterday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in relation to the motions that we have before us, we have had written motions by counsel for Nzirorera.  Now, Mr. Robinson, I do not know if you wish to do them all together or seriatim.  I don't know if it's necessary for you to say anything further, but -- so the first question is procedure.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm satisfied to rest on my written motions, and I'd like the opportunity to reply to any submissions made by the Prosecutor orally.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you intend to reply seriatim or you are going to deal with all the matters together?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, what we had planned to do was respond orally to five of the motions and respond in writing to three of them.  The three that we would submit written responses for are the three motions to certify an issue for interlocutory appeal.  So they're not issues that should interrupt going forward with the trial or the testimony from UB.  

With respect to the remaining five motions, I will deal with two of them together, and those are the motions to exclude testimony from UB and the motion to postpone his cross-examination, which we see really as one motion.  It has to do with the remedy that the Accused seeks for violations of Rule 68.  So it's really one motion; it's about the remedy that the Court should provide.  

And the other three motions will be dealt with by Mr. Morley, and those are the motion to inspect non-Rule 68 material, the motion to require certification from the Prosecution that Rule 68 searches have been conducted and the motion for a stay of proceedings until the appeals are resolved.  So I'll deal with the first two set which deal -- which concern the remedies and Mr. Morley will deal with the remaining three, and the certifications to appeal will be dealt with in writing during the course of this week.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can proceed on that basis.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Thank you, Your Honour.  

I'm not going to take too much of the Court's time in going over arguments that have already been made when we argued some of these issues last week with a motion to stay.  This Trial Chamber has already determined that there were certain violations of Rule 68 with respect to Witness UB, made an order that certain statements be disclosed.  The order with respect to those statements -- I believe there were three of them -- simply confirmed what was already in place, because the Prosecution had agreed that those three statements should be disclosed, and we disclosed them.  So the order confirmed what we had undertaken to do as a preliminary matter.  

What concerns us now is how do we move forward.  Mr. Robinson, on behalf of his client, wishes the testimony of UB to be excluded.  We submit that that is an extreme remedy and it is not required under the circumstances, and it would not be in the interest of justice for this Trial Chamber to be deprived of important evidence.  If we look at the Rule 68 issue -- and I realise that, between Mr. Robinson and myself, we have differing conceptions of how broad Rule 68 is, and even with respect to the Trial Chamber's decision last week, I'm a bit concerned about the way in which the Trial Chamber views our obligations, given the existence of the EDS, and on that point, what I would simply like to ask the Trial Chamber to consider is the reasonableness question in relation to Rule 68.  

Now, clearly, a statement like the one from the Catholic priest is a Rule 68 statement.  There's no -- there's no equivocation on that point.  But when we look at what the Defence is looking for, there are three branches to the Rule 68 provision:  evidence that mitigates the guilt of the Accused, evidence that -- excuse me, evidence that mitigates the guilt, evidence that would go to proving his innocence, and evidence that calls into question the credibility of Prosecution evidence.  Everything that Mr. Robinson has raised has to deal with that last branch, or, that last phrasing, in the Rule 68 provision, and there's a wide berth of interpretation for what affects the credibility of Prosecution evidence.  

Now, given the huge volume of materials that we go out and collect, it's simply unreasonable to expect the Prosecutor to find every last witness statements that mentions the name of the witness.  It's simply an unreasonable burden in context.  If we restrict ourselves to the Rwandan information alone, the Rwandan judicial records -- clearly, the Chamber has already stated that the Prosecution is responsible for making the searches.  But if we do a search with the name of this witness, simply restricted to that file of Rwandan judicial records, we come up with 571 hits for UB alone, and all of this material is in Kinyarwanda.  Now, it's our obligation to look to through the material, but it's an unreasonable obligation in this context.  This witness is implicated in criminal events -- in the events of 1994, there's no disputing that.  The witness himself will acknowledge that.  The witness has been convicted of genocide in Rwanda.  

How important is every last Rwandan judicial record that mentions the name of the Accused in relation to criminal activity for this Court to make an assessment of the witness's credibility?  I'm not suggesting that some of these statements may not fall formally within the confines of Rule 68, but what is Rule 68 supposed to accomplish for this trial?  Much of this material is covered in statements or in information that is already at the disposal of the Defence.  Assuming that there are details in these Rwandan PVs about the specific activities of this witness in relation to criminal events or the events of the genocide in Rwanda, how useful would it be for this Trial Chamber to hear question after question after question over issues that the witness acknowledges and that the Prosecution acknowledges, which is that the witness was implicated in the events of 1994?  

Mr. Robinson claims that he needs time to investigate further these allegations.  Our submission is that there's no need for further investigation.  We're not saying that the Court should prevent Mr. Robinson from investigating the allegations, but what would be achieved?  All of those issues are collateral to the issue before this Trial Chamber.  General principles of law put forth the proposition that cross-examination -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just before you go on to the legal issues, I thought that that last submission was a bit difficult.  You are saying that there was no need for further investigation, but you are not saying the Court should prevent Mr. Robinson from investigating the allegations.  Now, that's exactly what we have to consider, I think, or the extent to which investigation should be permitted, because he's asking for the cross-examination to be postponed to the next trial session.  How do I understand what your submission is with regard to that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
My submission is that that would be an extreme measure; it's not required under the circumstances, that the judgement against the -- against the witness, which we all now have in translation, is sufficient to provide a broad basis for cross-examination -- for effective cross-examination.  There's a volume of material that is already in the hands of the Defence in order to conduct its cross-examination.  We had requested Rwandan judicial records for this witness, and we received them from the Rwandan ministry of justice, and all of that material was served on the Defence.  So, independent of the judgement that was served last week, there are other Rwandan PVs that we sought and we served on the Defence.  There is a volume of material that can be used for cross-examination.  What would be achieved by further investigation?  

I'm not suggesting that this Court should prevent the Defence from investigating further, but assuming there was further investigation, the Defence is not in a position to call witnesses to rebut the testimony of this Witness UB on a collateral matter, and if there are contradictions between his accounts of his own behaviour in Rwanda and the accounts of witnesses that Mr. Robinson is able to dig up, those matters, those issues, would be collateral unless it goes to a specific factual issue that is an issue in this case, in the case against Nzirorera, Karemera, and Ngirumpatse.  

So what I'm asking the Court to do is to factor in the issue that matters that are collateral to the trial should not be a ground for rebuttal evidence or for excessive cross-examination, and bearing that in mind, there's no point in delaying cross-examination for the results of an investigation that can't go very far within the context of this trial because questions that deal exclusively with credibility and do not address the material issues in dispute are collateral.  

If we look at then -- here, I'm only addressing myself -- I don't have a decision from one of the two ad hoc tribunals.  I'm referring just to legal texts that we can find in the library here where there's some discussion of the issue of cross-examination on underlying -- well, on two issues, actually.  Cross-examination on underlying facts of a previous conviction, and here I'm going to read a short passage from Ewaschuk on criminal proceedings -- Criminal Pleadings and Practice in Canada.  The last name is E-W-A-S-C-H-U-C-K.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll spell again.  The author's name is E-W-A-S-C-H-U-C-K.  And, granted, this is coming from the -- from a national jurisdiction, from Canada, but I would ask the Court to take notes for its persuasive value.  The author says, "It seems that non-accused witnesses may be cross-examined as to the particulars of dates, places, and offences of which he has been convicted, but not on the details of the offences, unless the cross-examiner establishes that the details of the offence ..."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
"... have a particular relevance to the charge before the Court."  

Now, this simply encapsulates what I was trying to suggest earlier to the Court, which is that in terms of the scope of cross-examination of a Prosecution witness who himself has been convicted of a crime, that witness should be cross-examined as to the conviction itself but not the underlying facts, unless those underlying facts are also a material issue in the matter that the Chamber is trying to address in this case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you still have to assist us on that issue because you noted that Mr. Robinson, in his argument, suggested that there were issues as to the whereabouts of the witness at times that were material to the testimony he is going to be giving. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think, if I'm not mistaken, that was in relation to ALG, not to UB.  But even in that instance, Your Honour, the argument is the same.  The argument is not weakened by the Court's question.  

If we look at an example -- and this is just for purposes of illustration with respect to UB -- one of the statements that Mr. Robinson alleges, and we concede is a Rule 68 statement, is where a witness alleges that UB himself was involved in the distribution of firearms in front of the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 10th of April.  Mr. Robinson will correct me if I'm wrong, but that's my recollection of one of the statements that we were ordered to disclose.  That is not something that UB himself acknowledges, not in his written statements, in any case.  

In terms of what we have documented, he describes the distribution of firearms in front of the Hôtel des Diplomates, but he does not in that statement say, "I participated in the distribution of firearms."  Mr. Robinson claims that that's a Rule 68 statement because UB has not acknowledged that criminal activity, and that criminal activity in and of itself would put Prosecution evidence in -- would impair the credibility of Prosecution evidence.  But let's look at that issue.  

What evidence in rebuttal -- would it be appropriate and is it logical that Mr. Robinson would call rebuttal evidence to show that UB himself was involved in the distribution of firearms on the 10th of April in front of the Hôtel des Diplomates?  That's exactly what we're trying to charge his client with.  It stands to reason that he would be more credible as a Prosecution witness if Mr. Robinson was able to demonstrate that he himself was involved in the distribution of firearms.  Why should an issue like that hold up the cross-examination of our Witness UB?  

With that example, it is an issue that is central to the Prosecution case.  But is it reasonable to assume that further investigation to establish that UB himself was involved in the distribution of firearms would make his evidence less credible to this Trial Chamber?  

Let's take the example, just for purposes of illustration, that the Court was alluding to earlier with Witness ALG who, in his written statement, claims not to have left his house before the 12th of April.  One of the statements that is characterised as Rule 68 places ALG at a meeting at the Kigali préfectural office on the 10th of April.  So, yes, there's a contradiction.  But would it be appropriate and is it logical and reasonable to expect that Defence investigation is now going to turn up evidence to prove that ALG was, in fact, at one of the meetings that we allege was used to organise the distribution of firearms and the killings that ensued in April of 1994?  So, yes, there's a contradiction.  Yes, technically and formally, it's a Rule 68 statement.  But is further investigation going to assist on that specific issue, going to assist this Trial Chamber in assessing that witness's -- Witness UB or Witness ALG's credibility?  And I suggest that, reasonably, it's not.  So even though Mr. Robinson is entitled to conduct his investigations it's not going to lead us anywhere.  It's not logical.  And I'm asking this Court to exercise its good judgement in making its determinations of what remedy is appropriate in this circumstance.  

So I'm appealing to the Court's sense of reason.  I'm not trying to dispute the statutory interpretation of Rule 68 or to dispute that this is indeed -- that it may fall within the ambit of Rule 68, but let's be reasonable about this.  And then when we look to the issue of Rwandan judicial records, Mr. Robinson has listed nine statements which he qualifies as Rule 68, which demonstrates the Prosecutor's violation of Rule 68.  Well, I'm still at a disadvantage because when I looked for those nine statements, four of them, although they bear a K-number, so they clearly are in our database, are in Kinyarwanda.  And I can't understand them without the assistance of an interpreter that was not available yesterday.  But even with respect to those Rwandan PVs, Rwandan judicial records, they come out of a database where there are 571 hits for UB alone.  

How useful is it, really, and how reasonable is it to expect that all of this material is going to assist this Trial Chamber in assessing the witness's credibility?  So I'm suggesting that we should not fetishise Rule 68.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, which database did you find those hits on?  
MR. WEBSTER:
They were not in the EDS database.  This is a database that was not accessible to the Defence, so, clearly, Mr. Robinson is getting these statements from other Defence teams.  And what I would suspect, based on my knowledge of how the system operates, is that these were included in a number of statements that were disclosed in the case against Tharcisse Renzaho, because all of these statements tend to deal with administrators in Kigali.  

But of the nine statements that were listed as Rule 68 violations, four of them were in the EDS database, and I would suspect that several of those were available to Mr. Robinson in the EDS.  When I look at the copies of the statements that he provided to the Court and to the Prosecutor, those -- that has the look of a statement in the EDS, the type, the way that the redactions were done.  So, clearly, to my mind, they're coming out of the EDS.  Both statements as he's enumerated them, numbers five to nine, which are all the Rwandan judicial records.  They're not in the EDS, so they're coming from one of the other Defence teams.  And although, technically, the Prosecutor can be held responsible for everything in our database, our database contains thousands and thousands and thousands of documents.  And if you could -- the name of our witness is a common name in Rwanda, and it would require us to search through every one of those statements to find material that is not going to lead us anywhere in this trial.  

There's no disputing that UB was involved in criminal activity; he's been convicted already.  And what Mr. Robinson is suggesting to the Court is that he's going to do a better job of prosecuting UB than the Rwandan ministry of justice.  

If we look at the issue of remedy my suggestion -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Webster.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Why is your EDS system designed in such a way that information about Prosecution witnesses -- that some information about Prosecution witnesses does not appear on the EDS?  Why is it not possible for every information relating to Prosecution witnesses to be on the EDS?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It is possible, Your Honour, and that is the objective.  The objective is to put all of the OTP witness statements into the EDS, but it's a continuing process; it's not something that can be done in one fell swoop.  So as we move forward in time, more and more information is being placed in the EDS.  

In spite of that, however, and as a practical matter, how is that assisting the process, given the slough of motions that we've had to deal with over the past two weeks?  Because what Mr. Robinson is alleging is that simply putting something in the EDS is not disclosing it to him for Rule 68 purposes.  His application -- even the application that I'm dealing with today, is citing violations of Rule 68 because of information that he found in the EDS in the first place.  So, rather than using the EDS to prepare his Defence substantively, he's using the EDS to launch Rule 68 violations against the Office of the Prosecutor, and I don't think that that's why the EDS was established.  

It was established to make the process fair and to give the Defence access to the widest possible volume of material that we've been able to amass.  But it's not assisting us if, by making this information available to the Defence, it simply assists Mr. Robinson in filing more motions to allege violations of disclosure.  We are making disclosure through the EDS to the best of our ability.  It shouldn't be a vehicle to slow down the trial.  It should be helping us to move forward and, apparently, it's not doing that.  
JUDGE SHORT:
In respect of the material which the Court ordered you to disclose -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
-- how much of that was already in the EDS?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me go item by item, just to be clear.  If we focus our attention on the nine statements in Mr. Robinson's most recent motion, the first statement, described as a statement from a Catholic priest, that was in the EDS.  

The second statement, which is described as an  OTP statement from a survivor at St. André, that also was in the EDS.  

The third statement, a statement described as one concerning the redistribution of arms, that also was in the EDS.  

The fourth statement, which was previously disclosed -- it's on Mr. Robinson's list, but we had actually disclosed that statement on the 14th of June 2004, and that also is in the EDS.  

The only statements on that listing of nine that were not in the EDS were Rwandan judicial records coming from the file against Tharcisse Renzaho.  

Now, in that large file, the five statements that Mr. Robinson was able to obtain by other means contain a word which is one of the names of our Witness UB, and on that basis, it generates a hit.  And Mr. Robinson was able -- I am assuming that he's isolating statements that do indeed concern UB, but he's found five out of 571.  Now, I'm not suggesting that he's not entitled to the information.  We're not trying to deprive him of the information.  All I'm suggesting to the Court is that we need -- all of us, including the Defence, need to be reasonable about how we move forward in this case.  

The Prosecution has no intention of withholding information that goes directly to the credibility of a witness or to mitigating the guilt of the accused or proving his innocence.  We take our Rule 68 obligations quite seriously, but given the volume of materials that we have, it's simply impossible to find every last statement.  And the database has grown exponentially, basically in response to Defence requests, because the Defence has asked for these Rwandan judicial records, we've gotten them en masse, and it's impossible to go through them.  They're all in Kinyarwanda.  

All we can do is use the computer software to search through it as best we can, and that's the same software that we put at the disposal of the Defence.  And any witness statement that we have that is not in the EDS, it's not because we're making a decision not to put it in the EDS, it's because we have not been able to redact it yet.  And what needs to be redacted is the name of the declarant and any information that would disclose the identity of the declarant.  

So if we take one of the five statements that Mr. Robinson has listed that come from the file or the database of Rwandan judicial records, those statements may contain the name of our witness, but they're not being made by the witness.  Someone else is making those statements.  And in order to respect confidentiality of the information of declarants of these statements, that information has to be redacted, and it's an ongoing process.  But the objective is to put all of the information that is not protected under Rule 70 in the EDS to facilitate matters for the Defence.  But in facilitating matters for the Defence, we're not substantively advancing the trial, we're giving them weapons to tie us up procedurally, and that's not what Rule 68 was designed to achieve and that's not what of the EDS was designed to achieve.  

The trial is not a game, it's not a fight of gladiators in an arena.  We are trying to resolve substantial issues of justice, and that is what we try to do diligently on the Prosecution side.  

So, returning to the issue of the appropriate remedy, my suggestion to the Court is that we go forward with the evidence from UB, that Mr. Robinson conduct his cross-examination on the basis of all the information that he has already, and that if subsequent investigation generates information that would be appropriate to explore in cross-examination, then the witness can be recalled.  

This Trial Chamber should not be deprived of UB's evidence.  We've done everything reasonable within the context to find all of UB's statements, to disclose anything that would be -- would mitigate the value of -- excuse me, mitigate the guilt of the Accused, prove his innocence or cast a doubt on the credibility of Prosecution evidence, but it's an imperfect system and we do the best we can with it.  

The only thing I really wanted to reinforce before the Court was this notion of placing limitations on cross-examination and on rebuttal evidence, because issues that are collateral to the trial should not slow the trial down.  And if we're looking simply at the issue of credibility, credibility is a collateral issue, as it's understood in the legal text that I've consulted.  If we're dealing with an issue that is material to the accusation against the Accused in this case, then that's another matter, but this Trial Chamber should not be distracted by collateral issues in deciding whether we should move forward with the testimony of UB.  

So, I'm suggesting that Mr. Robinson's proposal of a remedy is unreasonable, that this Trial Chamber should move this case forward, and that we should hear UB's testimony.  And once we've heard his testimony, the Court can decide whether the cross-examination needs to be postponed or whether the witness should be recalled.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Should I hear Mr. Morley and then hear Mr. Robinson on all five, or do you wish to respond separately at this stage?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I would like to respond on these two, if you don't mind.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think that I find Mr. Webster's comments about Rule 68 very disturbing, and I don't think he gets his obligations under Rule 68, even after your ruling of the 16th of February.  

The Appeals Chamber says that the obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence is as important as the obligation to prosecute, but Mr. Webster is of the opinion that he doesn't have to comply with Rule 68 if it's too burdensome, and so he wants you to excuse that non-compliance and find harmless error in materials that will never see the light of day, unless we happen to stumble upon them in our own investigation.  That's completely violating Rule 68 and asking you, in advance, to condone those violations, to give your blessings to a violation of Rule 68.  And I don't see how you can do that.  

Rule 68 requires the Prosecution to provide all information, as soon as practicable, that affects the credibility of its witnesses.  If it takes going through 571 hits to see if any of that information about that witness affects his credibility, they have to do it.  It's as simple as that.  And they have the resources and the team to do that. 

It's not for me to do that, even if I -- and I don't have access to those databases in which I can do it.  But it's not for me to go through the EDS and keep coming up with records that they should have found in the very same way that I found it, by typing in the witness's name.  We are showing violations of Rule 68 with every witness, and Mr. Webster wants you to say that that's okay, let us continue that way.  And we absolutely can't accept that.  And this trial will grind to a halt every single day until we -- if that's what you expect that the Prosecution's remedy is going to be, because we'll show you every day, before a witness comes in and testifies, Rule 68 material that hasn't been disclosed to us.  We'll ask the proceedings be stayed; we'll ask the testimony be excluded; we'll ask the testimony be postponed because we'll have fresh violations of Rule 68 throughout this trial, unless you take the position now and give us a remedy.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, are you being deliberately confrontational with those threats?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President, I'm not making threats.  I'm simply telling you that unless you give the remedy -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you don't have to be so confrontational.  We understand language without you having to make threats of that nature which you know are confrontational.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President.  Really, I'm not making them as threats.  I'm simply trying to emphasise to the Trial Chamber that unless we have a remedy to Prosecution's Rule 68 practices, we're not going to have a smooth-functioning trial, and I think you understand my point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand your point without the need for extravagance of language.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand.  

Now, with respect to the testimony of Witness UB, you have found that the Prosecution violated Rule 68, and the question is now one of remedy.  It's our position that the remedy should be exclusion of the testimony of Witness UB because the violations of Rule 68 have been systemic, they've been repeated, and they will continue unless the Trial Chamber takes a step to make a remedy that actually affects the Prosecution and its presentation of its case.  And I would suggest to you that if you exclude the testimony of Witness UB, we will have much greater compliance in the future with Rule 68.  And if you don't, you are giving the Prosecution no incentive whatsoever to comply with the rule.  And when you hear the attitude of Mr. Webster here today, I think it should reinforce the need for a remedy.  

The logic of the Trial Chamber in its ruling denying our motion to stay the proceedings is completely circular.  To show a violation of Rule 68, the Defence has to point specifically to a document which it can prove is in possession of the Prosecution and can prove is exculpatory and has not been disclosed.  But once we have reached this level of proof, there's no remedy for the Rule 68 violation because you think that we already have enough information.  So, under your standard, there's no possible way to give us a remedy because you won't even acknowledge that there's been a violation of Rule 68, unless we have the material in our hand to show you that this is something that the Prosecution hasn't disclosed.  

When we tried to show inferentially that the Prosecution has interviewed witnesses on the very same topic of the testimony of the witness, you don't find that that's sufficient for us to have proven as a Rule 68 violation.  So, in a sense, you simply are only willing to recognise Rule 68 violations for material that we already have, and therefore offer us no remedy for the violations of Rule 68 which have been well documented.  

And what you're doing is rewarding the perpetrator and punishing the victim.  You are requiring us, who have been the victims of violations of Rule 68 to go forward as best we can, despite the late disclosure, and you're rewarding the Prosecutor with a tactical advantage of forcing the Defence to cross-examine in conditions in which we haven't had an adequate opportunity to do that.  So the remedy that so far has been offered by your decision on the motion to stay the proceedings is completely inadequate to limit prejudice to the Accused and to encourage compliance with Rule 68, and that's the reason why you have this series of motions before you.  

And it's our suggestion that you exclude the testimony of Witness UB for violations of Rule 68 and that is the best way of going forward with the trial and with assuring that this rule is being complied with, not as a fetish, but as a requirement as important as the obligation to prosecute.  

Now, Mr. Webster, with respect to our cross-examination of Witness UB, says that these matters are collateral matters.  What that means is that if we don't confront Witness UB with these matters at the time he's here testifying, we can't offer extrinsic evidence of those matters when it comes our turn to put on the Defence case.  That means that all of the investigation, all of the information, has to be at our disposal now when we confront Witness UB, because if we don't have that information, if we don't confront him with these materials, we are precluded from using it in the future; all the more reason why the testimony of Witness UB, if not excluded, should be postponed, because it's now or never with this information that relates to the witness's credibility.  

And if we haven't had the adequate opportunity to develop that information, then we lose the opportunity to confront the witness with it and we're forever prohibited from using that information, either through our own witnesses or through cross-examination of other Prosecution witnesses who relate to the same incidents.  The distribution of firearms, that is a perfect example.  If we can't ask UB about the distribution of firearms and if we haven't interviewed the witness who gives us the information about the distribution of firearms on the 10th of April so that we have a good basis to know exactly how that witness knew that, what were the circumstances, who else was there, then we don't have an adequate opportunity to confront Witness UB.  And that's the situation that we're in.  We received this information last Wednesday, so we're not in a position to do an adequate investigation to confront this witness on what Mr. Webster says is collateral matters.  

With respect to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, on that issue, one of the things that has bothered me about your position in this matter is that you have been in this case now for a long time, and I have seen the -- at least some of the disclosures that have been made generally.  I don't understand your complaint about not having enough information to cross-examine.  I'm not being facetious.  I genuinely don't understand why you complain that you are not in a position to cross-examine.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Your Honour, I think that's a very good question, and we have a lot of information about Witness UB's applications against Mr. Nzirorera and against the Accused, and we've investigated those and we've had the opportunity to investigate those thoroughly, and we've done that.  So we're prepared on that part of it.  

But, as to Witness UB's own activities, we don't have the -- until last Wednesday, for example, we didn't have any idea that a communal policeman who was assigned to be with him on a permanent basis after the 6th of April had given evidence in his trial and had talked about his whereabouts and his activities.  We didn't know of the existence of that person.  We couldn't interview them; had no idea.  It never came up in any of the witness's previous statements, that -- any of the information that we had.  

Now, that's a critical witness for us to talk to before we cross-examine Witness UB.  He could have a wealth of information as to whether UB was attending a meeting in which he claims Mr. Nzirorera spoke to the people at the préfecture, or whether he was doing other things at that time.  And that's just on the substantive aspect of Witness UB's testimony.  It doesn't even touch of the credibility of Witness UB, who completely denies any guilt for any criminal activity.  

And now we have witness -- we have 14 witnesses in that judgement alone who are providing various evidence of the criminal activity of Witness UB, that shows that he's being untruthful.  So, yes, we've done investigation but we -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's look at that.  The issue of his criminal activity, to me, is addressed.  First, we have the in-court statement of the Prosecutor.  Then you have the decision recording his convictions, so that fact is available for cross-examination at this stage.  You have the information which permits cross-examination at this stage.  

With regard to the witness who you say you need to examine, why is it necessary for you to conduct investigations with that person in order to empower your cross-examination of this witness?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Because that witness has a wealth of information that I don't have, a wealth of details that I don't have concerning this witness's activities during the very time in which he's testifying about.  For example, this witness talks about attending security council meetings on the 10th of April, 14th of April -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Security council?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, security council of the préfecture, on 10th, 14th, 16th, 30th of April.  He talks about going to the ministry of defence and receiving weapons, I believe on the 16th of April, which I don't believe is correct, but in any event there's a wealth of activities that will be the subject of his testimony during this time.  

Now, if we look at the judgement itself that we just received, the testimony of that communal policeman is maybe two paragraphs.  It's just a summary of what he said, so that is not adequate for us to take that information and simply ask the witness, "Well, the communal policeman says that you were present at places where people were killed or that you were distributing arms."  That isn't sufficient for our purposes for cross-examination, because this is a witness who has information about all of these events that are the subject of the witness's testimony.  So that's a concrete reason why we need to conduct further investigation.  

And there are other witnesses also that are revealed in this judgement for the first time that we would need to talk to, to determine, in fact, what are the facts concerning this witness's behaviour and activities at the relevant time so we can have all the material necessary for cross-examination.  And that's the kind of thing we've been doing with the information that we already have.  

When we receive witness statements from the Prosecution, if other people are mentioned as having been present at meetings, we go and try to find those people.  We talk to them, what happened, what's -- we find out whether there's information that either confirms or contradicts what the witness has said.  And now we are presented with 14 new witnesses, including significant people who have access to information.  Now we need to do that job.  That's the steps that are taken before cross-examination occurs in this court, and that's why we're asking that the testimony be postponed so that we can adequately cross-examine this witness.  

The question about the judgement of UB, the Rwandan judgement, the Prosecution was simply not diligent in disclosing this judgement, and now you're expecting us to cross-examine on the fly, simply taking the judgement and asking the witness about it.  That's not adequate cross-examination.  I think -- I have to tell you that for Witness Mbonyunkiza, my cross-examination of him, based on the judgement that was just disclosed to us at the last minute in his case, was terrible.  All I could do was ask him, "Well, okay, this witness says that you did this.  Is that correct?"  He said, "No, that witness wasn't telling the truth."  I had no facts.  I had no investigation, no ammunition, in which to do an adequate cross-examination on that kind of topic, and the same is going to be the case for UB.  I don't have any -- sufficient information to truly test his veracity until I've conducted an investigation.  And if I had this information in time, I would have already done that.  We wouldn't have this problem.  

The Prosecution has known since 1997, when they first interviewed this witness, that he'd had a trial in Rwanda and that he'd had a judgment in which he was convicted, contrary to his protestations of innocence.  They met the witness ten times, and they could have obtained this judgement from him at any of those ten times.  He's had it in his possession.  They still haven't obtained the appeals judgement, which he also says he has in his possession.  

So, the question is, given these facts, given this situation, what is the remedy?  And as of right now, you're rewarding the Prosecutor, you're giving them all the benefit of their lack of disclosure, and you're giving us zero.  You are just telling us, "Do the best you can."  And that's not fair because it's not our violation of Rule 68, it's the Prosecutor's breach, and you're rewarding the perpetrator of the violation and penalising the victim.  

So, we're asking you to give us this remedy, and the remedy is also one that if you postpone the testimony of this witness, just like Judge Møse did in Karera, there'll be a salutory effect in the future.  They will get these materials in the future because they know there's some consequence to it.  As of right now, if we do nothing, we're going to have the same situation in the next session, and I don't think anybody wants that.  

Finally, I want to emphasise -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Webster -- Mr. Robinson, granted that you will be unable to do some of your cross-examination effectively if you don't conduct an interview, you do agree that the substantial part of your cross-examination can be done at this stage, having regard to whatever disclosures have been made by the Prosecution and the information you have at your disposal?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I don't agree in this particular case.  I think, in some cases, that may be true, but in this particular case, it's not because this is a witness, as I've indicated in my motion, that we don't really know yet where he stands.  We don't know whether he's somebody who participated in these events and is now lying about it and covering up his own involvement, or whether, in fact, he was an authority who did not participate in these events but for whom people are falsely accusing.  That's the kind of investigation we need to do, based on his judgement, before we can put even to the witness or have our own theory of cross-examination.  

So, in this particular case, because the events for which he's been convicted are the very same events which are the subject of his testimony, we're not in a position to prepare our cross-examination because we need to have a global idea of where we're going before we begin the cross-examination.  So I think, in many cases, it can be said that, yes, we can do part of the cross-examination, but not the whole, but this is one in which, in order to construct the cross-examination, we feel that we need to have an idea of what this witness's actual culpability and situation was so that we can decide how to put our case to him and how to proceed with his -- with attacking his credibility, or, in some cases, supporting it.  

Mr. President, I also just want to finish by saying that the Appeals Chamber has said that if a witness is lying about his own involvement, that's highly relevant as to whether or not he is being truthful as to the testimony he's giving against the accused.  And this is a witness who has completely denied all of the allegations against him for which he's been convicted.  

Mr. Webster wants to pass over that, and says, "Well, the witness has been convicted and so therefore these matters don't go to his credibility."  But this is a witness who is coming to court, denying these very events.  And so it's central to his credibility for us to investigate the allegations that are contained in the judgement which was not disclosed to us.  

So, I think that's all I want to say about the remedies with respect to Witness UB.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I have a procedural question to ask you.  Why did you file two motions?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I filed two motions because I'm asking for two separate remedies.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the rule, if you have one cause, you file a motion for each remedy?  That's not a proper way to use the resources of a Court.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I don't know -- first of all, I was willing -- ready, willing and able to make these motions orally on Thursday, you may recall, so if we're speaking of efficiency -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that a retaliatory measure you're saying?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No.  I'm trying to construct these motions in a way in which I'm trying to make as clear as possible the relief that we're seeking and the grounds for that relief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But then both items for relief could have been in one motion.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That is true -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is really one complaint, with alternative remedies.  Why file two motions?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, just for my own conception of the issues; I thought that they were two separate issues. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's a level at which -- it harms our judicial process when you have a duplicity of motions of this nature. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't think you'll find anything duplicative about the text of either of those motions. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
It's one complaint, two alternative remedies.  It's not normal for that to be done.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Your Honour, it was not done intentionally to add to the number of motions.  To me, it doesn't add to your work.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It does. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Why?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  You have the same substance if it's contained in two documents as opposed to one. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Come on, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I'm presenting the same material -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are many, many domestic courts where counsel who do this would be asked to pay the fees of one motion, the costs of one motion.  That's not normal behaviour.  If you have one complaint, you don't file a separate motion or separate act for each alternate remedy.  That's not using the resource of the court properly. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I certainly will keep that in mind and do that accordingly in the future, but it was not done with the intention of making your work any greater.  To me, it was two separate issues, two separate remedies, and that's why I did it that way.  But in the future, I can combine them, that's no problem.  And I didn't duplicate any effort.  There's different texts in each motion.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Diagne.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  You are giving me the floor following my learned friend Mr. Robinson.  

Mr. President, I want to assure the Chamber that we support this motion in the defence of Mr. Édouard Karemera because in this question of legal entitlement, we all agree about the violations of Article -- Rule 68 by the Prosecutor, and we all know that Rule 68 is a basis of provision to guarantee equitable trial for the Accused.   Naturally, its violation should dictate our attention and the crux of what we are talking about today, the Gordian knot, that is, what is the Chamber going to do to punish the Prosecutor.  What is the Chamber going to say?  Because the sanctions or the punishment envisaged, or the reaction, is not satisfactory to the Defence team.  

Mr. President, any measure from this Chamber should be geared to restoring the equity of the trial.  There's no question about that.  This has been very brilliantly demonstrated by Mr. Robinson.  There have been new facts that vitiate the nature of the cross-examination as it was initially conceived by the Defence team.  

So, under these circumstances, and come what may, to continue to want UB's cross-examination would be tantamount to putting the Defence at a disadvantage, favouring the Prosecution.  I'm sure you cannot do that.  You will not do that, I know, because, if you do so, Mr. President, that will make the question of fair trial more acute.  So that I, as Mr. Robinson, believe that you should for Édouard Karemera -- to benefit from the cancellation of the cross-examination of UB.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I will not repeat, Mr. President, and if I do so, that would be inadequate, because it has been adequately said by my learned friend.  We have dwelled at each session on the question of disclosure, which is the basis of a fair trial.  Both sides, we agreed that Rule 68 has been violated, and very seriously violated.  

Now, so far as UB is concerned, my team in the Defence of Ngirumpatse doesn't have the same experience in the use of EDS and doesn't have experience concerning witnesses, but that doesn't rule out that we should drop our duties to defend, and this is what we do.  We defend.  That is why we do not understand that UB -- I'm just mentioning UB without referring to the others that must be heard in the course of this trial.  

If we are to go into cross-examination under these conditions as dictated by the latest disclosure of information, we will simply be putting ourselves in a position in which we involve ourselves in something that is not fair.  This is why this witness should not be heard.  We should be put in conditions that are comfortable for us to be able to cross-examine, just like the Prosecutor would have had the similar conditions to conduct examination-in-chief.  

I am not going into details of the arguments we've heard, but I'm not convinced that we are wasting time, as the Prosecutor has suggested, by suggesting that we work in a haphazard way in bringing us in and out at their own will, and I think the use of our time -- I don't understand what they mean by that, actually.  I don't understand that, "using our time usefully."  Working under these conditions can only harm the exigencies of a fair trial.  

Thank you, Mr. President.

     1045H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Webster, can you reply under -- in just a couple minutes?  It's just time for our mid-morning break. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  And my reply, Your Honour, I think I've made my position clear, and I get a sense from the Bench, based on the questions that it's been asking, that it's followed some of what I've been trying to -- to get at.  But just to refocus our attention a bit and just look at the absurdity of the situation, if I could call it that, let's look at UB and this allegation of his -- in his witness statement and his testimony, what we anticipate from his testimony is that he will describe the distribution of weapons in front of the Hotel des diplomates on the 10th of April.  That's affirmatively what we want to prove through his evidence.  

Mr. Robinson would have the Court believe that a witness statement in his criminal file, in UB's criminal file, that alleges that UB, himself, was distributing weapons on the 10th of April is somehow exculpatory.  All it goes to show is that UB talks about other people distributing weapons but doesn't talk about himself distributing weapons.  How does that assist the Defence?  Would it be permissible for Mr. Robinson now -- and is it logical -- that he would call this witness to prove that guns were being distributed but that UB was one of the persons that was distributing the guns?  That's exactly what we're trying to prove in our accusation against the Accused in this case.  So how logical is it to assume --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Aren't you putting that argument too strongly?  Wouldn't the Accused be entitled to ask UB whether he, himself, distributed weapons?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Of course, he could put that question to the Accused. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that is what he's saying -- that is what he's arguing about.  He's right to do that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
He does not need a witness -- or he does not need an investigation in order to lead him to the threshold of that question.  That's the only point I'm trying to make.  I'm not suggesting that the enquiry is -- is off course.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what you're saying.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah, but my understanding of Mr. Robinson's submission is that he needs to investigate in order to ask that question, and I'm suggesting that the information he already has in his possession allows him to ask that question.  

And regardless of what answer he gets from UB, how is that going to put this Chamber in a position to welcome other evidence to prove that UB distributed guns?  This is not a Prosecution of UB.  It's a prosecution of Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse, and Karemera.  And I'm asking the Court to use its good judgement in how it fashions this remedy, because it's clear to me that it's in the interest of the Defence -- they perceive their interest in grinding this trial to a halt, and it can happen because a large percentage of our witnesses were implicated in the events.  That's the only way we can prove our case against the insiders at a very high level in the hierarchy.  We have to have insider witnesses.  And if we want to face this problem with a third of the 70 or so witnesses that are going to testify, that's what the Court is about to open the door to.  And the problem gets even more complex because Mr. Robinson -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This application is nothing to do with what evidence the Defence are entitled to call.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It has everything -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It has to do with what questions can be put in cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER:
No.  Mr. Robinson is suggesting that he needs to investigate because there are witnesses out there that are going to help him make his case.  He already has the information that he needs in order to put questions to the witness.  What he is talking about -- or my understanding is, he's looking for extrinsic evidence that he may call in his rebuttal case or in his Defence case, and that is not permissible.  

And what we run dangerously close to is witnesses taking the stand in this case and insisting on being represented by counsel, and that's something that is really going to throw a wrench in our proceedings because they have -- they are at risk, judicially, in returning to Rwanda.  And Mr. Robinson starts his applications for each witness by insisting that they abandon their anonymity and then attempts to prosecute them in this case.  
All I'm asking the Trial Chamber to do is to exercise its reasonable judgement in fashioning a remedy.  I am not suggesting that the statements that Mr. Robinson has listed are not technically and formally Rule 68 statements.  What I am suggesting to the Court is that Mr. Robinson has already a volume of material that he can use to put questions to the witness, and the investigations that he's suggesting need to be made is to find extrinsic evidence that would not be appropriate in the first instance, assuming he found this extrinsic evidence.  

He does not need investigation in order to put these questions to UB.  All of that information is in his judgement or in knowledge of the judgement itself.  We don't even have to get into the facts that are explicited (sic) in the judgement.  So that's my submission.  I think if I said any more, I'd simply repeat what I've already said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take our mid-morning recess now, and then we come to you, Mr. Morley, afterwards. 
(Court recessed from 1045H to 1125H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, how long are you going to be?  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, given my condition, I hope not very long at all.  I hope that Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues have had what may be a helpful bundle and that the Bench has had an opportunity to peruse it.  I propose to take the Bench through the bundle as quickly as possible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All -- all 45 pages?  
MR. MORLEY:
But I'm quite quick. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  
MR. MORLEY:
And with Your Honours' leave, I propose to deal with all three motions at the same time.  All in, I suggest half an hour as I address the Bench.  

Your Honours will find that there is a bundle -- may I apologise for some typos which I discovered as I was going through the various skeleton arguments.  I don't understand how they arose.  One tends to only notice them after the documents are printed out.  There's also a little bit of highlighting on some of the bundle which I couldn't quite avoid on the photocopier.  I apologise for that.  I hope it doesn't distract the Court.  

The first motion to deal with -- I hope the Court is happy to deal with it in this way -- is within the bundle, the request by Mr. Robinson that certification of compliance of Rule 68 is required.  It's my respectful submission that such certification is unattractive.  Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues will have a skeleton of page 1 and page 2 of the bundle, and I invite Your Honours' attention to that.  At paragraph 1, Your Honours will see that I invite the observation that this motion is novel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I can assure you, we have read it.  So you don't have to read the whole thing.  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't propose to.  

It's novel insofar as, if we look at page 4 of the bundle, at paragraph 1, my learned friend invites penalty of perjury, which always sends a shudder down the spine of any lawyer, and at paragraph 5, Your Honours will see two lines up from the bottom that compliance should be certified under oath so that various Bar associations can be complained to.  

Now, it's my respectful submission that there has never been a motion of this nature in either the ICTR or the ICTY, and that is the starting point for Your Honours' consideration.  This is more than novel.  The vigour of it is perhaps unattractively combative, and Your Honour may recall some observations earlier today when Mr. Robinson was in full flow, as to what extent he may be unnecessarily confrontational.  The Bench is invited to consider to what extent this is an unnecessarily confrontational motion.  It certainly is a motion which proceeds on the basis that the Prosecution is acting in bad faith.  That is not a finding which has arisen as a result of the motion of the 16th of February.  And I'll invite Your Honours' attention to the judgement in a moment.  

But may I make the observation which one sees under paragraph 2, that certification during the trial process has been disapproved of in the decision of Blaskic, a decision which Your Honours will find at page 19 of the bundle.  

And may I apologise to His Honour Judge Kam that I haven't been able to produce everything in French.  

At page 19 of the bundle, Your Honours will see there a decision of the Appeals Chamber on the 26th of September 2000 at the ICTY.  Being the Appeals Chamber, the Court may feel that it's a decision which is of influence and arguably binding on the proceedings here.  

At page 20, paragraph 43, Your Honours will see the relevant section which is of interest.  Now, bear in mind this is an appeal process rather than ongoing trial process.  The distinction is of importance.

MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry for that interruption, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Of course, Your Honour.  

This decision relates to an appeals process in which there was a certification invited, and the distinction with regard to an appeals process is articulated in paragraph 3, but we'll leave that to one side for the moment.  

Your Honours will see at paragraph 43 that the judgement reads:  "The Appellant submits that the Appeals Chamber should order the Prosecution to submit a signed, sworn affidavit to certify that it is aware of its continuing obligations under Rule 66(A) and Rule 68, and has produced to the Appellant all material requested in the first and second requests," whatever they were.  

He points out that such an order has been made before in the case of the Prosecutor against Krnojelac, and he goes on to say:  "He suggests that certification is required so that the Appellant and the Appeals Chamber can be assured that the Prosecution has discharged its obligations before the appeal process may proceed."  

Now, if we turn over the page, at page 45 -- paragraph 45, page 21 of the bundle, one observes there the Appeals Chamber, with regard to the decision in Krnojelac, and the invitation to certify with a sworn affidavit, is the subject of the following remark, paragraph 45:  "This type of order is one that should only be made by a Chamber in very rare instances.  The Prosecution is expected to fulfill its duties in good faith, and this has been acknowledged in the document known as the Standards of Professional Conduct for Prosecution Counsel.  Only where the Defence can satisfy a Chamber that the Prosecution has failed to discharge its obligations should an order of the type sought be contemplated"; never mind made.  

Now, it's my respectful submission that the second starting point with regard to this application, the first being that it has never before been put in such stark and competent terms; the second being that it is an order which should only be made in very rare instances.  The question arises whether such an instance has arisen, and also what is the relevance of the invitation in to certify in the appeals process?  

Can I take Your Honours, please, to page 17 and page 18 of the bundle?  Here we have the amended Rules of Procedure in respect of appeals, dated, as you'll see on page 17 in the middle of the page, 16th of November 2005; so a very recent amendment to the Rules.  And one sees under Rule 11 at the bottom of the page, it says, "Where the prosecutor is the appellant, the prosecutor shall make a declaration" -- note it's not a certification under oath, it's a sworn affidavit -- "a declaration in the appellant's brief that disclosure has been completed."

And if one goes over the page to page 18, the second paragraph reads:  "Where the prosecutor is the respondent, the prosecutor shall make a declaration" -- again, note, not a sworn affidavit under oath -- "in the respondent's brief that disclosure has been completed."  

Now, this is very recent as a decision within the appeals rules, and, in fact, there hasn't yet been a declaration made of this nature in the appeals process at the ICTY; it's that new.  

But what's significant about this observation about declarations, as distinct from sworn affidavits, is that it relates to the appeal process at a time when the trial has come to an end; and in consequence of that, there is an element of finality being sought as a prelude to deliberating on the issues on appeal.  And, therefore, it makes sense that there should be a declaration of some description in respect of disclosure, so that that is not an issue which troubles the Tribunal any further when it considers the appeal.  

Here, Mr. Robinson's invitation is that, during the trial process, there should be a certification which causes an immediate problem, and Your Honours will see that problem in paragraph 3 of the skeleton where it says, four lines down:  "The difficulty with the present motion is that while the trial is ongoing, the Prosecution has an ongoing duty of disclosure, so that any certification can only be valid for the day on which it is signed and becomes invalid the next day, as material is constantly being loaded into the OTP database.  It is arguable that certification during a trial would be otiose."  

So there is a consideration for Your Honours in relation to the distinction between declarations at the appeals level and certification during the course of the trial process.  Ongoing duty of disclosure, in my respectful submission, renders such certification, arguably, meaningless from the day after the certification is sought.  

I turn now to paragraph 4 of the skeleton.  Mr. Robinson makes this application because, in essence, he is arguing that the Court has found that there have been serious violations in respect of disclosure, such as to undermine the confidence of the Trial Chamber in relying on the good faith of the officers of the Prosecution.  It's my respectful submission that that is not what the decision found.  

If one looks at page 10 of the bundle -- that is page 6 of the transcript of Your Honours' decision of the 16th of February -- it is observable that at line 7, Your Honours have observed:  "The Chamber considers it necessary to point out that the administration of justice depends on the integrity of the Prosecution.  To the extent that if it is subsequently established that the declarations made in the session are inaccurate, the Chamber will revisit the issue."  That sentence clearly contemplates that the integrity of the Prosecutor has not been found to be impugned.  Obviously, if something happens later, the matter will be revisited.  But the point which emerges is that, from Your Honours' decision of the 16th of February, in my respectful submission, that sentence identifies that the good faith of the Prosecutor is still on record.  

If I can take the matter one step further, at page 12 of the bundle -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, there's something I need to ask you, because, in my mind, when I read this application, to what extent is this application different to this particular part of the decision of the Chamber that you've just read?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm very sorry, Your Honour.  I don't understand the question Your Honour has asked me.  To what extent is it different?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  When I read the application, I thought it was just a rehashing of that exact point that we had made.  So I was asking you, to what extent would you say -- do you see a difference between the two?  I intend to ask Mr. Robinson the same question.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, insofar as my learned friend is inviting sworn affidavits of compliance, as distinct from being reassured by that which is said by learned leader on record, on the trial record, it's my respectful submission that there is a distinction.  One involves the swearing of oaths, whereas the other involves an understanding that the Prosecution is acting in good faith and doing its best.  And I invite the observation that the difference is, effectively, Your Honours' decision recognises that the Prosecution may have made mistakes but was acting in good faith, whereas my learned friend's application is premised on the Prosecution are acting in bad faith and should be under sanction of swearing oaths and reports to Bar councils in the event that there are any further transgressions.  

I respectfully submit that my learned friend is taking the invitation to ensure the Prosecution get it right an awful lot further than has ever been taken in any trial process at the ICTY or the ICTR before.  Does that help Your Honour?  I'm not sure if I've answered Your Honour's question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that's your answer.  
MR. MORLEY:
I was trying to draw Your Honours' attention to line 34 of page 12 of the bundle.  That's page 8 of the transcript.  Your Honours will see there that the Chamber understandably says, "The Chamber is very concerned about some of the explanations given by counsel for the Prosecution in open court, difficulties faced by the Prosecution searching the database or other deficiencies in research, are not satisfactory explanations.  The Chamber strongly recommends that the Prosecution improve its management of disclosure in its case.  Lack of diligence or other default may require the Chamber to consider whether this conduct -- this is conduct which willingly interferes with the administration of justice, obstructs the proceedings, or is otherwise contrary to the interest of justice."  

So on the face of this observation by Your Honours, again, what is not being observed by the decision is that the Prosecution has been found to be acting in bad faith.  A shot is being fired across the Prosecution's bow to make sure we get it right, but insofar as the Tribunal is proceeding on the basis we are acting in good faith, it's my respectful submission that this certification invitation is certainly premature, if not, in any event, fundamentally unattractive.  

So, in short, what I invite is attention to the last paragraph of the skeleton which observes:  "The fundamental unhappiness about this motion is, it supposes bad faith, and unless the Chamber is satisfied of such, then the standing of counsel, as officers of the court, ought not to be challenged by what might be thought to be a professionally demeaning certification process.  If on the other hand, the Chamber believes counsel are acting in bad faith, then certification may not be the answer, but instead a stay of proceedings.  As such, a finding would be tantamount to finding a wilful abuse of process."  

In short, either the Chamber finds we are behaving, or the trial stops.  Arguably, certification is irrelevant.  Those are my submissions in respect of Mr. Robinson's motion on the first matter, unless I can assist further before I proceed to the second.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You may go on. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  

Your Honour will find the second-motion skeleton at page 22 of the bundle, and this is a response to Mr. Robinson's motion to stay the proceedings, pending appeal.  Now, it's my respectful submission that the fundamental point here is that Mr. Robinson is rehashing the arguments which took place on the 13th of February.  The only difference which arises is the acquisition of the judgement in respect of UB.  Insofar as my learned friend pleads that there has to be a stay, he does not articulate in his motion any detail as to why there is -- and I'm looking at paragraph 1 of the skeleton on page 22 -- irreparable prejudice if the trial continues because there has been inadequate time to prepare the cross-examination of witnesses.  

If we look at page 24 of the bundle -- page 24 is part of the motion that Mr. Robinson has filed -- and at paragraph 3, we have the bare assertion -- and it's not articulated in any detail -- "Mr. Nzirorera contends he will suffer irreparable prejudice if the trial continues under the regime ordered by the Trial Chamber."  

Now, just pause there.  Your Honours made a decision on the 16th of February that the trial should continue.  So this particular assertion in paragraph 3, one could say, seeks to go behind the decision that Your Honours made.  It's Mr. Robinson re-arguing the point he was arguing on Monday, the 13th.  And it's my respectful submission that unless the judgement of UB changes things, the point is functus; that is to say that the decision has been made, we move on, and it's not right for Mr. Robinson to be continually trying to re-argue what's already been decided.  

Does the judgement of UB make a difference?  Well, as part of Your Honours' decision of the 16th of February, Your Honours will recall that there is explicit understanding that the judgement of UB has been obtained late, and Your Honours have made the courteous assistance of allowing, on Wednesday, the 15th, the judgement to be translated with the assistance of the court translators.  

So, in fact, again, although the judgement of UB is something which is new, it was, in fact, something which was considered as part of the decision-making process of the 16th of February.  So, in short, it's my respectful submission, Mr. Robinson is simply trying to re-argue the decision which was made on the 16th.  And I invite Your Honours to say that that is unhelpful, and the Court might even go so far as to say this is an unnecessary motion and should never have been filed.  But it's a matter for the Court, and I don't press it.  So those are my submissions in respect of the motion to stay, unless Your Honours seek any further assistance.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  You can go on.  
MR. MORLEY:
The skeleton in respect of the third and final motion is at page 26 of the bundle, and this is a response to the request by Mr. Robinson to seek inspection of OTP statements concerning seven named persons.  Well, the first thing to say is, if we look at page 29 of the bundle, we have there the seven named persons identified.  I can assist the Court by saying that, item 1, we don't have any statement.  Items 2 to 7, we do have some material, and if necessary, Your Honours are invited to review that material in camera.  

May I make it plain that the Prosecution's position with regard to this material is that it does not embarrass the Prosecution to disclose it.  There is a point of principle at stake.  The difficulty is that if this material is ordered disclosed simply because it looks like it might be interesting, then what we are worried about, at the Prosecution end, Mr. Robinson being as diligent as he always is, is, we're just going to get list after list of named parties to research, because Mr. Robinson will assert that those named parties may have produced statements which are material to the preparation of the Defence, and we will find ourselves researching on Mr. Robinson's behalf, rather than preparing on the part of the Prosecution.  It's the thin end of the wedge.  So it's a point of principle, Your Honour, which we're trying to argue.  

Now, the application in respect of this material is made under Rule 66(B).  Your Honours are reminded what that rule says -- I'm reading page 82 of the Rules of Procedure within the Tribunal, Rule 66(B)-- "At the request of the Defence, the Prosecutor shall permit the Defence to inspect any documents in its custody which are material to the preparation of the Defence."  

And one of the conundrums is, what does that mean?  Because on the one hand, it could mean everything within the OTP database is potentially material to the preparation of the Defence.  And if so, then my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, and anybody else, under Rule 66(B), should be entitled to go through what we call Zy -- that's the computer programme which has loaded into it all OTP material -- but it cannot mean that.  The reason why I submit that Rule 66(B) cannot be so wide in its meaning is because if it was, there would be no reason for Rule 68.  Rule 68 would be redundant, because everything would be disclosable as material to the preparation of the Defence, irrespective of whether it was exculpatory or not.  So Rule 68 clearly contemplates that Rule 66 is to some extent limited.  And it's my respectful invitation that the limitation is plain if one looks at Rule 66(A).  

And I'm reading now from paragraph 4 of the skeleton on page 26.  Your Honours see there that the argument put forward is disclosure because the Defence might use the material to prepare the Defence.  However, Rule 66(B) should be read in the context of 66(A) which sets the parameter; 66(A) refers to disclosure of material intended to support the indictment and of Accused's statements and to copies of statements of witnesses the Prosecution intends to call.  Now, none of the material that my learned friend has sought falls into any of those categories.  

My learned friend has drawn on a decision from 1997 to justify the application he makes, and this may be instructive to look at.  Your Honours will see the decision of 1997 at page 34 of the bundle.  Your Honours see there a decision in the Bagosora case, and the relevant and of-interest section is at page 38 of the decision.  

Now, what my learned friend has done is, he has lifted from this decision, diligent as he always is in reading everything that's ever been written by the ICTY or the ICTR, he has selected the third paragraph on that page as the basis for his application, which reads:  "Further, with respect to the Rule 66(B), the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Defence counsel must fulfill two fundamental requirements in order to succeed in its claim for disclosure of evidenciary material.  First, the Defence must demonstrate prima facie materiality of the evidence in question; and, secondly, that the said evidence is in the custody or control of the Prosecution."  

Now, having identified that particular section of that judgement, and if Your Honours turn to page 30 of the bundle, Your Honours see the motion in respect of inspection, paragraph 6:  "It has been held that to obtain an order pursuant to 66(B), the Defence must demonstrate prima facie materiality of the evidence in question; and, secondly, that the said evidence is in the custody or control of the Prosecution."  And the specific decision is referred to.  

So what my learned friend then goes on to do is, he asserts materiality.  He's identified some individuals.  Fine.  But if one looks at the identification of materiality, it's very vague, I respectfully submit -- a matter for the Court -- it's pretty loose.  It's as wide as the whole case.  

If we look at paragraph 10, having identified the first three witnesses, materiality is said to be -- still on page 30 of the bundle, Mr. Robinson's motion -- "The information obtained by the Prosecution from these witnesses is likely to relate to their activities and knowledge of the MRND and Interahamwe meetings, and to the relationship between the Accused and those bodies" -- mainly, the MRND and the Interahamwe meetings -- "as well as acts and conducts of the Accused in addressing MRND meetings and directing activities of the MRND and Interahamwe."  Well, that's the whole case, in my respectful submission.  There is no specificity with regard to why such statements might be of use or interest to the Defence.  

Where my learned friend goes on to identify the next three witnesses, materiality is pleaded at paragraph 12 -- and I'm dealing now on page 31 of the bundle -- paragraph 12 reads:  "The information obtained by the Prosecution for these witnesses is likely to relate to meetings held by the authorities of Kigali préfecture on the distribution of weapons and is material to determine whether the version of these events by Witness UB is accurate."  Well, that could be said about almost every statement, I respectfully submit.  So, a matter for the Court whether my learned friend, in relying on the decision of 1997, is suggesting materiality which lacks specificity.  

What is of interest is, when one looks at a decision of 2005, about Rule 66(B), there is some observation by Judge Møse on what amounts to, material which is disclosable under the heading, it is material to the preparation of the Defence. 
(Pages 24 to 34 by Wendy Molnar)


1200H 
MR. MORLEY (continuing):
Now, the 2005 decision can be found at page 45 of the bundle.  This is, again, a decision from the case of Bagosora and the relevant section of interest might be thought to be paragraph 6, which begins on page 43.  In the last sentence of that page it's plainly a paragraph relating to Rule 66(B) and what should be disclosed, and there is this observation:  Page 43, last sentence, "The final category prescribed by Rule 66(B) (material to the preparation of the Defence) must also be understood as referring to the Defence preparation to meet the Prosecution case."  

In this particular decision there was a dispute about immigration documents, and it goes on, "The requested immigration documents are not part of the Prosecution case in the sense described above, but may be used during the Prosecution's cross-examination of Defence witnesses with the view to their impeachment."  

What is of interest here is that part of the reasoning behind my learned friend seeking to obtain this material is because, as he pleads in his motion, he is anticipating making the seven witnesses Defence witnesses.  They are not witnesses who are going to be relied on by the Prosecution.  In theory, their statements, on the face of the decision of 2005, arguably can be held back for the purposes of cross-examination of those people if they become Defence witnesses.  

So, it is my respectful submission that Mr. Robinson's application, in light of the 2005 decision, in light of the fact that none of these people are going to be Prosecution witnesses, in light of the fact that the application falls outside Rule 66(A) and its parameters, in principle, is an application which should fail unless, under the 1997 decision, specificity of materiality is defined, and I respectfully submit there isn't specificity. 

Finally, it will not have escaped the Court's notice that Mr. Robinson was able to go and take statements from these people anyway.  So the extent to which the preparation of his Defence is hampered by the absence of these statements is moot.  He can talk to the witnesses.  

In short, Your Honour, I have the various statements here.  If the Court wants to review them, the Court is very welcome to do so.  But there has to be a limit to what it means under 66(B) to say the Prosecution must disclose "that which is material to the preparation of the defence".  It is too widely articulated by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, so widely, I submit, that it renders Rule 68 completely otiose. 

I make the observation on page 27 of the bundle in my skeleton at paragraph 11, which I hope meets with some consideration.  There has to be an air of practicality.  The Prosecution cannot be expected to prepare the Defence case while running the Prosecution case.  This is particularly as we do not know the detail of the Defence case.  While the Prosecution is not embarrassed by disclosure, the present position is one of principle, and guidance is sought from the Chamber.  I hope that's of assistance.  I don't propose to say any more on this particular motion, unless Your Honours have any questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thirty-eight minutes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think I can do this in less than 30 minutes.  

First, with respect to the motion regarding certification by the Prosecution.  So Mr. Morley says this is a novel motion, the first time ever brought in any (sic) of the ICTY or the ICTR, but he points us to the Blaskic appeal decision in which the very same request was made to the Appeals Chamber in Blaskic that a signed, sworn affidavit be made by the Prosecution regarding its compliance with Rule 68.  That decision further notes not only was a request like that made before at the ICTY, but an order to that extent was issued in the Krnojelac case.  

We are simply asking that this Trial Chamber do what the Appeals Chamber and what the prior Trial Chamber in this case said it would do.  Where the Defence can satisfy a Trial Chamber that the Prosecution has failed to discharge its obligation, then, under those circumstances, only in those circumstances, should an order of the type sought be contemplated.  And those are, indeed, the circumstances that we find ourselves in now. 

The Appeals Chamber didn't speak of bad faith.  They said "where the Prosecution has failed to discharge its obligations".  You have found that the Prosecution has failed to discharge its obligations.  It is now time to take the next step.  That step is to require the Prosecution, and each member of its team, to certify that they have complied.  It ought not to be any problem.  When I sign my name to something, it simply indicates that I have enough faith in the truthfulness and veracity of what I am saying and I am willing to put my signature to it.  

The Prosecution ought not to be afraid to do that.  They ought to have enough faith in their representations that they have made repeatedly to this Court that they are complying with Rule 68 and put their name behind it.  If, in fact, they are in good faith, what's the problem?  Why not certify to this Court that they have complied?  And if they are not willing to certify, then perhaps they are not in compliance, and they are afraid to be on the hook because they know they are not in compliance.  

So this matter of certification is simply a next step to encourage compliance with Rule 68, and I think Mr. Morley, in particular, is the type of lawyer that would say to Mr. Webster, "I'm not going to sign your document about complying with Rule 68 unless I am darned sure that we have complied."  And I think Mr. Lombardi would be the same way, and Mr. Lahaie.  And so the effect of this motion being granted would put the Prosecution to a little extra effort to make sure that we have compliance with Rule 68, with no prejudice to them whatsoever in doing so.  They are simply being asked to put their name, their signature behind the representations that they have already made in court, that they have complied with Rule 68.  That is simply the purpose of the motion. 

Now, I know in your decision you said, "Next time, if you don't do this, maybe we will do something more to you."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now or next time?
MR. ROBINSON:
If there is no compliance -- if we find, within the course of this session, that there has not been compliance, maybe we'll do something -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no, no.  That's not what we said.  Our decision was based on statements of fact made by the Prosecution concerning the searches that they had made and the results of those searches, and we said if it subsequently turned out that those statements were inaccurate, then we would revisit the issue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, my question really was, what's the difference between that and asking for certification?
MR. ROBINSON:
Because I'm asking them to certify that they have complied with Rule 68 in toto, not simply that the representations they made as to these particular instances in which I have caught them in violations of Rule 68 are true.  They are supposed to comply with Rule 68 for all of the witnesses in this case, and should have complied long ago.  So I am asking you to order them to certify that Rule 68 compliance is complete, full, not only every time I bring another document they say, "Oh, I'm sorry, we didn't disclose that."  This is to prevent that.  This is to require a level of responsibility and accountability, to remedy the problem that we have encountered in this session, and I suggest we are likely to encounter in the future.
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Robinson, hasn't Mr. Webster given this undertaking in the course of these proceedings several times, that they have complied with their Rule 68 obligations, and they acknowledge that they have this obligation and that it is a continuous obligation?  Hasn't he given this undertaking several times at the bar?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Your Honour, he has done that many, many times, going back to --
JUDGE KAM:
Do you accept it in good faith?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, absolutely not. 
JUDGE KAM:
So you are not prepared to conduct this trial on the basis of good faith?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I am, but that representation was made back in November of 2004, in February 2005, all along, that we have complied with our obligations fully under Rule 68.  Now, here we are, February 2006.  It's not true.  It's been proven, established 100 per cent, that representation was not true. 
JUDGE KAM:
And has it been proved that they had deliberately not complied with their obligation under Rule 68?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, (unintelligible) that question "deliberately", I would say no, it hasn't been established, deliberately. 
JUDGE KAM:
So why then question the good faith, which is what you imply, that you do not accept the good faith of the Prosecution?
MR. ROBINSON:
Because a simple search for the material, using the name of the witness, would have revealed that material, and they didn't undertake that simple search.  And they made that representation that they complied with disclosure without undertaking that step.  So, to me, maybe it's not deliberate, but it's a very negligent misrepresentation.  And I don't believe that, from what I hear from Mr. Webster today, where he thinks that Rule 68 is a technical problem, that their compliance is a burden to them.  I don't see that Mr. Webster is going to make the kind of efforts to comply with Rule 68 in the future that's required.  So he can say, yes, like the three monkeys, see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, but, in fact, he is not taking the steps to comply with Rule 68.  It is unfortunate, but I think it is clear that that's the situation.  

If Rule 68 had been complied with from the beginning of this trial, like it should have been, we wouldn't have this problem.  We'd be here with Witness UB in the cross-examination by now.  It's only because the Prosecution has not fulfilled its obligations that we are having this problem.  The question is, what is the remedy and what can be done about it?  And we think that certification is a logical next step, to put the accountability of all the Prosecutors at issue.  

Now I would like to turn to the motion for stay pending appeal.  A motion for stay pending appeal requires, first of all, that you grant certification for the appeal in the first place.  So, to some extent, we are putting the cart before the horse because the motion for certification is something that has not yet been responded to by the Prosecution.  But I think Mr. Morley is misconstruing -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
May we ask you a procedural question.  Why file a separate motion for stay?  Why wasn't it part of the relief applied for in the certification?
MR. ROBINSON:
Again, it could have been, Mr. President.  To me, it was more clear to make two separate motions.  But, again, again, the motions were not repetitive.  The motion for stay is a page and a half.  It could have been added to the motion for certification to appeal, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is additional relief. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, it's additional relief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, it's incomplete. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct, but it requires a further showing of irreparable harm in continuing.  But, in the future, if you want motions to be consolidated in that manner, I could do that.  It's not any effort on my part to make your work more difficult. 

The motion for stay pending appeal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have noticed that you don't mind making life difficult for us, and that's not a problem. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I have no -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Beg your pardon?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I said, I have no intention of making life difficult.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're so used to it, as though you relish the opportunity to do that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry you feel that way, but I feel like -- I am going to raise all of the points on my client's behalf.  If that makes your life difficult, then I'm sorry, but that's what I'm doing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The point is, Mr. Robinson, we take -- I take a view that the Court's resources are abused when you bring unnecessary proceedings before it.  If you have one question to ask, which we have more than one answer, and you bring multiple motions with regard to that one question, you are abusing the process of the Court.  I think it is a very simple and obvious proposition that most lawyers accept.  If you are making application for leave to appeal and you want to get a stay pending the appeal, it's most normal.  That is part of the application for leave to appeal.  But if I draw this to your attention, why do you have to make these further remarks?
MR. ROBINSON:
If that's the way you want it, I agree.  I wrote one page and a half or one page and a quarter for leave to appeal.  It could have been added to the same motion.  You are correct and I will do that in the future.  I don't see that that's added to anybody's burden by the fact that it's been in two pages instead of one.  It's the same page and a half, whether it's added to the motion or not.  Now I see you want it done that way, I'll do it that way.  It's no problem.  

With respect to stay pending appeal, we believe that the remedies provided in the Court's decisions on stay of proceeding are inadequate.  This is a problem that affects Rule 68 violations for witnesses who have already testified, and for every single witness who is scheduled to testify in this trial session.  Witness UB, HH, ALG, GFA, GBU, and Serushago, have all been shown to have had Rule 68 material which is not disclosed to us.  We don't feel that the remedy provided by the Trial Chamber, which we basically don't see as any remedy, was adequate for our needs and for a fair trial and effective cross-examination.  So, we have asked for certification to appeal, and we ask that the matter be stayed pending the appeal so that the Appeals Chamber can make a ruling on the adequacy of the remedy.  If it turns out that they feel that the remedy was adequate, we can go ahead and we will be guided for the rest of the trial with how we proceed.  

If it turns out that they find the remedy was not adequate, we will not have had to undergo -- to have seven or four, or however many cross-examinations, based on inadequate time to investigate and prepare for those cross-examinations.  That's why we feel that the trial should be stayed pending a resolution of this on appeal. 

We can't help but notice that whenever the Prosecution requests more time to do its job, this Trial Chamber has no problem in granting them those extensions.  The expert witnesses, time and time again, on the last day on which the report was due, the Prosecution provides a request for an extension of time and the extension of time is granted. 

When the Court tells the Prosecution that they need to tell us which witnesses they are going to drop from witness -- in exchange of the Witness ADE, on the day that is due, the Prosecution says, "No, we don't think that was a very wise order.  We are going to not comply with that, or we ask for an extension for much later in the trial for that to occur," and you have no problem with that. 

Rule 92 bis, you tell them to file their motion.  On the day it's due they say, "No, we don't think it's a very good idea to do it now; we're going to do it later."  And you have no problem with that.  So, you keep giving the Prosecution every extension that it wants, and you give us nothing.  You want us to cross-examine UB under conditions that are horrible.  We were just receiving his judgement.  We had no time to investigate where there is Rule 68 material coming to us after he has taken the witness stand.  So we are disappointed in the Trial Chamber's ruling on the motion for stay of proceedings.  We don't think that the trial, as it's proceeding now, is proceeding on an equitable and fair basis, and we feel that the Trial Chamber needs some guidance from the Appeals Chamber in order to reset the balance that needs to be reset within this case.  For those reasons, we believe that our motion for stay pending appeal should be granted. 

I turn now to the motion for inspection of statements pursuant to Rule 66(B).  We have met the three requirements of Rule 66(B).  The material is in possession of the OTP.  There is no doubt about that.  The request is very specific.  We have listed the name of the witness and they have the material here in Court.  So there is no question of some kind of onerous burden or vague specificity with respect to being able to find and locate the material that's requested, and we have shown that it's material to the Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, before filing this motion, did you make the request for 66(B) inspection?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, in my letter of -- going back to my letter in November I asked -- I invoked both Rule 66(B) and Rule 68 for this material, as well as in my original motions.  And I would point out again, I know you are annoyed to have to deal with what you see as ministerial disclosure disputes that should be resolved between the parties.  But on the 7th of November, after this session ended, I went back and made a list of all of the things that are now contained in these motions, and I wrote a letter to the Prosecutor very specifically setting forth all of those things.  I tried to resolve that.  They never answered the letter.  They never provided the disclosure.  So I don't know what more you can expect me to do, but I am making these requests always to the Prosecution before filing motions with the Trial Chamber. 

The materiality of this -- these statements that I am seeking inspection of is set out clearly in our motion.  The first three witnesses were named by Mr. Mbonyunkiza as having been present at the February 1992 meetings.  Their information is very material as to whether or not what he has attributed to Mr. Ngirumpatse was, in fact, said, and also because of their positions.  The first one was the national secretary of the Interahamwe national committee.  The second one was an official of the -- it was the treasurer of the préfectural committee of the MRND.  And the third one was supposed to be the composer of extremist songs for the MRND.  

So the very nature of these individuals makes it likely that, not only can they assist on these particular meetings, and that issue raised by Mr. Mbonyunkiza, but they have information material to the issues involving whether such statements were made at MRND rallies, and the relationship between the Interahamwe and the Accused. 

The same thing is true for the three witnesses that involve Witness UB.  He has identified these people specifically as attending security council meetings at the préfecture of Kigali from the 10th to the 30th of April, including meetings at which he claims Mr. Nzirorera was present.  So, these witnesses can provide material information to us about these meetings, and also about what else occurred in the préfecture at the time that may or may not be consistent with what Witness UB is saying, because two of these witnesses were conseillers, like Witness UB, and the third was the leader of a political party with which Witness UB had some association. 

Finally, the last witness was identified by Witness GFA and GBU as being involved in the same events in Mukingo commune that they were:  Being involved in the formation and training of the Interahamwe, meetings at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house, and killings on the 7th of April.  So it is material to us to see what this witness has said to the Prosecution.  We think we've --
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Robinson, you see, you have used words like "the statements are likely to contain A, B, C, D."  And then you say that they -- the statements may contain information that's relevant.  So, in effect, you don't really know what -- you don't have any information as to what those statements contain, but you think that there's a likelihood that these statements may contain information material to your Defence, right?
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct. 
JUDGE KAM:
And you think that any time you have -- any time you think that a statement in the possession of the Prosecution is likely to contain information that is material to your Defence, then you are entitled to have that material inspected.  Is that your understanding of the law, or the threshold which you have to meet?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  My understanding is that I have to make some showing of likelihood that the information is material to my Defence.  If the standard is that I have to -- how am I supposed to know the contents of the document without it being disclosed to me?  So, if that's the standard -- 
JUDGE KAM:
No, I'm not -- I'm not telling you what the standard is.  I'm asking you.  If you -- if you think that -- let's say because somebody was present at a meeting, so you assume that there is a likelihood that that person may have given a statement to the Prosecution which was material to your Defence, you are not sure.  You don't have any information from that person, that he or she had actually given such a statement to the Prosecution, but you are saying that the mere presence of that person at the meeting raises a likelihood that he may have given a statement that is material to the Defence and, therefore, that is sufficient to order disclosure, is that your understanding?
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Your Honour.  Because we already know that these people have given statements to the Office of the Prosecutor.  We don't have to ask them about that because the Prosecution has acknowledged each of these people has given statements to it.  So we know they have given a statement, and we know they have already, by -- in testimony in this Court, been listed as people who were present at important meetings which the Prosecution has led evidence on.  And we know, by the nature of their position within either the MRND or the préfecture, that they are people in a position to have information about the issues that are related to this case and that are material to our Defence.  So I think that's as far as I can take it. 
JUDGE KAM:
Wouldn't your case be stronger if you had got statements from these persons indicating that they had given statements to the Prosecution, and this is exactly what they said:  A, B, C, D, E?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, my case would have been stronger if I had done that, but I don't believe I am required to do that.  Some of these people are willing to talk to us and others are not.  I don't think that it is necessary for us to have interviewed people to find out what they told the Prosecutor.  If they had -- I think that showing the materiality, if we can show that these people are in a position where they have information about items that are relevant to this trial, I think you can presume that the Prosecution asked them about the MRND, the Accused, and then it's material.  So, I don't think we have to go so far as to obtain information directly from each witness before we are entitled to inspect their statements.  

I don't have anything further on Rule 66(B) inspection, unless the Trial Chamber has any question, and that also concludes my submissions on Mr. Morley's part of the motions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Any other Defence submissions?  
We are going to have to take some time to consider our -- I'm sorry, Mr. Morley, did you wish to reply?  
MR. MORLEY:
No, thank you.  All the points have been made. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We are going to have to take some time to consider our decision on these matters.  We hope that we will be in a position to come to a conclusion during the course of today and, in all these circumstances, it might be sensible to simply adjourn until tomorrow morning and expect that we will be able to proceed.  So I feel that we will take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning at 8:45.
