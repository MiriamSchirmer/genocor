P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 8th of February 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

The appearances are the same. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, good morning.  

The appearances are the same for the Defence.  But I would also like to introduce to the Court the lawyer for General Augustin Bizimungu, our new -- our next witness, and that is Mr. Giles St-Laurent who is sitting in front of you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. St-Laurent, and welcome to our proceedings.  
MR. ST-LAURENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  

Before we get started with the next witness, I was wondering if we could address the matter that we left pending last week, which was the addition of the exhibits for the cross-examination of Kajelijeli.  

I did speak to Mr. Robinson over the weekend and he has objections to a few of them, and I think we're going to have to simply argue it before the Chamber.  But I propose to admit 15 exhibits.  Mr. Robinson has the list and if we could go through them one by one.  Whenever there is necessity to seek guidance from the Court, we can stop and address it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, we don't mind you presenting the entire list now.  I think we'll propose -- we will enter into evidence those that are not controversial.  We think we'll probably prefer to hear -- to receive the arguments on the contentious matters in writing to avoid -- to minimise the time we spend in court on this issue. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, excuse me.  

Could I make a pitch for giving -- resolving these orally, even if we have to resume at 4 o'clock today, because the last time we did this in writing it was eight months before they were resolved and it took a lot of work on our side to brief those issues and everybody had forgotten what the important things were.  

This can take about 15 or 20 minutes.  And if you are concerned with the court time, I just think it's better to resume at 4 o'clock and to finish it than to leave it to paperwork which will take a long time to resolve and more resources for everyone.  

So I would ask you to think about setting aside some time.  We could finish that job and move on. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We would consider that.  But it would not be this afternoon.  It would either be tomorrow or Wednesday. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The first document is in relation to the census that was signed by -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Excuse me, Mr. Robinson.  

Our brief deliberation has required me to raise the issue of the attendance of your client at the session.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I would like to have my client present.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, in that case we need the agreement of Ngirumpatse.  So perhaps you can arrange that or discuss it, so we can make a formal decision in due course. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. WEBSTER:
I'll continue, Your Honours.  
The first of the documents signed by Assiel Ndisetse dated the 28th of October 1992.  There is no disagreement between Mr. Robinson and I, so this would be the next Prosecution exhibit, if Mr. Issa could give us a number. 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document will be P. 420. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 420 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
The next is the list of militiamen.  That was taken from the testimony of BTH from the 10th of April 2008.  This we're going to have to argue because Mr. Robinson is opposed to it.  So I'll keep it on the side.

The third is the letter of Aloys Karekezi dated the 30th of November 1993.  We've addressed it briefly in this Chamber and gave it an identifying number of IP. 51.  This also is a contentious matter that we'll have to argue at a later time.

The fourth was the letter from Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye dated the 5th of June 1993, which Mr. Robinson characterised as referring to Gatabazi.  It's come to light that this is a document that was previously admitted as P. 130, so we don't need to readmit it at this point.  But what I'd request is that the identifying information for the person that was contained in the letter be entered under seal as a separate exhibit so that we can track it in our records.  This is also a contentious issue between Mr. Robinson and myself, so I'll hold that to the side as well.

Then there's the English translation of D. NZ343, which is President Habyarimana's speech of the 
23rd of March 1993.  That's uncontentious.  It's already admitted.  We simply are admitting the translation now.

The next item, number 6, is the number 83 issue of Isibo.  That is dated 9 to 16 January 1993.  Mr. Robinson is opposed to that, so we'll hold it to the side.

The human -- the following item is the human rights report of June 1993, which addresses the international commission of human rights organisations and the Rwandan commission that was set up to evaluate civil servants.  That also is a contentious issue which we'll have to argue, so I'll hold it to the side. 

The eighth item is a letter to the ministry of justice concerning massacres in Mukingo dated the 
17th of May 1993.  That also is a contentious issue which I'll hold to the side.

Next there's the interview note of Préfet Basile Nsabumugisha dated the 3rd of December 2009.  That also is contentious.  And the affirmation which would be appended to it, and that is contentious as well.

The tenth item is a letter signed by Préfet Basile Nsabumugisha dated the 29th of April 1994.  We have consent on that item so we can give it a Prosection exhibit number, which I assume would be P. 421.

The following item is an excerpt from the diary of Augustin Ngirabatware.  Here we have agreement, so you can give that the following Prosection number, which would be 422.

Then there is an item, the RTLM broadcast of the 3rd of June 1994, which was previously identified in our records as ID. NZ28.  In principle, there's no disagreement, but Mr. Robinson would like his previous document entered into evidence which he claims is longer.  I haven't seen it.  It's a document we will have to get from CMS, so I'll hold this to the side as well, even though it's non-contentious in principle.

And there is Mr. Kajelijeli's sauf-conduit pass, under the name of Gaspard Mbanzabugabo, which was entered into evidence in his trial as P. 31.  This is non-contentious, so we can give it the next Prosection number of 423.

The next excerpt is an excerpt from a motion filed by Mr. Kajelijeli on the 9th of November 1998.  That's non-contentious.  It's only an excerpt that's relevant -- which was relevant to my cross-examination.  That will be P. 324.  

Then the trial transcript from the 17th of April 2003, pages 57 to 59 in English, that would P. 425.  It's non-contentious.  And when we meet to discuss the other items, I will bring the relevant French excerpt.  

So that is what we have agreed upon.  So we have quite a few exhibits to discuss.  And I also would prefer that we do that orally.  The issues are fairly simple.  It just demands a decision from the Chamber.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We admit those documents which have been agreed and we will defer discussion of the others to a time to be fixed.
(Exhibit No.  P. 421 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 422 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 423 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 424 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 425 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
And for the benefit of CMS, I have written the proposed exhibit numbers on the back of the ones that the Court has accepted, so Mr. Issa can collect these.  And if you refer to the back page on the other side, you will see how they have been marked.  Thanks.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  We're ready to have the witness come in.  

We call Augustin Bizimungu.
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  

I am very happy to appear before you.  I want to greet this Honourable Court and all those present in the courtroom. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.

Before you begin your testimony, you'll have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.
(Declaration made by Augustin Bizimungu in French) 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you.  You may sit down. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.

Now you'll now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the counsel designated for that purpose.  

And you will start by responding to counsel for Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
AUGUSTIN BIZIMUNGU,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Bizimungu.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	General Bizimungu, we have placed before you a personal information sheet, and I'm wondering if you could tell us whether the information there is correct.  
A.	Correct.  The information is accurate, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may that be admitted as D. NZ730. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ730 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, the sheet tells us you are a native of Byumba.  Can you tell us where you did your primary school? 
A.	I was born in Byumba in Mukarange commune, as it appears on the PIS.  I went to primary school in Rushaki in Mukarange commune in Byumba. 
Q.	And where did you go to secondary school? 
A.	The first part of my primary education was in Byumba at the Byumba Christian school.  Then the second part was in Musanze in Ruhengeri and I was still attending the Christian schools. 
Q.	Do you know Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	When did you first meet Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	I saw him for the first time -- but this is not when I first met him necessarily.  I saw him for the first time in 1969 when I went to Musanze.  I was in the fourth year and he was in the last year, that is, the 
	sixth year of studies.  I was a younger -- I was the younger one and we knew our seniors.  I knew him in Musanze while we attended the same college for one year.  That was in 1969 in
Musanze.  I knew him, although we didn't talk to each other at that time. 
Q.	What did you do when you finished secondary school? 
A.	In 1972 I wrote a competitive exam into the Kigali military academy.  And I passed that examination and I was admitted for the 1972-74 batch.  And I graduated in 1974 with the rank of second lieutenant. 
Q.	And can you tell us briefly what posts you held in the army from 1974 through 1988? 
A.	Upon graduation from the military academy in 1974, I was immediately posted to the commando training centre at Bagogwe centre.  This centre was supported by the Belgian military 
	cooperation -- technical cooperation.  So I got there in '72. 
 
But in September of 1974 I went to the Marche-les-Dames commando training centre in Belgium for further training in order to become a commando trainer or instructor.  

So I returned to the country in January or February of 1975 and I was immediately assigned to follow-up local training.  Because of the preeminence of the Bagogwe training centre for commandos, it was required at the time that one should also obtain a commando training certificate from that centre.  

So I received some training at that centre in order to become a commando trainer.  After that training I continued to serve at that centre as a commando trainer till 1982.  

From 1982 the government of Rwanda granted me permission to attend training -- further training in Belgium at the Royal Defence Institute, formerly known as the war school, which I attended for 
two years.  

Then in 1984 I graduated with a general staff certificate and then returned to the country.  

In August 1984 I went to the paracommando battalion where I served as S2/S3.  And at that time we had one paracommando battalion at Kanombe.  

In January of 1985 I was promoted, an in-service promotion, and I was appointed commander of the training centre in Gako in Bugesera.  

In 1988 I was transferred to Ruhengeri, where I served as the commander of the commando battalion in Ruhengeri, which at the time was located in Ruhengeri town.

So I got to that post in 1988.  But in the meantime a new camp had been set up in 
Ruhengeri prefecture, but was not located in the city.  That new camp had just been built and it was known as the Mukamira military camp.  So I was the first commander of the Mukamira military from 1988 when we relocated to that camp.

Then in 1990 -- from 1990 when Rwanda was attacked by the RPF-Inkotanyi, I was assigned directly to the war front, first, at the Mutara and then, secondly, to Byumba, and then later on, on the 25th of January 1991, reassigned to Ruhengeri -- still working with my Ruhengeri commando battalion.  

On the 27th of January, that is in the night of the 27th to the 28th of January, the area commander for Ruhengeri called me and introduced me to his general staff.  And then he showed me a telegram from the head military headquarters appointing me to replace him as commander of the 
Ruhengeri operational secteur, a position which I occupied until the 16th of April 1994 when I was appointed chief of staff of the Rwandan army.  And I took up that office on the 19th of April 1994.  

I don't know, Counsel, whether I have answered your question. 
Q.	Yes, you did.  Thank you very much.

Now, can you tell us during the period from when you left the secondary school until the war broke out in 1990, how often did you see Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	That is a very difficult question because, well, you see, at that time I did not expect that I would be asked how often I met anybody or some individuals.  In any event, I will attempt to give the best possible answer I can offer.  

Our paths separated, so to speak, in Musanze at the end of 1969 when he graduated.  He went to the national university of Rwanda while I pursued my own career.

Later on he became general director at the ministry of public works.  And at that time we -- our paths did cross sometimes in Kigali, particularly given that we had a common friend who also worked in Kigali.  I don't remember what that friend's rank was at that time, but he was 
Lieutentant Colonel Setako.  So from time to time I ran into Joseph.

Later on when he became a minister, I hardly met him except on very rare occasions.  I do remember, for example, that in 1984, upon my return from Belgium and while in Bagogwe awaiting an appointment, Nzirorera had organised a party at home to -- a house-warming party, to which he had invited many people from Kigali and even some officers from Bagogwe.  And I remember attending that house-warming party at his house.  

So what I can say is that I met him a lot more frequently when I was appointed commander of the Ruhengeri commando battalion in 1988.  
And why was it so?  It was so because at that time Rwanda -- well, there was no multiparty politics in Rwanda.  In fact, there was no political party as such.  We only had the national revolutionary movement for democracy -- for development, rather, the MRND.  And all Rwandans were automatically members of the MRND, including soldiers.  

So at that time, and following the organisational setup of the organisation, the préfet of each préfecture was automatically the chairman of the MRND within that jurisdiction.  But given that the préfet was not the -- was not a native of any given préfecture, a préfectoral committee was set up, made up of natives of that préfecture.  It made up -- it was made up of 12 members and 12 elected members.  And, therefore, one of them had to be the vice chair of the movement within that préfecture.  So when I arrived in Ruhengeri, it is Nzirorera who was the vice chair of the MRND in Ruhengeri cumulatively with his position as minister of public works.

So whenever meetings -- MRND meetings were called in Ruhengeri préfecture requiring that various services come together, I was one of the heads of the services that were expected to be present.  And it is on those occasions that I had opportunity to meet Nzirorera, to say hello to him, just as I said hello to all others in attendance, not particularly to Nzirorera.  

You see your question is such that I can only answer only in terms of these official relations, which I had not exclusively with him but with others who attended those official meetings.

I also do recall that 1988 was an election year and candidates from Ruhengeri had to campaign in their stronghold in order to fight it out among themselves.  So at times -- it happened from time to time that the préfectoral security committee would accompany the préfets at rallies where the various candidates were introduced to the public.  

So as a member of the préfectoral security council which accompanied the préfet, we had the opportunity to see the candidates who were running for office, Nzirorera, Bizimungu, Casimir and Boniface, and what have you, Ntibitura, a soldier, a former soldier giving to Caesar what belonged to Caesar, so to speak.  So that was an election year and I saw him during that year.  

In 1989 I also saw Nzirorera on the occasion of the inauguration of the Mukamira military camp, which took place in July 1989.  And that was during the two weeks of project work.

Nzirorera was present at the inauguration of Mukamira camp.  The president of the republic was present.  All distinguished members of authority were present.  But I clearly remember that Nzirorera was present because he, as minister of public work, was in charge of building that camp and he spoke on behalf of government.  

Now, with the RPF attack in 1990 I think I also saw him.  And since then the frequency of our meetings, should I say, simply vanished, because I went my own way, and that was separate from Nzirorera's, and did not give us opportunity to meet, given that political or -- political restrictions had been introduced into the country which did not allow me to meet him often.  I was busy at the war front and Rwanda had introduced multiparty politics.  

So I think from then on I cannot be very useful to you in answering this question, because then Mr. Karemera, who was the mastermind behind these transformations, has talked to you about these things, and will talk to you about these things.  But in any event, let it be said that he was nicknamed Rukusanya because of the noble task which had been assigned to him.

Let me say that with our constitution of 10 June 1991, which introduced multiparty politics, the 
Rwandan armed forces, as well as the judiciary, or the magistracy, were prohibited from belonging to 
political parties.

But even prior to the adoption of that 1991 constitution, I never had the opportunity to attend any rallies of the old format of the MRND.  And that is why, although we met in the past in the context of various MRND meetings, let me say that even at that time you could not call it a political party, it was the revolutionary movement.  And in any event, the war -- with the onset of the war, it became increasingly rare for us to meet.  

So all I can say is that I ran into him from time to time, but not often. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.

Now I want to take you to the 1st of October 1990 when the RPF attacked Rwanda.  Can you tell us where you were stationed at that time and what you did? 
A.	I'm sorry.  Maybe I was a bit too fast.  I was commander of the Mukamira military camp, which was host to a commando battalion.  And I was cumulatively commander of that commando battalion.  

Now, this is an important fact because it may happen that within a military camp you have several units.  And, by the way, that was what was foreseen, given that Mukamira camp was likely to host many battalions.  But at the time we only had the Ruhengeri one, but I was there at Mukamira camp with my battalion under my authority. 
Q.	And did you proceed to the war front? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And where did you go and how long did you remain? 
A.	On the 13th or 14th -- no, 13th October 1990 -- either 13th or 14th of October 1990, I received a warning memo from the headquarters of the Rwandan army informing me that I had to prepare for a new mission towards Mutara.  

On the 15th -- no, rather, on the 14th evening I received an order to move on the 15th.  On the 
15th of October 1990 then, I moved.  I would spare you the details of my itinerary.  And I got to within the Gabiro secteur, which had withdrawn from the front and which was now at Kisiguro (phonetic), where I met my secteur commander.

But in the meantime, on my way to Kisiguro (phonetic), I had been informed that I had to go past the headquarters of the Rwandan army in Kigali for a briefing session.  

And that was where I stopped for the third briefing session.  And I was received by the deputy joint 
chief of staff who specified my missions and gave me new orientation of the work I was supposed to do.  He told me:  "Henceforth, you're under the authority of the operating commander of Gabiro.  If you have any problem, you see him, go back to him."  He was very firm on this.  There is no room for bypassing hierarchy.  You are no more under the authority of the joint chief of staff.  You are directly under the commander of the operational command for Mutara, who carried out a certain number of operations in Mutara.  And I got to the Mukamira camp on the 13th of December 1990.

I spent hardly two or three days when the headquarters, which had taken me over, or under, its authority, assigned another new mission to me, dispatching me to the operational command of Byumba.  I got there on the 17th of December 1990.  And again this time the system is the same as was the case in Mutara.  I now go under the direct authority of the commander of the operational command of Byumba.  

At that time this was Colonel Nshizirungu.  I was there in Byumba carrying out operations.  It was not a walkover.  It was not a leisure party.  I stayed there in Byumba up till the 25th of January 1991, when I got back to Ruhengeri, and following the programme, which I mentioned earlier on.  

That is it, thank you. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.

I just want to have you inform the Trial Chamber a little bit about this attack of the 1st of April 1990, because we haven't had any witnesses about the military before.  So can you tell us where that attack was launched from and what the Rwandan armed forces did to repulse that attack? 
A.	Wow.  Now, that's a very, very long question.  Well, I will try to be brief.  I'll make an attempt.

On the first day of the attack it hit the borders of Kagitumba, the border post of Kagitumba.  It was on the northern access from the road going to Uganda and going past Mutara.  That was where the attack took place.  And the assailants, who were they?  Initially, it was part of the Ugandan army which was there on the war front.  

But a few days later we were informed that the assailants claimed they were of the RPF, and which had a programme, and which I later learnt had eight points.  And we learnt at the head of that movement there was a general known as Rwigema, collaborator of the Ugandan president, Museveni, who had been deputy minister for defence under Museveni.  

As a matter of fact, initially there was quite some confusion.  It was the Ugandan army that was attacking us, that was what we understood, even if the claim was being done under some other movement.  But out on the field, out on the front, for having clashed -- crossed swords with them in Mutara, we had people -- we had soldiers of the Ugandan army who were holding identity cards of the Ugandan army and they all came from Uganda.  

Apart from that, it was not for me to authorise the case.  My role was to push back this attack, be it Rwandan, be it Ugandan.  And it was the duty of the others to -- the others to investigate and clarify what the situation exactly was and to know who it was who was our attacker, and maybe to be able to start negotiations with the attacker or seek the necessary wherewithal to fight this enemy off.  

Whatever the case, the initial confusion was that the fighters were from the Ugandan army.  And Museveni even said it clearly.  He did not hide on this issue.  He said, "I know my boys.  I know them.  They will win." But, on the other hand, he was speaking some other language by saying that these people had escaped from his powers and that they had left without his knowledge.  

But whatever the case, these are people who were in contact with the Ugandan army and who had been part of the Ugandan army and who had been registered as Ugandans but who, after having gone past the borders, claimed being Rwandans going back to our country to fight, one, the dictatorship of Habyarimana; two, to restore democracy to Rwanda; three, I believe it was for -- to settle the problem of refugees, refugees which you've certainly been informed about, refugees who had left since 1959, and others who were out of the country.

So they have these two major items, the return of the refugees and the fight against the dictatorship.  
And if you permit, Counsel Robinson, I will not be -- I will not be clearer than counsel for Rukusanya and counsel for Karemera, but let me underscore the fact, whether these are false arguments, these two, because since 1990, and even before, Rwanda was on the pathway of democratisation.  At the same time the problem of refugees was being addressed, even though lately it was on the table.  It was being solved.  

And so Museveni and -- there are people, people who pass or claim they were experts on Rwanda, others who know very little about Rwanda and its relationship with Uganda, did not -- did not see the danger that Museveni was facing in having a foreign army under him, that is, Rwandans in his army.  These Rwandans had helped Museveni to achieve power while he was fighting against Obote, if I'm not mistaken.  

Now having got into power, he had promised these Rwandans who would be granted 
Ugandan nationality because they were enrolled within his army and they were holding -- a number of them -- prestigious offices.  Now -- and he had difficulties saying, "Well, I have an army within an army.  I have foreigners within my army."  This was a political thorn in his flesh, because the opposition was saying:  "You have sold our country to foreigners."  These are Rwandans who are holding key positions.  Before going on training in the United States, the actual president of Rwanda, Kagame, who was a commander at the time, it was him who was in charge of the intelligence in Uganda.  

So to get rid of this thorn in his flesh, Museveni, as maligned and as foxy as he was, he did also send these cohorts to us.  He was aware that this situation going up in Uganda was not going to help him.  So he told him, himself a medical doctor going back to Rwanda, someone like a university professor, if he goes back to Rwanda, he will be a university professor.  

But how I would justify the fact that I have generals within my army, that I have an entire troop of Rwandans within my army.  Internationally speaking, and in compliance with international conventions, he could not handle that.  He was cornered.  That was a situation that was developing in Rwanda.  And he said, "Well, let us participate."  And that is how they sent what was known as the RPF in Rwanda.  And that is the key issue which I think is crucial, which people, unfortunately, miss, but which provoked or triggered the tragedy in Rwanda which potentially we will be discussing in subsequent moments. 
Q.	And how did the Rwandan army manage to repulse the attack of the RPF? 
A.	Well, sincerely I must confess, and I'm not proud to say this, there was groping around a troop with 5,000 men.  The Rwandan army, which had been built within the framework of peace and 
	national unity, never had an inkling, not once did they think that they were going to face any such an invasion.  

Now, I recall it was that -- this is an anecdote which I want to share which I was witness of during his first visit in Rwanda in 1986, if I'm not mistaken -- yes, 1986.  I don't have the dates very exactly.  But President Museveni, when he visited Rwanda -- at the time I was commander of the Bugesera training school, but the chief of staff had appointed me to be his instructing officer, so I was by him in receptions, in auditoriums in Butare where he went.  And he said publicly in Butare that there are some people who are saying that he could allow Rwandan refugees to attack us.  But he said, "No, that will never happen."  That was his statement.  

But, you see, this was pretence on his part.  Practically, at the highest level we were not ready for that war, and technically the Rwandan armed forces were not prepared for that war.  And that was why, with the help of diplomacy, there was a Congolese contingent, former Zaire, that came from Mubuto in Zaire at the time, but this military attachment really did not do much.

And within a certain framework there were Belgians who came to protect the airport, the 
Kanombe airport, and I think there was also a French detachment.  But whatever the case, after some hesitation we set up.  And after the hesitation, which was not in all secteurs -- and I must point this out because the war that broke out from Mutara, the head of the Rwandan army created secteurs, Nagatari secteur which was commanded by -- at the time by national Colonel Nsabimana, and he also had the Rwamagana secteur, which initially was under Gatsinzi and which would later on be called the 
Gabiro secteur, under that authority of national Colonel Rwanyagasore, at the time when the Nyagatare under Nsabimana was registering conquests and victories.  

On the other hand, we heard on the main course, the Kagitumba-Kigali road, Gabiro secteur was failing in its duties.  And that was where the -- the Congolese battalion, which failed in its duty as well.  It could not do much.  

And maybe it's unfortunate that I am the one saying this here.   When I was recruited within the 
Gabiro secteur, it was as a matter of fact to stave off the -- the horrid departure of the Congolese team which had started withdrawing with its ambulances all the way to Ngoma.  

And so the Rwandan headquarters said:  Let us reorganise ourselves.  We've been abandoned by the Congolese.  Let us pool our troops together.  Let us change the hierarchy.  And, well, that was where we -- we -- that was where we now got things back in order.  

And from that moment we had the wind in our sails.  We really dealt the RPF severe blows.  And on the 30th of October 1990 we were at the Kagitumba border.  The headquarters of Rwanda prohibited us from going into Uganda, which was right ahead of us.  And so we returned in the -- and they returned to Uganda to organise themselves.  But what about the case of the first reversal, the first defeat?  And that was on the 30th of October 1990.  Of course, this national army got dispersed in the park and that was where my units, alongside others, had the duty of doing a mop-up within Akagera national park.  
Now, after this mopping up had been done, that was where President Habyarimana -- and I must state, Mr. President, at this point that at that time Habyarimana, president of the republic of Rwanda, he was at the same time minister of the national defence, he was cumulatively head of chief of staff of the Rwandan army and head of the national gendarmerie headquarters.  Of course, he had deputies but he had the final word.  

And on the 7th of December, 7th December 1990, he came -- comes over to Mutara to congratulate us for a job well done.  Of course, he comes.  And there we have before us the president of the republic who had his prerogatives.  He is the supreme chief of the Rwandan army.  He could come as 
defence minister.  These were his prerogatives.  He could also come as the joint chief of staff.  And then he was before us speaking to the soldiers, and I can remember very clearly, because on that day it was my battalion, the Ruhengeri commander battalion, which had the honour of presenting to him military honours. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now I'd like if the registrar can show you document number 1 from my packet.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, these exhibits were sent to the parties and the registry on the 4th of February electronically, but the registry hasn't made any paper copies for some reason.  

So I'm showing the document to the witness, and if you could consult your electronic copies, that's sufficient.  Otherwise, we will have to take a recess and have the registrar make paper copies. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think you can continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, do you recognise the document that has been placed before you? 
A.	Well, to be honest with you, I think that with the few seconds I've had to look at this document, I cannot recognise it.  But when we met on Saturday you showed this document to me.  I recognise that it is the same document. 
Q.	And what is it? 
A.	I can see it is a translation -- I mean the translated copy of the speech of President Habyarimana with the date of December 1990.  This is the address which the president delivered and we have the translated copy here. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'd ask that that be admitted as D. NZ731. 
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I'm sorry.  I don't understand.  This witness did not offer the document, so I do not see why it has been admitted through him.  And he said he does not recognise the document.  It was shown to him when he met with Defence counsel, but it does not mean that he recognised the document. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, General Bizimungu testified that he had been present at the time the speech was given and he recognised it as a translation of the text of that speech, so I believe that there's enough foundation to have the document admitted. 
MR. SENDZE:
I think if we want to ask the witness exactly what President Habyarimana said, we can do that and we would have his testimony on the record.  We do not see that this is probative of anything, so we object to its admission. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, that would be a departure from a practice of admitting exhibits.  But if you want him to read the whole speech here for the next 15 or 20 minutes, we can do that.  But I think it's been our practice to admit the document and quote from the parts of it that are relevant. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we think this speech should be admitted.  There is a question we wanted to ask:  Was the speech shown to the Prosecutor before?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  It's number 1 in our packet of exhibits distributed on the 4th of February. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is its authenticity being challenged?  Or is it just the issue as to why the witness could authenticate it?  
MR. SENDZE:
Yes, we're not challenging the authenticity of the document.  We just have a problem with it being admitted through this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We're admitting it because the witness specifically said that this is a translation of the speech of the president, so we think he has provided a foundation for admitting it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, at the top of the document, it says traduction, which means translation.  I mean the witness is basically reading the document to basically identify it as the translation.  It's not a 
	major issue.  It doesn't hurt the Prosecution case.  

But we're up to 700 exhibits from Nzirorera's team and 400 from the Prosecution.  How does this help Mr. Robinson's case or this Court in weighing the issues and finding facts?  

I don't really see the value of admitting this speech.  And the witness, as my colleague suggested, can tell us what he remembers of importance of the speech, and that would be much more helpful than padding the record.  

I mean the Prosecution has put in a lot of documents as well.  I'm not suggesting that we also haven't admitted substantial numbers of exhibits.  But we're getting to the point where we can't even keep track of them now.  We were using an exhibit.  I didn't even realise it had been admitted previously.  So that's my concern really. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We -- we think it's relevant.

And, Mr. Robinson, it's not only your colleagues behind you who are interested in language issues.  Do you have the document from which this was translated?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, Mr. President.  I don't.  It would be -- the original was presumably in Kinyarwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would it be translated in French?  There has been no French translation.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, this is the only document I have. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I believe this document is in French.  So I -- it's only the English that we don't have. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have the other French translation?  
MR. SENDZE:
Yes, Mr. President.  The document is in French.  We do have a French translation, but we don't have an English translation. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
So I think a speech was given in Kinyarwanda and it was translated into French and we don't have any further translation.  That's the situation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Judge Kam thought he was making a point for his own benefit, but he's really making a point for my own benefit. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's right. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.

Well, we admit the document. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, General Bizimungu, directing your attention to the fourth page of that document, there's a portion which is in brackets with a star next to it.  I would appreciate it if you could slowly read those -- that small portion so that it can be interpreted into English and we can all understand what 
	President Habyarimana said about that particular topic.  
MR. SENDZE:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  An exhibit number was not assigned. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa, could you update?  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document is D. NZ731.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ731 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So can you read page 4 of the bracketed portion for us.  
A.	"Rwanda, our dear fatherland, the fatherland of the Banyarwanda.  Rwanda is Batutsi, Batwa and Bahutu.  Every morning as the flag is hoisted, we are reminded by the national anthem that Rwanda belongs to all Rwandans, Tutsi, Twa and Hutu.  That is the Rwanda for which we must fight, the Rwanda which we must build.  Wars such as these raise serious problems.  We shall be answerable to history as to the manner in which we defended our fatherland.  That is what I wanted to remind you of today, by reiterating that all Rwandans have bestowed their confidence in you and in us.  They support you and are reassured that you will resolutely defend them in all circumstances.  Even those youths on the hills want to join you." 
Q.	Thank you very much, General Bizimungu.  

Now, as a result of the attack of 1990 -- of October 1990 by the RPF, was there any effect upon relations among the ethnic groups in Rwanda? 
A.	There was a real impact, but one needs to revisit the historical background to be able to talk about that impact.  Unfortunately, I am not very conversant with history, or I am not a strong historian.  

All I can tell you is in relation to my own personal experience.  At war school I had to study the history of the Rwandan armed forces.  And in so doing, I became familiar with some of these things.  
In 1959 -- or, should I say, before 1959 the regime in Rwanda was the monarchy.  Then there was political change in 1959 and the first elections took place in the early '60s, or, rather, in 1960.  And so in '61 -- or, rather, was it '62, the monarchy had been overthrown and a republic was born.  

So the monarchy was the system under which the Tutsis had overriding power.  With the birth of the republic those who supported the monarchy fled to Rwanda's neighbouring countries:  Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi and Congo, as it was known then.
(Pages 1 to 19 by Melissa Hook)



































1015H
THE WITNESS (continued):  
These people organised themselves to reconquer or recapture power in Rwanda.  So from 1959 up to the time of the independence those who were known as the monarchists, called the Inyenzi, conducted incursions into Rwanda which had an impact on ethnic groups.  

So this war by the Inyenzi continued until 1968.  I do not know what the reasons were, and whether they were extenuated or not, I do not know, but from 1968 they froze their attacks on the country.  

Then in 1972, when Grégoire Kayibanda was the president of Rwanda, what happened was that there was unrest, inter-ethnic unrest in the neighbouring Burundi.  Allow me to recall that Burundi and Rwanda have similar ethnic compositions in terms of ethnicity, and we also share a common history in terms of Belgian colonisation.  This made it possible for the monarchy, which was the preserve of one ethnic group, to be affected both in Rwanda and in Burundi.  

So in 1972, with the outbreak of the events in Burundi, such events spread right to Rwanda, sparking ethnic tensions in Rwanda and obliging, so to speak, part of the Rwandan citizens to again flee out of the country.  These internal problems within Rwanda led President Habyarimana to overthrow Kayibanda in 1973.  From 1973 to 1990, I believe that the necessary documentation is there to prove this point.  

From 1973 to 1990 Rwanda became a haven of peace where all ethnic groups experienced peace and had a breath of fresh air, particularly in respect of the Tutsis, who had not had any breathing space since 1959.  So the Tutsis began to prosper in all secteurs and actually welcomed 
Habyarimana's government.  

Then in 1990 the RPF attacked, and, in spite of their claims, they did not in any way mislead anybody because they were simply continuing their ambitions of 1962, '63 and '64, to the extent that it was the sons of those Inyenzis who had attacked.  

So in spite of the several years of peace, 17 years of peace actually, under the Habyarimana regime, the invasion of the country in 1990 was going to open up scars, scars from the era of the monarchy and scars relating to attack by the Inyenzi on the inhabitants of Rwanda.  

So just when people were beginning to forget those pains, just when people were beginning to live in harmony, then this happened.  And even those who were opposed to Habyarimana would say that, yes, indeed, Rwanda had become a model country in the region and that it was prospering prior to the 1990 attacks.  So what happened, therefore, is that the injury of the past was revisited by the attacks of the Inyenzi and then, here and there, tensions -- the ugly head of tension sprawled again here and there.  

But President Habyarimana used his political weight to do his level best to control or check these emotional outbursts.  By the way, he was a political heavyweight.  He was loved by the people in spite of the false propaganda, the propaganda whereby Habyarimana was portrayed as a dictator and as a tired leader.  He was respected by the people.  He was loved by the people, Hutu and Tutsi alike.  But, again, propaganda, as you all know -- most of you have held high position in your countries -- you know what the negative impact of propaganda can be.  And this is what led to the reality of our experience as it was at the time.  

What I am saying is that the 1990 war was not necessary because the claims that were put forward were being dealt with.  So, unfortunately, this war reopened a can of worms, a problem that has persisted in Rwanda and which persists to this day, the problem of ethnicity.  Whether we accept it or not, whether we criticise it or not, it is an authentic problem.  It is a genuine problem.  All those who know, those who look into this matter, even expats, they know that this problem has not been solved and it will not be solved until people stop playing hide-and-seek and address the really -- the real substance of the Rwandan problem.  

What I am saying, therefore, that the 1990 attack, which was unnecessary, brought in negative impacts as the RPF continued to conduct incursions and attacks into country -- into the country, and this more so because the RPF had its own policies or positions whereby it attempted to use that political factor to its advantage.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, General Bizimungu, you told us that you returned to Ruhengeri in late January 1991.  What was it that caused you to return there?  
A.	In the night of the 22nd to the 23rd of January 1991, the RPF opened a battle front at Ruhengeri.  This front was already there in November, I believe, because in November 1990 I was not there yet.  It was at that time that the Ruhengeri secteur operational command was set up for Ruhengeri to deal with the threat from the enemy, particularly.  

You see, anyone who attacks the country can be referred to as the enemy by the country.  And, by the way, they too referred to those whom they were attacking as the enemy.  

So in that night of the 22nd to the 23rd of January 1991, Ruhengeri town was attacked and occupied by the RPF for an initial 48-hour period.  Then on the 25th, when I arrived in Ruhengeri, the RPF had not been entirely chased -- chased out of the city.  
My battalion was given a mission, and when we got to Ruhengeri, there were other battalions in place, including the paracommando battalion which was already there.  Our mission was to defend the integrity of the territory from Ruhengeri.  So I had to quickly return because the RPF had taken over the city of Ruhengeri.  
Q.	And had people been killed by the RPF in that attack? 
A.	Yes, absolutely, yes.  From October 1990 when the RPF attacked, it did not only target military positions, it also attacked the population.  But the problem became more acute following the defeat in Mutara.  The RPF would go on to open war fronts in inhabited areas.  You see, Mutara was not a very highly inhabited area because of the national park.  But the attack of Ruhengeri would be an attack on populated areas, and, in the course of that attack, the RPF killed some members of the population.  Some people were abducted, and others were taken to be used as carriers for food and luggage and what have you.  

The simple answer to your question is that when the R -- yes, when the RPF attacked Ruhengeri, people were killed.  
Q.	Did the RPF go to the Ruhengeri prison during that attack? 
A.	Yes.  The attack on Ruhengeri became famous; that is, the January 1991 attack became famous, because the prison was -- the doors of the prison were thrown open.  The prison was also known as one where prisoners of political opinion were held.  Biseruka, Lizinde, Muvunanyambo and others were released or taken away from that prison by the RPF, including other prisoners who were taken away by the RPF, and yet many more would be scattered all over the country.  But they were subsequently picked up by the competent services. 
Q.	And how did the attack of January 1991 affect security in Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	The targets of the RPF attacks included the préfet of Ruhengeri, who narrowly escaped, and I think that the gendarmes who were guarding him were killed at that time.  I also recall, I think, that one of his sons was wounded.  Clearly, people fled out of the town of Ruhengeri.  When I say people of 
	Ruhengeri town, I'm referring also to people from Kinigi and Kigombe communes who had to flee to other communes.  

I only found out later on, through the media, that there had been tensions and that people had attacked each other, that the Bagogwe in that area, following the RPF attack, were affected and that people avenged themselves, or revenged, in the midst of all these activities.  

But it is a very complex issue, because even before the 1990 attack rumours had it that some Rwandans had left the country to join an organisation which was planning to attack Rwanda.  This was not being said openly, but what happened was that with the 1990 attacks some members of some families would go to join the Inkotanyi and these mysterious disappearances raised suspicion within the inhabitants.  And so when the town came under attack and people were killed by the RPF, most unfortunately, some reprisals were carried out and a number of persons were killed.  

I do not have the relevant data and, as you would see from my experience, I was involved in fighting and warding off the attacks and there were other services that were involved in dealing with the other problems that were faced by the population.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, General Bizimungu.
MR. ROBINSON:
Would you like to take our morning recess, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you.  Thank you.  It's just about time.  We'll rise for 15 minutes.

(Court resumed at 1100H) 
MR. SENDZE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Before Mr. Robinson continues, during the break, we were able to obtain an English version of D. NZ731, which is the speech of President Habyarimana.  So I'll hand that to Mr. Issa.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson has seen it?

Have you seen it, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I haven't seen it, Mr. President.  But I'm satisfied that they're not going to slip a phony document in on me.  So I appreciate the efforts of the Prosecution to obtain the translation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, now can you tell us:  What was the military situation in Ruhengeri préfecture from -- after the RPF attack of January 1991 up until January of 1993?
A.	What I can say is that in the Ruhengeri operational sector, the military situation has always been very tense.  After Ruhengeri town had been liberated, the Rwandan armed forces in the sector were confronted with the RPF which had backtracked to the area of the volcanoes.  It took us several months to dislodge the RPF from there.  

Having taken advantage of the ceasefire that was signed in N'sele in March -- I don't recall the exact date on which the N'sele ceasefire agreement was signed -- we were under the belief that the RPF would respect the ceasefire, but it violated it by attacking and attempting to recapture Ruhengeri.

We stopped them, and then they returned to the volcanoes, and we chased them and booted them out of that area once and for all in May, or was it June 1991.  From that time on, part of our troops were permanently stationed on the volcanoes, right up to the summit of the volcano.  

In the meantime, it must be said that the Ruhengeri operational sector is a vast area covering all the area of the volcanoes and also part of the Kidaho commune neighbouring Uganda and 
Butaro commune as well.  When the RPF did not attack from the area of the volcanoes, it tried on several occasions to penetrate -- that is, when it did not attack from the area of the volcanoes, the RPF launched several attacks from Rwanda -- from Uganda, rather, obviously, through Kidaho commune.  That kept us very busy throughout 1991.  And the same obtained for Butaro commune where attacks from Uganda were launched.   
So we had permanently before us attempts by the RPF and reconnaissance activities -- attempts to attack by the RPF and reconnaissance activities which we warded off in 1991.  The same situation applied to 1992 which, I must say, was a particularly atrocious year when we look at the RPF incursions, particularly in the Butaro area.  The RPF intensified its offensive, particularly in the month of March 1992.

What happened is that in April of 1992, a significant change -- a significant political change occurred in the country.  On the 16th of April '92, a multiparty government which had almost been set up on the 31st of January 1991 but which was at that time boycotted by political parties -- what happened is that at that time then a transitional government, a coalition government, was put in place on the 
16th of April 1992 headed by Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye of the MDR party.  Five political parties were involved -- MRND, MDR, PSD, and what have you.  I am sure you know all about that transitional government.

The purpose of the transitional government was to conduct direct negotiations with the RPF.  This does not mean that there had not been other attempts to negotiate with the RPF before that time.  However, the multiparty government, which included parties that were opposed to Habyarimana and his MRND party, said that their priority was to conduct the negotiations.  Unfortunately, I am not here to quarrel with or wonder about how the multiparty politics worked.

Unfortunately, there was disharmony.  There was disagreement, and some felt that they could join the enemy to fight Habyarimana; that is, within the same government there were people who thought that they could join or support the RPF and still work within the same government or against the government.  But that is not what we are concerned about now.

What matters is that when the coalition government announced that negotiations were going to take place including various stakeholders -- American diplomacy, French diplomacy, Belgium, and many other countries that supported the idea of negotiations -- it is at that time that the RPF intensified its attacks in Butaro commune in April and May and, in so doing, had a head start on the negotiations, should I say.

Now, I think your question was quite specific.  But allow me to say that the RPF also attacked Byumba in June 1992, and I am stretching my answer to cover this area.  There was some kind of a lull when a ceasefire agreement was signed on the 12th of July 1992 under the auspices of the coalition government headed by the late Boniface Ngulinzira following the first negotiations that had started here in Arusha in June of 1992.

The idea was to have a truce in place up to the 31st of July 1992.  But between the 12th of July -- and it must have been on the 26th of July I think -- the RPF attacked our positions in Butaro and violated the truce.  This was a difficult problem for us because almost the entire Butaro commune was captured in July of 1992.  After those games the RPF pretended to agree with the implementation of the 
ceasefire agreement.  We then availed ourselves of that period to reorganise ourselves, so to speak, and also to think through a number of issues.

That is how it happened that in November '92 the minister of defence known as James Gasana set up a commission of officers made up of the sector commanders essentially to brainstorm and make recommendations that could be useful to the coalition government.  We submitted our report to the minister of defence in the second half of November 1992 I believe.

In the meantime, the Arusha negotiations were ongoing.  The first protocol was signed in August relating to the state of law, and I think the second on power sharing was signed in October 1993.  And the idea of merging the armed forces was still on the table for negotiations.

I do clearly remember that phase of the negotiations because, on the other hand, following a decision of the council of ministers, I had been appointed military advisor to the presidency of the republic, a position which I never took up.  I never took up that position, but it was a position in which I was expected to have accompanied James Gasana, the minister of defence, in the delegation that would have been involved in the military negotiations.

When I arrived Kigali, the chief of staff of the army, then Colonel Nsabimana -- I think he was a colonel at the time -- he told me, "Well, Augustin, you can go back to Ruhengeri because the situation is such that you will not travel to Arusha."

I did not believe him.  He had asked me to go back to Ruhengeri, and I felt somewhat frustrated.  But I went to see the minister of defence who told me, "Oh, so you are already here.  Are you ready?" 

And I said, "Yes, I am."

And he said, "No.  I'm asking you whether you are ready to go back to Ruhengeri."  And I told him, no.  I was ready to go with him to Arusha.  And he said, "I have told the chief of staff to tell you to return to Ruhengeri because the situation is such that we cannot let you be absent from Ruhengeri."

So I returned to Ruhengeri in January 1993, and that is where I had a close brush with death almost.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us what would happen -- what would members of the population do when the RPF attacked an area?  What was the reaction of members of the population?
A.	Flee. 
Q.	And was there a project of civil defence that was begun to try to stop the population from fleeing? 
A.	Well, I am sorry, Counsel.  The measures to be implemented were not such as to stop the population from fleeing.  Why?  Because from the time of the invasion by the RPF in October 1990 when it was observed that the RPF was killing members of the population, a number of measures were taken simply as survival measures to organise inhabitants to conduct patrols and rounds with a view, on the 
	one hand, maybe to alert the armed forces in the area of any impending danger; or secondly, to tell the population to take the necessary measures to make timely escapes or to flee in a timely manner.  So those measures were not intended to fight or to open a front using the population against the RPF.

There is a history, a longstanding history, that goes with those measures, particularly in respect of the Inyenzi incursions in the '60s.  As I stated, at that time there were rounds and patrols that were organised by the population using spears and whatever they could use at the time.  So this system was somewhat replicated when the RPF invaded in October 1990.  

Almost across the entire country those measures were put in place but would vary according to the intensity of the threat.  Where the threat was low, the measures would not be stringent, and the reverse would happen.  And if there was no threat, the measures might simply have been taken away.

So what happened is that the inhabitants who were in direct contact with the attacker made a number of claims or requests to the effect that "We are here.  We are conducting these patrols and night rounds, and it would be unfortunate if an RPF infiltrator or combatant found us somewhere.  And although we know that the armed forces, the Rwandan armed forces, cannot be present across the country to check such infiltrations, if they found us, then we should be able to deal with the situation."

And that is how the various authorities insisted on requesting for assistance in support of the self-defence or self-protecting measures for the population.  I know very well that the first administrative unit which asked for strengthening the organisation on the ground with the population was from -- was the Mutara préfectoral council, which worked with the commander of the Mutara sector which -- to table a number of requests which were forwarded to the competent authorities.   

The préfet of Byumba and also the préfet of Ruhengeri also proceeded in a similar manner.  That is how those initial self-protection measures for the population came into place.  But the concept has been exaggerated and given a scope that really is not its own.  The population, members of the population, was involved in these activities.  

But the préfet of the préfectures that I have mentioned then went on to ask for support from the government by way of providing resources for the communal police to be strengthened and to work in collaboration with a number of selected and trained inhabitants who would then work in providing proper monitoring for the night patrols.  That's it.  
Q.	Thank you, General Bizimungu.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the registrar can show the general document number 5 in my packet which is a letter dated the 20th of January 1992 from the minister of the interior.   
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, do you recognise that document? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	What is it? 
A.	It is a fax message from the minister of the interior to the préfet of Byumba and Ruhengeri which contains information -- or, rather, with the minister of defence, the general staff of the Rwandan army and EMAR, and the general staff of the national gendarmerie.  It is forwarded to these three for information.  The minister Faustin Munyazesa is a signatory of this document which is dated 
	20 January 1992.  In fact, this is a message which contains a decision whereby 300 weapons would be made available to the Byumba and Ruhengeri préfectures, 300 for the two préfectures.  So this is the information contained in this fax from the minister of the interior to the two préfets. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ732.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ732 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, under this programme of distribution of weapons, who was it who was in charge of distributing the weapons, and who were the members of the population who received them?
A.	The content of the message speaks clearly for itself as you can see.  The minister of defence placed at the disposal of the ministry of the interior 300 guns.  Instructions were given to the préfet.  And you may know that the préfet is the first or highest official at the préfectoral level.  

I do not know whether this issue has been dealt with sufficiently here because you may want 
to know that in spite of the war that was raging in Rwanda, we never had a state of emergency.  
And, therefore, the administrative services functioned normally.  The Byumba, Ruhengeri and 
Kibungo préfectures - Kibungo, I may want to point out, was also at war at that time in 1992.
Those préfets in those préfectures were in charge of the administration.  They were the ones who managed the préfectures pursuant to the law that sets up préfectures and outlines the various duties of the préfecture.  Under that law, the préfet is responsible for security in the préfecture.  And in order to accomplish that duty, he is assisted by a number of organs including the préfectoral security council.  In this particular case, the minister of the interior wrote to the officials who are the préfet.  

May I have a copy of that document, please.  

I do not know whether I have not addressed part of your question, Counsel.  Please kindly guide me as to which question you want me to answer.  Guide me only as far as the questions go because you will not guide me when it comes to my answers.   
Q.	Okay.  Well, my next question is whether the political parties had anything to do with the distribution of weapons or the civil defence.
A.	No, but let me clarify one thing.  We have here before us a document from the ministry -- from the minister of the interior which states that 300 guns should be distributed to the population.  And this is where the problem arises.  I think there are about 800,000 inhabitants in Byumba or about a million at the time and a similar figure for Ruhengeri préfecture.

Without exaggerating, one could then say that there were around 1,700,000 inhabitants in those two préfectures.  When the minister of the interior and government accordingly, since the two ministers are part of government, when the minister makes such a decision, people should not start screaming as loudly as they can that the entire community has been armed.

Calculate for yourself.  Three hundred guns for more than 1.7 million inhabitants.  How many guns would how many inhabitants have?  By simple calculation, you can find the answer yourself.  So those weapons -- I believe the Ruhengeri préfecture received about half of that figure and Byumba préfecture about half of the figure too.

So it was the duty of the préfet to manage those weapons taking into account the nature of the threat it was facing.  That is why all the inhabitants of Ruhengeri -- or all the communes in Ruhengeri will not receive arms.  They would be sent to Kinigi, Mumba, Kidaho, Butaro, and Cyeru specifically.  

And the weapons, furthermore, will not be distributed directly to the inhabitants.  When the préfet would have discussed with the relevant services and decided to give 30 guns to Kidaho commune, it was then for the bourgmestre to manage the situation.  Although the guns are for the service of the population, they are not intended to be distributed to individuals like Bizimungu or what have you.

The idea is to make available those weapons to the commune for the interest of the commune.  And this is where the confusion arises.  I want to make this clear so that when you come across a document like this one, you should not rush to the conclusion that this is the genocide and this is this, and this is that.  Whereas, the measure was taken for legitimate self-defence when a country was seeking to put in place efficient or inefficient measures towards the protection of its population.   

Now you have raised the issue of political parties.  This document -- this document from the minister of the interior -- this document from the minister of the interior to the préfets of Byumba and Ruhengeri really -- really, the purpose of the message is very clear.  There is no reference to political parties, to any political party in this document.

In any event, this document is available.  It is in the government archives, and when the coalition government was set up in 1992 under Nsengiyaremye, I do remember that a council of ministers held in the month of May 1992 at which, more or less, similar measures were adopted including curfews, checks and controls and what have you -- I do very well know that the council of ministers also held in 1992 chaired by Nsengiyaremye, after Byumba was attacked, which noted that the security of the population had come under attack and, therefore, called on the population to organise itself in self-defence.  

At that time the government was made up of several parties.  And if those measures were adopted, it was not along party lines but, rather, within the context of multiparty governance which had nothing to do with political parties as such. 

So that is why, while the war was raging between political parties in Kigali, while some were accusing others of this and that, people availed themselves of various opportunities.  And while some saw Interahamwe across the country, it must be noted that in Ruhengeri Interahamwe was non-existent.  But it is most unfortunate that there was manipulation at that time for political interests and that, unfortunately, that manipulation has gone as far as reaching other institutions where it should ordinarily not have taken place.   
Q.	Can you tell us what happened in February 1993.
A.	Yes.  The RPF violated the ceasefire which was in force since the 1st of August 1992 signed on the 12th of July but in power first in 1992.  The RPF unilaterally broke the ceasefire.  It carried out a wide-scale attack covering the entire war front with a particular emphasis on the town of Ruhengeri and between Ruhengeri and Byumba.  

I'm referring to the Byumba préfecture where there was an attack going right up to the 
Kigali-rural préfecture.  That attack was launched on the 8th of February and brought down a lot in terms of casualties, caused a lot of talk, a lot of ink.  In fact, that's an attack which would be -- would remain in the minds of Rwandans for many, many, many years.   
Q.	Can you tell us approximately how many people were displaced as a result of that attack and where they went.
A.	Well, I would say many, but I will restrain myself from stating figures, figures which I did not personally cross-check and which -- for which I would say many because people say many.  

I was at the heart of the fighting.  I saw people, many, many people, running helter-skelter, displaced persons that I saw many of them, including those in Nyakyunga but also concerning the 
Ruhengeri secteur, the Mumba, Kinigi, Kidaho communes, which -- because initially until the attack of the 8th of February, we had control.  We had things in hand right as far as the borders of the communes including Mukingo, Kinigi, Mumba and Kidaho.  

The commune that we lost was the Butaro commune.  As I said, with the pressure of March and May until 1992, we lost that commune.  At this time with the attack of the 8th of February, we lost further grounds involving Cyeru commune, Nyarutovu commune, part of the Ruhondo commune and virtually the entirety of the Nyamugali commune and all these persons who were now coming behind us as displaced persons,and, of course, they were being taken care of by the persons who were in charge.  It is not the commander of sector.  The sector commander had other fish to fry.  He had other things to do.  Then they were in terrible, disgusting conditions.  

This is not something you wanted to look into.  But of course, by Byumba and Kigali, I can assure you the 8th February attack came as far as the rural -- Kigali-rural.  There were many camps including -- the one that is known as the Nyacyonga camp where there was no one, but where there was about -- so many people.  Some even quote one million.  

But even the figures which are given later and which are actually manipulated were -- unfortunately, these figures are swollen depending on the interests of all and sundry.  I don't want to really delve into these figures, but there were other camps.  For example, you have the Rutare-Tumba camp.  I know that place very, very well for the simple reason that I went there from time to time to visit close relatives who were there.  There were many camps of displaced persons.

Now, this was the consequence of the attack of 8th February which would give a semblance of balance with the ceasefire that was signed in Arusha in 1992.  
Q.	And after this attack of February 1993, were there also some reprisals taken against Tutsi civilians within Rwanda? 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we still have a brief break at this point.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  No problem.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll just rise for a few minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1143H to 1147H) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, I had asked you if there were any reprisals taken against Tutsi civilians after the 1993 attack by the RPF. 
A.	I think we should say that, in the situation in which I found myself, I was not in a position to know exactly that which was happening.  But a few days after the attack, when, first of all, I was besieged for virtually four days in my headquarters, the RPF had come as far as below the mountain that overhung my headquarters.  

We took four days to clear the headquarters.  We took some time to clear the helm in which we had taken by -- in the town until March and until the date on which the ceasefire was signed, I was really in a tense atmosphere.  Whatever the case, I knew later that attempts about reprisals were alleged to have taken place in the Mukingo commune.   

And at that time the authorities of the Ruhengeri préfecture, with the help of the security services, had stepped in.  And I think the gendarmerie had succeeded in protecting some families in the 
agricultural institute of Busogo.  

Well, I think -- with that said, I think there was an attempt of reprisals.  And a few persons may have been killed at the time.  And if there's a document which states that, it may be authentic.  But that attempt did not end up in a bloodbath.   
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the witness could be shown Exhibit D. NZ82. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, this is a communiqué that has been admitted into evidence from all of the political parties dated on the 2nd of March 1993.  And I want to call your attention to paragraph number 6 in which the political parties invited the government to organise the civil defence.  

Do you recall that event, and can you tell us whether or not the project of civil defence continued after the attack of February 1993?  
A.	Well, after everything -- I'm sorry, but I am bothered by the term or coinage "civil defence" because there is the risk of misinterpreting the issue.  I talked about measures.  Now, these were measures to protect the population.  Now, you call it civil defence but please.  We should not mix it up with civil defence which we understand it classically in countries like France, Switzerland, like military defence in Belgium.

Artists in misinformation use civil defence -- a coinage or an expression which was maybe naively used but without a mastery of the significance or the purport of the term when you go beyond the ordinary.  And with that said, we also cannot talk about civil defence without lending to its historical background.

With the war of 1990, the first who reacted and who asked that the country should organise the population for its defence in training its military and providing the necessary wherewithal was a 
think tank of university lecturers in Butare.  

Of course, it is true that this was in relationship with the invasion that took place on the 
1st of October 1990.  And everybody -- well, with Uganda breathing down our necks, there was a feeling that the country was going to be overrun.  And so they had suggested that the civil defence be put in place.  

Well, it was a thought or reflection which was finally -- which never really was implemented.  I also talked to you about an initiative that was provided by a commander of Mutara in collaboration with the préfectoral committee in charge of security in Ngarama.  I also talked to you about unrelenting appeals from the préfet of Byumba and Ruhengeri.

Now -- well, is that what you're referring to as civil defence?  I don't recall.  Was it these measures that are called as civil defence, measures taken in the neighbourhoods in Kigali just to fight against insecurity?  Because these measures were taken everywhere, in all neighbourhoods where the 
quarter head would organise nocturnal rounds as we are going to see later when we come to the 6th of April 1994.

So if the political parties -- at this time with those who were quoting the RPF because now this had to do with all political parties.  If they ask that the government should organise the population into civil defence, then that civil defence did not exist.  It did not exist.  Except we want to consider that it existed in the areas -- in the areas of fighting.

But it was really a consequence of the encroachments of the RPF and was not organised as civil defence.  So it was not civil defence because this was going to be projected much later by the Kambanda government.  So the terms were used there but with a poor mastery of the subject.  And I find that the expression "civil defence" -- and called that way, and the civil defence which we share and which was expressed or desired by the political parties did not exist. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the witness can be shown document P. 284.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I beg your pardon -- I beg your pardon, but please.  I do not know whether Defence counsel will revisit this issue.  But if you permit me, I wish to make a brief comment on the document which we just looked into, the document regarding political parties.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  It's fine with me, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may do so.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The document in question by political parties -- I see it is dated 2nd March.  On the 2nd of March 1993, we are under pressure exerted by the RPF.  Now, the RPF is virtually -- virtually in Kigali, just 30 kilometres away from Kigali, everybody is sensitised about the looming danger and the capacity for destruction and the power of the RPF.

Now, the political speech changes.  It varies.  And this time it is no longer the propaganda that had been bandaged during the period of multipartyism.  It is clear that everybody's in danger.  But there is something that happens on the 7th of March 1993.  It is the signing of the peace agreement from 
Dar es Salaam -- in Dar es Salaam, that is signed between two important personalities.  Kanyarengwe, the president of the RPF on the RPF side, and Nsengiyaremye, Dismas, the prime minister, are representing the Rwandan government.

Now, according to the clauses of the recent ceasefire, the last ceasefire, because that was the last, it is clearly stipulated that all measures -- well, there are documents to that effect.  An end is put to all the measures regarding arming the population which -- even though I explained that this was an abusive use of the term and any other programme.  And even all ordinary military recruitments were frozen.  And so the political will of political parties -- and this should be pointed out -- should never -- was never transmitted into reality.  And that is what I thought I should add, Mr. President.

So with respect to the ceasefire of 17th March 1993, the will expressed by the political parties and also expressed by many organs was never implemented.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  If you look at the document that has now been placed before you, document P. 284, can you tell us if you recognise that document and tell us what it is.   
A.	Well, this document -- I came in contact with this document right here at the Tribunal.  And on reading the document, after analysis of the document, I noticed that it was a document from the ministry of defence from a service that was in charge of armaments.  

It is a memo addressed to the director in charge of intelligence and external security, a document signed on page 2 by the head of the armaments division at the ministry of defence.  Yes.  This document -- I saw it.  I found that -- I found it a very interesting document.   
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber the contents of the document.  
A.	Well, in broad strokes, the head of the armaments division at the ministry of defence is informing his boss about the situation on the distribution of weapons.  As a matter of fact -- and there are things that I got to learn a posteriori, things I have already painted to you, the deadly situation in which I found myself after the attack of the 8th of February.   

But after I saw this document and with information that was coming to me, I found that it was interesting.  It was said that after the 8th February attack, an attack which happened in Ruhengeri and in Mukingo -- the attack was unfolding further on towards the west and heading towards 
	Mukamira camp and also towards Gisenyi.   

The MINADEF authorities who were on site at the time decided to provide some communes in Gisenyi, maybe four of them which were bordering to Zaire and Uganda, I believe -- they decided to equip them with a number of guns.  And so there was -- how do we put this.  There was some controversies around these weapons, and the government council decided about the distribution of these weapons.

And so that's exactly what this memo from the head of division is addressing and explaining -- explaining to his boss, particularly, the situation in Gisenyi.  At the same time this struck me because -- well, I am not -- I have not -- on my own trial here.  I am not trying to make this my business, but I'm just trying -- what about the case -- this struck me because it was noted that weapons had been distributed within the Ruhengeri préfecture and so on and so forth.  But this memo, this note, which I see is dated 10th March 1993 -- it is probably in the month of March 1993 -- point number 3, attracted my attention very deeply.  And here it is said -- 

And if you permit me, Mr. President, can I read this point number 3 in order to better expatiate thereupon.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
So after having given the situation reining within the Gisenyi commune that in some communes weapons had been recovered, point number 3 states -- it was another point which the author of the document is raising.  The préfet of Ruhengeri requested a loan of 80 G3 guns to renew or replace the posse of weapons within the framework of the strengthening of communal police of Kigombe, Ruhondo, Mukingo, Nkuli, and Cyabingo and then mention -- it is mentioned within the same framework, the préfet of Byumba also asked for about 30 guns to equip his -- the communal police.

This deduction was supposed to be done from the remainder of arms that had been recovered from some communes of Gisenyi.  But the refusal of the bourgmestre of Karago did not make this possible.  Furthermore, it is not fair to withdraw arms from one commune to hand them over to another commune.

Weapons which were successfully recovered were transferred to the headquarters of the Rwandan army for further instructions.  It is difficult to lend them out because they are not at the disposal of the department for intelligence and external security.  There's another interesting point.  Maybe I'll begin by commenting on these that I just read.   

Now this attracts my attention and leads me to state, Your Honours, that the Ruhengeri préfecture had at its helm a préfet who had control.  He held things in sway, and he was leading the 
Ruhengeri préfecture as attested by this memo and as attested by the document which recommended on the 20th of January concerning the 300 guns and as attested by other documents which, unfortunately, we do not have in our keeping now, which we do not have in our possession because we cannot find them, but these documents exist.   

And so -- and this point is a very important point for the simple reason that people would spread information that there is a small group led by Nzirorera made up of Bizimungu, Augustin; 
Setako, Ephrem; and others -- he named them -- who were going to rise and do what they feel, go to the Mukingo commune.  I don't even know what is there.  There's no gold in Mukingo commune, but they're going to hold meetings.  They're going to distribute weapons.

And all of this -- in all this there is no sign of any intellectual honesty.  We are supposed to ask what's happening in this Ruhengeri préfecture as it is not being led.  And so with all the propaganda being used, unfortunately, I don't know what happens.   
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, turning away from the official documents of how organisation of arms was handled by the préfectoral authorities, I want to ask you some questions about evidence that has been adduced in our case from Prosecution witnesses.

So first of all, can you tell us whether or not you ever attended any meetings at the Mukingo commune office from January of 1991 until you went into exile.
A.	No, as far as I can recall really, no. 
Q.	Did you ever address the officials or population of Mukingo commune and suggest that Interahamwe be trained and armed so that they could exterminate Tutsis? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  Before the witness answers that question, could Mr. Robinson break it down into 
	two or three parts because he could give one answer, and we don't know exactly what he's denying.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
 (Pages 24 to 37 by Kelly Surina)



























1215H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	First of all, did you ever address the population of Mukingo commune -- or its authorities and suggest that the Interahamwe of Mukingo be trained? 
A.	Counsel, I am somewhat uncomfortable if I were to say no, but I would seek the indulgence of the Trial Chamber to talk a little more about the Interahamwe.  I feel very uncomfortable with this.  
Q.	Okay.  Go ahead.  
A.	Interahamwe, what is the Interahamwe?  Someone needs to tell me who the Interahamwe are.  Is there a distinction to be made between the members of the public and the Interahamwe?  Are we accepting the same propaganda format which claims that the entire population was made up of Interahamwe, or do we agree with the position that all those who were not for the RPF were Interahamwe?  

Did those organisations exist?  I don't know.  So I feel a little bit uncomfortable because my answer can only be no, but at the same time I must refute, or I must draw the attention of the Court to the fact that I need to be clarified on -- on -- on this matter of the Interahamwe.  I am familiar with my case file.  Maybe it is not the same concept that is being referred to here in this trial.  So my question is, what does Interahamwe refer to in this particular trial? 
Q.	Prior to -- prior to the death of President Habyarimana, were you aware of any group of youths in Mukingo who were claiming to be Interahamwe? 
A.	It is really with a lot of pain that I am going to answer you.  I might disappoint you, but all I can say is that I do not know.  I was not a party to the organisation of political parties.  I was sort of an outsider to all of that.  

Well, several parties had militants or supporters in Ruhengeri and elsewhere and there may have been many members of political parties in Ruhengeri, but what I know about Ruhengeri is that there were 
two major parties in Ruhengeri, the MRND and the MDR.  The MDR -- which was mainly active in Nyamugali, Nyarutovu, Nyakinama communes and what have you, and so I do not say that it was the dominant party.  What I'm saying is that the MDR was also present in other areas of Ruhengeri préfecture.  

I am aware that Colonel Bangamwabo who was -- or former -- an ex-colonel at the time, the 
former director of the Rwandan development bank and all those people, I was told they were members of the MDR.  I know, for example, that in Ruhondo, there was a significant MDR presence as well.  Now, whether members of the MDR in those areas bore a name, I don't know.  

There were also MRND members.  Whether they were called Interahamwe or something else, I do not know.  I also hear that the CDR was present and the PL as well in some areas.  
So what I can say is that the names that the various political parties adopted for themselves were not issues of concern for me.  I was not concerned about them at all because I was already quite busy taking care of my soldiers.  
Q.	Okay, General Bizimungu, I'm going to ask you a series of questions about events in Mukingo commune, and I would like you to discipline yourself now during this part of the 
direct examination to answer these questions directly and try not to give too much of an explanation, unless you feel it's necessary, because they're very clear and it's not necessary to go beyond Mukingo commune in your answers.  

So we're going to start by asking you, to your knowledge, were you aware of any group of youth in Mukingo commune who held themselves out as Interahamwe?  I think you can answer that either with a yes or no, and if you need to explain, you can.  
A.	In military jargon, we will say that you have called me to order, and I thank you, Mr. Robinson.  No.  
Q.	Now, did you ever attend any meetings of authorities at the residence of the mother of Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo commune? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you ever attend any meeting of authorities at the residence of Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo commune from 1990 through to the death of the president? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, did you provide any weapons to the youth of Mukingo commune? 
A.	No.  I -- let them hang me if I did so.  
Q.	Did you know a position called Ruhehe? 
A.	Counsel, as a matter of discipline, can I expand a little bit on this particular question? 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Ruhehe is a word that I learnt during my trial.  I did not know what Ruhehe was all about when I came across it in the document.  If Ruhehe refers to that hill, which is opposite the Mukingo communal office, I am ready to answer your question.  But would you kindly repeat the question, Counsel.  
Q.	Yes.  That hill across from the Mukingo commune office that's been called Ruhehe, was there any military position there? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	When was that military position first established? 
A.	After the attack of the 8th of February, but I do not remember the exact date.  In any event, it was after the attack of the 8th of February.  

Counsel, can I say a little more than this? 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	I told you from the very beginning that we had control over the border right up to the volcanoes, but we were pushed back on the 8th of February by that attack.  In that context, the Dar es Salaam agreement of 17th March '93 states clearly that the Rwandan armed forces will remain in the newly occupied positions, that is, the positions at which we were at the time of the signing of the ceasefire, and that the RPF would return to its former positions and that the zone, between the two, will be referred to as the demilitarised zone.  

So when we were pushed back by that offensive -- or by that attack, our soldiers who were in -- on the volcanoes retreated to the extent that the battle front was not far from the Mukingo commune.  So it is within the context of realigning our positions that a position was set up on the hill opposite the Mukingo communal office.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  And can you tell us approximately how many soldiers were stationed there after the position was established in 1993.  
A.	I would say about a company, but the number of soldiers in a company could be between 
80 and 100 soldiers.  So I'm not able to give you an exact figure.
Q.	Was there a stock of weapons kept at Ruhehe? 
A.	It was an advance position, why would we stock weapons there?  You see, military positions are such that each soldier has a weapon.  Why would we have a stock of weapons there?  There was no stock of weapons.  
Q.	Thank you.  To your knowledge, was there ever any training of the youth of Mukingo commune -- military training -- prior to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Military training, what are you referring to, Counsel?  I would like us to be specific.  Are you talking about training offered by myself or by whom?  
Q.	Well, we've had testimony in this trial -- and I believe some of it was in your trial as well -- of people who claimed that the Mukingo commune office and at a building known as Isimbi, that there were training consisting of military exercises -- such as, learning how to handle a weapon and things like that.  
So can you tell us whether, to your knowledge, any of that actually occurred?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Let me start with a small comment.  I feel a little uncomfortable because I have a case in which I was accused for many things -- accused of many things, including accusations that we trained Interahamwe and what have you.  That never happened.  It is just stories.  
Q.	Now -- 
A.	It is actually just rubbish.  
Q.	Was there an expansion of the number of people -- of soldiers in the Rwandan army after the April 1990 attack? 
A.	Yes, yes, indeed.  That was one of the major challenges of that war.  The Rwandan army went from 5 million to about 30,000 in 1994.  So that was a real challenge for the army.  
Q.	And during the process of recruitment of new soldiers to join the army, were there any exercises or tests administered at the level of the communes in Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	It is sometimes difficult to answer your questions without giving you a background -- or the background against which I offer the answer.  

One, when I became the commander of the Ruhengeri operational sector, I was not in charge of recruitment for the army nor for the gendarmerie.  The commander of EGENA was the one in charge of recruitment for the gendarmerie.  The commander of Camp Mukamira continued to perform the duties of area commander, and he was the one in charge of recruitment.  

There were also other administrative matters that he was directly responsible for and answered to the chief of staff -- without referring to the sectors, including management of reserve staff and so on and so forth.  

We also have issues of deserting soldiers, and the area commander, therefore, dealt with these things and strategy.  And dealing with the adversary was among other things that had to be thought out.  
Yes, it is true that there were recruitments, and I don't think it would surprise anyone to know -- or to observe that from 1990 to 1994 -- 1994 recruitments were going on.  That shouldn't surprise anyone.  

And how was this done?  Announcements were made to the commune.  The bourgmestre informs the conseiller, and the conseiller would then inform their inhabitants.  And on a specific day, military officials appeared to conduct the tests for recruitment, and such tests included cross-country exercises and a number of other tests.  Now, if this is what was being referred to as military training, then it would be most unfortunate.  
Q.	And did the political parties have any role in the recruitment of soldiers for the army? 
A.	No.  Article 50 of the 1991 constitution provides clearly that, in order to carry out its policies, the government has available to it the armed forces.  How can the armed forces be involved in any such thing?  The answer clearly is no.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"The armed forces and political parties..." 

Correction from the interpreter.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And after the advent of the multiparty system, were officers prohibited from attending or participating in political party affairs, including rallies? 
A.	Prohibited by the law and by the constitution. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take a break at this time?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  It's time for our luncheon recess now.  We'll take the luncheon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1231H to 1410H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I spoke with Mr. Ngirumpatse's Defence team, and they've indicated that they don't have any objection to us proceeding in his absence for a discussion of the issue of the admission of the exhibits used for Kajelijeli's cross-examination.  So --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll confirm it tomorrow, but it will be -- most likely be on Wednesday afternoon.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, General Bizimungu.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel, good afternoon, Mr. President, and good afternoon to the entire Trial Chamber.  
Q.	General Bizimungu, during the multiparty period, did you ever attend a rally or meeting of the 
MRND party? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you ever attend a rally or a meeting of the CDR party? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you ever attend a fund-raising event at the Rebero hotel for the Interahamwe? 
A.	I am stunned.  Indeed, no.  
Q.	Were you ever a member of an organisation known as The Friends of the Alliance or The Dragons which had, as its objective, the extermination of the Tutsi? 
A.	No, absolutely not. 
Q.	Prior to the death of President Habyarimana, were you aware of any plan to exterminate the Tutsi? 
A.	To be candid, I know nothing, nothing, nothing about what you are referring to.  So nothing.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, I want to talk to you about the events after the death of President Habyarimana, and so I would like to ask you, first of all, where you were when you learned of President Habyarimana's death.  
A.	I was at my home in Mukamira in my room.  
Q.	And can you explain to us why you were at your home at that time.  
A.	It would take a little while to provide the explanation, and so I would like to crave the indulgence of the Bench.  
Q.	Yes, you can go ahead.  
A.	Since I was appointed as the operational sector -- of Ruhengeri to replace the lieutenant colonel of the gendarmerie, Uwihoreye, Charles, who had been transferred to the military headquarters in Kigali, I left the -- I occupied -- I occupied the -- the headquarters who -- which he occupied in the 
Nyamagumba gendarmerie in Ruhengeri.  And there, I would be in an office -- a hall in which there is -- at the same time, let me say all the -- the working tools of the sector commander and -- and that is where I also set up my bed.  So I spent my night in -- in my command unit.  

Now and then my family -- as I had left since October 1999 (sic) to the war front -- my family remained in Camp Kamira (sic).  Meaning that as sector commander in Ruhengeri, I live and I stay in Ruhengeri in the conditions -- under the conditions I just described to the Chamber.  Now and then when things calmed down, I would make a short trip to my home in Mukamira to -- for family reasons.  

Now, it happened -- it so happened that on the 6th of April, I was in Mukamira in -- under circumstances that were special in nature.  As a matter of fact, at the time when I was in Ruhengeri on the 3rd of April 1994, my spouse, who was in Mukamira, telephoned me to tell me that my mother had just passed on.  My mother was at my home, and she had been there for about two to three months to -- for us to take care of her as she was ill.  

And I would like to remind the Chamber that my mother was a displaced person since 1992, and I had set her up somewhere in Kigali -- in Kigali-rural.  But when she -- when she was unable to deal with the illness, we decided to take her to my home in Mukamira, considering the fact that my spouse was a nurse in order to be in a position to provide her care.  

So on the 3rd, unfortunately, she passed on in Mukamira unfortunately.  I left Ruhengeri and went to Mukamira, and we decided to carry on with her burial in Byumba the following day.  On -- on the 4th, we went to Byumba to bury her, and then we came back later on -- later in the evening on the night -- on the night of the 4th to the 5th.  I spent the day of the 5th in Mukamira.  And on the 6th in Mukamira, I -- my intention had been to spend more than four days there in order to organise my mother's funeral.  

Those are the circumstances under which I was found -- that is to say -- in my home in Mukamira and not in Ruhengeri.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, can you tell us what happened when you learned of the death of President Habyarimana.  What did you do? 
A.	Well, since I was in mourning, I must say I was equally ill.  I had some problems with my feet -- rather, my legs, and so I was at home.  But -- now, how do I get to hear about this piece of information? 

At the time when I was in my bedroom, before I had been in the living room alongside many people who had come to condole with me and so on and so forth, and since I wasn't feeling too well, I decided to retire into my bedroom.  And as there were many people in my house at that time, you had my spouse and some of my relatives I believe who were -- so she was taking care of all those people.  

So as I was in my bedroom, I heard people exclaim.  And my wife rushed in and told me that the president's place -- the president's plane had just been shot down.  But at the time she was telling me this, I, almost, at the same time I received -- but, quite frankly, I don't remember which came before which.  So I received a phone call from the military headquarters and that from the officer in -- who was on duty, whose known as Ntamagezo, who told me that he was coming to collect -- they were coming to collect us in Ruhengeri because they'd been -- to take us to Ruhengeri as we had been told that -- in Mukamira -- the president and the army chief of staff and the president of Burundi have just perished 
in -- you know, at that time, there -- no one was telling us -- I can't remember what words were used, but in any event, "The plane crashed.  Now -- so we are at the military headquarters.  We are going to meet and we shall inform you as appropriate." 

After having been informed by the officer on duty at the état -- at the military headquarters, then you have lots of contacts.  My deputy, who was in Ruhengeri, and who was the interim commander when I was absent, whose name was -- whose name is Bivugabagabo, Marcel, also called me and told me that, "We have just heard this."  

And I said, "You are -- it's the right time for you to call because I've just been contacted by the 
military headquarters as well.  In any event you know what you have to do because, concerning the circumstances, you have to alert -- put the -- all the units on alert and avoid to be taken by surprise because the person who shot down the plane has -- would likely carry on." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have to request that the pace slows down a bit to facilitate translation and recording.  Do you understand, General Bizimungu?  Please speak a bit more slowly.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I was surprised that I had not yet been instructed in that regard.  Thank you very much.  I will attempt to slow down. 

So I was at the time when I was talking with my deputy, Marcel, and we were talking over the phone about the first measures to be taken.  

But at the same time in Mukamira where I was found, you have the commander of the Mukamira barracks, because when I was appointed operational commander in Ruhengeri, another commander was appointed for Camp Kamira (sic) to replace me, and that is a person known as Bizabarimana, Laurent.  

He -- as a matter of fact, a short while before we had been together, because he had come to my home but had left earlier, he also, having heard the news, rushed to the command headquarters of Camp Mukamira and we were in touch for most of the entire night.  That is to say that is how I heard about the news, and I stayed in contact with various people, Commander -- Komakamira (sic) -- of -- of the Camp Mukamira, the one who replaced me in Ruhengeri, and the Rwandan military army staff -- headquarters.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did there come a time when you left Mukamira camp? 
A.	Yes.  Maybe an important stage is that -- before I answer your question directly, is that, as the officer on duty at the military headquarters had told me a little while after midnight, he called me again and told me that, "Now, there is a telegraph that is going to follow, but I'm going -- I was just about to alert you that the meeting which was held at the ministry headquarters had just taken some important decisions; firstly, the appointment of Colonel Gatsinzi as army chief of staff -- interim army chief of staff to replace General Nsabimana, who had just died in the plane."

The second decision of importance, which he told me about, was that, "Tomorrow around 10 a.m. in Kigali, there was going to be a meeting of the sector commanders, the commanders of units found within Kigali, and officers of the two military headquarters of the Rwandan army and the gendarmerie, as well as -- of -- the minister of defence to assess the situation.  So tomorrow we are going to send you a helicopter in the morning to come and collect you."

So I seized that opportunity -- told him that, "Unfortunately, no, I will not be able to come because I was ill and that I would be represented by my deputy, Colonel Marcel."

So after that communication, of course, the telegram arrived and a car -- Marcel received it, and he also called me, and I told him that I was already informed.  "You are the one who's going to go to Kigali on my behalf."

And so that's how in the morning before he left for Kigali he called me -- Marcel called me and told 
me -- firstly, he updated me about the situation that was relatively calm on the 7th -- on the morning of the 7th of April.  And he told me that, "Now, I am leaving for Kigali, and I have been in touch with S4 to let him know that you were leaving so that someone, at least, would be on hand."
Now, that said, since I was not going to Kigali and as I was, indeed, aware of some pieces of information, I felt that something was going to happen.  So I decided in spite of everything to -- in spite of my poor health, to go to Ruhengeri in the operation sector.  

In the morning, I received some wishes from my spouse -- or some care from my wife and another nurse from the camp who was there.  So between 10 and 10:30 -- in any event, after 10:30 I went to the Ruhengeri operational sector.  That's it.  
Q.	Now, let's just take a pause for some geography.  You were at Mukamira camp.  Can you tell us, what commune is that located in? 
A.	Nkuli commune.  
Q.	And from Mukamira camp going towards Ruhengeri town, do you also pass through 
Mukingo commune? 
A.	Yes.  You leave Nkuli commune, you go through the Mukingo commune, and in the morning you get to the Kigombe commune. 
Q.	And what's the approximate distance in kilometres between Mukamira camp and Ruhengeri -- the 
ops headquarters? 
A.	Over 20 kilometres.  In any case, not over 25 -- in any case, but I could be more specific if I was given a chance to check out.  
Q.	No, that's quite fine.  Now, on the morning of the 7th of April as you passed by on the tarmac road Mukingo commune and Byangabo centre, did you notice any disturbances or dead bodies or anything like that?  Smoke? 
A.	Disturbances, no, but -- but people along the road, yes.  People looking stunned which was, considering the circumstances, to be expected.  Corpses, no.  
Q.	Did you have any indication, as you passed Mukingo commune, that there had been any violence 
there -- or there was any violence there? 
A.	No, Counsel.  In all honesty, I did not notice any such thing.  And when you started talking to me about smoke, that surprises me somewhat because smoke in Rwanda in those days was a normal thing because from every home, when food is being prepared, smoke would rise.  So -- in fact, any smoke anywhere would not draw my attention.  
Q.	Did you stop anywhere on the 7th of April in the morning between Mukamira camp and the Ruhengeri ops headquarters? 
A.	No.  
Q.	And once you arrived at Ruhengeri ops headquarters, what kinds of activities did you engage in over the course of that day of the 7th? 
A.	When I got to Ruhengeri, the first thing is I went to -- well, at least, to my office -- my station of authority to know exactly what is happening, and when I get there, we had -- or I had in my personal computer a fax, a fax meant to receive only messages regarding activities of the enemy.  
There were two stations from where one could listen, one in Gisenyi and the other at the joint staff of the Rwandan army, and on which there were messages concerning the enemy which were very, very important and -- for us to -- to track them.  So that's the first thing I do when I get to my office, just to monitor the reaction of the enemy with regards to the events that had occurred.  

And on checking, I realised that there were interesting messages.  There were messages from Gisenyi, and we noticed that the enemy was aware of the activities that had happened and was giving an appointment (sic) for its troops in the main city, which was Kigali.  And so I told myself, "There, you have it.  The enemy will not take long before it attacks us."

I called some battalion commanders for them to meet me at the sector so that we can exchange information, and I think that they came at around 1 p.m., 2 p.m., thereabouts, and of course they too apprised of the message -- they read the document, and we engaged in discussions.  

I asked them exactly what the situation is, and they informed me that there were movements in -- in 
the -- at the front and there were precursory signs that -- proving that the RPF was already on the advance.  And I told them that they needed to get ready to ward off any eventual attacks launched by the enemy.  

Of course, I had to wait for some time the arrival of Bivugabagabo who had gone to Kigali for him to return from the -- the meeting.  But at the time he was coming back, we -- at that same time, we received a telegram from the joint staff that the RPF had actually launched attacks and that, in Kigali, fighting had broken out.  And the RPF had left the CND and -- "Be careful, take -- be careful in your respective positions because the SP -- the RPF is on the march." 

So around 4 p.m., of course, there certainly was a (inaudible) stage which I may have missed, but on that very 7th of April, thinking that we may be taken unawares, as had been the case on the 
8th of February 1993, I had instructed the Ruhengeri commando battalion to strengthen his position there at the Ruhengeri-Kidaho road, given the main artery or the main route by which the enemy could come using vehicles.  

And I tell him, "Please strengthen your position with another troop.  They're at the position where we are.  We are occupied at a point known as Karwasa."

And I think that towards the evening of the 17th -- the 17th of April, I -- I went there briefly -- it was only 4 kilometres away -- just to make sure that I knew what was happening.  But from there, all the advanced positions, around 5 p.m., 5:30 p.m., were already announcing shots that were coming from the enemies, and they also had started retaliating.  

To -- so we gave clear instructions that we were actually at war and there was no -- there's no need -- cause to suffer or incur the same losses as was the case on the 8th of February 1993.  There was cause to react.
Q.	After you had arrived at the Ruhengeri ops sector, did you go to Mukingo commune at all on the afternoon of the 7th or the evening? 
A.	No.  The situation that was unfolding at the time did not allow me -- offer me the -- the luxury of going back to Mukingo and not much less to return to my home.  
Q.	Did you go to Mukingo commune on the 8th of April at all? 
A.	No.  
Q.	In general, what did you do between the 8th and 14th of April? 
A.	Well, on the 8th as from the early morning I was occupied because, on the night of the 7th, with the way things had evolved, I had summoned all the battalion commanders so that they come over and so -- so as to be briefed on what to do.  And so on the morning of the 7th, I did what was -- what we call in our own parlance, a grouping -- a meeting to issue war instructions.  After that, the commanders of battalions, after having asked questions, left directly and got to work.  

And so on the day -- on the 8th of April, I was busy all day coordinating operations.  I do not know -- well, I don't know whether -- I just -- I don't also remember exactly whether it was not on the same 
8th of April that the joint staff gave me some instruction to send a battalion to Kigali, and it was necessary that I, who had given an order for the movement of troops to some battalions, I needed to find a battalion to send to Kigali, and I eventually decided to send the Muvumba battalion, which had taken the Kinigi road.  And so it was necessary that it be replaced just so that there is no -- that position was not left empty.  

I was busy taking care of those activities, and on the 9th I was still involved in these activities.  

At a certain point in time -- I really cannot recall exactly what the date was, whether it was the 
12th or it was the 13th -- the joint staff informed us that there was a ceasefire for the evacuation of foreigners.  In the centre of town of Ruhengeri, there were some strangers who had been brought together to the home of Jean-Claude Hincq, a Belgian married to a Rwandan.  And there a crowd had gathered, and they were discussing regularly since we were -- at least, we discussed very often because he was a friend, we'd chat from time to time.  

We -- we asked ourselves a question, whether these people were going to just stay there forever, and finally it was said that they should be evacuated towards Gisenyi.  
Equally, there were the religious sisters who were Spanish -- Spaniards and who were in -- in Nyakinama, and these sisters also contacted to be evacuated in the convoy that was heading towards Gisenyi.  And so taking advantage of that ceasefire or that truce, that activity was carried out and people were effectively evacuated to Gisenyi.  

On the night of the 13th -- on the night of the 13th breaking 14th, I was confronted to a situation -- how do we put it, a situation which was cause for worry, so far as I was concerned, because the -- the 
joint staff of the army sent me an order.  I'm not saying a message -- sent an order that I had to understand, "Get ready to facilitate the passage of MINUAR", which had to leave Miyove, that is, the Kinihira sous-préfecture, and come over to join a MINUAR position, which was there at Ruhengeri in Nkumba.  

Nkumba, which was found in the zone, in principle, the -- since the (inaudible) -- demilitarised zone and since it was -- the fighting was still on course.  

Now, having witnessed these things -- well -- well, Counsel Robinson, maybe I should stop here.  
Let me just stop here so you don't accuse me of being ill-disciplined.  Well, if you ask me the question, I'll be sure that I'm not being too long.  
(Pages 38 to 49 by Jean Baigent)



















1445H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  It's perhaps not that necessary for our purposes to go into that much detail, so let me move on and ask you another question.  And that is that by the 13th of April had you become aware of any killings of Tutsi civilians which had taken place in Mukingo commune? 
A.	In Mukingo commune, no, I was not aware of that.  But I knew -- yes, to be honest, I knew that there was some turbulence, there was some trouble, there was -- I knew that I was the 
	gendarmerie camp (sic), and Leandre, the commander of the gendarmerie, who, as from the 7th, was out in the field as part of his mission as gendarme to put order.  

And so he's been working with the authorities of the préfecture in some areas where you had -- where (inaudible).  

For example, he warned me -- he alerted me about the fact that killings had taken place in Busengo.  He told me, but I did not exactly weigh the gravity of the situation, knowing that it was not good at all, and so that on the 13th I noticed nothing special.  But, on the other hand, there was another story which -- a situation which unfolded at the Busengo sous-préfecture where the authorities of that sous-préfecture were facing the attackers.  

The commander of the gendarmerie handled that problem.  And at some point in time he came over to see me and he told me he had been towards Busengo but had to come back.  This is information which I just gleaned because people were totally absorbed, caught up by the war.  In the meantime, I sent another battalion, the 73rd battalion, to Kigali, which followed the first -- the 3rd (inaudible) battalion.  I virtually put together a team to help the commander of the gendarmerie.  

And so at the end -- I know that in all these activities I knew that there was a transfer of some people who were at the Busengo sous-préfecture.  They were moved over to Ruhengeri town.  I knew that this had taken place.  And the authorities of the préfecture with the gendarmerie decided to settle them at the Ruhengeri appeal court.  And, well, in all of this I don't know what happened at what time, but I knew that those activities were ongoing and that the gendarmerie and the authorities of the 
préfectoral administration were handling that situation.  

I don't know whether, at least in part, I've answered your question. 
Q.	Yes, you have.  And were you also aware that killing of civilians was taking place in Kigali? 
A.	I am uncomfortable to say -- if I say that I knew, then -- to say that I could not have information, that was not fair.  But to say that I didn't get information from here about tension here and there, that would be hypocritical on my part.  When I learnt that the préfet, Bariyanga, Sylvestre, the main 
préfet of Ruhengeri in office who was assassinated in Kigali with his family, that is not an isolated information which I just received from the blue.  

There was a lot of talk about many people who were killed in Kigali, including the head of the 
Ruhengeri préfecture.  I think I saw one of his bodyguards who came telling us, "Well, I escaped, but the préfet, his wife and children were just been killed."  We led the information about the situation that was prevailing at that time.  

And so -- well, I think that when Marcel Bivugabagabo came back from Kigali he talked to me about the death of the prime minister, Agathe, because apparently they were neighbours in Kiovu.  

And so on that day the situation was not good at all, especially as I think it was either maybe the 
12th or so, but it was on that day that there was a stream of people, very many of them, coming from Kigali and Byumba fleeing away from the RPF.  

This situation on the 12th of April -- as a matter of fact, there was confusion everywhere.  And so I don't know.  But to know -- knowing exactly what is happening where, what is happening, I do not know.  But just knowing that the country was under blood and fire, I knew, and no one can say anything about this.  And that was the situation since 1990.  The RPF was ensuring chaos, and they were taking advantage of the situation.  It was, as a matter of fact, the ideal condition for continuing to create confusion. 
Q.	But in addition to killings perpetrated by the RPF during this period, were you also aware that 
members of the population were killing Tutsi in Kigali? 
A.	Well, such piece of news, we get it in the air, but we don't have an exact grasp of the situation per se.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if the registrar can give the document number 7 from our bundle of materials to General Bizimungu.
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, could we hear a question to the witness before we place documents in front of him?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, we are going to show you a broadcast from Radio Rwanda on the 
10th of April of 1994.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  
MR. ROBINSON:
You wanted a question.  I'm making my question. 

MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, but you're telling the general what you are going to show him, which is a way of leading, and this is direct examination.  So ask a question, and then we'll see if the document needs to be in front of him in order for him to answer it and recognise what's in the document.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, my question is going to be:  Can you please read from page 11 of the document.  It's difficult to ask that question when the document is not in front of the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, Your Honours, that's the very point.  This is direct examination.  If Mr. Robinson wants to elicit testimony from the witness or evidence from the witness, he should ask a question, and the document is secondary.  If he lays foundation for the document or he brings out from the testimony of the witness that the document is somehow relevant from his answer, that's another issue.  But actually this is a leading question when you put a document in front of the witness and then ask him to read its contents and then comment on it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I don't think I need to respond, Mr. President, unless you have a question of me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, even though we might think that you are technically right, under the circumstances of this trial this is rehashing of evidence that we know about.  We think that the question could be omitted to save time and in the interests of justice.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  So if the document could be put in front of the witness, please.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, General Bizimungu, if you could turn to page 11 of that document, and there is a statement by Colonel Marcel Gatsinzi.  It's broadcast on the 10th of April.  You have told us that General Gatsinzi was appointed chief of staff, and so in his capacity as chief of staff he was addressing the 
Rwandan people.  And I would ask if you could -- since this is in Kinyarwanda, if you could read, or if you prefer to summarise, what General Gatsinzi is saying here on page 11.  
MR. SENDZE:
Since it is in Kinyarwanda, we would prefer that he reads rather than summarise what is in the document.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fair enough.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, General Bizimungu, if you could just read the three paragraphs that are on page 11, please.  And please read slowly.
A.	That's fine.  Thank you.  Colonel Marcel Gatsinzi.  
"It is true that Rwanda has been struck by a tragedy over the past few days.  The 
president of the republic was killed brutally.  Subsequently we have been very, very afflicted by this state of affairs, and many Rwandans have been aggrieved by the situation.  

"Furthermore, some people have expressed greater grief as compared to others, among whom you have some soldiers, members of the population who went on to manifest behaviour that is tantamount to vengeance.  However, these persons acted individually without being manipulated by any organ or authority to do this or to do that.  

"Such activities took place, the situation prevailed, but the military hurriedly looked into the situation and considered putting an end to that situation.  That is what we are doing.  That is what the authority is addressing actually.  

"When such a mishap occurs, it is not possible to put an end to such a situation very quickly because that requires many resources.  For example, we cannot actually say that it is the soldiers who have taken upon to carry out revenge, because you also have members of the population involved in this violence.  

"Equally there are other persons who have joined the fray who have taken advantage of the situation to engage in looting and in the killings.  

"As a result, we now have put in place a programme to bring things to order, to begin with.  But to put an end to this ongoing situation, it is necessary for a political authority to be put in place, to be erected, and that was our priority, because we needed political power to be instituted for the ensuing instructions to be issued nationwide, given that it is such power that should lead, and it is not the military that should hold power or the reigns of authority.  

"Quite simply, we served as an intermediary to enable them to meet so that subsequently those people would be in a position to adopt specific positions.  The decisions were taken without the -- any form of involvement of any soldier.  We did not attend the meetings of the politicians.  The politicians are the ones who adopted their own decisions and set up a government.  Therefore, we had hoped that that government would once more conduct the affairs of the country, and we asked the people to support it and, as soldiers, we supported that government.  

"So we searched for the ways and means of bringing a halt to the existing disturbances.  And to attend this objective we asked the gendarmes who enforce law and order to do that, to stop all the people from jumping into the fray, whereas the goal was not to bring back security.  
"Those people might have wanted to loot with the aim of hurting people, whereas such was not the 
duty of the soldiers.  And that is not what the members of the population had to do."  
Q.	Thank you, General Bizimungu.  

Now, in this address General Gatsinzi is making the point that the killings were not ordered by authorities but were committed by individuals acting on their own.  Now, was that consistent with your own experience? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour --
THE WITNESS:
Exactly. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not following the evidentiary point that Mr. Robinson is making with this mode of examination.  The witness has testified that he was in Ruhengeri.  This is Marcel Gatsinzi, who was listed as a potential Defence witness, making a broadcast on the 11th of April, I believe.  How is getting the witness to simply read the transcript of a broadcast and comment on it helpful to the Chamber?  

This is the issue that I was objecting to.  We could have done the same thing by having Mr. Robinson find some way of putting this in evidence independently.  The witness is simply reading a broadcast and commenting on it.  We don't know if the witness heard this broadcast when he was in Ruhengeri on the 11th.  I'm at a loss for understanding what is accomplished by examining the witness in this way.  

And we have objected in the past when Mr. Robinson has adopted this approach by simply having a witness read speeches and broadcasts and place them on the record and comment on them without having testified to having personal knowledge of the broadcast or the contents or the accuracy of what's being stated.  So that's my objection and still an objection to the form of the question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, as I'm sure you recall, many broadcasts have been admitted in this trial, many as Prosecution exhibits from the Bar table without even any witness being called to say they heard them.  These documents are being accepted for that purpose without the need to even have a witness have heard the broadcast.  And it's the Prosecution who has benefitted from that as well as the Defence.  So it's not the time now to start to require Defence witnesses to be identifying having heard these broadcasts over the radio.  So the document is independently admissible.  

But my goal is to try to show what exactly the army was telling the citizens and whether or not that was also -- whether that was accurate in General Bizimungu's estimate, given the knowledge that he had of the situation.  
So I don't think there is anything improper about doing it this way.  I'm trying to limit the time.  And unfortunately, because the document is in Kinyarwandan, there's no way for you to understand its contents without somebody reading it.  And I think probably the best way I can do this is simply to pick selected portions of these documents and ask General Bizimungu to acquaint you in 
English and French with the content of them and then to be able to ask him questions about whether that also was consistent with his experience or whether General Gatsinzi was putting out some propaganda on the radio that wasn't true.  

So that's my explanation.  And the next thing I would like to do is move this document, which is 
number 7 in my bundle, into evidence as D. NZ733.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think we will allow the question.  

Mr. Robinson, just as an aside, how much longer do you envisage your examination-in-chief will last?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think I will finish sometime tomorrow, but I don't know exactly when.  I'm sure I will finish tomorrow actually, but I'm not exactly sure when. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Tomorrow, after several hours then.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  It's difficult for me to estimate.  Sometimes the witnesses' answers are expansive.  But I am hopeful that I will finish sometime during the course of the morning tomorrow.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The record should reflect our objection to admitting the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Objection is noted, and it's overruled.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, General Bizimungu, General Gatsinzi is also saying that the military -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have an exhibit number?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, that would be D. NZ733.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ733 admitted)  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, General Gatsinzi is also saying that the army is trying to put a stop to the killing.  Now, was that also your understanding of the position of the army with respect to killings by 
members of the population? 
A.	Firstly, this general staff headquarters announcement was something I listened to because it was of interest to me.  So at the time it was announced on the radio, I listened to it.  I wasn't hearing it immediately, but maybe subsequently on other programmes because in the evening, in any case, considering the tensions, we would -- we were interested in hearing about news about what had happened in Kigali.  

Secondly, this is a general army staff -- chief-of-staff who was speaking.  He was talking about the armed forces.  But, in any case, he was talking more specifically about the situation in Kigali and where, in spite of the fighting, you still had units which could still be available.  But I believe that he's sincere when he's saying so. 
Q.	Now, moving a little ahead to the 12th of April, did there come a time when some officers issued a communiqué by the command of the Rwandan army? 
A.	Yes, I also heard that communiqué. 
Q.	And if my document number 3 can be placed before you, please, I would like to have you look at that.  And we have this in English.  

General Bizimungu, do you recognise that document? 
A.	Well, yes, but I was handed a document in English. 
Q.	Do you recognise it as being a communiqué of the 12th of April signed by a number of members of the command of the Rwandan army? 
A.	The document which is signed was a document in French, but the one I have is a translation in English.  I can see names.  They seem to be the same signatories of that communiqué of the 12th of April. 
Q.	Perhaps the Prosecution could help me obtain the French document of this, but in the meantime let's try to go along with English.  

And in the communiqué it's stated that the command of the Rwandan armed forces is calling for the RPF to get together with them and to stop the wave of panic that has swept through the population by suspending the fighting.  And they propose a truce to the RPF forces that would begin at the 
13th of April at 12 o'clock.  

And then it's signed by Colonel Rusatira, Colonel Gatsinzi, Colonel Muberuka and a number of other officers.  

Now, can you tell us -- first of all, what do you know about this communiqué, and did it represent the position of the Rwandan army?  
A.	Now, Counsel, that communiqué was welcome by all soldiers because we believed that the proposal therein was going to salvage the situation.  So the communiqué of the Rwandan general staff headquarters signed on the 12th of February was a very important communiqué.  Unfortunately, it was disregarded. 
Q.	Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as D. NZ734.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ734 admitted)  
BY MR., ROBINSON:
Q.	Now turning to your own activities, did there come a time when you returned to Mukamira camp? 
A.	Yes, I was about to tell you that on the night of the 13th a peculiar situation happened in the 
Ruhengeri OPS sector with the facilitation of the UNAMIR, which had to go to Nkumba, and that happened at night.

So on the 14th in the morning I decided as there was a truce to facilitate the evacuation of foreigners.  And since there was some form of minor calm, I decided to go to my home in Mukamira, yes, on the 14th. 
Q.	And about what time on the 14th did you leave Ruhengeri? 
A.	Well, unfortunately, this is only an approximation because I -- Counsel, I lost my diary.  So, in any case, it was in the -- around 10 a.m., before mid day.  But to tell you the precise time, I don't think I will be in a position to tell you. 
Q.	And when did you return to Ruhengeri from Mukamira? 
A.	In the afternoon.  Maybe I'll put it at around 3 p.m. 
Q.	Did there come a time on the 14th after you had returned from Mukamira that you learnt about something that had happened at the court of appeal that day? 
A.	Yes.  Unfortunately I learnt that people who had moved away from Busengo to the court of appeal had been killed on that 14th, and I heard about it from the gendarmerie group commander.  And so, yes, unfortunately those people who -- who normally should have been under his guard had been killed by attackers who later we would learn had come from Mukingo. 
Q.	Did you yourself order or have anything to do with the killing of the Tutsi in the court of appeal? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to inform you that that's one of the main charges against me, and I have been in a position to deal with it at length during my trial.  I pleaded not guilty.  So to be -- it is not a pleasant surprise.  From far or from near, I would never have wished the death of those unfortunate people. 
Q.	We have evidence in our case that after that event there was a broadcast on the radio in which it was said that the court of appeal had been shelled by the RPF and the Tutsis had been killed by RPF.  Did you have anything to do with that communication that was made over the radio? 
A.	Yes, that's one of the charges that was brought against me, that I would have made a press interview and communiqué.  They don't tell me against whom or they don't show me the press release I signed.  Unfortunately this came on the air and then subsequently heard the communication that 
said -- mentioned something else.  So I have nothing to do with that so-said communiqué which is attributed to me. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, from the time you returned in Ruhengeri on the 14th of April until the 16th of April, can you tell us in general what were your activities.  
A.	Well, to be candid, I can't tell you in much detail because, for one thing, it's been a long while.  Secondly, I don't have anything to assist me to remember.  Thirdly, I am in Ruhengeri, and I am carrying on my normal activities or coordinating the activities on the war front.  And when I have a chance I go to town.  But after the unfortunate incident of the court of appeal, I instructed -- this time I instructed because the gendarmerie commander was -- I saw him overwhelmed, so I instructed Marcel that it's unfortunate that an event such as that in the court of appeal happened, that it was absolutely necessary to protect the vulnerable locations where the Tutsis were.  I was talking specifically about the Ruhengeri hospital, especially also there was a groupe scolaire, and I am also talking about other areas.  

And that was one of the main concerns subsequent to the unfortunate event of the court of appeal.  I am fully aware that the opposing side will say I was present and that I issued orders.  I would insist on saying it was an unfortunate and regrettable situation, and I talk about it with a lot of grief.  And I believe that on the 15th this was one of my major concerns to ensure that such an incident does not repeat itself in Ruhengeri.  

And I'd like to tell the Chamber that, to be candid, the gendarmerie group commander was deeply touched and affected.  Apparently he had lost his mother -- his mother-in-law somewhere.  So it was horrible for them.  I believe that on the 15th in the afternoon the truce -- at that time the RPF started combat again and I had to be on alert. 
Q.	Now, on the 16th of April 1994, did you learn that you had been appointed chief-of-staff of the Rwandan army? 
A.	Yes, I think in the 7 p.m. bulletin I was in my headquarters, and I learnt it from my escort who was listening to the radio and who came before me and informed me that, "Congratulations, my general."  And I was taken aback.  I listened to how things unfolded over the programmes, and subsequently I received the telegram from the minister of defence notifying me of it. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, number 9 in my bundle of materials is the radio broadcast in which 
General Bizimungu's appointment, as well as some other appointments, were announced, and I would simply move to -- rather than take the time to show it to the witness, I would simply move that into evidence as Exhibit D. NZ735.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ735 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this might be a good time to stop for the day and we can pick up tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's 3:30.  We take our adjournment at 3:30, and it's just about that time now, so we'll adjourn until tomorrow.  

As I'm sure you are fully familiar with our procedures by now, it may be unnecessary for me to tell you that while you are a witness on the witness stand, any adjournment during the period, you should not discuss the case or your testimony with anyone.  We now take the adjournment. 
(Court adjourned at 1530H)
