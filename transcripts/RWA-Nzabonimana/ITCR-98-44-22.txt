MR. FLEMING:

20

Thank you, Your Honours.

Your Honours, two

21

propositions are immutable.

22

Prosecution always bears the onus of proof

23

and that beyond reasonable doubt.

24

an accused is entitled to a trial with the

25

application of the highest standards of law

One is that the

KELLY ALLEMANG - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
2

And, two,

KAJELIJELI

30 NOVEMBER 2001

1

applying to him.

An accused has protections

2

built into the Statute and nothing that I

3

say can derogate from those two

4

propositions.

5

those, we accept the burden that they

6

impose.

We don't interfere with

7
8

However, in that context, I want to make --

9

we want to make a number of points.

The

10

first one is that the crimes with which this

11

Court is dealing are remote, they are

12

complex, and they are massive.

13

domestic jurisdiction, if there is a single

14

murder, it is a matter of great inquiry, and

15

indeed, great expenditure of public funds.

16

We are not here speaking of a single murder,

17

we are here speaking of a crime, or crimes,

18

I should say, that is so massive they almost

19

pass beyond the degree of belief that we can

20

bring to it.

In any

21
22

The second point is that in that context it

23

creates an enormous difficulty in both

24

investigation and proof.

25

now see why I stated at the outset that the

Your Honours will

KELLY ALLEMANG - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

KAJELIJELI

30 NOVEMBER 2001

1

Prosecution continues to retain the burden

2

of proof and that beyond reasonable doubt.

3
4

The third proposition is that the Statute

5

has no coercive powers in it in respect of,

6

for example, witnesses.

7

witnesses, ultimately, are voluntary.

8

coercive powers that the Court may have are

9

enforced, ultimately, only by a complaint to

All of the
The

10

the security council, which complaint might

11

be dealt with a long time into the future.

12

So the Statute under which this Court is set

13

up does not have the normal coercive powers

14

of a domestic jurisdiction.

15
16

Fourth, Your Honours, the indictments are

17

sometimes necessarily complex, although we'd

18

readily concede that some of our indictments

19

are sometimes unnecessarily complex.

20
21

The fifth point that we make by way of this

22

introduction is that the charges though,

23

ultimately, are not terribly complex.

24
25

The sixth point, Your Honours, is this:
KELLY ALLEMANG - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

KAJELIJELI

That we ask and can ask only that you

judicially notice facts that are necessary

for the purposes of the case.

prepared to concede that in some of the

5

applications that have previously been made,

6

there have been requests to judicially

7

noticed facts, which are not necessary to

8

establish a particular crime.

9

judicial notice must be purely for the

10

purposes of establishing the existence of

guilt or otherwise.

12
13

Now, Your Honours may immediately start

14

thinking in terms of judicial notice in

15

terms of things like the genocide; the fact

16

that there was a genocide in Rwanda.

17

will come back to that in a little detail a

18

little later on.

19

something that we ask you to take judicial

20

notice of, nor can we for the reasons that

21

we'll give subsequently.

30 NOVEMBER 2001

1

Your Honours, one of the propositions which

2

is of concern in all of this is that if

3

those of us who come from the common law

4

look at our rules, the fundamental

5

proposition is that the best evidence must

6

be introduced to the Court.

7

a significant change from the normal

8

propositions that we find in our traditional

9

jurisdictions, especially the common law

Here, there is

10

Because of the remoteness of

11

the crime, because of the difficulty and

12

complexity of investigation, there may not

13

be what we consider to be the best evidence

14

available.

15

mind what we said at the outset that the

16

Prosecution still bears the onus of proof,

17

that the accused is entitled to all of the

18

protections, but those protections are to be

19

found within the structures of the Statute

and the rules.

Paragraph (a) states

shall apply rules of evidence, which will

And Your Honours have the right to

reference to any concept of admissibility,

to admit evidence that's relevant and it

So we find if we

apply some sort of definition to probative,

12

a Trial Chamber may admit any relevant

evidence, which it deems to prove the facts.

The point that we make is this:

rules, but it is constrained by the mandate

Now, Your Honour, we've taken a little time

to go through that foundation proposition.

21

One then looks carefully for any further

great pronouncement in respect of evidence,

23

and it wisely, the drafters of the rules

24

have left it a very wide proposition and

25

they have confidence in doing so because of

14

KAJELIJELI

30 NOVEMBER 2001

the way in which the Rules are drawn and the

2

experience of the judicial office holders

within these Tribunals, because not only is

there a domestic experience, but there is

5

also an experience going beyond that into

6

the realms of this area of law,

7

international humanitarian law, and

8

International Criminal law.

10

Indeed Your Honours are freed from the

constraints of a domestic jurisdiction and

Your Honours now have to provide a new legal

framework and are providing a new legal

Can we then turn to Rule 94, in particular.

3

Because Rule 94 then is interpreted not as

4

we would interpret it within a common law

5

jurisdiction, but significantly differently,

6

and the first point we make in respect of

7

that is to say that the common law

8

jurisdiction has all of the constraints on

9

the admissibility of evidence attached to

10

it.

This jurisdiction has the constraint

11

that the evidence is relevant and probative.

12

So it is in that context then that we

13

interpret the Rules in respect of judicial

14

notice.

15
16

When we look at the origins of judicial

17

notice within the common law, we note some

18

interesting characteristics about it.

19

First, Your Honours, judges may take

20

judicial notice of facts.

22

clearly established that evidence of their

23

existence is unnecessary.

evidence of existence is unnecessary.

2
3

The limitations placed upon judicial notice

4

within, for example, a common law system is,

5

as I have just said, it's discretionary.

6

Second, it's within the rules relating to

7

the admissibility of evidence with all of

8

the confines upon that.

9

because a matter is proven in one case, it

And third, just

10

cannot be taken judicial notice of in

11

another.

12

fundamental differences in the proposition

13

in common law and the proposition here.

And that's one of the greatest

14
15

Common law always made a distinction between

16

relying one's own knowledge, a judge relying

17

on one's own knowledge and the fact that

18

something is notorious.

19

we note these differences:

20

"a Trial Chamber shall not require proof of

21

facts of common knowledge, but shall take

22

judicial notice thereof."

23

difference is that while it's discretionary

24

in the common law, it is, in fact, mandatory

25

in Rule 94(a).

Going to Rule 94,
In sub-rule (a)

The first

94(b) is different because

2

3

That is permissive.

4

the Trial Chamber may decide to take

5

judicial notice of adjudicated facts and

6

documentary evidence from other proceedings.

That is a judge may --

7
8

The second difference is that the common law

9

said that the matters, the facts, must be so

10

notorious, the rule provides, sub-rule (a),

11

that they are matters of common knowledge,

12

vastly different concepts.

ultimately are first.

to the matter at issue in the current

proceedings and that is the in final line of

17

reason to take judicial notice of anything

is because it goes to the proof of the

matter before you and the proof of the

matter before you is sometimes narrower than

particular, a different conclusion.

13

Paragraph 27 points out the distinction

14

between Rule 94(a) and 94(b); that is, they

15

say unlike 94(a), 94(b) is discretionary.

16

That's a proposition that we have already

17

pressed upon Your Honours that 94(a) is not

18

discretionary, but you shall take notice of

19

facts of common knowledge.

20
21

They say that the purpose -- I shall read

22

precisely from paragraph 27 -- "In this

23

connection, the Chamber recalls that the

24

doctrine of judicial notice serves two

25

purposes:

Then they go on to say as

must be balanced against the fundamental

right of an accused to a fair trial."

Because, as they pointed out in paragraph

proof," and of course, "the accused has a

"These aims

KAJELIJELI

30 NOVEMBER 2001

1

Your Honours must look at the probability of

2

the evidence.

3

as distinctive from "probativeness," or some

4

other, because the probability and

5

probativeness come from the same derivation.

6

It's the probability of the evidence.

7

the measuring of one fact against another,

8

when if you compare them, one is likely to

9

be true.

I use the term "probability"

It is

So it's the probativeness, the

10

probability of the evidence with which this

Trial Chamber is concerned.

that framework.

14

encumbrances upon that exist within a

domestic jurisdiction.

And, finally, in respect of Ntakirutimana,

18

paragraph 28 says, "In striking this

19

balance, the Chamber will avoid taking

20

judicial notice of facts that are subject of

21

reasonable dispute."

22

footnote to that, which takes us back to

23

some earlier learning in respect of it. It

24

says, "In support of this proposition, see

25

the Prosecutor against Sikaricha," a

And there is a

ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
23

KAJELIJELI

30 NOVEMBER 2001

1

decision on the 27th of September 2000,

2

where the Trial Chamber said, "Considering

3

that the Trial Chamber can only take

4

judicial notice of facts that are not the

5

subject of reasonable dispute, and that is

6

appropriate for the Trial Chamber to take

7

judicial notice of facts, which are agreed

8

between the parties," and that's the

9

footnote which is referred to.

It goes on

10

to say, "Such matters should not be settled

11

by judicial notice, but should be determined

12

on the merits after the parties have had the

13

opportunity to submit evidence and

14

arguments."

15
16

So the proposition in paragraph 28 is that

17

if a fact is the subject of reasonable

18

dispute, then it shouldn't be judicially

19

noticed.

20

have no dispute.

21

that the existence of the fact is the

22

subject of reasonable dispute, then, of

23

course, it must be adjudicated.

24

it means that the parties simply dispute it,

25

then we would submit that that is too narrow

Just because the parties want to dispute a

fact does not take it outside of the realm

of judicial notice.

it, and it falls within that proposition

8

that they are of common knowledge, then they

can still be judicially noticed.

If the parties want to

If the

10

existence of the facts are the subject of

receipt of evidence, then it's something

which the parties are entitled to adopt.

2

It's something that Your Honours shall

3

apply.

4

course, is that there is not the necessity

5

to call evidence and to have

6

cross-examination on it and so on, and there

7

will be judicial economy.

8

fundamental purpose of it is for the receipt

9

of evidence.

And the net result of that, of

But the

And the receipt of evidence is

10

done in the context of the Rules and the

Statute here, not any domestic jurisdiction

12

and not any common law or any other notion

13

of judicial notice wherever it might have

14

originated.

15
16

So judicial notice here is to assist to

17

receive evidence which is relevant and

18

probative.

19

obviously, that Your Honours apply to any

20

piece of evidence in this Court, including

21

evidence received by way of judicial notice.

22

Second, they are matters of common

23

knowledge.

24

parties might dispute the existence of the

25

fact, if they are of common knowledge, then

And that's the first test,

Your Honours are entitled to take judicial

2

notice of them.

3
4

We finish as we started.

None of this is to

5

derogate from the right of an accused to a

6

fair trial to have all of his or her rights

7

protected and none of it derogates from the

8

duty of the Prosecutor to prove facts beyond

9

reasonable doubt.

But the difference for

10

us, and for this Tribunal, is that we do so

11

in the context of these rules and this

12

Statute, and so we adduce evidence which

13

does not have applied to it the intricate

14

admissibility rules that we might import

15

somewhere else, but rather has applied to

16

it, the practical and the logical test at

17

the end of the day of evidence, which is

18

relevant and evidence which is probative.

19
20

Your Honours, we submit that in that

21

framework then, Your Honours analyse the

22

requests that we have made.

23

at the outset, we don't go through those

requests, that has been before Your Honours

motion for judicial notice on the basis of

Rule 89 of the Rules of Procedure and

Evidence.

3

Now on the basis of Rule 94, the Prosecutor

4

asked the Trial Chamber to notice the facts

5

moved in Annex 1 of its motion as being of

6

common knowledge or as facts adjudicated

7

upon in other cases in conformity with Rule

8

94(b).

9

submitted in Annex A are of common knowledge

10

and Rule 94 says that the Trial Chamber must

11

notice judicially facts of common knowledge

12

admitted in other cases before the Tribunal.

13

The Trial Chamber should not, therefore,

14

require proof of what is of common

15

knowledge, but simply takes judicial notice

16

of that.

The Prosecutor said that the facts

The Prosecution is saying that

Now, the

Firstly, My Lords, between the

10

1st of January, and the 17th of July, 1994,

11

Rwanda was a signatory to the convention on

12

the suppression of genocide, and on the 12th

13

of February, 1975, it adhered to it.

14

this is clear and the motion for judicial

15

notice by the Prosecutor could be admitted.

Now

16
17

Now between the 1st of January and 17th of

18

July, '94, Rwanda was a signatory of the

19

Geneva Convention of 1994, since 1975 and

20

adhered to the protocol, the additional

21

protocol.

22

therefore, the Defence Counsel sees no

23

problem about Trial Chamber accepting and

noticing it judicially.

see it in its proper light.

of judicial economy then it misses its most

important characteristic.

16

learned friends for reminding me that in

fact it was the Prosecutor's office who, at

18

least in part, put that proposition to the

Trial Chamber.

20

because it is not a matter of judicial

economy, it's a matter of an aid in proof of

Honour, of Your Honour's approach and we

have, of course, cited that's simply not the

inconsistence in the rules and, therefore,

2

Your Honours shouldn't follow them, that

3

somehow or another 94 was inconsistent with

4

the other Rules in respect of the receipt of

5

evidence.

6

that if one improperly characterized it as a

7

reversal of Your Honours approval, we make

8

the proposition again that it's not a

9

reversal of Your Honour's approval, at all,

It's not.

And one can only say

10

but rather it's in aid of that proof.

And

11

that's an important and fundamental plank in

12

everything that we say.

13

Your Honours, my learned friend said that we

14

sought to prove all of the element of the

15

crime against his client.

16

have we sought to implicate the involvement

17

of Mr. Kajelijeli, nor is there anything

going to eliminate elements involved in

matters outside of personal involvement and

intent.

We don't subscribe to that,

2

at all, because the only genocide that we

3

can prosecute is the one exhibited by the

4

intent of the individual.

5

irrelevant for this court to take judicial

notice of the fact that there are eight

people killed or whatever.

11

What we do is to take those elements of the

crimes and, indeed, they are carefully

thought out and they are the elements of the

14

crimes which Your Honours can take judicial

15

notice of without interfering with the

16

individual's right.

17

and defence is development in the process.

18

So Your Honours, we have never sought to

19

prove the case with judicial notice but

20

rather those elements which we say are

21

commonly known, those elements upon which

22

adjudication has been made and not those

involving him personally.

we say that it is not a reversal of Your
