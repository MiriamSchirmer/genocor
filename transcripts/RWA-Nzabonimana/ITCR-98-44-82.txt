MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber III is now in session.  We shall begin with a Status Conference.  

	Could the registrar kindly announce the matter before us? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Madam President.  

	Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andrésia Vaz, presiding, Judge Flavia Lattanzi, and Judge Florence Rita Arrey, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 29th March 2004, for a Status Conference in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Karemera et al, case number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, registry.  

	Could the parties kindly introduce themselves, beginning with the Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Good morning, Your Honours, and good morning to the parties and Defence counsel and the registry.  Prosecutor today is represented by myself, Don Webster, senior trial attorney, Holo Makwaia, trial attorney, Dior Fall, legal adviser, Gregory Lombardi, assistant trial attorney, Bongani Dyani, assistant trial attorney, and joining us at the Bench is our case manager, Ayo Fadugba, and our intern.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor. 

Now the Defence. 
MR. ROACH:
Good morning to the Court and to all parties.  My name is Charles Roach, and together with my colleague, Mr. Weyl, we represent Dr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who is not present today.  I have more to say about that later. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Roach. 

Counsel Diagne? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, good morning, Madam President.,  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to the teams of the -- members of the Prosecution team.  My name is Dior Diagne.  I would like to introduce you to Felix Sow, our new co-counsel, from the Dakar Bar.  We also have with us our legal assistant, Peggy Reinette, and Jean-Paul Temahagali.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel.  Welcome to Counsel Felix Sow and to the rest of your team. 

Counsel Robinson, you have the floor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning.  I am Peter Robinson for Joseph Nzirorera.  I speak a bit of French now but I don't understand it very well.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you for making an effort to address us with a few words in French, Counsel Robinson. 

Counsel Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm going to stay in the safety of English.  David Hooper, ably assisted by Professor Andreas O'Shea, thank you.  For Dr. Rwamakuba, I should add. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Hooper. 

As we mentioned before, we are going to begin with a Status Conference.  We have remarked that the Accused are not present, although we have authorised previously Accused to be present during Status Conferences, which, by the way, will be held in open session. 

We will give the floor to each party so we can iron out some details in the proceedings before continuing the testimony of the next witness. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The Prosecutor is ready to proceed.  We have witnesses here in Arusha.  One witness is waiting outside the courtroom, so we are ready to proceed as soon as the Court gives us the signal. 

There is a housekeeping matter that I would like to address to the Court, however.  I sent a memo this morning; I'm not sure if it's arrived with the Court or all of the parties.  It has to do with the scheduling of testimony for Witness G.  Witness G is a witness that is subject to very special protective measures.  He will not be testifying -- he will not be testifying in Court.  He will be testifying from a foreign location by videolink.  This is a matter that the Court addressed in a motion for special protective measures sometime last year. 

Originally, Witness G was scheduled to testify at the very beginning of the third trial session.  However, due to our own scheduling changes, the third trial session has been pushed back substantially, and with respect to this particular witness, we have to coordinate his appearance with two other cases.  He will also be testifying in the Bagosora case and in the Bizimungu case.  The Bizimungu case is before Trial Chamber II, the Bagosora case is before Trial Chamber I, and it was anticipated that we would make arrangements for this witness's testimony in a consolidated manner.  In order to arrange for his testimony, we have to coordinate with national authorities of two different states, in addition to coordinating with the registry, and it appears that we will have to take his testimony sometime after the 17th of May, which poses a bit of a problem in terms of our current scheduling. 

We had anticipated a number of Ruhengeri witnesses and factual witnesses, some of the witnesses that are coming from Rwanda for that period, but now we have superseding concerns, given the difficulty and the challenge of arranging for Witness G's testimony.  

	We would like to inform the Court and the parties, and to present the issue of moving forward his testimony, to have him testify at the very end of the second trial session, as opposed to the very beginning of the third trial session.  So I'm sure that's an issue that the Defence will want to address, but it's something that is a bit beyond our control, but I bring it to the Court's attention at the earliest opportunity.  My conversation with the other parties that are involved in coordinating his appearance only took place last week.  This is news to me as well.  And I'm sure all of the parties in the Trial Chamber will sympathise with our present position, which is attempting to facilitate the testimony of this witness, and the only way we can do that is by coordinating with the other cases, the other Trial Chambers, that will be using his testimony. 

Aside from that, I know Mr. Robinson has raised a number of disclosure concerns.  I believe those have been addressed.  I will allow it to him to raise his objections and respond to them in turn. 

In every other respect, I believe we are ready to proceed.  The Prosecutor responded to a motion for continuance from Mr. Robinson.  We made our position clear with respect to continuing with the trial in that motion.  We are ready to proceed.  We would prefer that all outstanding motions be resolved before testimony resume, but the Prosecutor is ready and willing and anxious to proceed with this trial.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Counsel for the Defence, do you have any words at this stage?  

	Counsel Roach, you have the floor. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you.  Yes, as the Honourable Court noticed, Dr. Ngirumpatse is not here today.  He has taken the position of absenting himself because of his lack of confidence that he can get a fair trial, and that is based on the fact that there are many issues in the way which have not been resolved to his satisfaction, and these include the previous sessions that we had in November and December and the status of that and the status of the appeals and the various different motions that are pending.  And in our client's view, proceeding before these matters are resolved would not guarantee for him a fair trial, a situation in which he can know and predict with some kind of confidence that matters will be properly considered. 

Dr. Ngirumpatse, however, has given instructions, even though he's not here.  I will relay and try to put into effect the instructions that I have been given.  One is a motion that I would like to place before this Honourable Court, and it is going to be a motion in an alternative form.  What he seeks to do is ask this Court -- move this Court for an adjournment in the proceedings until such time as there is a definitive decision as to whether or not there is a mistrial.  Now, that matter had been presented to you for consideration, and in our respectful view, and in Dr. Ngirumpatse's view, it was not dealt with, but what was dealt with was whether or not there should be a trial de novo.  

In our view, a trial de novo and an application for a mistrial are entirely two different things.  Our position is that this Court ought not to proceed on the indictment of 2004, which is the current indictment, until such time as there is some finality to the indictment of 2003.  And basically we are saying that there is no jurisdiction of this Court to proceed on the indictment of 2004 without bringing some finality to the proceedings under the indictment of 2003. 

Technically speaking, and in spite of the decision -- or notwithstanding the decision of the Appeals Tribunal -- Appeals Chamber, the trial that started in November of last year is continuing, and that continues until there is -- or it's continuing on that particular indictment, and that continues in that fashion until there is some determination by this Court, some official act by this Court, declaring that that particular indictment of October 2003 is no longer efficacious. 

Alternatively, we are asking that the trial be adjourned until the matter that is pending in the Appeals Chamber is disposed of and we have a clear direction as to whether the trial that we have been proceeding on has been aborted, in which case we respectfully submit that you make an order for a trial, a new trial, should that appeal be successful.  If not, if the appeal is not successful, then we would be able to govern ourselves accordingly. 

Now, these two motions -- or this motion, in its alternative form, is of a jurisdictional nature, and in our respectful submission, jurisdictional motions must be disposed of before proceeding.  They are threshold motions.  This Tribunal, as it's presently composed, has not dealt with a motion -- the motion for mistrial, which, in our view, was a threshold motion, in a -- on a basis of priority, and we note that a number of other motions were dealt with before that motion, which was presented in December, I believe on the 19th of December, of 2003, and it was decided on the 19th of January -- either the 19th of January or February of 2004, but in any event, we know that there were many other motions that were disposed of in priority to that jurisdictional motion, and we should just like to urge upon this Court that it deal with any motions that challenge its jurisdiction to proceed on a priority basis before taking other steps. 

In summary, then, we would say our position is that the trial or proceedings not continue until there is a resolution of the status of the appeal in the Appeals Tribunal, and, in the alternative, if you do not wish to wait for that decision, which, in our view, would be regrettable and would cause confusion as we are here today having been through that -- a similar process when the Appeals Chamber was deliberating on the motion or appeal by the Prosecutor with respect to the form of the indictment, we proceeded nevertheless and -- only to find, after the first session, that there was a ruling vacating the order enabling that particular October indictment to proceed, or to be issued. 

So if we want to avoid the kind of confusion that we've had, which causes my client, for example, to feel that the proceedings are murky and not clear, and for that reason not in a position where he can collaborate with it, then it is our submission that you should wait until we have a resolution of that matter. 

So those are my submissions.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Roach. 

Counsel Robinson, you have the floor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I'm going to revert to English now.  This is beyond my capabilities in French. 

I want to start off with a positive request, and that is to withdraw the motion that I filed last week for a two-hour delay in these proceedings, and I want to thank your staff for allowing or enabling me to be able to visit with my client on Sunday.  We did have a long visit, it was productive, and I appreciate the effort that was made to allow for that, and so I officially withdraw that motion. 

I also have to speak about the fact that my client is not here.  I spent a good part of that day yesterday trying to persuade him to come, because I think it's very unfortunate that he's not participating, and I think that I should just tell you that he doesn't feel that the concerns that were expressed to the Trial Chamber, in his letter and the letter of the three Accused back in February, have been addressed, and he's waiting to see how the proceedings evolve today, and it's my hope that he will return to participate fully in these proceedings in the future. 

I would just like to observe that I -- it's not customary for the -- a Trial Chamber to receive a letter from an Accused, and it's probably normal that there be a first reaction not to respond to such a letter, but I would like to encourage the Trial Chamber to look beyond that, to try to extend an olive branch, because, after all, it is the trial of these individuals, it's their lives that are affected.  If they are judged guilty, we all go home to our home countries and they will spend the time in a cell.  And so I think it's very important that an effort be made to allow them to feel that their trial is a fair one.  And I also think that the trial will be very difficult if the Accused take actions to absent themselves and to further instruct their counsel not to participate in the proceedings.  I think that situation has occurred once before in the Barayagwiza case, when another American lawyer withdrew from the case because the ethical rules of his jurisdiction did not allow for him to continue to represent a client against his instructions.  And so I think that there is a potential in this case for huge disruption of these proceedings, and I think it would be worth the effort to try to resolve these things as amicably as possible. 

Now, I would like to first of all support Mr. Roach's motion that he has made this morning and indicate that we join in it and agree with him that the matter of jurisdiction should be settled first. 

I would like to say that I don't think we can proceed today for a number of reasons, including what Mr. Roach has said, and considering the other pending matters that are now before the Trial Chamber.  I have to tell you that I only, about 8:35 this morning, received a stack of maybe two inches of documents which have been filed in the last week and six CD-ROMs which have been disclosed in the last week, and I haven't been served until this morning with the motions that were filed, preliminary motions, on behalf of Mr. Rwamakuba.  Mr. Karemera and I hadn't been served with the responses of the Prosecutor to my motions that were filed.  And I'd like at a minimum to have the courtesy of being able to contribute to the Trial Chamber's decisions on those motions, replying to those of -- responses of the OTP and also joining and contributing to the motions by the co-Accused.  And so, for that reason alone, pursuant to Rule 73(F) I'm entitled to five days from the time which I'm served with these documents to respond, and I can do so within that time frame, but I don't believe that the trial or any other proceedings related to the facts of this case should go on until I've had an opportunity to make those filings and then the Trial Chamber is able to make a ruling.  

And I would point out that because these are preliminary motions, Rule 72 requires that the preliminary motions shall be disposed of before the commencement of the opening statement, and so it's our position that we cannot begin the trial until all of these motions are decided, and these motions should not be decided until all the parties have had an opportunity to -- until all the parties have had an opportunity to file their pleadings.  And I don't believe I have received responses to the motion -- to at least one motion that I filed last week on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera relating to the specificity or the form of the indictment.  

So I also would like to note that we don't have an amended indictment I'm aware of that conforms with the corrections that were discussed with Judge Arrey on the 23rd of February, when the Prosecutor indicated there were certain errors in the text of the indictment as well as the French translation.  And so, were we to proceed today, I don't have an indictment upon which, to my knowledge, we would be proceeding upon, even if all of our preliminary motions were denied or otherwise disposed of without any changes ordered -- being ordered to the indictment. 

With respect to the issues of disclosure, there are still many outstanding issues of disclosure that have not been resolved with respect to the witnesses, even the one that is proposed to be called as the first witness.  I do want to say that the Prosecutor has improved their production of disclosure materials, and the list is not as long as it has been, and I think that through the stewardship of Mr. O'Donnell, a system has been put in place where there has been some accountability, and it's worked.  But nevertheless, for example, with respect to Witness GFA, the first witness, I don't have the English translation of a statement that had been disclosed as GFA-7.  I believe in the stack of material I received today, there is the French translation of GFA-8 being given to us for the first time.  I obviously haven't had a chance to review it, and particularly my client hasn't reviewed it, and he was the one that was primarily wanting that; and we note that the latest disclosure is of GFA statement No.  12, and we only have eight statements disclosed to us for Witness GFA. 

We don't have the English translation of a large document known as a transcript of Gacaca proceedings which was disclosed in Kinyarwanda on the 23rd of January.  

There are nine statements of this witness to Rwandan authorities that we don't have.  Those statements were listed in a notice of extremely urgent motion requesting that the Prosecutor produce all prior statements of proposed rebuttal witnesses GNL and GNK that was filed in the case of Prosecutor v. Kajelijeli, back in April of 2003.  At that time -- Witness GNL is now Witness GFA, the same person, and it was indicated that he had made nine statements to Rwandan judicial authorities during the course of his case, beginning on 3rd of April 1995, continuing through the 29th of December 1999, and we don't have any of those statements disclosed to us.  I don't know whether that's because the Prosecutor doesn't have them, but they've certainly had ample opportunity to obtain them.  This witness has mentioned in his statement a meeting in November of 1992, of the MRND party in Ruhengeri, at which President Habyarimana spoke.  We have been asking for at least six months, probably longer, for the Prosecutor to provide us with a tape of that meeting.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel Robinson, would you mind going a bit slower, because the interpretation booth is having a bit of trouble following. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry, Madam President. 

At this meeting in Ruhengeri in November of 1992, at which President Habyarimana spoke, there has now been produced to us six CDs which purported to contain the tape of what was said at that meeting, and this meeting is a topic to be covered in the testimony of Witness GFA, and we just received this this morning, although you've ordered it to be disclosed, I think, more than two months ago. 

Also, my client tells me that on Friday he received some disclosure of new witness statements in connection with the Prosecutor's motion to vary the witness list and add some new witnesses.  I have yet to receive those statements, but I'm told that two of the witnesses describe -- are from Ruhengeri and describe incidents which are the same incidents that will be the subject of testimony by Witness GFA, and I've not had an opportunity to review those statements, and obviously those are necessary so that I can cross-examine Witness GFA to determine whether his testimony is contradicted by these witnesses.  And I would point out that those statements of these new witnesses were due to be disclosed to us on September 28th, 2003, 60 days before the trial commenced, and that this is a violation of Rule 66(A)(ii), and that at least one of these statements existed as far back as the year 2002. 

Another issue with respect to Witness GFA is that I have been denied access to this witness and have not had the opportunity to speak with the witness in advance of his testimony.  The protective order issued by the Trial Chamber of 12 January 2000 provided that the Prosecutor should make all necessary arrangements to facilitate an interview with a prospective Prosecution witness.  I requested that I -- to interview this witness back in January, and our procedure had been that I would be allowed to speak with the witness and determine whether or not the witness is willing to talk to me or not, and if the witness was not willing to talk to me, then I left, thanked the witness, and if they were, then I had the opportunity to do so.  In this case, with respect to Witness GFA, I was advised by Mr. Chappell from the Victim Witness Support Section that Mr. Webster had advised him that that procedure was no longer to be implemented, that it was to be now the Victim Witness Unit, Prosecution Section, that asked the witness whether they were willing to speak with me, and if the witness said no, that I was not to have any access to this witness.  And as a result, I've not been able to have any access to the witness.  And I consider this to be a violation of the principle of equality of arms as well as the protective order that has been issued by the Trial Chamber. 

Those are some of the issues with respect to the first witness, GFA, and I will tell you that, without taking your time right now, similar problems exist with respect to the other witness who is supposed to be called in these first two weeks, Witness GBU. 

I also wish to raise a number of other issues, and I'm sorry for taking so much time, but there are many issues that remain unresolved.  There is a problem relating to statements of -- from -- made to Rwandan authorities in general.  And you ordered that the Prosecutor make their best efforts to obtain these statements because you recognised, in your decision of 30 January 2004, that these statements have exculpatory value.  You also ordered the government of Rwanda to provide these statements and to provide its comments or objections, if any, to the Trial Chamber by the 10th of January.  

On the 6th of January, two things happened:  First, the Rwandan government sent you a letter and said that they needed a few more days to respond to your request; and secondly, the Prosecutor sent a letter to the Prosecutor General in Rwanda, asking him to make these records available.  However, since then, nothing has happened.  The Rwandan government has not made any further statements to this Court and has not provided any of these statements to the Defence or, to my knowledge, to the Prosecutor.  And to my knowledge, the Prosecutor has made no further efforts, after not having received a response to its letter of the 6th of January, to obtain these statements.  And as a result, we are in a position where witnesses are coming into this Trial Chamber, being provided by the government of Rwanda, in which very relevant exculpatory material is being withheld, and it's our position that that is a recipe for an unfair trial and that that situation must be remedied before these witnesses are allowed to testify before the Trial Chamber. 

With respect to exhibits, we have requested copies of exhibits, and there is a pending motion with respect to that, and I was notified on the 24th of March that there were binders of exhibits that were now going to be made available only for our inspection, and I tried to make arrangements for inspection of those exhibits this afternoon, but as we stand here today, I don't have copies of, nor have I had the opportunity to inspect, binders of documents that the Prosecutor intends to use as exhibits, and it's our position that this should have been resolved at the Pre-trial Conference, when Rule 73 requires that exhibits -- exhibit lists be prepared, filed, and our position is that copies of exhibits be provided, and so because of the lack of disclosure of the Prosecutor's exhibits, we are not prepared to proceed today. 

I sent a letter of the 19th of March to the Prosecutor, and I asked that a copy be circulated to the Judges, which contained many other problems relating to other witnesses for which we don't have disclosure, and I'm not going to review those at this time, but I do wish to address the issue of Witness G that Mr. Webster has spoken of this morning, because we don't have all of the disclosure for Witness G.  We particularly don't have a series of tape-recorded interviews that Witness G provided to a foreign government, of which we don't know which government that is, but which is in the possession of the Prosecutor and which I've been asking for, for more than a year.  

I want to note that I don't have any objection to having Witness G's testimony accelerated to the end of May, and I understand the problems that the Prosecutor has to try to coordinate with other cases, but, No. 1, I need full disclosure, and Witness G is a witness who has given maybe 40 -- well, between 20 and 40 interviews or 20 and 40 cassettes of interviews with the Prosecutor, some of which I have and some of which I don't.  In addition, because I didn't know until this morning that Witness G would be called during this session, I haven't done any preparation for Witness G, and I will request that there be a one-week recess before the testimony of Witness G so that I can prepare, but if I have that recess, and I have all the disclosure in sufficient time, then I don't object to Witness G testifying during this session. 

But I would like to also indicate that it's my request that myself and Mr. Nzirorera be present at the location where Witness G will be testifying from, so that we can have our full confrontation rights, and if he's to testify in videolink, then we want to be at the end of the link where he is present, and we already expressed this in our response to the motion for special protective measures for this witness.  In the Media case, when Witness G testified, they had a procedure where one counsel was in The Hague at that time and the other was here in the courtroom, and if I have a co-counsel by then, then my co-counsel can be here in the courtroom, and Mr. Nzirorera and I would request to be at the location where the testimony is being given.  But those problems can be discussed in more detail later. 

I'm not going to go over the pending motions that I've filed.  I do want to reiterate that I have requested, in my motion to continue, an adjournment of the trial for further investigation, in accordance with the Appeals Chamber's decision that such investigation would be -- a delay of months would be needed for such investigation, and I want to tell you that I need the time to investigate 40 or 45 witnesses that we were not previously concerned with until the joint criminal enterprise became a part of this case as of 18 February. 

And, in addition, I want to file a notice of alibi with respect to the new indictment, and I need time to contact the alibi witnesses before I can provide the names and addresses of those witnesses, as required by the notice of alibi. 

At this time, I would like to renew three motions that I have previously made and on which the Trial Chamber has made rulings.  I would first like to officially renew my motion for production of records by the United Nations peacekeeping -- Department of Peacekeeping Operations.  Pursuant to the decision of the 9th of March by this Trial Chamber, the registry was requested to assist me in transmitting my request to that department, although I will tell you that I had transmitted it to them twice before and they hadn't responded, but nevertheless it was served again on the 18th of March, and I asked them to respond within ten days so that we could have their input by the time that this trial recommenced, and there has been no response, to my knowledge, from the Department of UN Peacekeeping, and so I hereby move that the requested production in my motion of 5 January 2004 be ordered by this Trial Chamber forthwith.  And I appreciate the decision that the Trial Chamber made on the merits that the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations is an organ subject to the power of the Trial Chamber to order production of documents. 

Next, I would like to officially renew my motion to report the government of Benin to the United Nations Security Council for their failure to comply with the orders of the Trial Chamber.  This was the subject of a decision by this Trial Chamber on the 19th of March 2004, in which you again requested that the government of Benin provide these records, and I believe you requested that they do so or comment by the 29th of March.  That's today.  And to my knowledge, there has been no response from the government of Benin.  And so I renew my motion that you report -- that you request the President to report them to the United Nations Security Council for failure to cooperate with the Tribunal. 

Second, I -- third, I wish to officially renew my motion to -- that you request the President to report the government of Rwanda to the United Nations Security Council for failure to comply with, now, three orders of Trial Chambers requesting that they provide records.  And in your decision of 11 December 2003, you denied my request to report them to the Security Council and instead issued another order asking them to cooperate, and they have not done so.  And so I renew my motion in that regard. 

Finally, I would like to make a motion to exclude the testimony of Witness GFA, the first potential witness of this session, for the Prosecutor's violation of Rule 66(A)(ii).  This Rule requires that the Prosecutor serve at least unredacted -- at least redacted witness statements 60 days before the commencement of trial, and, again, that date was September 28th, 2003.  I hadn't even heard of Witness GFA as of September 28th, 2003.  The first disclosure of any kind with respect to this witness occurred on the 21st of October of 2003, and as I indicated earlier, further disclosures have been continuing with respect to this witness, the most recent being something that I received this morning, and Rule 66(A)(ii) has clearly not been complied with, and I would indicate that at least one of the -- several of the statements, but at least one is dated in September of 2002 and it was well in existence before the disclosure date deadline of September 28th.  And so, as a result of the violation of 
Rule 66(A)(ii), I ask that the testimony of Witness GFA be excluded. 

I think I've taken up enough of your time and given you enough requests, so I thank you for your patience, and that concludes my remarks. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel Robinson. 

Counsel Diagne, you have the floor. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you for giving me the floor on behalf of Édouard Karemera. 

As you have observed, just like the other co-Accused, my client is not here this morning.  

Madam President, I must tell you that in -- pursuant to the letter that he sent to your Chamber on 19 February, 2004, he is still waiting for a response from you.  You know, Madam President, that that response can be in several forms.  I don't think that he's waiting for a written response from the Bench but just a signal; just an effort would be sufficient.  He has also asked me to tell you that he wants to be present and be active in his own trial. 

That said, Madam President, I would like to support the different motions presented by my learned friends, Mr. Roach and Mr. Robinson.  I would like to support those, and please let me come back to the issue of preliminary motions that we filed before your Chamber, regarding the indictment. 

Madam President, if the indictment is indeed that of 18 February, on the basis of which -- is the one with which you want to proceed today, I must tell you that that would be very problematic for us.  Madam President, I have just looked at several different scenarios and I would like to think out loud with you, if possible.  I'm asking myself:  What would happen, Madam President, if the indictment would be rejected, as we have asked in our preliminary motions, or at least revised in different ways?  What would happen?  That's what I'm asking myself.  At that time, would we have to recommence the proceedings, or must we believe that by today deciding to continue the trial on the basis of the indictment of 18 February 2004, you implicitly are rejecting all of the motions, all of the preliminary motions, filed by the parties?  I also can envisage a third scenario.  If you reject our motions, and if these motions are heard by the Appeals Chamber, what are we going to do?  We will be in the same situation when the Chamber -- Appeals Chamber rendered a decision on 19 December 2003.  We will be obliged once again to recommence the proceedings all over again.  So I'm trying to be very brief, Madam President, but I'm asking these preliminary questions, and I believe that it is absolutely necessary for you to give us an answer to these questions. 

I'm asking you, Madam President, to establish a bit of order, to clear up this confusion, before we recommence or continue with the trial.  I would ask that you answer the different preliminary motions that have been filed by the different Defence teams before the trial can proceed. 

So, in few words, and to be very brief, I just wanted to bring these things to your attention, and I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Diagne. 

Counsel Hooper, do you have any words for the Trial Chamber? 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President.  This trial appears to lurch from one difficulty to the next.  It's no fault of the Judges.  We at present have, if one quickly reviews it, this position:  A certified appeal to the Appeal Chamber in respect of commencing de novo or mistrial; we have the pending and again certified point of appeal for the Appeal Chamber with respect to the indictment itself, with respect to whether the indictment we are proceeding with, or proposing to, today is, in fact, a proper -- the proper indictment to proceed upon.  All -- both those matters were regarded by this Chamber as being of sufficiently in the interests of justice to merit certification and are currently pending.  There has been an oral motion today in respect of jurisdiction.  And fourthly, there is the category of preliminary motions that so unusually feature in this case after, in fact, the trial has commenced and witnesses have given evidence. 

The Chamber has had its attention, if it needed attention drawn at all, to the application and clear wording of Rule 72, and for our part, while in no way wishing it, one raises the serious question of how one gets about Rule 72.  It seems to us -- if we can assist the Court, it seems to us that these matters of jurisdiction necessarily need to be decided before we progress the case further by way of evidence.  And we gain support from -- for that proposition, if there is any lack of clarity in the Rules of this Tribunal, by an interesting reference perhaps to Rule 133 of the ICC rules of procedure, and to dealing with points of jurisdiction.  I won't read it out because I appreciate that you would prefer probably to read it yourselves in French, but Rule 133 and Rule 58, which is the -- has the necessary criteria, which quite plainly and more clearly states that rules relating -- or questions relating to jurisdiction necessarily have to precede, as one might reasonably have thought, trial proper.  So we draw those matters to your attention, Madam President. 

The position remains this:  that we are in a mess. 

At an earlier stage, we, representing the interests of Dr. Rwamakuba, joined the oral motion that was made to this Court with respect to mistrial or commencing de novo.  We today repeat our concerns in respect of the position that we find ourselves in.  We find ourselves, we submit, in a mess, and we submit and resubmit that the most appropriate way forward is to start this trial again, to put the matter off, to settle these outstanding matters and to start the matter again, to have the Prosecution, having had this full indictment put on the last occasion, reopen the case in respect of their new theories and call their evidence thereafter. 

At present, we are assured that there is perhaps a residue of protective rights for the Defence, which rests entirely on recall of witnesses that have already given evidence.  First of all, the recall of witnesses to give evidence is, in our submission, an unsatisfactory way of dealing with witnesses.  Secondly, we submit that where there has been witness evidence, as there has here, and then an indictment that is so radically different that the entire body of the indictment has to be read on the 
re-initial appearance, underscoring how radical a difference it was, that there must be a presumption of prejudice against the interests of the Accused in respect of prior testimony.  We, for our part, seek, for example, the recall of all those witnesses who gave evidence in relation to Dr. Rwamakuba at Butare hospital.  They were significant witnesses, and their evidence is now seen, or has to be seen, against a different template, a radically different template, a radically wider kind of allegation, and different allegations and new allegations, which has been acknowledged already. 

We submit that we are not content at present with the faint promise of recall, and we are also concerned as to whether recall will, in any event, be effected.  We note, for example, that Witness RO was due to give evidence in the Butare case.  I remind you that Witness RO provided 11 statements, the majority of them dealing with Kanyabashi and Shalom.  She has not been called in that case.  I'm not going to go into what possible reasons are.  I'm not privy to them.  But one is immediately on one's guard.  One is immediately concerned. 

So we are in a mess, and it's going to be a continuing unravelling of difficulty.  This is the -- the mother's ball of wool that's run away, and it's run away and it's been kicked around now, and somehow someone has got to ravel it all up together and hope that it's going to be in as good condition at the end of the day as it was at the beginning, and I have gravest doubts.  So we reach a point where we say, "Look, in our submission, let's be clear cut about this and wholly effective.  Let's, in fact, grab the nettle here," because it is an unpleasant nettle, "Let's restart.  Let's give time for the necessary solution to the various radical issues that are before this Chamber.  Let's assist the Chamber in that respect.  Let's start again." 

Those are my reflections and indeed my position in respect of Dr. André Rwamakuba.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Hooper. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor to respond. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'd like to begin by saying that -- commenting on the absence of the Accused here today, which I would urge this Court to recognise as an outrage.  It's deliberate obstructionism on the part of the Accused.  This Court and this Tribunal went to great expense to organise an initial appearance for the Accused on the 23rd of February; that was at the insistence of the Defence that their initial appearance occur before we recommence the trial.  Counsel were brought from the four corners of the globe in order to convene here to enforce the rights of the Accused, and they did not show up.  We spent three hours reading an indictment basically to an empty room.  The indictment being read aloud was to guarantee the rights of the Defence.  The Defence did not even respect this Court with their presence, and they are doing the same thing again.  

The absence of the Defence -- excuse me, the absence of the Accused is no impediment for us moving forward today.  There are other serious arguments that this Court must consider, but the disdain that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, André Rwamakuba, Édouard Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera have displayed to this Court and to the parties in this proceeding is certainly no basis for delaying the trial. 

In terms of what seems to be a common theme through most of the Defence applications, that of the alleged nullity of the indictment, the confusion about the status of the indictment, the Prosecutor does not share that view at all.  This Court issued an order on, I believe it was the 13th of February.  In any case, an indictment was filed on the 18th of February.  That is the indictment that governs this proceeding.  There is no legitimate argument that there was a nullity in the proceedings, that there was any gap in the indictments that were governing this trial. 
Clearly -- clearly -- if there was an issue of the indictment being a nullity or of there being a gap in the accusatory instrument that governs this proceeding, the defendants would have been set free.  One of the purposes of the indictment is to allow this Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over the person of the Accused.  If there was a question about the status of the indictment, that question would have been translated into this Court releasing the defendants.  That did not take place because it's clear that there is a valid indictment governing these proceedings.  This Court has already pronounced itself on that question. 

Mr. Hooper and Mr. Robinson seem to complain that somehow the case has radically expanded now, with the amendment.  We don't see it that way at all.  The case, in fact, has narrowed.  The allegations against the Accused are more focused.  They are easier to defend against; they are easier to prove.  It facilitates the trial to have a more specific indictment, and we have endeavoured to do that.  

The argument that joint criminal enterprise pleadings have expanded the case is simply fallacious.  The original indictment, the one that was filed in August of 1998, was itself pleaded on a joint criminal enterprise theory of Prosecution. 
	(Pages 1 to 16 by Mark Porter)




















	1015H
MR. WEBSTER:
I responded to this issue at least twice in writing.  The only difference is that now we are calling 
co-perpetration by the name that the Appeals Chamber has told us is more appropriate, which is a joint criminal enterprise.  But it is common purpose pleading, acting in concert, co-perpetration, and the nomenclature "joint criminal enterprise" does not change the nature of the accusation.  

If we look at paragraph 6.104 of the original indictment, that spells out exactly the case that the Defence had to meet, and that is going as far back as August 1998.  So in that respect, the case has not grown any wider; it has simply become more focused.  

There is only one aspect of the joint criminal enterprise pleadings that varies a bit from the original indictment, and that has to do with charges of sexual violence, because the sexual violence in rape charges are conceptualised on a category III, joint criminal enterprise, pleading but that also has not expanded this case.  It simply has clarified exactly how the Prosecutor will prove the rape aspect of this case.  So those arguments, we offer, Your Honour, do not stand ground.  This case can go forward. There is no reason to delay the trial.  The trial -- excuse me.  The new indictment -- the amended indictment has facilitated matters, and has enhanced this Court's ability to manage the trial.  

I would like to address some of the disclosure issues that were raised by counsel.  I will start with 
	Mr. Robinson.  He went through a lengthy recitation.  I'll try to be brief.  

In terms of the service of the videotapes -- of the CD-ROMS of videotapes that he received this morning, these are essentially new items.  This is not a situation where the Prosecutor has withheld the disclosure or has tried to frustrate disclosure.  In fact, the video -- the CD-ROMS that were served this morning only recently came into the possession of the Office of the Prosecutor.  He had previously requested video footage of the meeting of the 15th of November 1992.  That was provided on the 12th of March.  That was a very abbreviated videotape.  That was what we had in our archives at that time.  Since that date, we have obtained new footage, and that new footage was disclosed to him this morning, according to his statement.  We served it on CMS sometime last week.  He picked it up this morning.  But, in any case, he is getting much more than he asked for, because when he made his initial request, that material did not even exist in our archives.  That is something that we have only recently come into possession of.  The same thing with some of the witness statements that he is complaining of; some of those witness statements were only taken two or three weeks ago.  So it is quite impossible for us to serve witness statements in September of 2003 when they were only taken, in some cases, three or four weeks ago.  

Even with respect to those witness statements, he complains of unfair surprise of being denied an opportunity to prepare adequately when he knows quite well that he met with those witnesses.  In fact, despite the many exchanges that I had had with Mr. Robinson, the only one that I directed to him that did not generate a response from him is when I directed him not to have contact with protected Prosecution witnesses that were related to the Accused.  He disregarded that request.  He did not acknowledge that request, and the same witness statement that he is complaining of right now was taken from witnesses that he saw in spite of the fact that he knew that they were protected Prosecution witnesses.  This occurred some weeks ago when he was in Ruhengeri with his investigator.  It is an issue that this Court needs to be concerned with.  

Even with respect to Witness GFA, Mr. Robinson complains that he has not been allowed an opportunity to see GFA.  That is certainly not the case.  WVSS, through David Chappell, had a conversation with Witness GFA, which is the procedure that was set down or outlined by this Tribunal -- by this Trial Chamber, in fact.  Based on the conversation between David Chappell and GFA, GFA refused to see Mr. Robinson.  He was unequivocal.  Mr. Robinson -- excuse me.  Mr. Chappell communicated that to Mr. Robinson.  Mr. Robinson insisted upon seeing the witness, when the witness quite clearly stated he did not want to have any contact with the Defence attorney.  This has nothing to do with my intervention.  I simply assured Mr. Chappell that as long as the witness's response was unequivocal, it was not in the interest of the witness's security and sense of well-being to impose Mr. Robinson's presence upon him.  I had no conversation with the witness concerning 
	Mr. Robinson's request.  That conversation was between the witness and WVSS, and it is not an issue.  

Concerning the statements that some of our witnesses have made to Rwandan authorities -- and, in this case, again, it is for GFA -- on Friday a large package arrived in Arusha from Kigali.  That package contained a number of Rwandan witness statements.  The Prosecutor has made best efforts to obtain those statements.  I called numerous times to Kigali.  I even violated the procedures for contacting officials in the Rwandan government.  I did everything that was possible to expedite the delivery of those statements, and they finally arrived in Arusha on Friday.  

On Saturday I contacted the registry here in Arusha, and I had someone come in over the weekend to make sure that that box was delivered to me, because, usually, it does not happen until the following Monday.  When I opened that box, it contained so many statements that were in disarray -- they were all in Kinyarwanda -- I did not have the capacity to go through them and organise them or even identify what witnesses were represented in that batch.  I understand that the batch that I received this week, and it's only half, that there is another package and materials that is expected to arrive from Kigali, but it is going to take at least a week or so to organise those materials and to identify them.  I cannot even identify what witness is making what statement.  It is all in Kinyarwanda.  It is going to require the assistance of Kinyarwanda speakers in order to decipher what exactly is contained in those boxes.  It is not going to be available for testimony that we expect this week and next week. 

I am not sure -- I have no way of knowing, if GFA statements are contained in that box.  This Court cannot afford to wait to wade through those materials in order to provide statements, for we don't even know the probative value, or as Mr. Robinson would have, the exculpatory value.  There is nothing that guarantees that simply because a witness has made a prior statement, that it contains anything that is exculpatory.  

As for the translations, Your Honours, the Office of the Prosecutor provides its own statements in French and English, the two working languages of the Tribunal.  When it comes to the question of providing statements from Rwandan authorities, those statements in Kinyarwanda are in the language that the Accused understands.  Quite often, we provide French translations.  We have to prioritise our request to the language section.  And if, because of the overload of work that they face, they are unable to provide English translations, there is nothing that we can do about it.  Translation is the responsibility of the registry.  

The legal requirement is to provide documents in the language that the Accused speaks.  Most of the documents that have not been translated, that Mr. Robinson complains of, have been provided to him in Kinyarwanda and in French.  If he is not able to put together a Defence team that can adequately work in French and English, that is his problem and his fault.  It is not something that this Court needs to intervene with, certainly not to hold up these proceedings because he cannot understand the statements.  His client can certainly understand the statements, and he can hire a language assistant to assist him.  

As for inspection of exhibits, Mr. Robinson clearly stated that my office had contacted him and suggested that we conduct an inspection of certain materials this afternoon.  So it makes very little sense to complain this morning about a procedure that has not yet taken place but which has been scheduled.  

Concerning Witness G, there are a number of transcripts that have only recently become available to me, and these, I believe, are what Mr. Robinson refers to as the interviews with the foreign government.  I do have those materials in my possession now.  We are ready to serve them on the Defence, but it is simply a question of deciding whether those materials should be served in redacted or unredacted form.  If parties and this Trial Chamber can come to an agreement that Witness G will, in fact, testify towards the end of May, then my office will make arrangements to serve those materials in unredacted form.  If, however, the parties and the Trial Chamber cannot come to that agreement, and it is likely or it is possible that we will not take Witness G's testimony, then we will have to make a decision or devise the means of making that material available to the Defence in redacted form.  

Given the tenor of Mr. Robinson's response, I would think that we will be taking testimony from Witness G towards the end of the month.  We can make the disclosures in a timely basis.  I don't anticipate any problem with fully complying with the disclosure requirements in order to take testimony from Witness G.  I believe I have addressed all of the issues that are outstanding from Mr. Robinson, but -- 

I would like to address some of the issues raised by Mr. Roach.  On the issue of the pending motions before the Appeals Chamber, we have the motion for mistrial and the motion to start the trial de novo.  Those are not issues that I would agree should delay the trial of this matter, Your Honour.  

Mr. Robinson's request that we resolve all outstanding preliminary motions is something, however, that concerns us.  The Prosecutor is ready to proceed.  We would encourage this Court to proceed or ask for caution or take caution on the issue of the preliminary motions which we feel should be resolved before we continue taking testimony in this case.  We are not asking for the matters to be delayed.  We are not asking for an adjournment.  We are simply pointing out to the Court our concern that these preliminary issues be resolved before we take additional testimony from the witnesses.  If you give me one moment, please -- 

Your Honours, I think I have addressed everything, all of the disclosures have been resolved concerning the witnesses that are upcoming this week, and that is GFA and GBU.  There is nothing concerning disclosure that should prevent us from moving forward.  

Just to reiterate, the only issue, as I see it, is that of resolving all outstanding preliminary motions.  We will respect and follow the Court's guidance on that score.  The Prosecutor is ready to proceed or anxious to proceed.  This case can go forward, and on that basis, I would conclude my remarks.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

Mr. Robinson, do you want to add something, very briefly, please? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like to ask for a recess for about 30 minutes.  I have just been handed, by the registry employees circulating in this courtroom, three decisions of the Trial Chamber that are dated today with respect to preliminary motions.  They are in French.    I just got them a few minutes ago, and I don't think it is productive to continue the Status Conference without having a chance to read these and so I can comment on them.  So I would ask that we have a 30 minutes recess so that we can deal with the material which has now been handed.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is closing this Status Conference.  We shall indeed observe a break of half an hour, and we shall resume soon, but this will be under an open ordinary session.  We are, however, surprised to hear the Prosecutor state that with regard to the preliminary motions, the Chamber needs to respond before the appearance of witnesses, because, as we have not responded -- if we had not responded to all your motions, it is because we are waiting for the responses from the Prosecutor, and so we rendered our decisions in places where we had all the information, in other words, from the Defence and the Prosecution.  As for the others, we are awaiting the reactions of the Prosecutor and we shall render our decisions thereupon.  

We do recall that we have rendered some 50 decisions in this trial so far, and we have done all that is necessary so that decisions are rendered in time.  We have received motions rather belatedly, and we have done our best.  That is what I can say with regard to what needs to be said.  

I see the Prosecutor with his hand up. 

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, what do you wish to add?
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  My concern is not so much that the Court is not -- I would like the Trial Chamber to understand our position.  We are not complaining that the Court has not issued its decision.  We understand that we have not responded to the motion.  We have not responded because all of the Defence motions arrived at the same time, at the last minute, on the 24th of March.  

	The Defence took 30 days to assemble at least eight or nine motions, and some of them are really, you know, a bit complicated, and which is not to say that they raised substantive issues, but they still raised issues that we have to respond to in order to protect the record for purposes of appeal two or three years down the line.  So our concern is really one of addressing these issues seriously and reasonably.  

We would like to start the trial.  We are ready the start the trial.  We have witnesses here, so we are certainly not trying to slow things down.  Our concern is that we simply have not been able to respond to all of these motions in the way that we prefer because we have got too many of them at the last moment.  There are two responses that we expect to file today.  Clearly, the Court cannot respond to the motions until we respond.  These are the types of motions that, under ordinary circumstances, we would request more time to respond.  We are not going to do that.  We are going to respond as quickly as we can, but it is only because we want to drive these things -- these procedures in our trial forward, but under any of the circumstances, we would want more time to respond to motions that were raised by the Defence.  But we thank the Court, and we are trying to push things ahead.  So, please, do not see my comments as any disrespect for the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just to specify with regard to the Prosecutor that, in principle, he has until this afternoon to file his responses, and that if he is unable to do so, he should at that point in time file a motion for further time.  We are, therefore, going to close this Status Conference, and we shall resume in half an hour so that we can see what way forward.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, by asking for the recess to read your decisions, I also didn't mean that I didn't have something to say with respect to Mr. Webster's remarks, but if I could just be very brief.  

First of all, I want to say that the decisons that you've rendered -- and I haven't read them yet -- you didn't give us a chance to reply to the Prosecutor's submissions.  I just received his responses today, and we have five days to file a reply, and you didn't give us -- these are motions I filed a week early, a week before the deadline, and I think that that's very unfair that we don't have a chance to reply.  These motions of Mr. Rwamakuba, Mr. Karemera that I didn't even see until today, they were not served on me by the registry, and I haven't had a chance to file anything, and I have five days to do that.  It is very unfair for you to make rulings without giving us enough time.  I filed motions in July of last year and you hadn't ruled on for months and months, and to make rulings on motions without giving us an adequate time to be heard, I protest that.  

I want to say that Rule 72 is very clear that the trial cannot commence until all preliminary motions are disposed of, and to go ahead with these motions that haven't even been ruled on, in the face of that Rule is wrong.  It's unfair.  It is acting with impunity, which is absolutely wrong, and I'd ask that you do not do that.  

I want just to comment to Mr. Webster's claim that I met with protected witnesses, because that is patently false.  I met with witnesses in Rwanda who had never been -- I had never been told they were Prosecution witnesses, who had never appeared on any witness list, we had never had any statements of these witnesses disclosed, and I had no idea -- because of this failure of disclosure of the Prosecution, I had no idea that they were Prosecution witnesses.  
During the course of my interviews with them, they never even mentioned that they had even been interviewed by the Prosecutor.  And it was only after that that Mr. Webster complained that I was meeting with Prosecution witnesses, but he had never disclosed any statements of these people, never put them on a witness list.  So how am I supposed to know that I am meeting with Prosecution witnesses?   And I told Mr. Webster that if he didn't want me meeting with Prosecution witnesses, he better tell me who they are, and he didn't do so in that case, and I resent the implication that I did anything wrong.  

I notice in these motions that in at least two of them, I see reference to Rule 73(F) that I am not being paid for some of these motions.  And I want to indicate to the Trial Chamber that I am going to be seeking to appeal these kinds of sanctions, which are completely one-sided and unfair, and I just make a note of that.  

I also want to indicate that with respect to the new disclosures that Mr. Webster has now revealed, that he received from the Rwandan government and even more on their way, I am very happy to hear that.  I think that is very significant, and it make no sense whatsoever to continue the trial and then have the statements produced to us at some later time.  This is another reason why we should not be continuing with this trial until we have complete disclosure.  There are now materials in the possession of the Prosecutor, and pursuant to Rule 66(A)(ii), they must be disclosed to us.
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have heard you.  Please be very brief because we have taken all our time from nine o'clock to listen to what you have to say.  So, please, be very brief if you still have further comments to make.  We were indeed going to consider all that you have said here, and that is why we believe that that break for half an hour is indeed necessary.  

Yes, please, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President.  Just for the record, because otherwise it wouldn't be clear on the record, I just received a few minutes ago, and after my submissions to you this morning, your decision "Relative â la requête de Joseph Nzirorera aux fins de l'ajournement du procés."  I wasn't aware of that decision before I addressed you.  

I think, Madam President, you'd probably appreciate it that those decisions, which were in fact dated today, have only come into our hands a moment ago, but I was unaware of that decision when I addressed you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We take due note of what you have said, Counsel.  This session stands adjourned.
