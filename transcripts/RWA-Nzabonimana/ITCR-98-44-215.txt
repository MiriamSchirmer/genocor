MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday the          13th of December 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba; Case Number, ICTR98-44C-T. 

Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, I'm missing Mr. Hooper. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
He is here.  He is here. 
MR. HOOPER: 
We make our entrances, our exits.  In relation to -- all right, so I have beaten the gun here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, you will observe that we have a new addition to the registry team here this morning.  And I would like to invite Mr. O'Donnell to introduce himself and make a brief comment on the Guindo application.  
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I hope that you will allow me to remain seated so that I can reach the microphone.  My name is O'Donnell; and I'm the acting deputy registrar.  And I understand that yesterday Mr. Hooper made an application before this Court to obtain the attendance of the commandant of the UNDF as a witness for the Defence.  

I understand that the Court suggested to the Defence that they make an application in the usual way to the registry first.  I, therefore -- pursuant, presumably, to that recommendation, I received a letter which says, "Dear Registrar, I'm writing to request your assistance in obtaining the attendance of -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, please; slowly, slowly.  I'm sorry, we can't -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, a bit more slowly. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
I beg you pardon.  

"I'm writing to request your assistance in obtaining the attendance of Saidou Guindo, commandant of the UNDF as a witness for the Defence.  We hope to reach him at 8:45 on Friday.  Sincerely,         David Hooper."

Your Honours, the application in that form puts me in some difficulty, because our jurisdiction, as in many jurisdictions, does require a decision to be made at a senior level before a staff member can give evidence.  If in this particular -- as in this particular incident -- incidence, the staff member has witnessed or played a part whilst carrying out his duties as an ICTR employee, then this does raise serious issues which the registrar has to address; but at the same time, ICTR has a responsibility to ensure that the interests of justice are fair, and it recognises that it has a duty to assist the Court process where it is possible and proper to do so.  

In this particular instance, the application which I received contained no information about the substance of the evidence, or the testimony that was required.  It gave me no historical background to the matter and how it came about that the commandant was expected to give evidence as soon as Friday.  I don't wish, of course, on behalf of the registry, to disrupt your schedule, but I do require, before I can make a proper decision in this matter, a great deal more evidence from the proposed calling party.  And in particular, I need to then prepare an official statement which contains whatever is required by the Defence.  

And in this case Mr. Hooper, this morning, told me that the substance of the matter, apparently, is two simple facts.  One is the shoe size of the Accused; and the other is the question of whether the Accused wore glasses both before and -- well, at the time of his admission and after his admission to the UNDF.  My suspicion is that these are relatively uncontroversial facts, and that it would be very surprising, indeed, that once a statement had been prepared officially and signed by the commandant of the UNDF, or whoever knew -- had information about the matter, it would be very unusual for that statement not to be accepted.  

And if it were not accepted by the parties -- and Mr. Hooper has indicated to me in this particular instance he does not think it will be -- then, certainly the registry would take very strong steps, indeed, at the highest level to ensure that the statement was accepted, unless there were very compelling reasons for it not to be.

So, that is what my position is, Your Honours.  As I say, I think it is possible to make progress on the matter, but I don't believe, without more assistance from counsel, I will be able to do it by 8:45 on Friday.  
MR. HOOPER: 
First of all, I would like to thank Mr. O'Donnell for his assistance in this, and also may I say to             Mr. Guindo, who has been extremely helpful and cooperative.  

On the 13th of November I wrote to the commandant enclosing a draft statement of fact, and inviting him to have it signed by either himself or an appointed delegate.  And the statement merely referred to having examined the records of the UNDF, and from those records being able to provide the height and weight of André Rwamakuba at about the time that he was received into the UNDF in 1998.

In respect of spectacles, I wanted the -- requested the authorities at the UNDF to confirm that at the time of his reception, André Rwamakuba did not wear -- or, rather, did not have in his possession any spectacles; that he was first prescribed spectacles a year later, when he was in the UNDF; and whether anyone, particularly the commandant, was in a position to comment on the extent of his use of spectacles.

I received a letter very promptly from the commandant in which he provided all of that information.  He confirmed the position in respect of spectacles, and he added that he had not, in fact, noticed -- or barely ever noticed Rwamakuba using his new spectacles at all in the five or six years since.

I presented this document to the Prosecution, who true to form in this case, if I may say so, could not bring themselves to make an admission in any way.  I notice Ms. Fall was concerned about the witness wearing earphones; I don't see how this can possibly jeopardise or compromise the witness, if I may continue?  The Prosecution, it may be remembered, when we submitted our list of admissions earlier this year, even refused to admit the calendar, even refused to admit the fact that the RPF and FAR were fighting from the 7th of April.  So, I must say, it was with a certain degrees of pessimism that I provided them with this simple statement concerning the basic facts relating to André Rwamakuba.  And I'm afraid they met, in full, my pessimistic outlook.  

Now, if Mr. O'Donnell could prevail upon an intransient prosecution to, in fact, perhaps accommodate us, save Mr. Guindo the inconvenience, if not, perhaps, embarrassment of giving evidence, then perhaps all parties could be satisfied on this point.  And I am sure the Chamber would prefer that such matters could be dealt with in a proper and professional manner without having to be dragged yet again before the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, it is not necessary to respond. 

You know, I must say that I do not think that this is an appropriate use of court time.  And this is a meeting which could have taken place between Mr. Hooper and Mr. O'Donnell outside of the time.  It is a purely administrative issue.  

Now, Mr. O'Donnell, what is next step?  
MR. O'DONNELL:
If we receive the evidence, the information that we require, we will try to get the statement accepted; otherwise, Mr. Guindo will not come here on Friday at 8:45.  I cannot allow it.  Of course, the Court can make an order to the effect, if it wishes to do so. 
MR. HOOPER: 
May I just add that Mr. Guindo, with the cooperation I have come to expect from him over the years, when I saw him in the carpark about a week ago, I said.  "There is a bit of a snag the Prosecution isn't accepting it."  He said to me, "I will be very happy to come along and talk on behalf of Mr. Rwamakuba;" I was very heartened by that reply. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, now that the administrative process has been clarified, I think that you will take the necessary steps. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, yes, I'm afraid I didn't -- the reason I didn't see Mr. O'Donnell yesterday was lack of time.  I'm not sure where that statement is, and I thought that probably Mr. Guindo and Mr. Everard would -- well, anyway, would between them, would have -- Mr. Everard would have become acquainted with the situation; I hadn't realised that he hadn't.  But, yes, certainly, so I'm not even sure what I am expected to do now, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think we have given you as much assistance as we could.  And I think the ball is in your court now. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  This is the Judge speaking to you.  

THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and I'm sorry you had to witness a few housekeeping matters that we had to address before your testimony commenced; but we are now ready to resume hearing you.  I must remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began yesterday. 
THE WITNESS:
Agreed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. O'Shea, we are in open session now. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Can we resume in closed session now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how much longer do you need, and what is the reason for it?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
I am still in the location that I was yesterday.  And it will still be too close to the witness's identity, having regard to the other factor that I mentioned yesterday.  I believe that it should be about half an hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will resume in closed session.  For the benefit of the public, the testimony that the witness is giving is considered capable of revealing his identity.  And we go into closed session for that purpose.  It is likely to last for half an hour longer.  We will go into closed session now.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 6 to 13] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. O'SHEA: 
Are we in open session now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are in open session. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, Witness, if I can just state that we are in open session.  So if I ask you any question which you feel might reveal your identity, can you please alert me?  I will be watching it, the Judges will be watching it, and the Prosecution will be watching it, but you also have to watch it yourself. 
A.	All right.  That is fine.   
Q.	And try not to refer to details which could compromise your position.
A.	All right. 
Q.	Now, you arrived in Bumbogo, and you are brought there by the RPF.  And can we put a date on when you arrive in Bumbogo; if you remember? 
A.	The 17th or the 18th, if I remember correctly.  So, we went on living there.  And it is the RPF soldiers who informed us that it would be well for us to join the others.  What others these were we found out in due course.  So we went up to Bumbogo, and we met a great many of the people who had left the parish at the time of the killing, of the massacre, especially women and children who had not been killed.  So that was the 17th, or the 18th. 
Q.	Right.  When we are referring to the larger location, let us refer to it as Gikomero commune.  And that is how it has been frequently referred to in this case.
A.	Yes, all right.  Okay. 
Q.	Now, did you find refugees at Bumbogo? 
A.	Yes, we found many people who had been able to escape the Gikomero massacres.  I think some people had to pay money for that, or take advantage of the confusion to escape.  They were mostly women and children. 
Q.	Now, don't make any reference to your location, at least not to the name of your location, but did you or did you not recognise any of those refugees? 
A.	Many refugees, many women who I had seen in the church before the massacre that occurred; yes, I saw many people I knew.  If you wish, I can give you names; would you like that?  
Q.	I don't think that is necessary, no.  So what else did you observe at Bumbogo? 
A.	A fairly large number of RPF troops.  And, most of all, a lot of noise because there was shooting from where we were to the Kami military camp, which was still held by the FAR; that is, the                      Rwanda Armed Forces, the forces of the former regime, and, of course, the shooting back of the FAR.  It was a horrible situation.  There was a lot of noise.  And we often wondered whether a shell would not fall on us. 
Q.	From your viewpoint or your perspective, where did you think the RPF were at that stage, exactly? 
A.	Part of the RPF was right there with us.  Some of the soldiers had already taken up positions in Rutongo, which forced my companion to join me in Gikomero there, because there was hard fighting.  And I think that those who had taken over Rutongo had also taken Jali, which overlooks Kigali.  

And around Kanombe towards the airports, there were probably RPF troops who were surrounding the town, as the aim was to take over Kigali, as if it were a pincer movement.  At least, this is what I understood afterwards because they did not inform me about the RPF strategy at the time. 
Q.	So, how did you find out about that particular aspect of things afterwards? 
A.	Concerning those who attacked -- were attacking from where we were located, that was clear.  Also, it is the priest who joined me who told me that where he was in Rutongo there had been pitched battles.  Afterwards, I learned from people I knew well that there was also heavy fighting in Jali.  And everyone in Rwanda knows that Kigali was taken from various sides at the same time. 
Q.	Did you say Jali?   Could you spell that, please? 
A.	Jali is J-A-L-Y. 
Q.	And where --  
A.	Sorry, J-A-L-I. 
Q.	And where exactly is Jali located? 
A.	Jali is opposite Rutongo.  When you are in Kigali you must take the Byumba road first, and then go up north, it was in the north of Kigali.  It was north of Kigali.  That is where the telephone premises or infrastructure and radio transmitters are located.  There is also a fairly large military camp there. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Can I please place the Defence sketch map in front of the witness?  I will give him a fresh one because -- I will give you a fresh one because you may have your own specific changes to make to it.  So that will go in as a fresh exhibit.  

What is the situation with Your Honours; are you struggling?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have access -- 
MR. O`SHEA:
Oh, good. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
At least most of us.  
MR. O`SHEA:
Perhaps Your Honours could share, if Judge Byron doesn't mind. 
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
I'm fine.
 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, let me just make this clear to you, Mr. Witness, that this is a sketch map, all right?  So there may very well be inaccuracies; but it is the best representation that we have been able to come up with.  The maps of Gikomero are not terribly good, the official ones.  Perhaps if you could just have a look at that sketch map, I have shown it to you before.  Are there any particular changes that you would like to make to that map, any significant ones, not --  
A.	There is a road missing.  From the place called Gishaka, there is a road parallel to the one who goes to Shango to Kajevuba.  And this is the road on which the RPF arrived, so you must add a road.  I do not know why it does not appear on the sketch, because this road that goes from Shango to Kajevuba does exist.  And then there is a parallel road from Gishaka to Kajevuba which is parallel to the first one.  

I think, on the whole, this is the significant addition that should be made to the map.  If I notice anything else afterwards, I will let you know. 
Q.	So -- 
MR. O`SHEA:
Could the witness please be provided with a pen?
THE WITNESS:
Do you wish me to draw the road?
BY MR. O`SHEA:  
Q.	Yes, sorry, I got distracted for a moment.  Yes, please if you could, please, add that road as best you can.  I realise you are not a topographer, whatever the word is?
A.	Yes, I am not a draftsman.  All right, that is done. 
Q.	So, if we come back to your story, you are at Bumbogo, which is in the centre, towards the bottom half of the map.  And --  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you have your perception of fighting.  How intense was that fighting?  
A.	I do not know how to determine the intensity of fighting, but there was shelling every five minutes.  Every five minutes there was at least one shell that came at us from Kami, or which was fired from Bumbogo, to the extent that when -- when we had a bit of calm, we would say, "Oh, it is quiet now."  But just when we said it, it would start off again.  So it was very heavy.  

Actually, that is why we asked the RPF leader whether he couldn't take us anywhere, somewhere else, because we did not see what else we could be doing there except getting ourselves killed. 
Q.	Now, you mentioned the route to Kajevuba.  Would that be the road that runs on the extreme left-hand side of this sketch map from Kigali, all the way up to the top to Kajevuba? 
A.	Yes, that is the tarred road which comes from Kigali and goes right to Byumba.  Are you referring to the road on which we saw the RPF for the first time, is that what you are asking me?  Because when the RPF arrived, we saw them on that road which I added to the map.  And from all indications, they were coming either from Kajevuba or Gasabo, where it was said that they had been for some time already. 
Q.	Now, if we come to your presence at Bumbogo, you have said that you felt that there were, or there may have been RPF at Kanombe; is that right? 
A.	Yes, certainly, or at least who were moving towards Kanombe.  I wouldn't know where they were coming from, but probably they were coming from the area of Kibungo following by roads.  I don't know what direction they were following at that time.  They got to Kanombe very quickly.  That is where the airport was.  It was an important landmark for their strategy. 
Q.	And where is Kibungo? 
A.	Kibungo is in the east of the country.  It is almost on the frontier with Tanzania.  Do you see the road at the very bottom of the map which goes through Kanombe, Kabuga, Rugenge?  That is the road that goes towards Kibungo.  And this is, I would say, it is about 150 to 200 kilometres from Kigali, although Kibungo is not shown on this map here. 
Q.	To your understanding there would be RPF moving down this road or in that area in the east, and other RPF moving from the north, along side of the Kajevuba route? 
A.	That is right, coming from Byumba -- Kajevuba, I mean; that is right. 
Q.	And then you had also observed the RPF moving down the road that you have marked on the map, on the dates that we were talking about earlier? 
A.	That is the road that they used when they were coming from Kajevuba or Gasabo to get to Bumbogo.  We observed that there was a column, one whole column that had gone passed that place.  Perhaps other troops went passed; certainly others went through Shango, Nduba and all of that because there was quite heavy fighting there as well. 
Q.	Now, you had had some observations of the RPF.  How did they travel?  Did they travel via vehicle, via car, by foot? 
A.	The RPF won the war with their boots and their Matolewa.  They also had equipment, communication equipment that they used.  They took the country on foot.  They could easily do 50 kilometres a day on foot.  I only saw one motorcycle.  They must have stolen that from somewhere.  It had no more petrol; they must have stolen it from somewhere.  But apart from that, they went on foot. 
Q.	And from your perception of things, were they in two or three defined groups, or were they also in smaller groups?
A.	What we saw was a column of soldiers, one after the other, well disciplined.  Certainly there must have been other groups because some must have gone through the west of the commune that is around Sha, Shango and Nduba, and probably also from the east, but this must have come afterwards because there was more resistance from that end, I believe, around the lake. 
Q.	Now, again, be very careful about mentioning your location; but apart from the column of RPF, did you have any personal contact with any specific RPF soldiers? 
A.	Yes.  First when they discovered that there were still two (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal) around -- 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Just a moment; if that could be redacted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So ordered.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, be cautious.
A.	Yes, because where we ended up with the others where I was, of course, under military control, we had contact with soldiers, of course.  It is --  
Q.	And was that the large group or small group? 
A.	There was coming and going.  I think there may have been 100 or so where we were.  It is difficult to say.  We never knew who was who, who was where.  I think there may have been around 100 or so there. 
Q.	And when you saw the column of RPF, how many RPF do you think there were in that column? 
A.	There were RPF, there were 100 or so.  So, these are the people we met up with later on, 100 or so soldiers. 
Q.	So, when you met with the RPF at your location -- again, be very careful -- what -- what date was that? 
A.	The 15th, because they arrived on the 14th.  I may be making mistakes with the dates though.  Well, I think it -- it is the 16th.  They got to the commune on the 15th; but it is only the next day that the first troops went passed where we were, so it was the 16th.  If I am mistaken, it is only by a day.  I think it is the 16th. 
Q.	Do you have any knowledge of when the RPF arrived at Gasabo, if at all?
A.	What I know, is that it was said that they had been there for a while already.  I think they must have been there even before the genocide started, or, in any case, immediately afterwards because we got there very quickly.  But they were well hidden; they did not show themselves until after the killings.  Well, the person who joined me afterwards went passed Kajevuba on the 10th, but afterwards the road was blocked by the RPF.

I think that by the 11th he was in Gasabo in the area near Kajevuba.  
Q.	Now, don't give the name or ethnic group of this person; but did there come a time during these days, from the 9th onwards, when you received a visitor? 
A.	No, I did not receive any visit, no.  Of course, there were refugees; I could see them there, but not visitors. 
Q.	Well, when I used the expression "ethnic group" it was for your protection. 
A.	All right, I understand. 
Q.	Let me come to it in another way.  You mentioned that the road -- the roads to Kajevuba had been closed on the 10th, I think you said; did you say that? 
A.	The 10th or the 11th that is what I suppose because -- on the 10th, the person who was with me was able to get passed, but it was not possible afterwards.  So it is either on the evening of the 10th or on the 11th that Kajevuba was closed. 
Q.	Now, the person who was with you, and don't mention his ethnic group or his name, the person that was with you, when was the first time that you saw him? 
A.	On the 10th when he joined me where I lived.  Coming from Rutongo where he had spent the day with the French -- a friend who was amongst those who came to join me.  So he arrived on the 10th, he arrived at Gashaka on the 10th.  And he said that he had got passed -- or he had gone through Kajevuba, it was the quickest means to come where we were from Rutongo. 
Q.	So he was -- he was originally located where, before he met you? 
A.	He was in Rutongo. 
Q.	And he --  
A.	From the day before. 
Q.	And he wanted to get to where? 
A.	He was intending to spend the night in Rutongo, the night of the 6th to the 7th so that he would go to Kigali on the 7th where we were supposed to have a meeting which, obviously, did not take place in view of the events.  So he was coming from Rulindo, which is further north from Rutongo and does not appear in this map, in the Mugambazi commune. 
Q.	Would it -- would it be -- 
A.	You see Mugambazi commune and then you keep going up outside of the map, and it is somewhat to the north.  That is where he lived, but he went to visit a friend in Rutongo, which is to the south of Mugambazi; and that is where he was taken unawares by the fighting that began after the crash of the president's aircraft.  

And things became so difficult on the 10th, that he decided to find out whether there wasn't more peace where I was.  It wasn't the case, but he wasn't to know that. 
Q.	Now, you have described to the Chamber how when you arrived at Bumbogo, you --  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	You saw RPF and fighting, and having assessed the situation afterwards received information about RPF movements afterwards.  You have the impression that there were RPF on the road where it says "Kanombe", and that the RPF had come down from the left-hand side of the -- what we have called the "Kajevuba route."  Now, from your perception -- 
A.	Yes, yes.  
Q.	If one were to draw a line, I'm not asking you to draw a line, but if one were to draw a line starting from Gishaka secteur, going through Shango, all the way to the left of this sketch map, so take the point which is parallel to Gishaka and Shango on this sketch map, on the left-hand side of the Kajevuba route, in your assessment of the situation, from which dates do you think the RPF might have arrived at that point? 
A.	Certainly not after the 10th, probably before, because they also used all kinds of tactics, by hiding, by using guerrilla warfare.  But it is clear that they were in the region by the 10th, because they were in Rutongo even before the 10th.  So, I would say between the 7th and the 10th they were around there, and that is true.  But it is difficult to give a more exact date, of course.  In order to do that, you had to be part of the army command, which I wasn't. 
Q.	Now, if one wanted to move on this same Kajevuba route, if one wanted to move in the other direction, from Kigali towards Kajevuba, could one do that safely between the 8th and the 18th, which are the dates that you have been discussing? 
A.	I don't think so.  I don't think it could have been feasible, or perhaps on foot, hiding in the sugar cane plantations.  But I think going about in a vehicle, it would have been impossible to get to Kajevuba.  I also think that the person who joined me did not use the main road; at least, not until he got to Kajevuba.  There are other byroads that could have been used; but I do not think he would have been able to use the main tarred road.  It was occupied, and it was very dangerous to go passed there.

1028H 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, you're from the area.  To what extent do you believe a person in a position of authority in Rwanda would have been aware of these dangers? 
A.	I think the risk was very high, and a person with Rwandan authority would not have dared to come to an area where he might be killed, either by a stray bullet or by deliberate shot, because it was a region that was at war at the time.  So this was a place where there was a very high risk. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, I think that will be a convenient moment, if Your Honour pleases. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  How much longer do you think you have? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Forty-five minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will take a short recess.  We take a short midmorning recess.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1057H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not sure if you're going to say "thank you" if I tell you what I'm going to say. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we think it's almost time to apply the guillotine to the examination-in-chief.  How much time do you think you're going to need? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Forty-five minutes, I say with trepidation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the guillotine time.  We break at quarter to 11 -- quarter to 12, and examination must be completed by then. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Right.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, Witness, you've said that the RPF went by foot.  I think the expression you used was with "leurs bottes et leur Matolewa," and that in the early days, from the 7th, they were hidden.  Is there any way that one could be sure that RPF would not be hidden in any particular area in those days, between the 8th and the 16th? 
A.	I don't think it would be possible for civilians to know which way they went or where they were hidden.  But it was certain that they were somewhere.  They were no longer in Uganda.  They were no longer in Byumba.  So they were in the banana trees, in the sugar cane, or everywhere.  I am not an expert in military strategy, you must understand. 
Q.	Now, if you look at the screen to your left, you will see a -- a photograph of a -- an untarmacked road between a range of hills and some banana trees in the front.  Do you recognise that spot? 
A.	Could I go a bit closer because my eyesight isn't very good and --

MR. PRESIDENT:

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Unfortunately, the witness is not speaking directly to the microphone. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.       Witness, you can't be heard.  You have to speak into the microphone. 
A.	It looks to me as though the hills -- the higher hills in the backdrop -- in the background are toward Bumbogo, and the road going down is the road to Gishaka.  I'm not absolutely certain all -- or, it could be the road to Shango.  I can't be more certain than that.  

As to the presence of the banana trees, well, you know that there's no shortage of banana trees in Rwanda.  So it's a bit hard to distinguish one -- a particular place because of the banana trees.
Q.	Yes.  Well, that's a photograph which has been identified as Bumbogo, so that would appear to accord with your recollection.  
A.	Yes, it does look like that to me.  
Q.	Just -- just stay there for one moment.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel.  Sorry.  Counsel, your mic is off. 
MR. O'SHEA:
I know.  I'm talking to another counsel. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	This is a photograph which is taken from Kayanga side towards Gishaka.  Does that ring a bell? 
A.	Yes, quite.  Where the arrow is, that's approximately where I'd situate Gishaka.  And the road that you see is the road down which we saw the RPF coming.  Beyond there's Kilkiazo (phonetic) hill, and beyond that's Kayanga, Rutunga, and if you go around the other side, you'd see Lake Muhazi. 
Q.	And which one of those is Gishaka? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel asked which one of those hills is Gishaka. 
THE WITNESS:
My opinion, it's here in the foreground.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	To me, a hill is just a hill, but there we go.  Thank you.  

If you could go back into the limelight, please.  

Now, if you -- if you look at the map and you go from the point where it says "Kigali," you've got the road going up towards Kajevuba.  The white area is supposed to represent a valley.  Is that a fair representation? 
A.	Indeed, it was a valley along which the road went practically to Kajevuba and then, heading for Byumba, rises much more sharply.  But from Kigali to Kajevuba, it's practically flat, running along that valley, the valley of the Kajevuba, which flows into the Nyabugogo at Kigali.  
Q.	Then there's another road that runs -- a smaller road that runs from Kigali upwards, which I think passes Remera, which is not on the map, the next road to the right.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, quite.  That's the road I'd take very often to go from Kigali to Gishaka.  And it goes through Bumbogo.  Yeah, that's it. 
Q.	And is that a tarmac road or a non-tarmac road? 
A.	From Kigali to Remera, it's tarred, and at the time after Remera, it was no longer tarred.  More recently, part of the road has been asphalted, but at that time it did -- the asphalt stopped at Remera.  It's about a year ago, about a year ago, because it passes Remera prison.  I don't know if that's where it is, but, anyhow, it's been asphalted that far. 
Q.	So in 1994 it would have been tarmacked up to Remera and then non-tarmacked thereafter? 
A.	That's right, after Remera up to Bumbogo and then Gishaka. 
Q.	Now, apart from the road towards Kajevuba and the road passing Kanombe at the bottom and the one we've just mentioned up to Remera, are any other -- are any other of the roads that you can see on the map tarmacked? 
A.	No, there was no other tarred road except the one from -- through Kajevuba, through the one to Kanombe, and the short one to Remera.  The others were all earth roads, at least they were at the time.  
Q.	And how sensible or safe would it have been for a person to have gone from Kigali up the Remera road after the 8th of April? 
A.	You're talking of Kigali-Remera?  Remera is practically -- is still Kigali, in a way.  I was in Gishaka at that time, but I was told that, even between Kigali and Remera, there was fierce fighting because Remera is not far from what was called the CND at the time, the parliament, in other words, the Rwandan parliament, where the 6,000 men of the RPF were based, who had been brought there to protect their politicians in case the broadbased transitional government had been installed.  

Now, of course, when the genocide started, those RPF soldiers emerged from the CND, and very near the CND was the Presidential Guard camp, and there was fierce fighting.  And that's in the Remera district, so probably the road from Kigali to -- to Remera couldn't be very secure.  But I was not able to observe that for myself because, as I told you, when we left Gishaka to try and find out -- to get to Kigali or at least find out what was happening there, I told you what occurred.  
Q.	And then what -- what about after you passed Remera? 
A.	Towards Gishaka? 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...yes.  
A.	There quite probably were roadblocks.  I told you that I encountered one where Karama is indicated on the map, but for the rest of it, I don't know.  But I imagine it was not very safe.  It was probably very difficult to get through.  I was told of a young lady, a former nun, who was able to get to Remera by foot, but with the protection of a RGF soldier, Rwandan government forces soldier.  Because they were on foot, they could skirt the roadblocks, but, otherwise, it was not possible to drive.  There was the RPF, the RGF, the Interahamwe, a little bit of everything.  
Q.	Now, if you go a little more further to the right on this sketch map, along that road which passes Kanombe, there's another little road that goes up.  Do you see that?  So if we go from Kigali directly -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- towards Kanombe, pass Kanombe, and then there's another little road in the bottom of the map that goes up.  Can you say anything about that road? 
A.	It's the road that goes to Ndera parish where the Rubungo commune office was.  It's not a tarred road.  It's a very poor -- the road is in very poor condition.  I don't know as to its safety at the time, but I think the whole region was in -- caught in crossfire between the guns on all sides.  So I don't think one could have taken that road with any certainty of not encountering -- encountering any problems.  It's the road up to Nduba parish and Rubungo communal offices.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...to go up that road would be a risky exercise? 
A.	Rather, quite.  All the more so since, at any rate at that time, it was a very poor road.  I've already been on it.  You can't drive at more than 10 kilometres an hour, there's so many potholes, et cetera, 
	et cetera, et cetera.  
Q.	And if you go a little bit further to the right along that Kanombe road, there's another little road that goes up where it says Rugende.  
A.	Yeah, Rugende.  I took that road one day from the top of the sketch to the bottom -- towards the bottom.  I was at -- I took a wrong turning, but I would never take it again unless you really want to kill yourself, if you want to commit suicide.  It's a very poor road.  It's full of bends and holes.  Sometimes you don't know whether you're on the road -- the road or beside it.  It is really a very poor road.  
Q.	Now, have you heard of something called Deutschevelte? 
A.	There's a place called Deutschevelte.  It's where the German radio Deutschevelte, if you're -- practically underneath where it says "Karama" under Bumbogo.  You keep on going down, and you get there.  It's -- it's just below where it's written "Rubungo" in small letters.  It's near the Kami camp, where the military police was who were fighting the RPF -- who were fighting the RPF in Bumbogo.  
Q.	So if you were -- if you were a minister in the Rwandan government between the 8th of April and the 16th of April 1994 and you wanted to go up to Gikomero, what would you do?
A.	Right up to Gikomero, you mean?  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...is that something you would do or -- 
A.	No, no.  I don't think I'd take that road -- road.  I don't think I'd get there unless you gave me a helicopter that could fly high enough to avoid the shelling from both sides.  No, we didn't see any vehicles there after the 10, 12th of April.  We saw no more vehicles.  It was no longer possible.  No, these are not roads to take in time of war.  
Q.	So after the 10th, did you -- did you observe anybody coming from Kigali at all? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	No.  After the 10th did you observe anybody coming from Kigali at all at your location?  Don't mention the name.  
A.	No, no, no, no, no, absolutely not.  Well, yes, on the 13th, I think, four or five RGF soldiers came.  I don't know where they came from, whether it was Kigali, Kanombe, or elsewhere.  But they came with the communal pickup truck, so there they must have been in the area anyhow.  They came -- they couldn't have come from Kigali.  

They came; they stayed there for about an hour.  I think they were reconnoitering, wanted to know what the military situation was, and they drove off again.  I don't know very well where they drove off to or what happened to them subsequently. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...and you don't know where they came from? 
A.	No, but there have been soldiers for some time before, RGF soldiers in the hills who were so-called ensuring safety.  Perhaps they came from there, Bumbogo, Nduba.  I don't know.  But, in any case, the vehicle that brought them was the communal vehicle.  So they couldn't have come from very far away.  Not very far from -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...now, you were in the area of Gikomero commune.  You are among people who came from various secteurs, potentially all of the secteurs (microphone not activated).  Did you ever hear of a man called Dr. André Rwamakuba coming to Gikomero commune between the 
	8th of April and the 16th or 17th of April when you were still in the region? 
A.	No, I did not hear mention of the presence of Dr. -- Dr. André Rwamakuba during that period, or even before.  The last time I was aware that he -- that he came to the commune was when he came to present his project that we talked of yesterday, the community health project he put forward to the development council, which was very much before.  I did not hear of his presence in Gikomero in April I (sic) -- afterwards or before. 
Q.	And you've continued to spend time in Rwanda since these events.  Have you ever heard Dr. André Rwamakuba's name before hearing about this case?  Have you ever heard about Dr. André Rwamakuba's name being implicated in killings in Gikomero commune after the events? 
A.	No, I have not heard Dr. André Rwamakuba mentioned.  I must say that I didn't even know that he'd become a minister.  I was not aware of that.  I must say no, that I did not hear him talked of, mentioned, neither during, neither before, nor after.  
Q.	Can you name some of those that you did hear were principally responsible for massacres within the commune? 
A.	The main perpetrator who planned at the communal level in the commune was the communal accountant, Mathias.  And the brigadier, Michel Nyarwaya, and his deputy for the Gishaka secteur, it's Mathias's brother, Ephrem.  They are the main ones I've heard mentioned, referred to, or whom I saw as being the main perpetrators of the attacks.  But not people from outside, I don't think, because Gikomero was not a strategic place for massacres to be organised, really.  
Q.	And those two individuals, where would they have been located at the beginning of the genocide?  Would they have come from Kigali, or would they have come from within the commune? 
A.	You're speaking of the people whose name I mentioned; is that it?
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	Yes, well, they were people who lived in Gikomero commune, worked there.  Mathias was the communal accountant.  He lived in Kayanga.  Michel Nyarwaya was the communal policeman -- the brigadier in charge of the communal policemen.  I think he lived in Rutunga or Kayanga.  He lived over there.  And Ephrem had a little business in Gishaka very near the parish.  

I think those are the three I mentioned, so really are locals. 
Q.	And among any others that you may have heard about as being perpetrators, or experienced as being perpetrators, did those individuals come from within the commune or Rubungo commune or did they come from Kigali, to your knowledge? 
A.	I failed to understand the question.  The people I've -- I've just mentioned the names of three people who were organisers of the killings in Gikomero.  I've told you that they are Gikomero people, inhabitants of Gikomero.  I did not understand the question you put to me. 
Q.	Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, from what you heard during the events, or from what you observed during the events, were there any perpetrators of massacres within the commune who came from Kigali during the genocide, or were they all locals or from neighbouring communes? 
A.	I heard no one else mentioned, apart from the people I mentioned and, also, that paramilitary, who probably came from Kanombe, but I did not know his name, and maybe also that chap claiming to be lieutenant, who was from Rutongo commune.  

But from Kigali itself, I saw no one.  I think the Kigali people did not show themselves.  Gikomero was really the back of beyond.  There was not much point in going out there to kill people, from the point of view of a politician.  
Q.	If you were told today that Mr. Rutaganira, the bourgmestre, was with Dr. André Rwamakuba and the two of them were inciting the killing of Tutsis and organising the killing of Tutsis within the commune during events and shortly prior to the events, what would be your reaction to that statement? 
A.	As regards Rutaganira, the bourgmestre, I would say that he did not have enough punch, did not have enough personality, to organise -- leave alone massacres, but to organise anything in the commune.  It was someone who did not have sufficient personality to be a leader of men.  

As to André Rwamakuba, I don't think he was a man to do such things.  He's a technician, a doctor, a technocrat.  He was not a politician.  I don't see André Rwamakuba in the role of a killer or of an organiser of killings.  And I don't see why he would have joined hands with Rutaganira, Telésphore, because I don't think they knew each other very well.  They must have been acquainted, but really not more than that.  So I don't very well see how could they -- could be considered as together, two of them, perpetrators of genocide. 
Q.	And if someone were to say to you today that Dr. André Rwamakuba was with Brigadier Nyarwaya and Mathias Rubanguka, inciting the killing of Tutsis and organising massacres within the commune, what would be your reaction? 
A.	Well, I would doubt that.  There are ways of knowing whether it is true, whether it is grounded or not, because Mathias is still alive.  He's in prison.  We can always put the question to him.  It would seem that Michel Nyarwaya died in Kibuye prison, where he was detained.  But as regards Mathias, you'd have to put the question to him, whether he accepts to testify.  But I don't see André Rwamakuba in that situation of planner or, indeed, participant in massacres.  
Q.	When you were in your location, and don't mention the name, did you observe or hear about public meetings or rallies where persons in positions of authority were inciting the killing of Tutsis in the period September 1993 to March 1994? 
A.	I did not hear mention of any political rallies along the lines you've mentioned.  Of course, there were people that might have wished for killings even then, but I did not hear of any public political rallies inciting hatred.  
Q.	Did you hear of meetings of the MDR within the commune during that same period, September 1993 to March 1994? 
A.	I did not hear about any rallies organised by the MDR or any other parties.  But I'd be surprised that the MDR was organising rallies because, in Gikomero commune, the MDR was very small and people, I do not believe, would -- I do not believe people would have gone to listen to what the MDR had to say.  I think people were more MRND than MDR. 
Q.	And in the period between March and during the genocide itself, did you hear of MDR rallies taking place? 
A.	No, but at that time, in view of the events, there were no further rallies organised by any party.  There were no rallies organised either by the MDR or any other political party, I think from March 1994 to 
	April 1994, I would say. 
Q.	If someone were to say to you today that, in the period prior to the genocide, Mr. Kamuhanda, Mr. Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, that's K-A-M-U-H-A-N-D-A, was present at a political rally with Dr. André Rwamakuba with the purpose of inciting the killing of Tutsis, what would be your reaction? 
A.	I'd be surprised, because Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda was in the MRND.  André Rwamakuba was in the MDR, and these two parties did not at all have the same vision of how the country's politics were to be directed, and in view of the massacres.  So I do not see how they could have met at a political rally during such troubled times as those that preceded the genocide and during the genocide.  So it seems to me a little difficult to understand.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Just a moment, please.  

Mr. Hooper suggests I take my confession, but apart from that, I have no further questions.  And I note that I'm seven minutes early to the guillotine. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  

Now, Mr. Witness, your testimony will come to a conclusion.  You will now be cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  And the -- we're going to have to take a break at 11:45, and we will then resume after lunch at 2:30.  But the Prosecutor will commence cross-examination now.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  I'd like to first, if possible, establish where you resided in 1994, without giving the information.  It was 10 kilometres, was it not, from Gikomero secteur? 
A.	No.  At the time of the genocide?  Is that what you mean? 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	I was one kilometre -- I was one kilometre away from the commune office of that commune. 
Q.	Perhaps we misunderstand each other.  The secteur, Gikomero secteur I'm referring to, not the commune office, which is based in Gishaka, I believe.  
A.	Yes, all right. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Can I just note that, if my friend is going to just pursue this specific distance, there's no problem, but if she's going to ask for different distances between different secteurs, she must be cautious in terms of locating this witness.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I was indeed going to ask for distances between different secteurs, so perhaps if -- I don't think -- if it's worth us going into closed session for two or three minutes, I can complete this area of questioning.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, as long as you don't -- as long as you don't orientate yourself in terms of the location of the witness. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Well, Your Honour, I don't know if -- it would help if I say that what I'm going to ask -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John -- 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Sure. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- I think you should, in a preliminary sense, use your discretion. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know what the issue is.  You try to manage it.  If you run into difficulty, you just appeal to us, and we'll go into closed session. 

Mr. Witness, you also have a role to play.  And if you think that the question is likely to result in a revelation of your identity, you can draw it to my attention. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I would say, to be on the safe side, if we can go into closed session just for three minutes, and then we can complete this part.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We're going to take a recess at 11:45 in any event.  And, for the benefit of the public, I can indicate that we'll now go into closed session for the remainder of our morning session.  We'll resume at 2:30.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 30 to 31] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 21 to 29 by Ann Burum)


(Court resumed at 1444H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  We now resume. 

Madam Prosecutor, you may -- I'm sorry, Ms. Fall.
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President.  

Before we begin, so I don't forget, yesterday I spoke about two documents which I wished to tender regarding the previous witness, A10 -- 17, rather.  I seek to tender those two statements given to the investigators.  The first, 25 June 2005, I believe it should be marked, if I'm not mistaken, P. 82 -- 83, I apologise.  And the second is 3 December 2005, and that should be marked P. 84.  I would also request that both documents be placed under seal because they contain confidential information. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. 83 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. 84 admitted, under seal) 
MS. FALL:
Most obliged, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John, you may proceed. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  I would simply like to start by confirming --
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	-- your current residence.  You have lived there since 1999; is that correct? 
A.	That's absolutely correct. 
Q.	Now, do you recall giving a statement to a Defence investigator in February 2001? 
A.	1991? 
Q.	Yes, yes, of course.  Yes.  Can you recall whether you signed that statement? 
A.	Yes.  The document ends with a legible signature and then my name, so I suppose I did sign it. 
Q.	Do you recall meeting Defence counsel, Mr. Hooper, after this first meeting with the Defence investigator? 
A.	No.  I meant -- I met Mr. Hooper before. 
Q.	Before 2001? 
A.	Pardon?
Q.	Before the year 2001? 
A.	Yes, indeed, before 2001. 
Q.	Can you recall what year this was? 
A.	It must have been 2001 or perhaps 2000.  At any rate, it was before I gave the statement. 
MR. O'SHEA:
If I can just assist, Mr. Hooper says he met this witness about six years ago. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Would I be correct in confirming that would be 1999?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  If Mr. Hooper's recollection is correct, that would be 1999. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed.  I was already in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) at that time. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Can that be redacted from the transcript?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, ordered. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Can you recall whether you gave a statement on this date when you met with Mr. Hooper? 
A.	No.  It was simply a contact visit.  We spoke, but I don't think anything was taken down at that point in time. 
Q.	And did you meet with any other members of the Defence team in Rwanda at any other time, other than on these two occasions? 
A.	Yes.  I met -- we called him an investigator, I believe.  I think he worked for the Defence.  He took down the statement I gave. 
Q.	Can you recall when this was? 
A.	In 2001.  But honestly, the date, I have no idea.  Isn't it indicated on the document?  At any rate, it was in 2001. 
Q.	If I can just clarify, so you met with Defence investigators twice in 2001? 
A.	I believe so, yes. 
Q.	And on both occasions you gave a statement? 
A.	No.  One moment, please.  Let me try to remember.  I think at any rate there were documents produced at each occasion. 
Q.	Do you recall when -- whether on the second occasion in 2001 you signed the document that was produced? 
A.	Yes.  I also believe the first time, normally speaking, yes. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, just to clarify and give you a background, we have been served with just one statement, and a note authored by Mr. Hooper in relation to your second meeting.  But there is no second statement as such.  Now, in your statement that I have, the one statement of 2001 -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Can I just help my friend on this question?  We have one signed witness statement which is from one of our investigators, and then we have one document which is basically a retyping of that statement by a second investigator.  You are welcome to see that, but it is basically exactly the same.  So there is one witness statement, and then there is one investigator's note where the investigator's retyped the original statement. 
THE WITNESS:
That's correct, yes. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
If you have no objection to showing us the retyping, we would be glad to see it. 
MR. O'SHEA:
No objection at all. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I will continue in the meantime. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	In your statement of February 2001, you indicated that you learned from ****************** on the 7th of April about the president's death, and that you told yourself that there were going to be problems.  Do you recall saying this? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, of course.  I remember very well.  Yes. 
Q.	And what made you think there were going to be problems? 
A.	It seemed obvious.  If a shell or something, a missile, kills the plane -- kills the president and downs his plane, it is very obvious that things aren't going to continue as they had prior to that.  

Also, in Rwanda, there were types of problems of that scale.  There weren't always attacks, but when there were problems, things turned ethnic in nature.  I was awaiting refugees at the parish as early as the 7th.  In fact, they began to arrive on the 8th. 
Q.	And when you say "things turned ethnic in nature" -- this is the translation I'm getting -- what exactly did you mean, "Things would turn ethnic in nature"?
A.	I didn't have an ethnic problem.  What I mean is in Rwanda, oftentimes I experienced the same thing in '73.  When there was political chaos, there would be ensuing ethnic problems.  I was not the one who had ethnic problems, but ethnic problems would ensue. 
Q.	Perhaps there was a mistranslation.  I didn't suggest that you were the one who had ethnic problems.  What I am trying to establish is what exactly you meant by "ethnic problems".  Did the different ethnic groups fight against each other as a result of certain events such as, for instance, the death of the president?  What sort of ethnic problems did you anticipate?  Who were the ethnic groups that were going to be involved, and what would entail? 
A.	At that time I didn't know how things were going to manifest themselves.  But what happened thereafter did show that the attack on the presidential plane was the trigger, if you will, for the implementation of the genocide.  The attack was not an isolated phenomenon.  Since 1990 there were problems in Rwanda.  Because of the war the RPF had launched, there were problems between the political parties.  You could feel there was a climate or environment that would generate these problems.  Of course, I didn't know what was going to happen, but you knew that one day or another the powder keg was going to explode. 
Q.	And this climate, if I can say "this climate", of tension which dates to prior to the president's plane crash, did that also purveyed in your commune where you were residing at the time?  
A.	Let me point out first, the tension didn't reach its height after the president died.  It was with the genocide it reached its height.  As I said, the attack on the president was the trigger which led to the genocide, and it seems that genocide had been planned long before by people who wanted to kill the Tutsi. 

In the commune where I lived, ********************, more specifically, already since -- in '92 *******************.  You could see that there were problems to the extent that ****************************** to maintain peace in the commune.  I even told people during ****************************************************, I told them that I had a rope in my car and that day I would use that rope to hang myself if ever I would see that, and that people should not advise (sic) themselves ethnically the point where they start killing each other.  

You could definitely see that the climate was a very bad one.  It went from bad to worse.  The unrest was not surprising to us.  What was surprising was the scope that it took on.  It was genocidal in scope. 
Q.	And did you ever discuss these fears and preoccupations you had with the bourgmestre, Rutaganira? 
A.	Rutaganira.  We spoke about these things.  A few days before the attack on the president, on the 1st of April, more specifically, which was Good Friday, I heard a rumour that things were going to happen.  What exactly, I had no idea.  Now, I knew these things would be directed against the Tutsi ethnic group.  

Now, I went to see Rutaganira, the bourgmestre, who said no, nothing was going to happen.  But he was afraid.  That was all.  And a few days later there was a trigger, but during the meetings in the commune, during various meetings, I always said that peace and security for everyone needed to be maintained. 
Q.	Prior to the president's death on the 6th of April 1994, did you travel to Kigali from Gikomero commune -- from Gikomero commune, that is? 
A.	Yes, of course.  Kigali was the place where we picked up our supplies.  Everyone.  It was not far from Gikomero, 25 kilometres or so, and so I went at least once per week, yes. 
Q.	Are you aware of the number of possible routes there are to Kigali from Gikomero commune in 1994 for a vehicle? 
A.	Essentially two different routes.  Those were the ones I used.  Those were the easiest or the ones that were in the best shape, if I can put it that way.  Bumbogo-Remera-Kigali was 25 kilometres from *************************************************** in Kigali.  I often looked at the odometer on my pickup truck to measure the distance.  The other road was **************-Kajevuba-Kibuye-Kigali.  And then you would meet up with the tarred road.  

There were other ways, but they were small, bad roads.  You didn't really -- or wouldn't really use them to get to Kigali.  From Kajevuba you have to count 35 kilometres, 25 of which are tarred road. 
Q.	How many of these small, bad roads would you say existed? 
A.	I would say four or five just off the top of my head.  One from Kinyinya, from Bumbogo (phonetic), it was a very, very bad road.  

Then there was one that went from Sha-Nduba-Shango; that's two now.  You could go through Ndera and Rugende.  Those would be suicidal routes, if I can say it that way, and then Kajevuba-Gasabo-Rutunga, but that would only serve to lengthen the trip.  

Honestly, the two that are still used the most are Bumbogo or from Kajevuba. 
Q.	And during your attempted escape to Kigali, you testified that you met a man within, I believe, a few metres of a roadblock who referred to you and your companion as Ibitzu, and you also testified that this meant accomplice of the RPF; is that correct? 
A.	Injitzu (phonetic).  I don't know.  I don't believe so.  I believe it must have been a war-displaced person -- I should say that again -- who wanted to avoid trouble.  We shouldn't look at the situation as good and bad on two different sides.  There were good and bad on both sides.  Either they wanted to stop me from leaving, the Interahamwe needed my truck, or he wanted to save my life, which was also very possible, by turning me away.  But saying that that was an RPF accomplice, I don't really think so. 
Q.	What I was trying to establish, perhaps this is my error in asking multiple questions, what did the word "Ibitzu", which he referred to you and your companion as, mean? 
A.	In Kinyarwanda, "Ibitzu", the plural, or Icitzu (phonetic), singular, it means someone who collaborates with others in a derogatory sense.  During the war an Icitzu is someone who works with the enemy.  

We should not forget during that time, for the entire population, the RPF was the enemy.  They had invaded the country.  So, someone who worked -- not in a general sense -- who wanted to fight the RPF, but someone who tried to live in peace, to restore peace, that person might be considered an Icitzu or Igitzu (phonetic), in the plural form.  
The Belgians were considered, rightly or wrongly, were considered RPF collaborators.  In other words, they were considered Ibitzu; the fifth column, if you will. 
Q.	And this term would not have been used by an RPF member, would it? 
A.	No, of course.  Now, it would be used perhaps in the other sense; those who do not work with the RPF would be considered Ibitzu. 
Q.	The roadblock that was further ahead, which you were perhaps saved, as you suggest, from reaching, was manned by the Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it must have been Interahamwe.  Of course, I didn't ask them for their identity card, but it was clear that they were Interahamwe.  It was one of the many roadblocks established in the national territory at that time. 
Q.	Thank you.  And it would be correct to say, would it not, that on your journey, on your attempted flight to Kigali, you met no RPF members at all? 
A.	Let me specify.  I was not fleeing.  I was trying to assess the situation and get back to Kigali, possibly.  I wasn't fleeing.  There were people with us we needed to continue to serve.  No, it is clear, there were no members of the RPF.  They weren't yet there.  If they were there, we certainly did not see them. 
Q.	And if I may just confirm, this was on the 14th of April?
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Had you succeeded in passing the barrier, the roadblock at Kabuga, which was manned by the Interahamwe, do you think you would have been able to reach Rubongo?  Would that have been the next point? 
A.	I did not make it through the roadblock.  I was stopped 50 metres from it, and I put my pickup in reverse and turned around.  I did not get through the roadblock. 
Q.	The question was:   Had you succeeded, had you been able to pass it, what would have been the next major point, do you say, geographically, that you would reach? 
A.	The secteur of Rubungo, one or two kilometres from there.  I don't think I could have ever made it.  It wouldn't have been possible. 
Q.	And the barrier to Rubungo, I believe you stated in your statement that it was manned by the French; is that correct? 
A.	No.  If that is the indication, that's a mistake.  This was prior to the genocide, prior.  In '92 and '93 there was a detachment of a few French soldiers.  They had a type of roadblock, but it wasn't in Rubongo, it was Karama, where the roadblock that I didn't make it to is located.  

Now, of course, this is in Rubungo commune.  I think we should specify.  There is Rubungo commune, just like Gikomero commune; Rubungo secteur is located further past the roadblock I couldn't make it through; and then the roadblock, which for a few months was guarded by French, was at Karama or Nyabikenke.  

In fact, all of these mean the same thing.  The French were there.  In case the RPF would attack, they would be there.  But prior to the genocide, in fact, there never was such an attack. 
Q.	And so on the 14th, it is your testimony, therefore, that the French were no longer there at Karama in Rubungo commune? 
A.	Yes, for a few weeks at that point, they had already left.  They had already left for quite some time. 
Q.	Do you know if this barrier was manned by the Interahamwe after the French left? 
A.	During the genocide, yes.  There were a few weeks where there was no one.  A roadblock is not a permanent thing.  Sometimes just a few beer kegs are put on the road just to stop cars from getting through, empty ones, of course, and that, when vehicles would stop, would enable people to make checks.  Sometimes there were no people there, but during the genocide, the Interahamwe showed up there. 
Q.	And after Karama at Rubungo commune, would you agree that Kigali would have been more easily obtainable if one were to pass the Karama roadblock? 
A.	No, because, as I said, there is Rubungo secteur and an entire Remera area which was in uproar.  I told you this morning that near Remera was the parliament building known as the CND committee nationalé (unintelligible) occupied by 6,000 RPF troops whose mission was in preparation -- preparing the RPF politicians that were to participate in the BBTG broadbased transitional government.  I didn't know it as I set out for Remera, but I was told afterwards it was absolutely impossible to get through. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)... told about the impossibility of passing Remera? 
A.	Remera or Kabuga?  No one ever told me that I couldn't get through the Remera roadblock.  It was subsequently that I was told that the situation made it impossible. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I think I need to increase the volume on my earpiece. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Would you agree, though, that the question of access would differ from one person to another, depending on which group you belonged to?  If you were, say, an Interahamwe leader, you would not have the same problems as, say, an ordinary citizen in going past a roadblock that was manned by the Interahamwe.  
A.	As things were at the time, I'm not sure that any leader, even an Interahamwe leader, could get through.  You mustn't forget that the people manning the roadblock, when they're not at the roadblock, they're either drinking beer or taking drugs.  So in such conditions, everything becomes impossible, even someone considered to be an authority, an eminent person.  I think the only way you could get through was if you could buy beer, and even then no one tried, even.  That's the point.  Everyone knew that the best thing was not to move at all. 
Q.	And there were roadblocks manned by Interahamwe throughout Rwanda; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes, with certain differences, I think.  There were places where there were fewer roadblocks.  Some took longer before they were set up.  But more or less, they were throughout. 
Q.	And is it your testimony before this Chamber that the roadblocks were impossible to penetrate, regardless of who you were in 1994? 
A.	I would not say that it was impossible, but it was highly risky and very dangerous.  These are things you know after.  You can take the risk of getting through.  If you got through, you wouldn't say it was impossible.  If you didn't get through, then you can't say anything anymore because by then you're dead.  So it was highly risky and very dangerous. 
Q.	And you, of course, granted as speaking as an ordinary citizen; is that correct? 
A.	What do you mean "speaking as an ordinary citizen"?  You mean speaking the language as any citizen, or reasoning as an Interahamwe reasons?  No, that is not my case. 
Q.	Not at all.  I think we misunderstand each other.  My point is when you talk about the risks, and that one could take that risk but you may end up dead, you cannot speak for an Interahamwe official or a government official, or people who were in a position that you perhaps were not so familiar with in 1994.  
A.	I think that the reasoning I put forward before you was valid for everyone.  I don't think anyone among the authorities dared to go into the hills because it was too dangerous, even for them, not just for ordinary citizens.  Maybe ordinary citizens might have been able to be safer than the authorities. 
Q.	So is it your position then that nobody moved around in April 1994; no officials, no army officials, no authorities moved around in April 1994 because of roadblocks that were located, situated, all throughout Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  That's more or less it.  To say that people didn't move at all would be somewhat exaggerating.  But people stayed within a distance that would make it possible to get home easily.  But to go from Kigali to Gikomero or to Rutongo was something one should not do.  

I personally tried to send a young man, telling myself that maybe going through the hills, across the hills, he'd be able to get to Ndera.  An hour later he came back and said, "You mustn't try it.  It's not worth it.  You will get killed."  And he was a Hutu, not a Tutsi.  Maybe if he had been a Tutsi, he wouldn't have come back at all either. 
Q.	But this young man, he was an ordinary citizen, was he not? 
A.	He was, yes.  He was, because he was killed in the general fight after the RPF took power.  He had finished his primary school.  He was a young man, but he did 5 kilometres and then came back.  An authority might not even have been able to cover the 5 kilometres. 
Q.	Thank you.  This is, however, your opinion as opposed to something you witnessed yourself.  Can we just clarify this? 
A.	I don't understand your question.  (Microphones overlapping)... my point of view.
Q.	You did not witness any authorities attempt to cross, or attempt to get from one location to another, in April 1994, did you? 
A.	No, no, of course.  Had I been such a witness, I wouldn't be here to tell the tale. 
Q.	Thank you.  I'm going to ask, as politely as possible, if we can keep the answers as short and precise so we can move a little quicker.  

After the incident, you drove back in your pickup; is that correct?  After being stopped before this roadblock, you drove back to your residence in your pickup truck? 
A.	Quite. 
Q.	Can you tell us the colour of your pickup truck? 
A.	More than that, I can tell you it was a Toyota Hilux, *********************, taken, as we said this morning, by the Interahamwe, and I never saw it again. 
Q.	And would it surprise you to hear that there are many witnesses, Defence witnesses especially, who testify that no vehicles came from the direction of Kigali, except those belonging to the Rubungo commune?   So obviously they didn't spot you on your return journey.  
A.	I saw no vehicle coming from Kigali, nor any vehicles belonging to Rubungo commune.  But it's possible that vehicles came from Rubungo without passing by Gishaka parish.  But I, at any rate, didn't see any. 
Q.	What distance had you covered by the time you reached Kabuga -- I believe it's here -- by the time you reach Kabuga just before the roadblock?  What distance had you covered by then?  
A.	About 10. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that two (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) in rural Rwanda would not normally be something that would pass unnoticed, would it? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Would you take care, please?  Perhaps if that can be redacted. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm sorry, is this a sensitive --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Identification.  So, we redact --
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Can we get some feedback from the witness as to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We discussed this earlier.  I don't want to explain the reference that is made -- 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the reference to (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) is redacted, as it potentially identifies.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I will rephrase. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Would you agree that yourself and your companion would not normally pass unnoticed in rural Rwanda? 
A.	Well, that's obvious, all the more so since my pickup was known, I was known.  My colleague came from elsewhere, but he was with me, and it is sure that I would have been noticed.  But I wasn't coming from Rubungo. 
Q.	No, you were coming from the direction of Kigali.  
A.	No.  When?  When I was stopped at the roadblock, I was coming from my place.  I wanted to go to Kigali, but I did not get there.  I didn't make it. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)... when you left your place; was it in the direction of Kigali or in the opposite direction? 
A.	It was in the direction of Kigali because I wanted to go to see what was happening in Kigali, what the situation was.  So I went through Bumbogo and the road towards Remera, but I didn't make it, of course. 
Q.	Thank you.  And on the 14th a group of Interahamwe, who came to your home, who I believe you stated were not from Gikomero, did you know where they were from on the 14th, the group that came on the 14th? 
A.	I think that they were young people enrolled in the Interahamwe, probably partly from Kanombe commune.  Mustn't forget that in Kanombe there was an Interahamwe training camp in the last months before the genocide.  I don't say they were all from Kanombe, but I should think most of them were, except for that "lieutenant", in quotes.  He claimed to be a lieutenant from Rutongo.  There must have been a few, maybe, from Gikomero, but I didn't recognise them. 
Q.	And where was Kanombe commune situated?  Where is it located in relation to Gikomero commune?   Perhaps Mr. Registrar can help you with the map.  
A.	Kanombe is on the south side of Gikomero along -- much of it is along the tarred road going to Kibungo.  That is also where the international airport is and the military camp where the training was taking place. 
Q.	And how far from Kanombe would you say Kigali was, or Kigali is? 
A.	There is the crossroads of the road to Ndera, which is called Kilometre 12, I think.  So there to the centre of Kigali are 12 kilometres.  But between Kigali and Kanombe, you don't have the impression of leaving for one commune for another.  It's a suburb of Kigali.  There's no empty spaces.  So it's 10 kilometres, 10, 15 kilometres. 
Q.	Thank you.  And the Interahamwe who came on the 14th, you stated that they took your passport and your aeroplane ticket and that you were planning to leave on that day; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, before the genocide I'd reserved a seat for the 14th.  I was due to leave on holiday, and as there is no travel agency in Gikomero, I had passed through Kigali, picked up my ticket, and all that was ready in a little bag.  It wasn't of much use, as it turned out. 
Q.	But am I right in saying that you didn't actually take those documents with you when you tried to reach Kigali earlier that day? 
A.	No, no, no.  I did not take them with me.  They stayed in my bedroom. 
Q.	So you had abandoned that idea of travelling on that day; is that correct? 
A.	After the 7th of April, we knew there wouldn't be any more flights out of Kigali once the genocide had started.  There couldn't be any flights out of Kigali. 
Q.	And your trip to Kigali, the attempt to make a trip to Kigali was simply to observe the situation, I believe you said? 
A.	Exactly.  I wanted to see where we were, because where I was, I only had news of 500 yards in the round, and didn't know anything about anything else, apart from rumours and probably false rumours running around, and as people will. 
Q.	So you only had news of your immediate vicinity, but did you not think it was risky to go -- or to attempt to go to Kigali in light of the situation? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, the group of Interahamwe that came on the 14th, I believe you stated that they fled because they were afraid that the RPF was drawing near, was coming close; is that a fair summary of what you said? 
A.	Not quite.  They came looking for vehicles because they knew the RPF was after them.  I didn't know that, but they knew it, and they needed a vehicle, and my pickup was the only one left in the area, and they left with it, with the few hundred centilitres left in the petrol tank. 
Q.	And you had stated that the RPF were in Kayanga from the 11th, I believe, of April; is that correct? 
A.	No, not Kayanga.  I think maybe that's what it says in the statement.  It's a mistake, either on my part or on the -- whoever typed its fault.  It was Gasabo, which is nearer to Kajevuba. 
Q.	I see.  So they had not yet reached Kayanga by the 11th, to your knowledge? 
A.	No, I don't think so.  No, no.  I think not. 
Q.	And on the 15th you stated that some FAR soldiers came; des Forces armées, Rwandese government force's soldiers; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  There were four or five RGF troops only, and it was a very short visit; they only had the chickens I had in my chicken run.  That's all they did. 
Q.	And you didn't know where they had come from; is that correct? 
A.	Those soldiers probably came from one of the small positions where there had been soldiers positioned throughout Gikomero.   After 1990 they were everywhere positioned -- in scattered positions throughout.  They came with the commune pickup, so there still was the commune pickup.  Mine no longer existed, but that of the commune was still there. 
Q.	And in relation to access to the roads, to roads, rather, you stated that the road to Kajevuba would have been blocked after the 10th, which is when your companion, your colleague, was able to use the road; is that correct? 
A.	Up until 50 yards from the Kabuga roadblock, Kajevuba up to 50 metres below that roadblock (unintelligible).   There was no problem. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Mr. President, I don't know if you would like to take the afternoon break now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Actually, it would be more convenient if we could break at 4 o'clock. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay.  That's fine.  Thank you. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	But aside from your companion, who actually took that road on the 10th, you have no other first-hand information, or second-hand, in this case, information as to whether the road was blocked or not; is that correct? 
A.	No, of course not.  No.  We saw we couldn't continue, and we just went home.  That's all. 
Q.	And is it correct that you were accompanied by the RPF, who made you leave by foot for Kajevuba on the 20th; is that the correct date? 
A.	Yes, that is the correct date.  Yes, quite.  It was the RPF soldiers who had run the commune that escorted us to Kajevuba. 
Q.	And after this, they drove you to Byumba; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  They put us in a pickup.  We went to Byumba from Kajevuba in a Daihatsu pickup truck. 
Q.	So would it be fair to say that you only observed their positions, the RPF positions, on the 20th of April?
A.	No, because where we were at Bumbogo, until the 20th there was an RPF position.  We knew it well.  We could see them.  On the 20th, when we arrived in Kajevuba, there on the summit of the hill, next to Mugambazi commune, there was a soldier headquarters that gave orders to the Mataliwala (phonetic) for the shelling of Kigali.  So we observed troop positions, Bumbogo and Kajevuba. 
Q.	And in relation to the roadblocks that were manned by the RPF on the road to Kigali, you observed this on the 20th of April; is that correct? 
A.	There was no RPF roadblock. 
Q.	So the RPF were not a danger for one getting from Gikomero to Kigali; they were not manned at certain positions? 
A.	We considered, my colleague and I, that we were safe when we were in the plane in Ntebe in Uganda.  Until then, we had no idea what the RPF intentions were, whether to slaughter us on the way, or what.  We didn't know.  

We left because we had to, but we were absolutely not sure of the outcome.  When the plane took off from Ntebe, that's when we sighed our relief and said, "Now we're on our way."
Q.	So whilst you were in Rwanda being accompanied by the RPF on your journey to the Rwandan/Ugandan border and eventually took cover, I believe, in Uganda, my question is, did you observe the RPF along the way?  Did you see them -- whether they were standing by, did you see them positioned in troops, or did you see them on your way on the 20th of April, other than those who were accompanying you?  I'm sorry to interrupt.  
A.	No.  The pickup overtook a column of civilians.   Coming from where, I know not.  The pickup truck stopped.  The soldiers, I think, handed over some sacks of food, I think, and then we continued.  The pickup was full of shells and other form of arms.  I told myself if we had a problem, the whole thing would explode.  

We arrived in Byumba, which had already been taken by the RPF for some time.  We slept at Byumba ********, and it was the day after the day after that that the UN observer group, that was supposed to be observing the border but it was observing nothing at all, took us from Byumba to Kabali (phonetic) to Mulindi, which was the headquarters, the headquarters of the RPF.  There were lots of soldiers.  

But there were no roadblocks on the road.  They didn't consider it necessary.  They were in charge.  It was certain that they would be taking over the whole country.  But still, people were not moving around.  It was too dangerous. 
Q.	And in your statement of February 2001, you said the RPF and the Interahamwe killed equal numbers of people in your commune and neighbouring communes; is that correct? 
A.	It's not quite what was said.  What I said -- I said was incorrectly taken down, but the western part of the commune, Sha, Shango, and Nduba, suffered RPF massacres.  The eastern part along Lake Muhazi, especially Rutunga, Gitaranga -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.   I'm sorry, could you repeat the list of communes on the eastern side?
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:  
Q.	Sorry.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the interpreter didn't get the eastern secteurs that you mentioned.  
A.	Am I on Tanzanian television?  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  

The western part of the commune, Sha, Shango, Nduba, there were massacres, especially by the RPF.  I'm not saying only, exclusively, but especially.  Rutunga, Gikunga (phonetic), Gikomero, Gicaca, the eastern part along Lake Muhazi were massacres, especially by the Interahamwe.  Gicaca and Bumbogo, which are more or less in the centre of the commune, it was both parts that were massacred.  As to the numbers, it would be difficult to say that it was the same.  There are probably more people massacred by the Interahamwe than by the RPF, but the RPF also killed a lot.  
(Pages 32 to 44 by Jennifer Spring)



1545H 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	And the killings in the eastern part -- no, sorry, the western, part, in Sha, Nduba and Shango - (microphones overlapping)
A.	Yes, there were many perpetrated by the RPF. 
Q. 	Do you know when these were committed?  Do you know when these massacres took place? 
A.	I think that this was somewhat in reprisal for the other massacres committed by the Interahamwe, so I'd say for -- around the 15th or 16th of April.  Yes, I believe it was around then, but we did not have really exact information, as I said. 
Q.	And the information you provide in terms of who perpetrated the killings in which parts of the larger communal area, is this based on official documents or is this something that you learnt through talking to people? 
A.	This is information, oral information, provided by people, including a couple which I knew well who had a child who was starting secondary school, who was shot in the back by the RPF because he was not running fast enough.  So the RPF was chasing people out.  Those who didn't run fast enough were shot down.  That was in Cyangugu.  

Another case was at the Nduba-Shango border.  This was a blind man whose child is now in university in Kigali.  He was not able to flee because he was blind, so he was shot down.  

A third case is a ************** from Sha who was cutting wood with an axe, peacefully.   RPF soldiers arrived.    They asked him to get onto the road with the axe, and they took the axe and cut off his head with it.  Those are small examples like that, but it's not like someone wrote a book to explain how the massacres occurred.  This is the sort of thing you learn in conversations. 
Q.	And did you learn of these killings when you came back to Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, yes, because I came back a year and a half afterwards, and that is when I was told all this, yes. 
Q.	In your statement you referred to four foreigners who were killed, three from Byumba and another whom you named who were killed by the RPF.  How did you learn of these tragic events? 
A.	No, it is not four foreigners; it is the three priests, Rwandan priests, of Byumba parish and a white priest, a Spaniard who also lived in Byumba.  His name was Father Valmajo.  We learned very quickly that they had been shot .  The RPF put them in front of the cathedral and shot them all.  It spread quickly -- the news spread quickly through white priests or other people.  It was easy to go past through Byumba still because the RPF did not take such a dim view of us.  
Q.	Have the killers been brought to justice at all? 
A.	Are you referring to RPF soldiers?  No, of course not.  Of course not.  This is not the sort of question one asks.  The RPF was at war.  They considered that they were prisoners who were executed, and they were executed and that's all. 
Q.	Does this situation not anger you? 
A.	I think it's the same in all countries in the world where there's war.  Obviously, I don't approve, no more than I approve of the genocide.  
Q.	Now, if I can come back to your statement.  You talked briefly about the bourgmestre, Rutaganira, and I believe you state that he was manipulated by the MRND.  If I can just clarify, is this to say that he didn't commit any acts of genocide or that he did or that he was being manipulated by the MRND? 
A.	I do not believe I used the word "manipulate", but I'd say that this was not a man who had the qualities of a leader of men and so he was not capable either to push people to kill each other, or to prevent them from doing so.  He wasn't a man, to speak in a slightly vulgar fashion.  I don't know what became of him afterwards, whether he's alive or dead.  According to his wife, who returned from Congo, she lost sight of him during the exodus to Congo.  There are many similar cases of people who were separated when they were fleeing.  
Q.	And for those who accuse him of having committed or having aided the génocidaires, what do you say to that, that he wasn't guilty or -- what is your position? 
A.	I don't know whether he was being accused of being a génocidaire or being a bourgmestre.  Automatically, all bourgmestres were included on the list of génocidaire.  I do not know whether he himself was actually a génocidaire, I cannot answer that question, but I'd be surprised.  He didn't have the mettle for that sort of thing.  

I'm not saying, mind you, that this is a good thing to have the mettle to be a génocidaire, but you should have a minimum of courage.  I remember when it began, things began to go badly, he was still there.  The killings had not yet started.  He was in his home, locked in there.  He barricaded the openings with furniture, to avoid being attacked.  This was a man who was frightened. 
Q.	Are you aware that some bourgmestres were actually removed from their position because they did not assist in committing the genocide? 
A.	I know of none.  Perhaps there are, but I do not know of any personally. 
Q.	Do you think that there are people who perpetrated the genocide who perhaps didn't have the clout, but were easily influenced, and as a result went along with that? 
A.	I think you might look at every case individually.  There are people who committed genocide because of their convictions, to defend the country.  I'm not approving; I'm just describing what I see.  People committed genocide because if they did not commit genocide, they would themselves be killed by other people.  Some were given drink; some were drugged.  There are possible cases that happened during those troubled times. 
Q.	So, in short, would I be fair in concluding that what you're saying is not that if one does not have the clout or one is not a "man", quote unquote, that one is not capable of committing genocide? 
A.	I don't know where you get that conclusion from, but it's not mine. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you involved in politics in 1994? 
A.	Neither in 1994, 1995, or any other time.  I've never been involved in politics. 
Q.	Yet in your statement you talk about the political ambitions of Anastase Gasana and the membership of the MDR and the MRND in Gikomero; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, the MDR, yes, in Gikomero.  Gikongoro is something else entirely.  But that doesn't mean that one is involved in politics; one just observes that Anastase Gasana has himself proclaimed as the chairman of the MDR in Gikongoro commune.  That is a fact.  It is not an implication of political involvement. 
Q.	But I believe that you said that he had wanted to be the president of the MRND; is that correct? 
A.	Well, yes, that was known.  It was well known. 
Q.	And can you tell us how well do you know André Rwamakuba?  Did you know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I got to know André Rwamakuba when ********************** of the technical committee of Gikongoro commune and when he came to present to this committee the public health projects, but I didn't know him very well, I must say.  This is not someone with whom I shared a beer on a daily basis, for instance. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many times you remember seeing him? 
A.	Twice or thrice, no more. 
Q.	And when were these?  Were these during the course of the committee meetings? 
A.	I met him once during the technical committee meeting because since he was not a member of the technical committee, he was just coming to present his project during a technical committee meeting.  The second time was probably at one feast or another at the commune, but I do not have an exact memory of this. 
Q.	Can you recall what year this was? 
A.	I would say 1992, but I wouldn't stake -- I wouldn't swear to it. 
Q.	And so when he presented his paper to the technical committee, was that in 1992 or another time? 
A.	No, I think it was at that time, I think so. 
Q.	And in your statement you said he didn't show himself much because he was in his little corner in Nduba.  Do you recall saying this?  
A.	No.  There are two statements in what you have said.  He didn't show himself often, yes, that is true.  He was not very evident in meetings and communal activities.  He was in Kigali for his work and sometimes he would return to Nduba to see his family, but he was most often in Kigali.  He was more often in Kigali than in his home town of Nduba. 
Q.	So would it be fair to say that you were aware of his movements? 
A.	André's movements, Rwamakuba?  Oh, no, of course not.  First, I am not an investigator who checks what people do night and day.  Secondly, I do not see why I would go and spy on André to find out what exactly he was doing with his day.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
At that point I think we will be taking the afternoon break, Your Honour.
MR. O'SHEA:
Before that happens, can I just ask my friend to point out this sentence of "in his little corner in Nduba"?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, can we do this after the break?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need to break for approximately 30 minutes at this time.  Resume at 4:30.
MR. HOOPER:
I wonder if I could get an indication from my friend -- well, we can do that after you've risen, and subject to what she says, I'll release the waiting witnesses.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Court recessed at 1559H)
(Pages 45 to 48 by Karen Holm)

























(Court resumed at 1655H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can resume now.  

Ms. Cummings-John, are you able to give us an estimate as to how much longer you're going to be?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
It will all depend on the answers, Your Honour, but I would say about half an hour, maybe 45 minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Ms. Cummings-John, we would like to finish this witness this afternoon, so we will measure our time of the adjournment to the completion of your cross-examination.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
And I will do my best.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	I'd like to start by perhaps speaking on behalf of the English interpreters in saying, if possible, Mr Witness, if you can speak a little more slowly and, on behalf of myself, if we can keep the responses as short and as concise as possible.  I know it's difficult and there's a tendency to explain the background, but if you can keep it as short as possible so we can move on and finish this afternoon.

Just before we adjourned for the short break -- 
A.	Agreed.
Q.  	-- I had indicated that in the statement which we received, that you had told -- or that the note states that you had said that André Rwamakuba was not -- was in his little corner in Nduba.  And I believe Mr. O'Shea wanted me to clarify where this was found.  And the page reference is 1401, and the sentence starts, "Gasana Anastase did not show himself much and the same can be said of André.  He stayed in his little corner in Nduba."

Does that refresh your memory at all, Mr. Witness?  
MR. O'SHEA:
No, you see, the problem is this:  if my friend is going to put a phrase from a statement to the witness without placing the statement in front of the witness, she must put it fairly and squarely and in context, to be fair to the witness.

Now, she has omitted the sentence which immediately precedes that, and it makes an enormous difference to the sense.  And the sentence which precedes it is, "The MDR was very -- was in a very strong minority."  What I mean is "it was very unimportant in the commune".
So this is not a question of saying that André Rwamakuba was physically in Nduba at any particular point in time.  It is an illustration of the minority nature of the MDR that he, being from Nduba, which was a small place in that small corner -- that is the context -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. O'Shea, that can be addressed in re-examination, if necessary, and if the document -- you know --
MR. O'SHEA:
I agree, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the point has been made now.  We want to finish the testimony this afternoon.
MR. O'SHEA:
I understand.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you've made the point and Ms. Cummings-John can continue now.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you for offering that explanation of what the witness meant, Mr. O'Shea.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	To continue, Mr. Witness, you stated in your testimony earlier that you didn't even hear that André Rwamakuba had become a minister; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I'm trying to be brief.  It's true.
Q.	And did you not listen to the radio in 1994, in April, before leaving Rwanda?
A.	There were no more batteries in the radio, so we couldn't know what the news was, and I'm not sure that Radio Rwanda broadcast a list of the members of the provisional government.  I don't remember that.  I only remember the name of the president being announced and the prime minister of the provisional government.
Q.	Well, there was actually a swearing-in ceremony and many witnesses, both prosecution and defence, learnt of André Rwamakuba's appointment as well as the appointment of others during this -- from the radio, rather.  So there were -- there was -- this information was broadcast on the radio, even though you did not hear it.  

You also testified that André Rwamakuba was not a politician.  Obviously, you were not speaking from any real knowledge of who he is or who he was.  Would I be fair in saying that?
A.	No, that's what I said.  He was a health technocrat much more than a politician.  He wasn't someone who was hooked into politics.
Q.	Do you know if he was a member of any party?
A.	Well, he was first a member of MRND, as any inhabitant of Rwanda was, but after the beginning of multi-party politics, he joined the MDR, Mouvement Démocratique République, the Democratic Republican Movement.
Q.	And you are also not aware that he took oath as Minister of Primary and Secondary Education on the 9th of April 1994?
A.	Well, at that time we weren't paying much attention to news from elsewhere than where we stood.  The days were full of practical problems to be overcome, people whose integrity had to be preserved.  We weren't so much concerned with knowing who'd been sworn in or not.
Q.	And you testified that the MDR and the MRND were opposing parties and, as such, Kamuhanda could not be associated with Rwamakuba; do you recall saying this?
A.	I can confirm that, yes.
Q.	Had you ever heard about the split in the MDR party?
A.	At the national level, yes; that was widely known.  But it was before the advent of the genocide.
Q.	And can you tell us what characterised this split?
A.	Well, basically, at the bottom of it, it's because everyone wanted to be chief.  It was a battle of chiefs.  There were some people much more given to violence perhaps than others.  It's a question of who wanted to be boss -- they all wanted to be boss.
Q.	And following the split, was there a moment when the MDR became -- or the MDR's objectives became similar or closer to those of the MRND?
A.	As regards the extremist wing of the MDR, yes.  Karemira and who else, I can't remember -- some other politician, they did get closer, but still they all wanted to take power, but through violence.
Q.	And were you aware that André Rwamakuba was part of Karemira's extremist wing, as you have just characterised it?
A.	No, I know not of that.
Q.	Did you know anything about the interim government that was formed in April 1994?
A.	All I know is that they wound up in Congo after having passed through Gitarama and Gisenyi, and Theodore Sindikubwabo, who was the interim president, had before that incited the people of Butare to commit massacres.  That's all I know about it.  It's a government that did not last long.
Q.	Do you know who this government was made up of -- who some of the members were, apart from Sindikubwabo that you've just mentioned?
A.	Not all, but I know Jean Kambanda was the prime minister, Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda was part of the government, minister of something -- I think maybe higher education.  I know now that Rwamakuba always was a member of it, and there were others.  I don't really know who they were.  There were other concerns than to keep lists of ministers.
Q.	So is it your testimony that you have just learnt in this courtroom that André Rwamakuba was a member of the interim government?
A.	No, no, it wasn't the first time all the same, but it was quite some time after the events when I learned that he'd been -- when he was arrested, that's when I heard that he would -- been minister.  Otherwise, I didn't really know anything about it.
Q.	Do you recall telling the investigators, or the investigator in February 2001 that you never heard of a minister who came from Kigali to perpetrate massacres; do you recall saying this?
A.	Yes, I do remember well having stated that.
Q.	But would it be fair to say that this is not entirely true, because you had heard of                               Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda -- in fact, you testified on his behalf; isn't that correct?
A.	But, first of all, I didn't know that Jean de Dieu Kambanda (sic) was a minister at the time and, secondly, I never stated that at any where that Jean de Dieu Kambanda (sic) came to the commune as a minister to launch the genocide.  You shouldn't put words in my mouth.
Q.	Indeed.  And I think perhaps you have clarified a point that I need to take note of and be clear about, because at the time he wasn't a minister, I believe.

But it's not that you agree that he came to commit massacres but that you heard -- I believe that was the question -- the question was that you never heard of any ministers.  Whether you agree with this or not, did you ever hear anyone or subsequently, for instance, when you learnt of André Rwamakuba being arrested, did you not hear then that he was being accused of coming to Gikomero to perpetrate or to lead the genocide?
A.	There are two questions.  The first is that I maintain that I did not hear about a minister coming to Gikomero commune.  Second, I never heard it said that André Rwamakuba had come to start the genocide, either before or after he was appointed minister.  I maintain this.
Q.	I would like perhaps to go into closed session, because I would like to deal with the witness's position in 1994 -- not the exact location, but perhaps in talking about his post, this may reveal his identity.  Perhaps, you know, he can give us a feedback as to whether he thinks this is likely to reveal his identity or not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John, the policy we have is that we try to limit the closed session to one session.  Now, do you have any other questions for closed session besides the one you have now?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
No, I'm going to deal with all the closed session questions in the closed session.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And is that the end of your cross-examination?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Then there will be two questions in open session and that will be the end of my examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will those two questions in open session depend on the closed session?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
To an extent they follow on from the closed session.

MR. PRESIDENT:
I see, all right.

About how much time do you anticipate this to last?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I anticipate, if I get short answers, which the witness has been very kind to give me, that it will take no more than 15 minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the public, we have to go back into closed session to preserve the anonymity of the witness.  This should be approximately 15 minutes.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 54 to 55] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

1520H
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, do you recall when asked earlier about the alleged involvement of André Rwamakuba in the genocide in Gikomero along with Bourgmestre Rutaganira, do you recall saying words to the effect that this would surprise you because André Rwamakuba was an intellectual, someone who presumably did not fit the profile of a génocidaire?  Do you recall saying words to that effect?  I'm paraphrasing, so forgive me, as I do not have the transcripts.  
A.	I think you have paraphrased in a rather singular manner.  That is not at all what I said.  What I said was that André Rwamakuba did not have any particular affinity with Rutaganira.  I, too, am paraphrasing when I say that, but that I would be surprised that the bourgmestre Rutaganira could possibly have planned genocide because he was not capable of it, and that André was absent, could not have done it and it was not his work.  He was not there.  He was in Kigali.  That is what I meant to say.
Q.	And what did you mean, or what do you mean when you say that "was not his work"?
A.	I'm not talking about work in the way Sindikubawabo described it.  It was not André's sort of work.  He was a doctor.  He treated people and his work was social medicine, in a way.  He was responsible for Kigali préfecture.  He was one of the health officials at that place.  It was not his sort of thing.  It was not his cup of tea to go and kill people.  It's not it.
Q.	But he was a politician and a member of the government of the 9th of April; is that not correct?
A.	I don't know whether he was a member of government at -- on the 9th of April.  I don't really know, but, in any case, he wasn't a politician.  He could be a minister without being a politician.  He was a technician.
Q.	And as an MDR member --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A technocrat, the interpreter corrects, sorry.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	And as a member of the MDR party, the extremist wing headed by Édouard Karemira, was he still a technocrat?
A.	André Rwamakuba was involved in the MDR, that is undeniable.  It is you who says he was in Karemira's extremist wing.  I know nothing of that.
Q.	And the final question.  How would you characterise a génocidaire, Mr. Witness?
A.	Just one word "Satan", or Shitani as he's called in Kinyarwanda.  I believed in the existence of the devil at that time.  That is a génocidaire -- someone for whom another person's life has no more value than a kilo of beans -- an extremist something.  That's it.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I have no further questions, Your Honours.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. O'Shea?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Witness, when the Prosecution was asking you questions about possible roads from Kigali up to Gikomero commune, the roads that you mentioned and the roads that you were thinking of, were there any roads that you were thinking of in response to those questions which we had not discussed when I was asking you questions?
A.	(Not interpreted)
Q.	Oh, it didn't come -- okay.
A.	What is the question?
Q.	The Prosecution asked you whether there were a number of roads which could be taken from Kigali up to Gikomero commune.  Do you remember the Prosecution putting that to you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you said that there were several roads and you named some of them.  My question is this:  were you thinking of any roads which you had not already discussed with me when I was asking you questions earlier today?
A.	Well, I was thinking mostly of the Kigali-Gikomero road that goes through Remera and Bumbogo, or perhaps the road that went through Kajevuba, and after Kajevuba the road went along -- followed Kajevuba River in Gikomero commune, but I really don't quite understand what clarifications you are seeking from me.
Q.	All right.  If the witness could be given the sketch map quickly, please.  Oh, you have it.  Good.

Now, the road that runs along the bottom where it says Kanombe underneath, there are roads which branch off that in the northerly direction -- there's one, two, three, four.  The first one we've described as the Kajevuba route; the second one is the Remera route, then the Rugenge and the which that goes towards (microphones overlapping)

Now, we've discussed all of those in court.  Now, are there any other routes that you know about?
A.	Yes.  From what is indicated as the Nkubana bridge, there is also a road that goes through Sha, Nduba, Shango and then Rubungo and joins the other roads.  I did not mention them because these are bad roads that people don't like to use unless they are moving about within the area.  But I think I mentioned the next road, which is through Gasabo, Rutungo, Kayanga and Gikomero, which is feasible if you have time and a lot of money to spend with the mechanics.  So those are the roads that exist, or that existed at that time.  Perhaps new roads were created afterwards, but I wouldn't know of that.
Q.	But are there any other roads starting from Kigali?
A.	To go to where -- into the country?  Well, yes.  Kigali is the capital of the country, after all, so there are roads leading off into the various préfectural headquarters towards Gitarama and elsewhere, and also to the communes neighbouring Kigali.
Q.	Let me stop you there.  The question is this:  are there any roads going from Kigali to Gikomero commune other than the ones we've already discussed, you and I, in court?
A.	No.  If you're talking about going by car, it's just the roads that I've mentioned.
Q.	Thank you.
A.	That we've just mentioned.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects witness.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Now, since you've got the map still in front of you, what can you say about RPF positions on the other side of Lac Muhazi, so on the right-hand side of Lac Muhazi if you look at the sketch map?
A.	It was in Byumba préfecture practically occupied by the RPF.  The RPF was practically everywhere, all around.  It is not Rutare, by the way, it is Rutare Giti.  All that was occupied by the RPF up to Byumba, up to the Ugandan border.
Q.	In response to one of the questions from my friend, you referred to false rumours in Gikomero commune.  Is that something that you have experience of as a person who's been living there for a while -- false rumours?
A.	You mean experience of rumours? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this going somewhere, or is this a general question?  
THE WITNESS:
If you live in Rwanda, rumours will be of frequent occurrence.
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, I thought it would be evident from what I was saying, but if Your Honour feels it's not important, I'll leave it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If it's that evident, then you don't need to go into it any more.
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry, Your Honour?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
If it's self-evident, you don't need to go into it any more.
MR. O'SHEA:
No, I thought it was self-evident why I was asking the question, but anyway I'll leave it -- I'll leave it.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, you've -- obviously from your testimony that's come out in examination-in-chief and cross-examination, you know a fair amount about what goes on in the commune, and perhaps what went on in the commune at the level of the MDR.  Would you profess to have expertise or extensive knowledge as to the workings of the MDR on a national level?
A.	No.  What I knew about the MDR at the national level was what I read in publications, books, or newspapers, but I never was greatly concerned with seeking out politicians, whether they were the MDR or the MRND, or any other party, to further my political education.  I didn't consider that necessary.
Q.	When you attached the words "Karemira" and "extremist", did you have anything in particular in mind which made you attach "Karemira" to the word "extremist"?
A.	Well, because it's well known in recent Rwandan history, and especially in the conflicting currents in MDR until the schism that Karemira was an extremist and he was one who invented the term "power"; in other words, those who want to use power and violence.  That was Karemira's work.
Q.	So were you aware of his speech, since you used that word?
A.	It was in the course of a rally held I think it was in Kigali, in the year before the genocide, in '93 or '94, but before the genocide.  I think it was in 1993.
Q.	Yes, thank you.
A.	But I don't remember the exact date.
Q.	And this is my last question.  If André Rwamakuba, in his capacity as a minister, had come to Gikomero commune during the period of the genocide and the period immediately before, do you think that you would have heard about it?
A.	Morally speaking, I do think I can say that I would have heard about it -- perhaps not at the time, but I would have been informed thereof.  It would have been spoken of to me sooner or later.  The same would have been true for Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda.  If he had come to the parish centre as he has been accused of, I think I would have heard about it, subject to the usual reservations, which means, as your colleague stated -- your learned friend stated, we're always the last one to hear about things, but we do hear about them sooner or later.
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you very much, and thank you for your patience.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Now, Mr. Witness, you've come to the end of your testimony.  I thank you for coming to give evidence before the Tribunal.  Now you are excused, and you are free to leave.
THE WITNESS:
Personally, I should like, for my part, to thank you, Mr. President, and Your Honours, Madam Prosecutor, and your assistants, and Counsel for the Defence, and all the staff from the registry and the others for having received me in this hearing.  I hope it will help clear perhaps some things up and I certainly do wish that the truth will out.

I should like -- I don't know if this is an appropriate time and place, but I should like to request permission to visit the person on whose behalf I have come here.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I intercede, Mr. Witness, to say that, yes, I apply, if I may.  Are we in closed session?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just hand up the pro forma form to visit André Rwamakuba and Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, and other detainees, in a specific capacity, which is apparent --
THE WITNESS:
 Karemira is dead, isn't he?  Kamuhanda.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, you cannot visit him.  Kamuhanda -- I think that came through clearly, yes.  
(Witness excused)
MR. HOOPER:
Can I also add another thing?  I've been speaking to WVS over the past week, and I was rather concerned to discover that witnesses who have gone to see the Accused -- and this is someone who, as you know, had essentially no witnesses over the past seven years -- were given merely 15 minutes with him and, indeed, two witnesses saw the Accused at the same time over the same period of time; as it were, they saw him together.  

And I raised this with WVS, what seemed to me a frankly inhumane allotment of time.  That is not a criticism of them at all.  They are very sympathetic to the situation.

And speaking to the particular member of WVS that we, as this team, have been very happy to work with over the last several months, she advised me yesterday that I should raise it in Court, and I do.  I was encouraged to raise it, can I put it like that?  It wasn't --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, this is a judicial -- what do I do?  Are there any rules that govern this?
MR. HOOPER:
No, there aren't any.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) a personal remark at this stage unless I can make a judicial order.  Do I have jurisdiction to do that?  
MR. HOOPER:
I had expressed it in terms of a request.  And may I say, Mr. President, that neither you nor your colleagues should underestimate the weight that would be given to such a request.  And if such a request is made, WVS, I think, feel greatly encouraged and, as I understand it, that allowance of time -- a reasonable allowance of time -- would be allotted, instead of the rather straitjacketed position at the moment -- at present.

So I'm led to believe -- and I've raised it now several times, and I'm distinctly led to believe that if I raise it in this way and if you and your colleagues feel that you can suggest that you feel it would be appropriate in all the circumstances, where possible, for a longer period of time to be allocated for these visits, that, I can assure the Bench, will carry considerable weight with those who will then make the necessary decisions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we all have our own opinions on the issue of what's reasonable and fair in circumstances of this nature.  But we are sitting now on a judicial Bench, and we don't have any information as to what actually happens or what is the reason for it.

We think that if we make a pronouncement from this podium, we should get some information before we make a statement from the Bench.  So we will -- we have asked the registrar to make some enquiries, and if you are able to adduce some evidence to us, that might be of assistance.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  Perhaps that could be addressed early tomorrow before witnesses are swept away.  Thank you.  Can we deal with exhibits tomorrow morning?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sure.  We grant permission for the witness to visit --
MR. HOOPER:
The various parties on that form in that capacity.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar has advised me that my secretary is not necessary.  It is a fairly routine matter and normally it is a matter which she will handle administratively.  But just in the context of what's been happening with other witnesses, I make the statement that we also give our permission.

MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.

I'm confident that we may -- that we stand a good chance of completing three witnesses tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  So we go home with a smile tonight.
MR. HOOPER:
That's the idea.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now.
