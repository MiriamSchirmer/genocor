MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminial Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, Judge Karin Hökborg and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, 
Tuesday, 6th September 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus 
André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

We resume our session, Madam Witness.  Your examination will be continued this morning. You remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you first started to give your testimony last week.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your examination will continue this morning. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper.
WITNESS RJ
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Yesterday, we were just coming to the point when I was asking you to look at a second procès-verbal statement, which were distributed in the original Kinyarwanda, French and English. 

Can you please be provided with the Kinyarwanda photocopy.  There's one here, if there's not -- and this photocopy in Kinyarwanda is at our TM60 to 63, so four pages.  And I'd like you, first of all, to look at the last page.  You look at the document in your own time -- you look at the document and you'll see the first page, there, with the more formal format, starting top left-hand corner, "République Rwandese", and then beneath that, Parike ya Repubulika, so it has it in Kinyarwanda, obviously, as well as French. 
Then you'll see that, in fact, unlike the document you saw yesterday, under the words "pro justitia," for justice, there is a pro forma introduction, which has been filled in that dates it the *********** 1999.  So this is a statement that, in time, is after your statement in the Gatera case that we looked at yesterday, that you didn't acknowledge, as I understand it, after your statement in the ICTR Rwamakuba case. That's where it stands in time.  And on the first page, on the left, we can see what I submit is your signature running up the side of the left-hand margin, and on each page your signature appears with your name in the left-hand margin.  And if you turn to page four -- and I see you're following this with keen interest.  If you turn to page four, you will see at the last page, underneath your clearly printed name, there appears a signature on the left-hand side as well as the right-hand side.  I'm not concerned about the signature of Claude Nkezabahizi, but I am concerned and interested in the signature on the other side.  And looking at that, is it right, Madam Witness, that that is your signature and this is your procès-verbal statement; is that correct? 
A.	I gave that testimony in the Twagirayezu trial.  What you see there is my statement in that trial -- the Twagirayezu trial. 
Q.	And so you acknowledge that that is your document.  I say "your document", you acknowledge that it is the procès-verbal statement that you provided, that it is signed by you, and that it bears your signature; is that correct?  
A.	I realise that a signature that looks like mine is appended to the document.  My name is also written out on it.  Even if I haven't written or read the document per se, I think it is my statement; it is my testimony, which testimony was given in the Twagirayezu trial. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And, of course, it's in Kinyarwanda, isn't it? 
A.	I think that there are French words here and there.  I haven't read the entire document, but I think there are also some passages that are written in French.
Q.	Well, there's two lines right at the end when it comes to the formal signature. 

Now, Madam Witness, in fact, in December 2003, the same document was put in your hand and you were asked:  "Do you recognise your signature on this document?"  And we can all see how clear, even in photocopy, I suggest, that is.  And this was your answer:  "Madam President" -- or it was the President of that Chamber that had asked the question -- "Madam President, I do not know what it is all about.  I can see some writing, which I do not recognise.  I see a signature.  I do not know whether it is an imitation of my signature.  In short, I don't know anything about this, and I would request that you attach no importance to it."  

That's page 74 on the 8th of December 2003, and in similar vein, goes on.  Why were you, I suggest, lying when you made that reply to the President of that Chamber? 
A.	I had asked you to produce the original copy of that document.  At the time, I had requested that they call the original or that they bring the original.  That today, you have explained how we came by this document, which is a copy.  You have reassured me that it is a copy of the original document.  You didn't bring that original.  It is a photocopy.  Actually, the situation is the same.  I don't have the original of that document and I realise that it is a photocopy.  I don't know where it was made.  So the situation is the same, with the exception that you reassured me that it is a photocopy of the original.  And I'd like to make it clear that Twagi -- Twagirayezu was not tried by the ICTR, but by the Rwandan courts.  But I'd like you to know that even today there are charges still against these people and these people who are charged in the Gacaca courts. 
Q.	See, I suggest your reply two years ago, just as with your replies yesterday -- and it's not a matter for me to judge, but it's what I submit to you -- were all part of an effort on your part to prevent the Judges looking and considering what you'd said before.  That's -- that's the position, isn't it?  That's the game you're up to yesterday and two years ago, isn't it? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I think, reading the transcripts by the Chamber (unintelligible) it is different from what was noted last year. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	It's my submission to you, Madam Witness, that it wasn't a misunderstanding -- an innocent misunderstanding on your part.  You knew full well what was going on and you were blocking that inquiry.  That's the truth of it, isn't it?  
A.	No, you are attributing intentions to me that I didn't have.  I am telling you that even now, this is a photocopy.  I give evidence in public -- in open session and this is my evidence -- my testimony, and the Judges can hear me.  As to this document, these are things that were written down by other people.  You have practically compelled me to admit that it is the copy of the original, but I'd like to insist that this is not the original and that it is a copy that we have before us. 
Q.	Now, you have the copy in front of you, and so I invite you to look freely at that.  I think you'll agree that it's all legible, and we know from yesterday that you can read it.  And on the first page that I have in English, but you have the Kinyarwanda original, it speaks of you going to the hospital on the 21st of April '94.  That you hid, it says, in the sheeting and after you went to the maternity unit.  That you saw people taking away other people and you're asked:  "Who took away the people?"  And your response is:  "Dr. Twagirayezu and Dr. Gatera are those who'd been waking up the people, and they sent them to the workers to kill them."  And Madam, if you want, you can read this yourself in the statement, if you're interested.  

	And it goes on:  "Others had been loading them in the vehicle driven by Mr. Michel Sebukayire, who's still working at the university, and they sent them to be killed."   And that is your first mention in any document or place of Dr. Twagirayezu or Michel Sebukayire.  You mention them in conjunction with Dr. Gatera.  This was not Dr. Gatera's trial.  This is the trial of Dr. Twagirayezu, who was also tried with Michel Sebukayire.  That's right, isn't it, those two were tried together? 
A.	What is the question, Counsel?  You are reading my statement in the Twagirayezu trial, but I didn't quite get your question. 
Q.	Is it right that Twagirayezu and Sebukayire stood trial together? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And you pop up with this statement naming both of them; don't you?  
A.	I cited them, because I saw them. 
Q.	And if we turn over the page, or I turn over my page in English, you -- you can find the spot with ease, I'm sure.  In your account, you say:  "I saw him -- " and this is Twagirayezu -- "coming at night on duty for surgery and sometimes he came to take away people.  He used to go in the wakening room.  He chose wounded people and he asked for papers and he ordered them to be taken away."  Is that something you saw? 
A.	Yes, I was a witness of that. 
Q.	You haven't told us about going to another place, this post-anaesthetic room, the wakening room.  When did you do that? 
A.	I had talked to you about surgery, but I didn't understand -- I didn't quite understand that this is the room that is referred to as salle de réveil.  I talked about surgery.  I never went to the salle de réveil or wakening room (unintelligible).  I always said that I went to the hospitalisation ward of the surgery unit.  As to the room known as salle de réveil, I found myself there when I went there for some stitches to be administered on me, but I never went there at the time. 
Q.	And I see in this passage that you give Twagirayezu a small axe.  So he's another doctor with a small axe; is he? 
A.	Yes, I see that you're repeating that, but I gave evidence in the Twagirayezu trial, and do you want us to go back to that trial?  I would like to request the President to direct the Defence counsel not to go back to what I said in the Twagirayezu trial.  I think it is clearly indicated that this is the Rwamakuba trial, but I realise that the Defence counsel is dwelling on the Twagirayezu proceedings.  I do not think this is the appropriate forum for discussing the evidence that relates to the Twagirayezu trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, I think I explained to you yesterday -- to you yesterday, that there were rules which govern what questions can be put to you and that one of our jobs, as Judges, is to apply those rules. 

Now, previous statements that you made are matters which are relevant to your testimony in this trial and those questions are, in fact, permitted by the rules that govern all proceedings.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
I now understand, Mr. President.  I wasn't aware of that.  I did not know that I had to talk -- and talk all over again of the Twagirayezu trial.  I did not know that I was giving evidence in a trial that there was -- concerned Twagirayezu.  That, I did not know, Mr. President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So it's right, obviously, you gave Dr. Twagirayezu an axe too, as well as Dr. Gatera has an axe, and Rwamakuba has an axe.   Did any other doctors have axes they used to hit people with? 
A.	The others also had it.  This is a weapon that was used by those people at the time. 
Q.	Now, you also mention a Mrs. Mukabandora, who's in prison, so that's someone else you mention.  Let's just go down, you then say that there was -- you refer to the people brought by the priest from Karama.  Now, you told us you couldn't remember any of them, but you name one here, there was one named James Sebucocera or Sera (phonetic).  Do you remember that man's name? 
A.	You have just reminded me that I had mentioned that name, but right now I don't remember the name.  But since I got acquainted with him, I had -- I got to know his name since I was there at that location. 
Q.	Then you talk of a Vincent Sebahire, James's wife, and others.  You said, "I don't know the names.  They took them and they loaded them in Sebukayire -- Sebukayire's vehicle."  Is that right?  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  It is Sebukayire who was driving that vehicle or (unintelligible) Sebukayire who was driving that vehicle, and I saw him drive it. 
Q.	Which vehicle was this? 
A.	It was a red pickup. 
Q.	So according to you, that wasn't being driven by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's son, Shalom; is that right? 
A.	No, I said -- no, I did not say that Shalom came to the hospital behind the driving wheel of any car whatsoever.  But when I was giving evidence, I did not deem it necessary to recall that it is Michel who was driving that vehicle.  I never said that Shalom drove the vehicle that came to the hospital.  Rather, it is the vehicle that came to the préfectural office that was driven by Shalom, and that is the reason why I say that the various pieces of information that you give back to me are mixed up.  That's what I've always said. 
Q.	And just so we're clear, Michel Sebukayire worked at the hospital.  He was the official hospital driver; is that right? 
A.	Yes, he was a driver and the hospital employee.  You must know that the vehicle belonged to the hospital. 
Q.	Which vehicle? 
A.	I'm referring to the red pickup; this was the vehicle that belonged to the hospital. 
Q.	Well, it's the first we've heard of that.  Can I -- can I ask you this:  In your statement you talk about people like James Sebucocera being woken up, and who did it, and being put on that vehicle.  And you -- you then say, "I immediately left the ward because people who came with me had been massacred, and then I went to hide myself at the maternity."  Now, just pausing there, by then, according to this statement, you'd seen this vehicle, but where in your present testimony before these Judges is the opportunity for you to see this vehicle before you go to maternity?  When was that? 
A.	The vehicle was parked in front of the maternity department, and people were being transported in that vehicle.  But we must say that not everything has been said, because while I was at the level -- I was in the plastic tents, there was a vehicle that came but then left later and went away. 
Q.	But I understood you to say you didn't see any vehicle then.  And, in fact, you were going around asking people what had happened to your friends.  You thought they'd gone to another ward.  So where does this fit in with all that? 
A.	I have talked about events that I witnessed before this Trial Chamber.  Well, now, you're proposing things to me, referring to incidents that took place this way and that, or here and there.  You presented them to me in a disorderly manner, but I would like to say that I have given evidence before this Tribunal of things that I witnessed. 
Q.	All right.  Now, it then says -- and perhaps you can help me with whether the Kinyarwanda is the same.  
	If you look at the document, you might get that assistance.  It says, "At the maternity, I found my elder sister, who'd been giving birth to two children, twins.  They'd been taken away by Dr. Gatera and other doctors.  I don't know -- remember the names.  And Dr. Twagirayezu was with the Interahamwe; he took away the people."  Where -- where does your sister suddenly come from, and the twins -- the two children?  Can you tell us, please? 
A.	I gave that evidence in a trial that took place in Rwanda.  As to my elder sister, she came to that location later, and I explained to the Judges that my sister had come to the hospital after I had left.  
Now, this is information that was told me, and that is why I did not deem it necessary to mention it before the Tribunal now.  I have always said that someone else gave me the information, according to which my sister came to the hospital, but she already came after I had left the hospital. 
Q.	Was your sister and her children -- did she give birth there; may I ask that? 
A.	No.  She was my elder sister, but you should understand that she was the daughter of my paternal uncle.  I hope you've understood this well.  I believe, or I think, that she came to that location with her two children.  I wasn't a witness -- I wasn't a witness to that, and that is why I didn't deem it necessary to mention the fact in this testimony that I'm giving. 
Q.	What it reads -- written down by a significant official in Rwanda, who, I assume, was trying to get it right and correct, which is read through back to you and signed by you, in an important document, as you know, is that you went to hide yourself in maternity and there you found your elder sister who had been giving birth to two children -- two twins and they were taken away by Gatera and Twagirayezu. 
A.	No, this was not properly written down.  My statements have been distorted.  My elder sister came later to the hospital.  This is someone who was with my elder sister who explained to me the circumstances of their abduc - abduction, of their being taken away.  And in my testimony, I talked about this, but I made it clear that this was told to me by someone else.  And before the Tribunal -- before this Tribunal, I am talking about things that I witnessed.  Unfortunately, the person who informed me about that died recently.  I, therefore, do not deem it necessary to talk about it because this is something that was only told me by someone else and who, unfortunately, has just died. 
Q.	And what was the name of that person? 
A.	The -- the person's name or first name was Alphonsine, but she's no more; she died following illness.  She gave me that information after the war, and it's from her that I learnt that at some point my sister was at the hospital. 
Q.	And what was her second name, Alphonsine?  
A.	I don't know her surname, but I know that her first name is Alphonsine. 
Q.	And -- and did she work at the hospital? 
A.	No.  She wasn't hospital staff.  Rather, at the time of the events, she was there as a refugee and most certainly had been at the location at the same time as my sister.  But I'm not very sure about that. 
Q.	Well, it says it in black and white, here, that you found your sister there who'd been giving birth to two children and that they were taken away by Dr. Gatera and Dr. Twagirayezu.  And you go on to say:  "Dr. Gatera had beaten me and he'd beaten, also, my one-year-old child, and he still has a lump on his head.  After they took away people, --"
MS. FALL:
Could you please give me the reference to the line where it says that she found her sister at the hospital?  This is a request for information, Counsel, my learned friend.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm reading from an English translation.  I have invited the witness to look at the original and tell me if there's any difference.  Let me find it. 
MS. FALL:
Which document are you referring to, please?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I am looking now at TM69, where she refers to, "I decided to -- I went to hide myself at the maternity.  Cave, in brackets, in English, meaning "cellar". 

There, also, Dr. Gatera, and Drs. Twa -- Gatera and Twagirayezu, as well as other doctors, whose names I no longer remember, came to take away my elder sister and the twins that she had given birth to."
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Counsel.  Perhaps there's a problem of -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel for the Prosecution said "interpretation". 
THE WITNESS:
I think I explained that, unless I'm mistaken.  I said that someone had told me that my sister had -- was at the hospital later.  I think I'd explained, unless I'm very much mistaken. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, don't be over-encouraged by that interruption.  It's in black and white that you're saying you found your sister there and she'd given birth to twins.  But I'm reading on now, after that; we've dealt with that.  We dealt with Gatera having beaten you.  Did he beat you? 
A.	There again, that's why I say what I have said was not correctly written down and I should like us to find the original.  Gatera hit my child, but not me.  Unless we can refer to the original, otherwise, what I said was misrepresented -- misnoted.  Gatera beat my child, not me.  I should like, once again, to ask that we refer to the original, because there we -- we're sure that we are dealing with the authentic document.  As to the photocopy, one cannot be as certain. 
Q.	Well, I'm certain, if you're not.  It goes on to say:  "After they took away people or he took away people, I went to hide in the sorghum near the hospital.  Then a vehicle came and stopped at the maternity.  Spoke with doctors, went inside with the female workers and went to wake up the Tutsis staying in the hospital, and they finished all the services.  I came to ask about, 'Who was that man?'  I found out that his name was Dr. Rwamakuba, André, who's detained at Arusha.  He came, saying that the Tutsi students had finished -- been finished in the university campus."  

	And you were in the hospital.  You still have Tutsis brought by the priest of Karama for treatment and you received them.  Took people away; loaded in the vehicle; papers are torn by Dr. Rwamakuba; Dr. Gatera, Dr. Twagirayezu -- suddenly arrives here, and other doctors.  Dr. Rwamakuba told them, 
(No interpretation) "...for the last time." 

Now, first of all, after Gatera had beaten either you or your child, and you say it was just your child, according to this, you leave and you hide in the sorghum field, right next to the hospital, there.  And then a vehicle arrives and people are taken out and loaded on the vehicle, and you make inquiries later who it is.  And you're told it's André Rwamakuba.  Is that, in fact, how it happened?  Is -- is that your -- how can I put it -- your mark one evidence?  That it was after you left maternity that a vehicle came with a man that you had later identitied to you as André Rwamakuba.  And then -- 
A.	No, it's not that.  If you're in a sorghum field, whom can you talk to to ask for identity, to ask about identity?  You know, these are things, events -- events that are all mixed up, topsy-turvy.  And I say you should refer to my testimony before the Trial Chamber.  You've read out yourself that I was in a sorghum field and then you say that I asked someone whose -- someone whose identity was.  What I'm saying, that in the Twagirayezu case, I made a statement, but the person that took my statement -- my (unintelligible) did them incorrectly.  

If you want, we can go through it and we can discuss what we know about Twagirayezu, or, if you like, you can go to the Gacaca hearings and hear what various people know about that person.  Otherwise, the facts reported in this document are laid out topsy-turvy. 
Q.	Did you actually give evidence in the trial of Twagirayezu?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And he was found not guilty, non culpabilis, acquitted and allowed to continue his life and practice as a doctor; is that right? 
A.	Twagirayezu was tried and, at first instance, he was imprisoned in perpetuity, and subsequently he was released.  We don't know how he was released, but at first instance, he had been condemned to life imprisonment.  And that's happened in Rwanda, many people have been released.  We don't know how they're released.  We don't know whether that doctor pleaded guilty in order to be released.  But, in general, in Rwanda, when you plead guilty, you are released. 
Q.	All right.  So that was a sort of multiple answer from you, which you sometimes give us, and it was mainly untrue, wasn't it?  First of all, Dr. Twagirayezu was acquitted, and I can produce the judgement, if you want to see it.  And in that judgement it's plain that you were disbelieved as a witness, as -- as were some of your friends from the hospital who also gave evidence, who've given evidence in this case too.  

Dr. Emmanuel Twagirayezu was found not guilty, never sentenced to life imprisonment at all.  Just found not guilty and released, and he presently works as a doctor in Rwanda.  That's the truth of it; isn't it? 
A.	That is not true.  You are not telling the truth.  Dr. Twagirayezu was condemned, at first instance, to life imprisonment with Sebukayire.  Subsequently, they were released, but they had been convicted.  People say that those two men had been released, but, in fact, they had been convicted.  It is not exceptional -- unique, in Rwanda when they plead guilty, they are released.  I think that Twagirayezu had, at first instance, been convicted, he and Sebukayire.  It is not surprising if they were released.  Perhaps they subsequently pleaded guilty and the Interahamwe that are in prison, do as much, similarly. 
Q.	All right.  Well, we'll look at that judgement shortly.  I'll get it for you and Sebukayire also was acquitted and released, I suggest. 

Now, when you gave evidence in that trial, the Gatera case, this was some years ago now, when the climate of opinion in Rwanda was probably different to what it is today.  And you gave your evidence against those people in open court with the public listening; is that correct?  Public hearings, public testimony; is that correct? 
A.	I never testified in the Gatera trial.  My written statement was read out.  I did not appear in public.  They read out my statement in public.  However, I must say, I was present at the hearing. 
Q.	And you were present and you heard ***********************************; is that right? 
A.	Not only *****************************************, but other witnesses also incriminated him.  Not only ******************************** testified against him; others testified against him.  And I must mention, in passing, that the Dr. Twagirayezu you mentioned is often accused at Gacaca sessions. 
Q.	Well, with witnesses like you about, that, I suggest, is possible.  But is it true?  Is it true what you say about him, or is it false -- a false allegation? 
A.	You speak of witnesses like me.  What witnesses are they?  How -- how are they, according to you?  
Q.	Did -- did you claim for the death of your sister against him?  Did you claim compensation? 
A.	Yes, I -- I sued a third party, because I told that she died in hospital.  Is that -- is that incorrect?  Is that a mistake?  
Q.	Were you claiming four million francs? 
A.	I don't remember; it's a long time ago.  The matter was tried.  We filled out the document, but I don't remember that item exactly.  I'm not an intellectual.  To remember whether I claimed damages, I don't remember, in any case.  I -- I don't even think about it anymore. 
Q.	But in the Twagirayezu case, in your procès-verbal statement -- and we don't have your evidence here, just your statement -- it -- it seems plain that you're there claiming to the court that you were a witness to your sister's death.  Whereas, in fact, you told us that it was all you know about what had befell your sister you've got second hand through somebody else.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  The notes are badly taken.  If I'd read it well before, I could have pointed out to the Tribunal.  The person who informed me is deceased, and I must say that I didn't make the statement as you are putting it.  That is incorrect. 
Q.	All right.  Now, I want you to look, finally, at another procès-verbal statement, and this is one you made in the case of Kageruka, Dr. Kageruka.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can this be distributed, please?  

There's a copy, there, for the witness, and the rest for Judges and distribution.  So there's a copy, here, for the witness in Kinyarwanda, the Kinyarwanda photocopied original, and triplicate Kinyarwanda, French and English.  And this document won't be part of the bundle you've seen, this is a new document. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness --  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. Issa, do go there, but can you bring back one, please, because I've given you all I've got.  
Thank you. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And looking at that, we're now very familiar, aren't we, with these documents, all forming basically the same format.  And this is headed:  "République Rwandese MINADEFF, Auditorat Militaire," because this was a military court because Dr. Kageruka was jointly tried with soldiers, and so he fell under a military jurisdiction, but he had a trial, in any event and I'd like you, please, to turn through -- over the first page, second page, third page, noticing, I hope, your signature again in the left-hand columns -- margins.  It's quite a long statement, and eventually on page six, at the bottom, in its usual place in these documents, on the left-hand side, if you can look, you will see your name and your signature.  And do you agree that that is so, Madam Witness? 
A.	I have said that I do not agree with the signature on the photocopies.  I have asked you to produce the original of the document.  Sometimes things can be added to photocopies.  I have consistently told you that I do not agree with the photocopies.  You've practically compelled me to recognise my signature, but I do not agree in any case.  There's a mix-up of events. 
Q.	So there's two things, there.  You don't agree with photocopies and, in any event, there's a mix-up of events on the document.  Now, a photocopy is what it says.  It's a photograph, essentially, of the original document.  You understand that, don't you?  Do you? 
A.	I hear what you're saying; I hear your explanation.  I have not yet read the documents.  If it's a statement in the Kageruka trial, I must tell you that he was tried and put in the first category and convicted.  I don't know if you want to dis -- exculpate him or find him innocent.  If he is guilty, he can be released.  Everyone in Rwanda who's pleaded guilty was released. 
Q.	And interestingly, the Rwandan authorities, when they take these statements, they don't type them because typing can be altered, can't it?  They write it by hand for reasons of authenticity; that's right, isn't it?  You understand, it's harder to change a written document in one man's hand than it is to change, perhaps, a typed document, particularly these days with word processors and things.  
	But anyway, looking at that document -- and we're coming up to a break and, if you want to, you can look at it and satisfy yourself, if anything, as you suggest, has been added.  I suggest it hasn't.  But, let's look, see what you say.  First of all, it is right, isn't it, that you gave evidence in the Kageruka military trial, yes or no, please? 
A.	I did not testify in the Kageruka case, but my -- my statement, rather, was read out.  But I did not appear before the Tribunal to testify.  Merely, my statement was read out.  But, in as much as he was with soldiers, I had to appear to speak of the soldiers that I had seen where I was. 
Q.	Now, this statement is -- give me one moment -- is dated the 11th of June '98.  So, in fact, it pre-dates the Twagirayezu PV.  So, in sequence, we have Gatera, André Rwamakuba, ICTR, this one, and then Twagirayezu, and then Muvunyi.  So in that context, let's see what you say. You say that you've come to accuse Kageruka, 2nd Lieutenant Bizimana and Lieutenant Corporal Aloys Mazimpaka, who is not the special representative to the ICTR who, I think, has the same name. 

Now, what are you accusing Dr. Kageruka of?  You say, "I'm accusing him of genocide at the hospital."  And you talk about how you get to the hospital, and then you say this:  "I went directly to the tent of the Red Cross.  I then saw Dr. Gatera accompanied by soldiers and Dr. Kageruka, who had just taken the people and was loading them into a vehicle, and they've never been seen again afterwards.  They killed them straightaway.  I heard Dr. Gatera say, 'Take them to the military disabled people who are in the ESO' -- the sous officer college - 'to raise their spirits.'  I immediately went to maternity." 

Now, before we go to maternity -- is that right?  Is that right, that you heard Gatera telling -- telling people to be taken to the military disabled at the ESO; is that right? 
A.	The notes, the -- this has been incorrectly noted.  I made that statement at the préfectural office.  With respect, I said that with regard to the incident at the préfecture.  It seems to me that you're confusing events, or the one who took the notes took them incorrectly. 
Q.	Or is it that you just make up stories as you go along? 
A.	No, don't try to minimise the genocide in Rwanda.  I'm not inventing anything.  Sometimes you make a statement and the statement is -- sometimes one makes a statement and the state -- that it is incorrectly noted.  It's not in chronological order.  Sometimes a statement was read and I pointed out mistakes, but they did not correct them, and in the meantime -- and sometimes, one would go to testify before a court to explain what happens more adequately, and I would tell people noting statements that it was not necessary to strike things out, my corrections, that I was ready to go and make the corrections before the court.  I did not know that you were going to dwell on those mistakes that haven't been corrected and accuse me of not having told the truth.  According to what you say, it seems to me that you do not recognise -- do not acknowledge the genocide, that the genocide did not take place, and that those who said the genocide took place are lying. 
Q.	Then it goes on:  "I immediately went to maternity where I found my elder sister, who'd given birth to a boy there."   So is this the second time that the authorities in Rwanda have got your story wrong, or is the truth of it that here, for the first time, and again later in the Twagirayezu procès-verbal statement, you're spinning an untrue story?  
A.	You can see for yourself that the person that took notes did it incorrectly.  Somewhere it is stated that my elder sister had twins.  And, here, you're speaking of a boy.  It's not correct.  There's a mix-up.  I don't know why the statement was incorrectly noted.  I don't know how we can continue to come and testify.  In any case, it would be better for us to write down our statement ourselves.  I don't know how the statement was -- this present statement was taken down.  Perhaps Defence counsel has added those things in order to minimise the genocide that occurred in Rwanda.  

I speak of events I witnessed with my own eyes in Rwanda.  I was a long time at that place between the -- from the 21st of April until the end of the war, I was in Butare town.  Why would I give different versions of the facts of the events?  I don't know why it was written down in this way.  And I'm not the only survivor in that place.  I think that some of those people also come to testify before the Tribunal, but what is clear is that there is a mix-up of events in this recorded statement.  I don't know who took the notes and where they get these things from. 
Q.	I think we get the picture.  Would it be fair to say that the more difficulties you get in there, in the witness box, the more you talk; is that right? 
A.	I am not loquacious.  It is, rather, because when I remember something or when something is told to me, I report it, and sometimes I forget some events.  When I remember an event, I add it -- 
Q.	Can we come to another question.  

So you say, "I immediately went to maternity where I found my elder sister who'd given birth to a boy there."  And we've dealt with that.  I'm not going to trouble you anymore with that.  Then, you go on and say this:  "I spent approximately five days there," which, from my calculation, would mean that you'd have left by -- on or about the 29th of April.  Would that be right? 
A.	No, this is your own computation.  To my recollection, there's no exact date.  I said it -- I testified here before the Court.  I repeat that what I say here is the truth in my testimony.  This statement, before us, is incorrect.  Some facts are true, others not.  So I would ask you to allow me to go and suckle my child. 
Q.	All right.  Well, we're going to -- we'll do that -- we'll be allowed to do that, I'm sure, in -- in about seven minutes, which isn't very long off.  And perhaps I can be dealt with all, if not most, of this PV by then.  
And let me just read what you say:  "I saw the staff members --" so this is when you're in maternity, you say for five days here, "I saw the staff members come and record the beds occupied by the Tutsis.   And then I saw Dr. Kageruka and Dr. Gatera accompanied by soldiers coming down and saying that every woman who gave birth to a boy should die together with her child.  It was then they entered the room where we were, and Dr. Kageruka asked me to show the identity cards.  I answered that I didn't have one.  Dr. Gatera came to support him, saying that any person who had no identity card would be considered --" and, I can't read my English translation, it's too faint.  I -- I suspect it means, "Would be considered a Tutsi or Inyenzi or whatever."  

"And then, when Dr. -- it was then that Dr. Gatera violently grabbed a big club from an Interahamwe, who was with him, and hit me on my arm and on my back.  He also hit my baby on the head.  I immediately fell under the bed.  My baby cried a lot and straightaway they woke up my elder sister and her baby, together with her two other children.  They took them away, loaded them into a vehicle and woke up many other Tutsi women, who'd given birth to boys." 

So there we are.  This time, it's Dr. Kageruka and Gatera with soldiers.  No mention of anybody else coming in in this passage, and you're hit by Dr. Gatera with a club on your back.  You remember that we had mentioned yesterday, in another document of -- of a broken vertebra, or something like that.  And hit your baby on the head, and you go under the bed, and then your sister, baby -- two children, all specifically spoken about. 

Now, you say, again, this is all a mix-up.  It's all a misunderstanding and that you didn't say these things, or is the truth of it, this is exactly what you said?  They got your words dead right and it's not true? 
A.	Some things are incorrect.  Dr. Gatera struck my child.  He didn't strike me, as far as I'm concerned.  You say they broke my spine; that is not correct.  I was struck when I was at the préfecture.  I said that at the hospital only my child was struck.  I was not struck at the hospital.  

Moreover, my elder sister was there, but I didn't see her.  It was another lady who told me that, who had been with her.  To say that I saw Kageruka wake up people doesn't mean that during the time when I saw the others --- well, I told you, I was at the hospital for quite some time.  It is true that I saw Dr. Kageruka, who was waking up patients, women.  There was especially a woman -- there was even a woman that he helped her to give birth and whom he abandoned.  

If I say that I was there from the 21st of April until the beginning of May and now you're telling me -- you're telling me of mixed up events, but I must point out that some events are true.  Apart, of course, from what you're adding. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) your evidence, because I -- I -- to help you in the long run, I hope. 

Now, over the page in the English, you're asked who was there, and you say:  "Yes, Dr. Kageruka was there, and it was he who loaded them onto the car, assisted by Dr. Gatera and the soldiers who were with them."  No mention of Rwamakuba at all.  

And then, a little later, we get this, perhaps, telling -- well, you're asked:  "Did Kageruka say anything when he hit you -- when Gatera hit you or hit your baby?"  And you said:  "Dr. Kageruka told him, 'Don't kill her here because her baby's crying loud.  In a moment, a vehicle will be here to take them.'"  So these are all matters that we haven't heard of before. 

And then you were asked this:  "Do you know anything else about Dr. Kageruka?"   And listen to what you say.  "What I know is that after having loaded these women into the vehicle, Dr. Kageruka told them, 'Look at the world for the last time,' and he took away their identity cards and tore them up." 
A.	I should like to explain to the Trial Chamber, to the Court, that the vehicle didn't come only once, it came often, and Dr. Gatera and Dr. Kageruka were together.  At one point, they were with Dr. Rwamakuba, but not always together.  I was present and the vehicle came to take people away every day.  Not once or twice, it was several times.  I testified in the Gatera trial.  I accused Dr. Gatera, I accused Dr. Kageruka, because I saw them often coming to the hospital.  And, if I did not mention Dr. Rwamakuba, it is not correct, because I told you that when I saw Dr. Rwamakuba, I was still there.  I saw Dr. Rwamakuba -- 
Q.	Right -- 
A.	-- on the occasion I mentioned, in the company of Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	But you see, your mistake is that you've tide these into specific incidents, like, when your child's hit.  So we can see that you're talking about the same incident and you're moving the personalities around.  You're introducing personalities.  You've become a rent-a-witness, haven't you?  You'll say what needs to be said for the trial that you're to appear in, whether it's Twagirayezu, or Gatera, or Kageruka, whether it's Rwamakuba?  Whether it was Muvunyi, but they didn't call you for that.  Whether it's Butare, but they didn't call you for that.  And you can sit there, knowing your name is protected, you can sit there and tell untruths.  You wouldn't say this in Rwanda, would you?   Not today, because you wouldn't like people to know that you're untruthful.  But you can do it here and claim witness protection.  I suggest you're not the only one, you come here and you feel you can lie with impunity.
A.	Mr. President, I didn't come before the Court to lie.  In any case, he's ascribing intentions to me.  I took the oath.  I did not come here to mislead people and lie.  He says that I asked for my name not to be revealed.  I must tell you that I often testify in Rwanda in Gacaca trials.  I give all the information.  I think it is the reason for which -- moreover, my security is ensured because I have given sufficient in -- detailed information on what happened in Rwanda.  I always take part in Gacaca proceedings in Rwanda.  Counsel for the Defence is ascribing intentions to me. 

Mr. President, I would beg you instantly to be able to go and suckle my child. 
Q.	I've only got a few minutes left with you.  But, perhaps, given your compelling need, I don't -- I can do that later. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I think that we should take the break now. 

We'll take the short recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1033H)
(Pages 1 to 15 by Jean Baigent)











(Court resumed at 1045H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, good morning, we can now resume.  

Madam Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you perfectly, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Now we can resume.  

Mr. Hooper? 
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	We finished your last statement, and it was to the effect that you saw Dr. Kageruka on several occasions there.  Is that right, at the hospital? 
A.	I had already said so.  Dr. Kageruka was an employee of the hospital. 
Q.	During the genocide, you saw him several times, you were telling us.  This is why you mentioned him; is that right? 
A.	During the entire period while I was there, Dr. Kageruka was working at the hospital.  He was on duty at that hospital. 
Q.	And so, I see, with some interest, one of your replies in the last PV, where after saying that -- you were asked this question, "Did you know Dr. Kageruka before?  No, I did not know him.  The first time I saw him was in the hospital when they were taking away those women.  The second time I saw him was during the trial.  That's how I knew that his name was Dr. Kageruka."  
A.  	I have said that normally, I did not know him.  I did not know that that person was Dr. Kageruka, but since he was an employee of the hospital, and that I was seeing him working there.  Others pointed him out to me saying that that was Dr. Kageruka; otherwise, before I came to the hospital, I did not know anybody in the hospital. 
Q.	I would like you to finally look at a list of names which is a list that we are all familiar with.  Can I pass this document up to you, please?  Now, we are referring to those names, not by name, we are not uttering them loud, but by number.  So, for example, the first one we know as number 1.  Is there anyone on that list you do not know? 
A.	Yes, there are some persons on the list that I do not know. 
Q.	Well, it's probably just as well that we take them thoroughly and in order as we've done before.  What is your knowledge of the first one, number 1?  Do you know that person? 
A.	No, I do not know the person number 1. 
Q.	Number 2? 
A.	I do not know number 2 either. 
Q.	Number 3? 
A.	I know number 3. 
Q.	Did you see number 3 there during the genocide? 
A.	No, I did not see number 3 there.  I know this person, because one day I went to consult the doctor, my child was ill and that is how I got to know this person. 
Q.	And that's subsequent obviously, to the event we are dealing with.  

	Number 4, do you know that person? 
A.	I do not know number 4. 
Q.	Number 5, do you know that person? 
A.	Yes, I met that person during the war.  I know that person.  
Q.	Can you tell us when and where you met that person during the war? 
A.	I got to know the person during the war, because this person was also at the hospital. 
Q.	Where did you see her? 
A.	I saw her at the university hospital.  That's where we got acquainted. 
Q.	Where at the university hospital?  In maternity or elsewhere? 
A.	I got acquainted with that person while we were at the hospital. 
Q.	Was that in maternity or elsewhere? 
A.	It was quite close to the surgery unit. 
Q.	And how many times did you see her there, during the time you were there? 
A.	I can't know the number of times I met her, but at a certain point she was no longer at the hospital and I never saw her again. 
Q.	When you saw her, was anything going on in particular? 
A.	When I met her -- well, I met her one day where the attackers were pulling our people from their beds and taking them away.  On other occasions, I met her while I was going to take some porridge for my child.  That is how I met her. 
Q.	She had a brother in the hospital.  Do you know what happened to him? 
A.	No, I know nothing of it.  All I know is that her elder brother is no longer alive.  He was killed, but I know nothing else. 
Q.	Did you identify André Rwamakuba to her at any time? 
A.	Yes, at a certain point in time we were together and I saw Rwamakuba, I was the one who told her that that was André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	And that was as a consequence to what the Hutu lady had told and the person whose name you wrote down on a piece of paper, told you, is that right? 
A.	Can you please repeat your question?  
Q.	Perhaps, it was a comment rather than a question.  I wouldn't repeat it.  
Q.	Well, when you say you identified Rwamakuba to him, what was Rwamakuba doing, and where were you? 
A.	People were being sent out of the surgery ward.  We were in the corridor.  I had just taken some porridge for the patient.  We were going down and moving towards the maternity.  
Q.	So this would be the same occasion that you told us about Rwamakuba: you are coming back with the porridge, you look in, you see Rwamakuba, the man in the plaster cast.  It's the same occasion.  That would be right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, it was on that same occasion. 
Q.	And was this before or after you spoke to the man whose name you wrote on a piece of paper who'd identified Rwamakuba to you? 
A.	This happened on the same day. 
Q.	Was it before or after he'd identified Rwamakuba to you? 
A.	I think you want me to repeat all that I have said already.  I went to the surgery ward, and to repeat myself, somebody pointed out Rwamakuba to me, people were being sent out, people were screaming, there was a din.  I asked these people what was happening, and the person explained to me what was happening.  I continued on my way and when I got further down, I met a woman to whom I related what I had just seen.  I do not know why you haven't understood, whereas, this is not the first time that I'm giving such explanations. 
Q.	Did she tell you that that man had just killed her brother with an axe, had been party to it? 
A.	I don't think I can remember anything like that. 
Q.	Lets' move on to number 6.  Do you know her?  Did you know her during the genocide? 
A.	Yes, I knew her during the genocide.  I didn't know her before then. 
Q.	Where did you meet? 
A.	I met her at the university hospital. 
Q.	Where, please? 
A.	I remember that I met that person, but I can't say exactly where.  I don't know at what location of the hospital that I met her. 
Q.	Wasn't she in the same maternity room as you? 
A.	I don't quite remember.  I don't recall. 
Q.	So I suggest, from each of your descriptions of where you were, you were in the same room, weren't you?  The basement maternity room for difficult pregnancies, day after day, night after night, if your stories are true.  How don't you remember her?  How could you miss her?  
A.	Frankly speaking, I don't quite remember her.  All that I remember is that she was a patient minder for her elder sister.  I believe that her sister had a premature born child.  I think they were at the paediatric ward. 
Q.	Who?  We were told they were in maternity, in the basement where you were? 
A.	Frankly speaking, I would like to reiterate the fact that I don't recall.  I know that when I knew her, she was a patient minder for her elder sister.  At a certain point they were transferred to the paediatric ward and she continued to tend to her elder sister in the paediatric ward.  But I don't have a clear recollection of that. 
Q.	Did you see her? 
A.	I don't remember having seen her elder sister. 
Q.	Did you identify Rwamakuba to her? 
A.	I know nothing of it.  I am not sure that I identified Rwamakuba to her.  We spoke of various events.  I can't recollect whether I identified Rwamakuba to her. 
Q.	You see, she has told more --
A.	And what's more, we were living under poor conditions. 
Q.	You see, she has told us -- let me finish.  She told us that you did identify him to her, albeit the first time she ever said that was in the witness box recently.  Is that right?  
A.	I don't remember having identified Rwamakuba to her.  I can't recall.  I don't know why you are not understanding me, but I can't remember. 
Q.	Is she a friend of yours, number 6? 
A.	Yes, she is my friend.  Even after the war we continued to maintain relations of friendship, but she never recalled to me that I am the one who might have identified Rwamakuba to her. 
Q.	And we needn't bother with number 8, as we discussed him.  

	Number 9, is she a friend of yours? 
A.	No, number 9 is not my friend. 
Q.	Do you know her? 
A.	No, I do not know that person.  I don't know her very well. 
Q.	Is it right that you, number 6, number 5, all made statements to this tribunal, your first statements, on the same day?  Is that right? 
A.	No, I did not have that information. 
Q.	Are you a member of any organisation, the survivors organisation, Ibuka, for example?  Are you a member of that? 
A.	And what would that imply if one is a member?  What do you mean by that, that I am an employee of Ibuka?  I don't understand the purpose of your question. 
Q.	Is it yes or no, please? 
A.	Ibuka is an organisation, but I would like to say that the fact that one is a member of Ibuka, means that I always have to recall the events that happened, and that is why every year, we must commemmorate, we must recall the tragic events that occurred, but this does not mean that I work for Ibuka. 
Q.	No, that wasn't the question.  One can well understand you'd want the support and help of groups like that, and I don't criticise that.  Are you a member of a group called Avega?  Yes or no, please? 
A.	No, I am not a member of Avega. 
Q.	Are you a member of Akasa? 
A.	What organisation are you referring to?  I do not quite understand. 
Q.	Akasa? 
A.	I think you are referring to Abassa.  This is an association which is called Abassa.  I am' not a member of Abassa.  Before, I used to be a member of that organisation, but I'm no longer a member thereof. 
Q.	That was an association ************* by number 9 on that list.  Is that right? 
A.	That is an association -- while I was a member of that association number 9 ************************** that association.  The president of the association was a reverend sister, but she no longer holds that position.  When I left the association, there was a reverend sister who was heading that association.    I do not know, if today, the association is *************** number 9. 
Q.	Finally, I want to come back to the Twagirayezu judgement.  I thought we'd laid our hands on it, but I think not.  Can I just pass up the Kinyarwanda document, which I'll ask to be exhibited in due course which is the final judgement.  Can I just pass this up to you to look at, please?  And it is in Kinyarwanda.  The head note reads:  "Judgement of the Trial. Court of First Instance Butare, Ordinary Session for the hearing of trials of people accused of genocide and crimes against humanity.  The court has made the judgement of the trial as follows: Judgment of the trial in public 14th of June 2001."  And then, on the first page, is, "The accused, Dr. Twagirayezu, Emmanuel, son of Casino" et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  2. Sebukayire, Michel, and his details.  The charges, if you look at the front page, please, Madam.  You can contradict anything I am suggesting to you.  The charges being --  
MS. FALL: 
	Counsel, please, is there a translation of the judgement?  Do you have a translation of the judgement? 
MR. HOOPER: 
	I am reading from it.  I only have the one I'm afraid.  And if you look on the first page, the charges, such as they concerned us, are that they both, according to articles of the criminal code in Butare, committed crimes against humanity, they killed people belonging to an ethnic group, crimes of genocide, and then, there is a review over the next many pages; and I invite you to look at the last page, if you wish, madam, the very last page of the judgement of the judgement.  It is pretty easy to follow, where there is a recital of the penal code and its decrees and international obligations, and a review of the quest for compensation by applicants.  So, it's the request of the Prosecution to convict, the request of the applicants for compensation.  The court has decided that the two requests were baseless, that the charges of genocide, of murder, creating a criminal group, travelling and looting, giving instructions to kill and the crime of mockery against Twagirayezu, against Sebukayire are baseless, as is being explained in the judgement.  Therefore, they have been acquitted of all charges and that no compensation shall be given as there was no crime; that they be released immediately after the reading of the judgement.  And finally, that this was the trial case being judged and read in public in this court of first instance at Butare on the 14th of June composed of -- it gives the name of the presiding judge, his two co-adjudicating judges and the secretary to the court.  Signed by the president of the court, the presiding judge, co-adjudicating judges and the registrar.
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.  	So Madam Witness, a complete and clear contradiction, I suggest, of your evidence this morning, and one I suggest must have been known to you in its detail.  So why did you mislead the Court this morning?  Straightforward issue. 
A.	I didn't want to mislead the Court.  That is not the purpose of my presence here.  I would invite you to undertake an investigation in Rwanda, and you'll find that at first instance, Twagirayezu and Michel, were condemned to life imprisonment, whereas, there is an association affiliated to the Roman Catholic Church which was led by a doctor by the name of Ngaboziza (phonetic), who was working with the doctors accused.  All the members of that organisation contributed money and obtained the release of Twagirayezu and Michel.  And that matter is now before the Gacaca Court. 
Q.	Well, we heard what you said, thank you, very much.  
	By the way, you have brought to mind one thing I haven't put to you yet.  You gave evidence in the Misago case, Monseigneur Misago, I think the papal nuncio in Rwanda, who was one of the leading churchman in Rwanda, you gave evidence for the Prosecution in that case, did you not?  
A.  	I have seen you each time supporting what you said with documents.  Please produce a document in respect of the point you've just raised.
Q.  	You are a sharp one, aren't you?  Because you know I've declared all those procés-verbal statements that I've got, but you might be wrong.  You just think about your answer again, please.  Did you or did you not give evidence in the Misago case? 
A.	Counsel, I said that I have seen that you've closely followed everything I have said in various trials in Rwanda, and you've always supported that with documents.  Similarly, you can produce a document regarding that matter because, as you said, you have records, procés-verbal records of the various trials. 
Q.	Let us see if we can enjoy evidence with a straight answer.  Did you give evidence or provide a statement in the Misago case, yes or no? 
A.	My answer -- in my words, my answer is, Mr. President, you must have seen notice that there always were pro justitia documents in each matter.  I should like that to be the case also now, in this matter.  
Q.	Are you capable of answering the simple question?  Did you give evidence in the Misago case or provide a statement?  It's a very simple question.  You know what the position was.  Was it yes or no?  This is an answer for the Judges, not for me. 
A.	I have answered the question.  You have pro justitia records of all the testimony I gave in various cases.  You can produce one concerning the present matter under discussion.  That is what I'm answering now.  
Q.	Well, thank you for your frank reply.  
MR. HOOPER: 
	Mr. Issa, can I invite you to show the witness this document, please?  Can you show her the signature at the bottom?  
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.  	So what's your answer, yes or no?  Did you give evidence or provide a statement? 
A.	I asked to see the photocopy because that's how we have proceeded regarding previous questions, and in this case, I have seen the photocopy in question.  This is what I was saying, but for now, we can continue.  That is what I wanted to obtain.  
MS. FALL: 
	Could I see a copy of that document, Counsel? 
MR. HOOPER:    
	I can provide you with a copy of the one the witness has.  All right, I wasn't going to bother -- 
MS. FALL:  
	I should like to draw the attention of the Court to the procedure of disclosure.  
MR. HOOPER:    
	I wasn't going to use it, but now I've been put in a position where I will do, I'll disclose it.  The only reason this is being put in, to add to all the documents, is the intransigence of the witness in coming to an answer.  And it's produced to provoke an answer from the witness, and the answer is, yes, she did give evidence.  And this deals with Monseigneur Misago. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.  	And there is very little in it relevant, Madam Witness, to our concerns, but right at the bottom of the English translation, it's translated as, "During the night on the day when Monseigneur Misago came to Kibeho, I continued to flee to Karama.  I was wounded.  The priest from Karama, whose name was Ngomarakiza, took us to the university hospital at Butare.  There I was bandaged, but they refused to keep us there.  We went to the Butare prefecture.  We found a number of refugees there."  So, one view -- your account here is that you didn't stay at the hospital, because they refused to keep you there and you go on to the prefecture.  Looking at this document again, it may have more relevance than I had given originally.  Is that what you were saying in the Misago case, that you didn't stay at the hospital at all?  Is that why you were so anxious to see if I had the document?  
A.	No, you are ascribing intentions to me that I never had.  There is something you don't know Counsel.  I cannot remember everything I put in all my statements.  You said that I arrived at the hospital and that I left to go to the prefecture, but what you've just told me there is without meeting -- because I stayed at the hospital, and after, I went to préfectural office.  You come back to various topics and are delaying proceedings.  
Q.  	I've only got one more question.  Is it right that Monseigneur Misago was acquitted, found not guilty and released? 
A.	I did not follow that closely.  Those who are in charge of that did it.  I am not the only one to have accused him.  Several people saw him at different times.  They did what they had to do.  As to the follow-up of the trial, I don't know.  You said he was acquitted?  I know that he is bishop at Gikongoro, and you say he was acquitted, fine, but nonetheless, he's consistently accused before the Gacaca jurisdiction. 
Q.	And his was the biggest public trial in Rwanda, and you are honestly telling this Court you didn't know the result in a case you gave evidence in? 
A.	Frankly, I don't know how the matter terminated.  At one point, I did hear that she (sic) had resumed his position as bishop, but that doesn't alter the fact that he committed the misdeeds we accused him of.  The proof of that is even at the time of Gacaca proceedings, the people brought incriminating evidence against the bishop in question.  
MR. HOOPER: 
	I've finished.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Madam Witness, the counsel for the Accused has completed his questioning of you, but you will still have to answer a few more questions, because under the Rules of Procedure the Prosecutor is allowed to ask you some further questions.  Do you understand that?    
THE WITNESS: 
	I understand. 
MS. FALL: 
	Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:   
Q.	Madam Witness, I'll be putting questions to you in respect of Counsel Hooper's cross-examination, and I'll be referring frequently to what he said or suggested.  I should like to come back very quickly to the testimony you gave in Rwanda.  After you explained the nature of the various pro justitia, you explained that you had testified in various trials.  Madam Witness, I should like to ask you, can you tell us again in which trials you testified? 
A.	Do you want me to give you the names of the people in the various trials?  
Q.	Yes, madam.  Precisely.  
A.	The first person was Dr. Gatera,  Dr. Kageruka,Dr. Twagirayezu.  There is a lady, Gatera's sister.  She hasn't come to trial yet.  It's someone whose involvement we discovered in the course of the Gacaca proceedings.  And there are two soldiers, 2nd Lieutenat Bizimana and 
	2nd Lieutenant Mazimpaka.  And then there was the Monseigneur Misago case; in fact, a case I've forgotten. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us what reason led you to testify against those people? 
A.	I went to testify in those cases because I was a witness to events, to the events in various cases.  I would add that people came to question us in respect of the various cases, and we supplied the information in our possession, and that is how I came to testify in those said cases. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you said that you were a witness to these events that occurred.  Can you tell us exactly, where such events occurred?   
MR. HOOPER:  
	I don't know how this arises in cross-examination (sic).  It is, in any event, a repetition of a question that was put in chief.  
THE WITNESS: 
	As to the place where such events occurred, I can mention the teaching hospital, I can mention the office's of Butare préfecture and Kibeho, a place where I stayed for a while.  Briefly put, wherever I stayed and saw horrible misdeeds committed, I spoke about them upon being questioned about them one time or another.  
BY MS. FALL: 
Q.	Madam Witness, when you were questioned regarding those cases, for most of them, it concerned individuals.  Is that correct? 
A.	In general, it was a question of an individual involved with (inaudible)  When giving our statements, we had to concentrate on the incriminated individual. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us, in respect of the people at the university teaching hospital, did you see them also together? 
A.	Those doctors were always together.  However, as to Minister André Rwamakuba, he was not always with the doctors in question.  The occasions in which I saw him are those which I have spoken of, but I do insist that the other doctors I saw often, and I saw reprehensible deeds they committed, and that is how I spoke of Twagirayezu, Kageruka.  I often mentioned them together.  But I didn't often mention Rwamakuba, because he wasn't in Rwanda.  When questions were put to me, when the investigators questioned me, I did not think that it was necessary to mention his name in Rwanda in the various cases.  I thought that one time or another I would come to mention -- speak of him at length, but I had that feeling as of the moment the investigators came to interview me.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  When you were questioned as to whether -- what were, apparently, contradictions brought to your attention, for example, when you said you didn't see people die at the hospital, I should like to know whether many people died at the university teaching hospital.
A.	Yes, I witnessed that.  Many people died at the teaching hospital.  They were struck with an axe before my eyes.  Many people were taken away in the pickup truck before my eyes.  Recently, we exhumed the corpses and we re-inhumed them in dignity, and there are other human remains that are buried somewhere and we go on searching for wherever people were buried so as to exhume the remains and re-inhumed them in dignity. 
Q.	You told us that recently you reburied bodies that have been exhumed.  Can you tell us where that was? 
A.	I said that was some time ago.  To begin with, we exhumed corpses very near the clinic, but recently, the last time we re-inhumed in dignity, I think it was last year.  It was in front of the maternity below the ablutions.  We exhumed some human remains and reburied them in dignity.  Those are the events I was referring to just before.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Madam Fall, this exhumation and reburial was not mentioned either in examination-in-chief nor in cross-examination.  It really should not come up in re-examination.  I know it came up by accident, but it's something completely new.  
MS. FALL:    
	I think it's in respect of a question I put to the witness that she intervened and spoke of exhumation and bodies that had been dug up.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	I know you didn't ask the question specifically, but I think I should have mentioned that.  
MS. FALL:   
	Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:  
Q.	I would come to a point concerning a Hutu lady for whom you were a carer.  The question was put to you as to whether you knew her name.  You answered in the negative.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I don't know the name of the lady whose carer I was.  I never asked her name.  
Q.	When you spoke to that lady, how did you address her?  By what name did you address her?  
A.	I never called her.  We could discuss, but I never asked her to tell me her name. 
Q.	In his cross-examination, Mr. Hooper has said that there were archives at the hospital and you could therefore seek to know her name.  Did you know at the time, where the hospital archives were? 
A.	I wasn't informed as to the records of the hospital, and I didn't go to consult them to know the name of the woman.  As far as I am concerned, it wasn't important to know her name. 
Q.	Madam Witness, regarding the man that you met and who identified André Rwamakuba to you and whose name you jotted on a piece of paper, Counsel Hooper suggested that you did not talk about that person in your previous statement.  Can you tell us whether you had the opportunity of mentioning that person's name before? 
A.	I mentioned the name of the person in question here in the courtroom.  Before that, nobody had put any question to me in respect of that man, so I have mentioned his name only in this courtroom. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you were given a list of names and you were requested to say which people on the list you knew.  You indicated the persons you knew.  You even said what relations you had with them.  Can you describe the exact -- if possible, the exact nature of the relation you had with those persons? 
A.	We met during the war.  I met them at the hospital during the war, but on the list is the name of a person I did not meet and I know the person.  Well, the person in question is a person I met when I went to have my child treated medically at the clinic.  But as to the others, we met during the war.
Q.		Madam Witness, over several days you related events that occurred at the hospital, and at a certain point Counsel Hooper suggested that you were giving accounts of events, whereas they were not true.  As for the time you met Rwamakuba, I'd like to come back to that point and to ask you to tell us how many times you met André Rwamakuba.  
A.		I think I saw him at the hospital three times, and I met him for the fourth time in the préfectural office.  I saw him either three or four times.  
Q.		Madam Witness, can you tell us, when was the first time you saw André Rwamakuba?  Where were you? 
A.		I saw him while I was in front of the paediatric ward in the tent.  I saw him again at the maternity.  And on another occasion I saw him in the surgery ward.  And in yet another occasion I saw him in the préfectural office.  
Q.		So for the record, in order to be clear, the first time you saw him was when you say you were in front of the paediatric unit; is that correct? 
A.		That is correct.  I saw him on the spot.  
Q.		And the other time, when was that? 
A.		The second time I saw him was at the maternity. 
Q.		How about a third time? 
A.		I saw him at the in-patient ward or hospitalisation ward of the surgery unit. 
Q.		And what you refer as the fourth time, where was that? 
A.		I was in the préfectural office then. 
Q.	I will not go -- I will not take up what you saw André Rwamakuba do, since you have already explained that at length here. 

Now, Madam Witness, I will just put the last question to you.  Much has been said about the evidence that you gave in Rwanda, and it has been said that most of the people were acquitted, most of the accused were acquitted.  Do you have knowledge of persons who were acquitted and who were later arrested again following the Gacaca proceedings? 
A.	At that stage, information is still being gathered.  People have not yet been charged and sentenced to prison. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, at this stage, I have no further questions for the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor. 

Madam Witness, your testimony has now come to a complete end, and we are now going to discharge you and allow you to return home.  I just thank you for coming to testify at the Tribunal.  You are free to go.  
THE WITNESS:
I would like to thank you too, Mr. President.  If you need me on a different occasion, you can always invite me, if I'm still alive. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, could I just indicate there's some sorting out to do with the exhibits, but I needn't trouble you just at the moment with that, unless -- yes, just see what the position is really at this stage.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Before we (inaudible) Ms. Fall had mentioned that there was an issue.  It's ten past twelve now.  Is this an appropriate time to address that issue?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think that probably we could take the exhibits, because I would like that that issue be discussed in a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But do you have an idea how long it's likely to last?  Is that something we can complete before lunch?  
MS. FALL: 
Yes, I think that can be done, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  Well, can I defer the exhibits and then we can deal with them all together, which would be probably more convenient, and we can also assist the registry with them.  

Can I have an indication, is it possible, as to what the future is in respect of witnesses?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think we should deal with the -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
The matter first.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The matter first.  And then afterwards we can discuss that. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, should we go into -- would -- should we go into closed session now?  That may seem to be the best procedure.  
MS. FALL: 
Well, I don't know if we'll begin with the admitting of exhibits.  I wonder if I understood well if -- if we have to tender exhibits now, probably we can go into closed session only later.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, could we deal with the exhibits later after we've discussed it with the registry?  That's our preferred position, because it's quite complicated -- well, a little complicated.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, we think there is something -- an advantage to be gained to -- as on some previous occasions, I think there are quite a few exhibits outstanding now, and it might be better if you and Defence agree a list which you can just read into the record.  So it might be more convenient for us to hear you now and come back after lunch just to admit the exhibits, if that is -- we might be able to get through it more effectively that way.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think it is the Defence that intend -- that is seeking to tender exhibits.  We have a list of the exhibits.  We don't have any particular problem in respect of the list that the Defence would like to tender. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but why couldn't we dispose of this matter?  You said it's not very long.  You said it's something we can do before lunch, and that would give us the lunch break for you and counsel to just assure that there's nothing that is contentious over the list.  I thought that you were ready to make your submission, and you said it was not going to take long, so we thought we might as well do it now.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I am quite ready to raise the matter.  I had told you that we wished to go into closed session if this were possible, but I'm ready to raise the problem or to raise the issue right now.  There's no problem with that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then I think we can go into closed session now.  We'll go into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 29 to 44] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, today I have received the following exhibits for Witness RJ -- 

MR. HOOPER:
Yes, just before we go to there, can I just, Mr. Issa, come back to Exhibit D. 121, which is XV's will-say of the 26th of August, '05.  Does -- you've got not just English but French as well.  Do you remember we undertook to provide a French translation?  And we've -- we've done that, just received that.  So I hope there's a copy for the Tribunal. 
MR. MJUI:
Yes, I have received -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  So can that be provided to the Tribunal, please, as well as -- as well as made an official exhibit.  Because it hasn't had a copy gone before them, I don't think.  Thank you very much. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, this is not an official translation.  Mr. Hooper approached us yesterday to ask us whether we could translate the document, to help him to do so, more correctly, and we felt -- we said that we felt that for translations to be tendered our preference was for official translations of the -- of the Tribunal.  So he must -- I've asked someone who works with him to translate the document, and that is the translation that is being tendered now.  It is not an official translation of the Tribunal.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you for that clarification.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we should tender it, but we can make a 90 -- Rule 95 order.  Couldn't the translation department be requested to translate it, Ms. Fall?  Could the translation department be requested to translate it?  And, when, it's done it could be entered into -- it could be exhibited.  But I think there should be translation on record, and we can make the order -- 
MS. FALL:
That's right (microphones overlapping). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- an official translation to be entered in due course.  

All right, Mr. Registrar, is that a satisfactory order, that -- 
MR. HOMETOWU:
That is possible, My Lord. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is my order, so is my -- 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Very satisfactory.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
It is a sufficient order?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
It is, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MS. FALL:
That's all right. 
MR. HOOPER:
So the unofficial -- the unofficial translation is D. 121B, but we ask that it be provided while -- while matters are still fresh in the memory because they're -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's (microphones overlapping) -- we'll accept it with the provision for the official translation in due course.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  And there's some other matters that I can indicate for the record.  The Gatera PV of the 
14th of April, '97, and the Gatera PV of the 11th of July, '97, had no translation provided, and there were difficulties, you may recall, that we ran into in respect of that.  And as a consequence, the only versions that are now exhibited are the Kinyarwanda and the French Prosecution versions.  Now, some part of the PVs were read in court, but it may be that we could ask, request, that the Court order a translation in English of those two PVs as well.  That's the 14th of April, '97, Gatera PV relating to XV; 11th of July, '97, Gatera document again.  Could those two be translated by the translation department into English, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose that would be helpful to one or two members of the Court.  The order is made accordingly, Mr. Registrar.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. HOOPER:
The photograph of Rekeraho was shown -- Rekeraho.  I haven't pronounced it correctly yet.  I'm sorry.  It's one of those names I've stumbled over, but we all know the one I'm talking about.  And that was shown to Witness GIO and identified by that witness as André Rwamakuba, or someone looking very like him.  This document, or that document, has the registry's mark of the 
25th of August, '05, on it.  Now, that document was then shown to Witness ALW and RJ.  I say "that document," the same photograph, but there were no marks entered on the document.  And I won't say more because I don't want to get it wrong.  And I'm waiting for Mrs. Pouplard's assistance.  So those two photographs were shown to ALW and RJ.  No marks were made upon it, but it needs to be formally exhibited in respect of both those witnesses.  So that's a photograph of Rekeraho as part of the exhibits relating to ALW and RJ. 

And, finally, it was also shown to XV, but he marked his with an "XV."  He was invited to do that.  So -- so I hope I haven't made that more complicated than it is.  It's basically the same photograph shown to four people, but each has a different and separate status.  One to XV was shown to him and marked "XV;" one to GIO was marked by the registry; the -- the photograph, in its marked registry form or not, was then shown to ALW and RJ.  And we just need to formally, then, ensure that each of the four witnesses has the Rekeraho photograph in his exhibit bundle as the photograph shown.  So it's GIO, ALW, RJ, and XV.  

And the other matter is that the photo of the person the Defence assert is the priest, Father Ngomirakiza, was shown to XV, who thought it might be Rwamakuba, you might recall, and to RJ, who didn't recognise the person.  And that needs again to be doubly exhibited for each witness so that we have a record of what that witness was shown.  

All right.  And the final matter is this:  The Defence seek now to -- as part of XV exhibits, to exhibit the statement which the Defence asserted was the statement made by XV to the Defence investigator, which is accompanied by declaration of honour by the investigator as to marks that appear on the page and an English translation, a literal translation, of all the matters that -- well, of the note exactly as it appears in the note.  So not in a -- as it were, the statement form, but in the note.  So it appears as a direct translation, and we'd wish to exhibit that as whatever the Defence exhibit number would be.  It may be out of sequence now, but it would be -- yeah. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we wish to object as regards the tendering of this document as an exhibit, or its admission as an exhibit.  This morning I mentioned a motion we raised with a problem we had as regards to the violation of the protection of our witnesses, and this statement is part of our motion -- part of the subject of our motion.  We, therefore, object to its being admitted as an exhibit.  And if you recall at the time of the hearing, Counsel Hooper constantly referred to this document.  And when we tried to object, he said it was not a statement but notes he had taken.  He repeated it several times.  You, yourselves, decided that it wasn't entered as evidence.  Subsequently, unfortunately, or on purpose, he said towards the end of his cross-examination that they weren't notes but, in fact, a statement that is in the transcript of his investigator.  

We have problems in that regard.  I told you very briefly this morning what the problem was.  You said you did not want to hear the arguments in respect of the violation.  We have, therefore, filed a motion, and all this is part of our submissions.  And we, therefore, object to the -- to this document being tendered and admitted as an exhibit.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I say that my original decision -- my original view at the time was we'd exhibit it later.  But we've discussed this, and I've been very much influenced by Mr. O'Shea's view.  And I think his view, in respect -- my respectful submission, is correct and that is it was a document that's been alluded to and it should be exhibited.  But I'm going to let Mr. O'Shea take -- assist the Chamber, if it requires that assistance, to justify its being exhibited at this stage.  

But I'd certainly feel the Chamber would be assisted by actually seeing the nature of the document.  I think that's a start in any submission, in any event, because I don't think the Chamber had the advantage of that at the time.  So can I pass up a scanned -- the scanned extract from the notebook, together with -- you'll see what I mean by the English translation of it.  It's -- it's more a statement, in statement form, than a note, I should -- I should add.  My friend's had this for a week, I think.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, it's a problem of ethics, I think, perfectly frankly.  The procedure followed by Counsel Hooper are contrary to all ethics.  He gave the document to Mr. Iain Morley just as when he was on the point of speaking it at the hearing.  They discussed it.  And when he used it during the hearing, he said it was not a statement.  Mr. Iain Morley drew the Chamber's attention to that, it was a -- a statement, they were notes, and he wouldn't be tendering them.  And then -- and towards the end he said it was a statement taken by his investigator, but at no point did he say that he was concerned to enter it as an exhibit.  

The problem that we have at the moment is that we have filed a motion with regard to violation of protection of witnesses.  That statement is part of our complaints against Mr. Hooper, who consistently violates the protection of the Prosecution witnesses (microphones overlapping). 
MR. HOOPER:
This is open session, and I strongly object to what has just been said.  I would have hoped by now that the Prosecution would understand (microphones overlapping) the ethical position we are confronted with here.  I'm sorry, Mr. President, I -- I -- I -- I'm -- I -- I -- I cannot abide these excursions into -- into this free-fisting that occasionally goes on.  I do not understand how my friend can, in fact, extract that kind of allegation from these circumstances.  And this is a public hearing.  

Now, I've said I'm deferring to Mr. O'Shea to take the argument in terms of a simple issue of whether this document should be exhibited.

1630H
MR. HOOPER (continued): 
In respect of any breach of witness protection, and I may hasten to add, there has been none here whatsoever, in respect of that, if that needs to be raised before this Chamber now, then we will raise it.  We prefer to raise it in closed session because of the personality involved, which isn't me, but somebody else who deserves and merits protection.  But at the moment, it's a straightforward issue:  Is this a document that should be properly exhibited at this stage?  We submit it is, and Mr. O'Shea has, I'm sure, bountiful arguments to that end.  
MS. FALL: 
Monsieur le président.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall.
MS. FALL: 
Monsieur le président.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, Ms. Fall, we are not a jury; we are Judges.  And our decision on this issue is not going to be influenced by emotion.  So we are going to be looking at the legal principles no matter how they are expressed, and so emotion doesn't aid the persuadability of what you are saying.  We are listening to the actual issues that are raised, and we're going to decide on that.  So getting warm is -- is -- is irrelevant to us, and we'd prefer if our proceedings were conducted with a certain degree of -- of amiable decorum.  
MS. FALL: 
Yes, but Mr. President, I should like to -- Counsel Hooper to stop interrupting when I'm raising an objection and saying that he's scandalised by our attitude because we are in open session.  Since this morning I have been asking for a closed session, in view of the sensitivity -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I thought that Counsel Hooper was entitled to raise that objection when he did.  You yourself had suggested that that matter should have been discussed in closed session, and we did discuss it, to some extent, in closed session.  Now we are in open session.  
MS. FALL:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I know, but we could have gone back into closed session if necessary, but -- but it's not a matter which we should discuss in public at this stage.  So I know sometimes in the heat of argument things slip out unexpectedly and no need to comment about it.  But it is a matter which should not be discussed in open session at this point in that kind of detail. 

But -- but we already understand -- but we have heard your objection.  I think we understand what the objection is.  We haven't exactly heard what the -- what the rebuttal argument is yet, but I think we understand your objection.  

Yes, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, this is a point of simple matter in my submission.  Would Your Honours like to see the document?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not yet.  Make your point first.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  It's a simple matter.  The other issue raised by Ms. Fall is quite a separate matter.  The legal principles involved here are quite clear in Rule 89(C), and the principles are set out by the Appeals Chamber in the case of Musema when dealing with documentary evidence.  And the basic question is this:  We have to show, on the balance of probabilities, that this document has some probative value.  That is the test.  It's not, at this stage, a question of determining the exact probative value of the document, merely that it has some probative value and some relevance.  And according to the Appeals Chamber, a chamber will not exclude evidence unless it is held to be devoid of probative value.  

This is a document which was put in front of the witness, and through Mr. Hooper's questions, probative value was adduced by virtue of the answers of the witness by agreeing to certain portions of the document.  The witness in examination-in-chief indicated that he had been seen by a person that he believed was a -- eventually a Defence investigator and that he had signed a document.  And in our respective submission, those factors put together give this document some probative value for the purposes of admission.  And the question of weight is a matter for a later stage.  The question of protective measures is a matter for the Prosecution to produce evidence.  But it has no relation to the question before Your Honours at this exact moment.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I continue to object to the procedure followed in taking that witness's statement, and I'm relying on Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and I think that no proof obtained by anything that casts substantial doubt on its reliability and would be antithetical to the integrity of the proceedings.  

Rule 95, I don't think it's necessary to go into that any further, because I did at length in closed session.  XV was always a protected witness.  Protection ordered on the 22nd of September 2000 and reconfirmed on the 16th of December 2004 in practically the same terms.  And I think the way it was tackled by the Defence and the way in which they took the statement runs contrary to the provisions of Rule 95, in which case Rule 95 should be applied.  And once more, we object to that document being admitted in evidence as an exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will -- we will consider our decision on this matter.  Hopefully we will be able to do it pretty quickly.  

There's just one question I would like to ask you, Mr. Hooper.  In your cross-examination you referred to specific parts of the document by reading them into the record and having the witness answer about those documents.  Are there any other parts of the documents that are relevant?  
MR. HOOPER: 
To be honest, I can't remember all the parts I read, and I can't exclude the possibility there are other parts that are -- are relevant. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but that's part of our question.  Because, you see, there's a level at which there is nothing to be gained or lost by the document being in evidence if you have already addressed -- if the matters which are relevant to the case have been already read into the record and the witness has answered them.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yeah.  But, of course, he's denied certain parts of it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER: 
And in order for you as the Tribunal to come to a decision later, you may be assisted by looking at the document itself, and you may come to certain conclusions from looking at the nature of the document which aren't apparent to you quite at the moment.  

May I, while I'm on my feet, just explain one matter that is quite important in terms of the issue of protection here?  Witness XV was served as a redacted statement on the Defence a long time ago.  In fact, I believe it appeared in the supporting material.  And that statement, you may bring to mind, is the statement where XV talks only of one Rwamakuba, and that's the one from Huye, the DGB driver, the sous-lieutenant in the Habyarimana government, which we, of course, appreciated wasn't and couldn't be anything to do with this Accused.  And we were surprised that that hadn't dawned on the Prosecution. 

By the time of the first trial, XV was no longer a Prosecution witness.  He'd been withdrawn and he appears on no list, nor had his unredacted statement been served.  His unredacted statement was then served, as it were, and he went back onto the list in November 2004 for this trial.  So there had been a period of about two or three years when he was on no Prosecution witness list for this trial.  And -- and the -- I'm sorry.  

Yes, I'm sorry.  So that's -- so the position is that we were served with an unredacted statement, which has the witness name on it, in November last year, 2004, and we were surprised.  We thought, why is this witness coming along again when he's talking of a Rwamakuba from Huye?  We weren't served with the additional evidence from the confirmation until three weeks ago, four weeks ago. 

Now, in the meantime, we have the first trial.  In the course of that trial, two witnesses speak freely in open session of the man they claim provided them with Rwamakuba's name at the hospital.  That was Witness RJ and -- and GIO.  There may have been another.  I think it was just two.  But they spoke at length in open session, and they named the name.  It appears about two dozen times on the transcript.  And rather interestingly and pertinently, at no time did the Prosecution get up and suggest that that was a protected witness.  And how are we to know?  But here was a man's name being uttered in court as the provider of identification for Rwamakuba. 

So, not surprisingly, we said to our investigator, "Go and get this chap quick.  Get to him before the Prosecution get to him."  And off he went.  And it's interesting that XV in his evidence talks about that photograph he was shown, which turns out to be the ID of the investigator, obviously, the UN ID.  And he provides the statement, and that statement was provided December 2003, a year before we received XV's unredacted statement with his name on it. 

So what we have here is a mountain made from a molehill and what appear to be extremely serious allegations made in the face of those facts.  

Now, the statements themself -- themselves, in my submission, bear being at least glanced at, but that's entirely a matter for Your Honours as to whether you want to see it now, because I don't want to give the impression it's just a load of jumbled notes.  It isn't that at all.  But you've reserved that decision, and I say no more about it.  But that's our position in terms of all this protection nonsense.  

And the relevant order is the order of 2003, and he's not on it.  

MS. FALL: 
Mr. President.  Mr. President, I don't think I'll take much time on this.  We have raised the motion.  As I said, this statement of XV is part and parcel of the motion we have raised, and I think that in respect of the time when XV became a witness of ours or not, we are willing to provide any and all information on that.  I would just like to add that the witness protection order provides not only for witnesses who are named, but for potential witnesses.  I think that -- that this person could have been a protected witness -- a potential witness, even a potential witness of the Prosecutor.  We are not going to extend the discussions or the argument.  We are going to provide all the information required on the matter, and you will judge for yourselves.  We sought to object because the statement made -- taken by the investigator and signed by XV is a manifest violation of the witness protection order.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, very briefly on this -- on this new point which has been raised of the definition of potential witness, the preventative measures orders have to be read with a degree of common sense.  If the Court were to interpret the expression "potential Prosecution witness" in the way in which my learned friend suggests, then the Defence would be prohibited from speaking to anybody ******************* without the Prosecution's permission.  So it's a nonsensical interpretation.  A potential Prosecution witness is one that's on the list or is -- or is otherwise, obviously, against the Defence.  At the time that this witness was sought out, it was potentially a Defence witness.  We weren't to know.  

And furthermore, the Court needs to be careful here because there are three protective orders.  There's one of 2000 in the case of Rwamakuba, there's one of 2003, and then there's one of Your Honours' of 2004.  And the relevant decision in this particular instance is the one of 2003.  That's the one which was applicable at the time this investigator went to see this person.  And if Your Honours read that decision, you will see that there is a degree of ambiguity over this issue of the obligations of the Defence with regard to what is phrased as potential witnesses in the sense that the Court, in an attempt to harmonise with the Nzirorera position, says that as a matter of general principle, the Defence should approach the Prosecution before contacting potential Prosecution witnesses, which is a different phraseology than the order which this Your Honours made or that in 2000.  And I think it's important that that's pointed out.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, logically -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We want to stop the argument now.  We can't have back and forth on these matters.  We have heard both sides enough, and we will -- we will consider and give our decision on the matter.  Thank you. 

Are the exhibits completed, apart from that?  

Mr. Registrar?  Have we completed the exhibit list?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I think there's still RJ to go. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we deal with that now, please, Mr. Registrar.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And -- and there's the -- I've been handed a very -- it's obviously a useful list relating to photos, but I'm afraid I don't understand it.  Can you give me one moment, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, you have the RJ exhibits?  It's quarter to five.  We want to complete our sitting now.  
MR. MJUI: 
(Inaudible)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have it?  
MR. MJUI: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please read it into the record.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. Issa, can I just help you with just a very quick, I hope helpful, suggestion from Mrs. Pouplard, which deals with the difficulty of the photographs. 

The photo exhibits can be dealt with simply by having the Defence exhibit number, whichever that is, Mr. Issa.  Which is the next number, please?  
MR. MJUI: 
The next number will be D. 132. 
MR. HOOPER: 
And it will be, we suggest, D. 132GIO, G. 132RJ (sic), G. 132ALW (sic), and D. 132XV.  And each of those exhibits is the same photograph of Rekeraho.  

And for the priest, it would be 133XV, 133RJ.  And that would again be the same photograph for -- covering those two presentations.  I hope that helps.  I can help you a bit later with that, Mr. Issa, if there's a problem.  
MR. MJUI: 
Your Honour, the list I have, it's not going the way it has been read by Mr. Hooper.  I'll read as it is, then we will see how it will go. 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Mr. Issa be allowed to sit down, Mr. President, for clarity of the sound delivery?  
MR. MJUI: 
Witness exhibit for RJ is as follows:  D. 132A and B, statement of Witness RJ of September 11, 1997, French and English, to be kept under seal.  Exhibit D. 133A and B, statement of Witness RJ of April 22nd, 1999, to be kept under seal, English and French.

Exhibit D. 138A, B, and C, PV of Witness RJ in Twagirayezu case of ***********, 1999, to be kept under seal, Kinyarwanda, French, and English.  Exhibit D. 139, PV of Witness RJ in Kageruka case of June 11, 1998, A, B, and C, Kinyarwanda, English and French, to be kept under seal.  Exhibit D. 140, excerpt of African Rights report of -- on Muvunyi case, English, referring to RJ's interview, to be kept under seal.  Exhibit D. 140 (sic) A and B, judgement in Twagirayezu case of June 14th, 2001, Kinyarwanda and English translation.  I think also this one is supposed to be kept under seal.  Exhibit D. 142, photo of Rekeraho shown to Witness RJ.  
Exhibit D. 143, photo of man with glasses, priest, shown to Witness RJ, Ngomirakiza.  Exhibit D. 144, tick list, Witness RJ, unmarked, to be kept under seal.  Exhibit D. 145, PV of Witness RJ in Misago case of 21st April 1999, to be kept under seal, Kinyarwanda, French, and English.  Exhibit D. 146, CD-ROM of transcript of RJ's testimony on the previous trial, December 2003.  Exhibit D. 147, photo of Rekeraho shown to Witness GIO.  Exhibit D. 148, photo of Rekeraho shown to Witness XV.  
Exhibit D. 149, photo of Rekeraho shown to Witness ALW.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

MS. FALL: 
Mr. President. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry, we're missing one exhibit, and that is the priest's visit -- priest's photograph shown to XV.  

So, Mr. Issa, if you could make that 150, photograph of alleged priest shown to XV.  

And that will complete it.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. 150 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  We did not discuss this list as we did for XV.  I do not have any problems.  There is only the matter of the translation of some documents and the list information regarding trials in Rwanda.  I think the translation that was made is not official, and so I would submit that a translation be requested through official channels.  I think that if, Mr. President, you can give the -- make the same order, we shouldn't have any particular problem with that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could I just say ordered accordingly?  Would that be clear enough?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
That is clear, except I would wish that the Prosecution counsel give us more information regarding the particular exhibit that she is referring to.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.  Thank you. 

Well, does that need to be done now in open court, or can it be done -- 

MR. HOMETOWU:
That will be fine with us, if it is done now in open court for record purposes.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, yes?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I was trying to make a suggestion, but the registrar seems to have vetoed me, and he has requested that you put your request on record (inaudible).  
MS. FALL: 
There are two documents that are of concern to me.  This is the document concerning the Misago (unintelligible) that is testifying against the priest.  Second document is the translation of the testimony given in Rwanda in respect of Ngagetura (sic). 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.  
MS. FALL: 
These are not official translations. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

(Microphone not activated)...the last exhibit. 
MR. MJUI: 
Your Honours, the last exhibit is D. 150, photograph of man with glasses, in brackets priest, shown to Witness XV, I think.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you. 

Well, for the record, I just should add all of these exhibits are formally admitted as stated by the registrar.  

Well, I think that completes our session for today, and we'll resume at 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.
