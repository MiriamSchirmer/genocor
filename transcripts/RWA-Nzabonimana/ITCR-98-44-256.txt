P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings?  
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, the 21st of April, 2006, for the oral-closing arguments in the matter of the Prosecutor v. André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have appearances, please, starting with the Prosecution?  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

The Prosecution is represented by Mr. Don Webster, Madam Alayne Frankson Wellars, Mr. Adama Niane, Mr. Massamba Ndiaye, and myself, Dior Fall. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall.  

And Defence, please?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, for André Rwamakuba, David Hooper, Andreas O'Shea and Celestin Buhuru.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We welcome you all to the closing arguments phase of this trial.  We had been led to believe by electronic communication that the Accused may be appearing today.  I don't seem to notice him.  
MR. HOOPER:
We saw him.  He said he'll come to Court as and when he receives an apology from the Prosecution.  His view, otherwise, has been, I'm afraid, very much the position that he's had up until today.  So I don't think I need repeat those matters yet again to you, Mr. President.  I know you know them well, but thank you for asking about his voluntary absence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the explanation, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, can I just briefly mention one thing, and that is that a few weeks ago, we learnt very sad news of the death of Gregory Lombardi.  He was, at one time in an earlier part of the process of this case, a member of the Prosecution team.  And they must have been very affected, I know, by his loss.  

We recall him very fondly as a friend, a good lawyer, and a very nice man indeed.  And we know that his very early death in life is a great tragedy to everyone that knew him.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Hooper, we thank you very much for making those remarks and the Chamber echoes those sentiments.  

As we are about to begin, we have lost a bit of time -- starting time and I would just like to confirm the time standards that you both would take.  We got the impression that you thought you could complete within one and a half hours each or a little bit more.  Do we act -- do we continue to act on that premise?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, for our part, the Defence, we hope to conclude within that time.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, we will try to work in accordance with that time slot.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think that, without any more ado, we can get started now as we would like to complete before night falls upon us.  

Madam Prosecutor.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I hope, and I have said so, that I will not take too much of your time because you have been following the proceedings in the case of the Prosecutor and André Rwamakuba.  You have followed with -- you have followed very attentively the testimonies of the 16 witnesses called by the Prosecutor, and you have also heard the testimonies of the 30 -- the 30 Defence witnesses.  

The indictment containing the charges against the witness -- the Accused, were disclosed to you on the 9th of June 2005.  You have in your possession all the exhibits tendered by the Prosecution and the Defence; the statements of witnesses; the transcripts of proceedings and decisions you have rendered in these proceedings, as well as the closing arguments of the Prosecutor and the Defence, which were filed on the 18th of April 2005.  

My objective, therefore, in reference to my closing arguments, is to bring out the essential arguments in fact and in law developed in this document and which prove beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of André Rwamakuba with regard to the charges 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the indictment.  

Mr. President, Madam, Your Honours, during the Prosecutor's trial brief which were emphasised -- which emphasised the difficult role that you have to play in accordance with Security Council Resolution 955 of the United Nations, you have to make sure that the authors of the heinous crimes committed in Rwanda in April to July 1994 are punished and that the victims will rest in peace.  Since this is required by justice and justice has to be rendered, it is your duty to contribute to national reconciliation and peace in Rwanda.  

I shouldn't dwell on the odious crimes perpetrated against the Tutsi population and moderate Hutus who were -- and the moderate Hutus who were against the extermination policy.  It is difficult to understand, even less to justify, these crimes that throughout the Rwandan territory caused the death of millions -- of thousands of Tutsis and the spoilation of their assets.  These were committed by people without scruple, without remorse, who were acting from a position of authority and who knowledgeably orchestrated all those massacres, amongst whom was the Accused, André Rwamakuba.  

The Prosecutor, in line with the objective of international justice, feels that it has established beyond all reasonable doubt the guilt of André Rwamakuba for the crimes of which he's accused.  

In the indictment of the 9th of June 2005, we did inform the Accused sufficiently of what he is accused, succinctly, in the introduction of our preliminary brief, in paragraphs 1 and 2, recalled what the charges were and the nature of the individual responsibility of which he is accused.  

Before going into the presentation of the evidence, Mr. President, Your Honours, I should like to point out certain facts which are incontrovertible.  Facts that we all admit:  That there were massacres, massacres of thousands of Tutsi civilian refugees.  These admitted facts are presented in paragraph 5 of the preliminary brief -- in paragraph 5.  

And, also, they concern the identification of the Accused at some of these events which took place in 1993 and 1994, and of which judicial notice has been taken as a result of the decision of 3rd of December 2000 in the Prosecutor v. Semanza.  In the light of that admission, I will speak of the specifically reprehensible behaviour of the Accused in the case of each massacre.  And for that, we recommend that the Judges declare him guilty for those charges.  

In the indictment he's accused of killing members of the Tutsi population, serious -- and having seriously threatened their physical integrity, has deliberately submitted the population to difficult conditions of life, leading to their physical destruction with the intention of destroying, in whole or in part, the racial or ethnic group known as Tutsi.  

In regard -- having caused grievous bodily harm to the Tutsi population, and physical harm, and intentionally submitted people to conditions intended to destroy them as a group, ethnic group, he is responsible having killed - or, having people killed or killing people, in the context of a generalised and systematic attack against the civilian population because of its political, ethnic or racial group.  

By his acts or omissions, André Rwamakuba is responsible, having -- for the murder of a number of people and having planned, incited, committed, ordered, or in any other manner aided and abetted in the planning, preparation and execution of those crimes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, that's an example of how far behind the English translator is.  Maybe you could just moderate your pace so you can make it easier for the translator to follow you.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  We'll have to allow more time, therefore, to the time I have been allowed.  I shall go more slowly so as not to lose more time, therefore.  

So I was saying, Mr. President, that he was responsible for having killed -- for having killed or having ordered to be killed members of the Tutsi population in the context of a systematic or generalised attack against that civilian group by his acts or omissions.  He is responsible for having killed several people inasmuch as he planned, incited, or in any other way aided and abetted in the planning or execution of those crimes.  All these accusations against the Accused were committed in Gikomero commune and in Butare University Hospital.  

The Prosecutor introduced a summary of the facts in chapter 1 of the preliminary brief, paragraph 6, with all the details, his professional life and the positions he occupied.  That is not in argument, but his membership of the MDR Power wing is in dispute.  With the footnotes that are in the preliminary brief, on the basis of the statements of Witnesses GIT, GLM, Nkezebera, Jean-Marie, a Defence witness, and the expert witness, Alison Des Forges, have established that following the extraordinary congress of the MDR held in Kabusunzu on the 23rd and 24th of July 1993, the party divided into two.  One wing under Faustin Twagiramungu was moderate, supported the Arusha Accords and democratisation.  The second wing, known as MDR Power, was in favour of the unity of all Hutus in order to establish Hutu Power.  

The Prosecutor, on the basis of the testimony and especially the expert witness -- and that is also in detail in our final arguments -- Rwamakuba, after that schism, joined the hard-line wing of the MDR opposed to the Arusha Accords, which faction incited hatred, violence against the Tutsi population, and it was established at the time of the presentation of the Prosecution evidence that the MDR Power faction played a determinant role in the events of April to July 1994.  

The Defence brought no evidence against that proposition but, rather, cast a doubt on the existence of the Power wing if -- doesn't stand up if you refer to Froduald -- Froduald Karamira at the meeting in Nyamirambo on the 23rd of October 1993.  

Rwamakuba participated in recruiting members of the Power wing and took part in the -- attended and took part in the Power faction meetings, which is found in paragraphs 34 to 48.  These meetings were organised by the Accused at Ndatemwa, particular -- that's in Gikomero commune, particularly at André Muhire's residence.  There were also meetings held at Sha, Shango, Kayanga, and Nduba.  

The Prosecution maintains that in view of those meetings and all the evidence in the Prosecution theory, the Accused incited the population to exterminate the Tutsi population, saying loud and clear it was time to get rid of the -- for the Hutu to get rid of the enemy.  In that context, as we have established in the previous paragraphs, the enemy in question was, of course, the Tutsi.  

Nor was it in dispute that the Accused was a minister of primary and secondary education in the interim government established on the 8th of April 1994.  The Defence tried to suggest that that appointment was against the will of the Accused.  The Prosecutor, in paragraphs 11 to 19, has established that the Accused was sworn in on the 9th of April 1994, that the MDR Power wing had four people in the government, and the names are given, and -- as André Rwamakuba, minister of primary and secondary education, Eliezer Niyitegeka, minister of information, Jérôme Bicamumpaka, minister of foreign affairs, and Jean Kampanda, who was prime minister.  Those four ministers belonged to MDR Power wing.  

It was established in the stated paragraphs that the policy of the government was to struggle against and defeat the Inkotanyi and their accomplices, which might be a bit bizarre for a government that is supposed to be democratic and of national unity.  All of the members of the government were Hutu.  And it clearly emerges from the information given in the paragraphs cited that André Rwamakuba participated in the preparation, elaboration, propagation and legitimisation of the policies of the government.  

He exerted -- he exerted influence on local authorities.  Furthermore, his capacity as leader of the MDR Power gave him authority and influence over local and regional heads of the local and civil programme, particularly over Interahamwe and militias related to Gikomero, its commune of origin -- his commune of origin, as well as those persons at Butare University Hospital.  

The Defence led no concrete evidence proving that the Accused disassociated himself from the policy of the interim government.  He never resigned, and maintained his post as minister, up until the government fled, as the RPF took the country in July 1994.  

During the period when he exercised his functions, André Rwamakuba carried out no actions to prevent the atrocities committed in Rwanda or to condemn them publicly.  He, instead, participated in this extermination programme, the programme to exterminate the Tutsi, put in place by the interim government, and contributed actively to the promotion and encouragement of the policy of genocide.  He was implied (sic) throughout the period referred to in the indictment in the commission of the offences committed in Gikomero commune and at the Butare University Hospital.  

In paragraph 20 of the closing arguments, the Prosecutor, before elaborating on the nature of the offences committed in Gikomero commune by André Rwamakuba, described the resources used by the Accused for the commission of these crimes with which he is charged.  This consists in the organisation of public rallies and the utterance of -- violent utterances, inciting people to violence and ethnic hatred and the distribution of weapons and as well as the organisation of widespread and systematic attacks directed against the Tutsi population.  

Paragraphs 21 to 30 of the closing argument describes the facts that occurred in Gikomero commune between the 9th and the 15th of April 1994.  The evidence focussed generally on those targeted, that is, the people of Gikomero commune, many refugees, most of whom were Tutsis.  They also targeted places of refuge, the number of victims.  It also focussed on the fact that the attacks were systematic and widespread throughout Gikomero commune.  And these attacks targeted mainly the Tutsi ethnic group.  Such evidence also focussed on the description and the origins of the assailants, some of whom came from Gikomero.  Many of them were Interahamwe soldiers, communal police officers, and civilians.  

The nature of the weapons in their possession was described.  These were guns, clubs, spears.  Prosecution witnesses were able to identify perpetrators of the attacks, and the evidence showed that many of the people who led the attacks accompanied André Rwamakuba.  Their names were clearly mentioned in the closing arguments.  Some of those people were Mathias Rubanguka; Pascal Ndengejeho; Joas Habimana; Ndamage; Etienne Kamanzi; the bourgmestre of the commune Rutaganira; Ngarambe; and Kayibanda.  Defence witnesses also confirmed in their statements that the persons mentioned by Prosecution witnesses were, indeed, responsible for the crimes committed against the Tutsi population.  

The Prosecutor also led evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that André Rwamakuba participated in acts committed in Gikomero commune; particularly, in the Ndatemwa centre at the Kurapanga centre and the Kayanga health centre.  

It was established that as of the time when the MDR split into two factions the Accused made sure -- that was the end of 1993, and in early 1994, he participated in meetings aimed, on the one hand, at recruiting members of the MDR Power wing and, on the other hand, to incite members of the Gikomero commune to combat the Tutsis.  

Evidence concerning meetings organised to recruit members of MDR Power is contained in paragraphs 34 to 36.  Prosecution witnesses ALA and GIQ saw the Accused -- during those rallies held in Kayanga on board a vehicle equipped with a loud speaker -- speak to members of the population, stating that it was time for the Hutus to get rid of the enemy.  And he broadcast songs in honour of 
MDR-Parmehutu.  

Witness GII, on or about the 4th and the 5th of April 1994, saw the Accused at Ndatemwa centre going to André Muhire's home, to attend a meeting organised with officials of MDR Power of the commune.  
Witness GII and Witness AVC were informed by participants at that meeting that, following the instructions of the Accused, the Tutsis were going to be killed.  All this information is in the closing arguments and all exhibits referring to them contained therein.  

André Rwamakuba organised between the months of August 1994 and March 1994, meetings in Shango, Nduba and Kayanga with a view to inciting the Hutu population.  Paragraphs 37 to 48 of the closing briefs have provided evidence to the effect that André Rwamakuba, during those meetings, incited members of the population to exterminate the Tutsi.  

Witnesses GLM and GIT stated that they saw the Accused going to attend meetings in Sha, Nduba, Shango and Kayanga.  They were able to know the nature of the statements made by the Accused during those meetings through participants at those meetings.  Such statements consisted -- consisted in providing information on the ideals and programme of MDR Power.  And they exhorted the Hutus to unite in order to exterminate the Tutsis.  

Such statements incited people to eliminate the Tutsis who were considered as the enemy and the cause of problems in Rwanda.  He stated, and I quote, "The militants of MDR and Hutu, in general, our enemy, is the Tutsi, who collaborate with the Inkotanyi."  

This utterance made by the Accused during the meeting in Kayanga and reported by Witness GAB demonstrate the ideology of MDR espoused by André Rwamakuba.  Information provided by GAB, concerning the meeting or the rally in Kayanga, was confirmed by Witness GAC.  

It is obvious that such a sensitisation campaign was aimed as setting the stage for the fight that had to be waged -- for the war that had to be waged against the Tutsi population and in which André Rwamakuba was involved.  

After that sensitisation campaign, André Rwamakuba, in his commune of origin in Gikomero -- and, in anticipation of the extermination of the Tutsis and to foster the execution of such a programme -- proceeded to distribute weapons that had to be used to kill Tutsis, providing them with the assistance and aiding and abetting the perpetrators of such massacres.  

The evidence contained in paragraphs 54 to -- paragraphs 50 to 54 establish that between the 10th and the 11th of April 1994, André Rwamakuba distributed machetes at Ndatemwa centre and in Kayanga secteur.  Such acts of the Accused were, by and large, proved by Witnesses GII and AVD.  They saw the Accused during the period in question placing weapons, in the home of André Muhire, in bags containing machetes, and holding a meeting with the officials of MDR Power with a view to planning the killings of Tutsis residing in the commune.  Following such meetings, the assailants started massacres of the Tutsi population, and the Witness AVC confirmed the statements in -- the statements of Witnesses GII and AVD.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have lost the interpreter.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry, we will repeat that last sentence:  Witness AVC confirmed the contents of the testimony of Witnesses GII and AVD.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MS. FALL:
Witness GAC saw the Accused during that same period delivering machetes to the house of Etienne Kamanzi, who was a nurse at Kayanga health centre.  He was present when six machetes were handed over in the presence of the Accused to Anatalie Mukarulinda, who asserted she had six Abakiga at her house, who were prepared to go to work.  

No one here is ignorant of the word "work" in the context of the events of April 1994.  Those machetes issued to the Interahamwe were used in the massacres that took place in the commune.  All these acts summarised here were fully described in the precedingly quoted paragraphs of the closing arguments.  

The Prosecutor asserts that in light of the evidence in paragraphs 55 to 66, is accused of having planned the massacres of the Tutsi; incited their perpetration, aided and assisted the perpetrators of those crimes.  The Accused ordered murders of the Tutsi population at Gikomero sectoral office and at Kayanga health centre.  

Witness GIN, between the 10th and the 14th of April 1994, saw the Accused coming -- with the officials of the commune, local policemen and her husband -- to Kurapanga centre, which is not far from her home and of the Gikomero sectoral office.  Information is provided in the closing arguments; the house of the witness has been precisely situated, and all the evidence supporting what I have said is given in detail.  

"At a place very near mine", she saw Rwamakuba incite members of the population to seek out and kill the Tutsi.  She saw him checking the ID cards of two unknown young men, but identified as Tutsi, tear up the documents they'd shown and had them taken away and killed in a small wood near where she was.  

She heard him state, shortly after that incident where a motorbike rider had been brought to a stop by the crowd, that only -- that no Tutsi should escape.  And he -- that motorcyclist suffered the same fate as the other two people previously mentioned and was taken away to a small wood to be killed.  

All these crimes were committed with the full knowledge of André Rwamakuba; the Prosecution evidence is very clear.  Rwamakuba, after those murders, congratulated the population for having begun the massacres, encouraging them thereby to carry on with those massacres.  The Prosecution evidence of those precise facts are detailed, in particular, in paragraphs 56 and 57.  

Witness GIN also provided reliable evidence as to the events that occurred at Kayanga health centre.  She saw the Accused a few days after the murder of the three young people go to Kurapanga centre and heading off towards Kayanga.  The witness mentioned that as soon -- that immediately after the departure of the Accused, vehicles arrived to carry Interahamwe and members of the population, armed with rifles and grenades, and all set off in the direction of Kayanga health centre just as André Rwamakuba had done a short time before.  

Witness GIN was informed on the return of her husband of the massacre of Tutsi perpetrated at Kayanga health centre under the orders and in the presence of André Rwamakuba.  Paragraphs 58 to 60 provide all the evidence confirming the information provided by GIN, corroborated by Witness GAB, ****************************************************************.  The evidence adduced establishes André Rwamakuba's responsibility in the massacre at Kayanga in paragraphs 64 to 66 of the Prosecution's final arguments.  

Witness GAB, who had sought refuge at the health centre when the killing began in that secteur, confirmed the information received by GIN as to the presence of Rwamakuba at Kayanga.  And with all the names provided, I won't quote them all, but Bourgmestre Rutaganira; Bourgmestre Rutaganira, and the notorious Nyarwaya, as well as soldiers and Interahamwe.  

Witness GAB, from her or his hiding place, could see Rwamakuba waving a pistol to start the killing, a signal to start the killing.  After that signal and in his presence, the killing began.  The soldiers and the Interahamwe attacked and killed, with machetes, clubs and firearms, the patients and the refugees present there, in the majority, Tutsi.  They also stated -- the Accused also stated, "These people must be killed so that in future a Hutu who is born would ask what a Tutsi looks like."  The killing stopped when everyone was dead.  And the evidence is approximately a hundred people were thus massacred.  

In paragraph 66 it is shown that the massacre at Kayanga health centre was mentioned by other witnesses, who, without being eyewitnesses, received corroborating evidence as to the murder of the victims.  

Witness ALA mentioned the attack on the centre, and apart from that Nyarwaya and Rutaganira, the presence of Mathias Rubanguka as being responsible for those massacres.  He also stated that there was about a hundred victims resulting from those massacres -- confirmed that there was about a hundred victims -- this witness, ALA, confirmed there were about a hundred victims and that they were Tutsi.  

In paragraph 67 of the Prosecution's closing brief, it is said that even if it's difficult to put an exact figure on it, that there were hundreds of thousands of victims in Gikomero -- in the Gikomero massacres for which Rwamakuba's responsibility cannot be ignored.  His help and assistance in providing weapons, his encouragement, his presence on the spot, all those acts and omissions, without a shadow of a doubt, facilitated in Gikomero commune the Tutsi extermination programme.  

André Rwamakuba was also guilty of crimes at Butare University Hospital during that time.  Having followed the interim government to Murambi, he regularly went to the hospital to plan, aid, abet, order, commit, assist in committing the massacre of Tutsi patients at that place.  

Paragraph 69 to 75 of the Prosecution closing brief establish the general context in which the massacres were committed in Butare préfecture, stressing that the Tutsi population -- members of the Tutsi population, men, women, children, fled to the hospital, seeking refuge from the killing and looting.  It is also established that the large number of refugees at the hospital -- it has been established there was a large number of refugees at the hospital.  There were regular attacks against them and the hospital patients.  The assailants have been described, armed with firearms, machetes and clubs, bludgeons.  The names of the doctors, the nurses, the soldiers and Interahamwe who regularly accompanied André Rwamakuba in committing those crimes, all that evidence is presented in the Prosecutor's closing argument -- closing brief.  

Paragraphs 79 to 81 established that Rwamakuba, apart from his direct population (sic) in those attacks was personally implicated in the planning of those attacks at the hospital, the preparation of which included distribution of machetes to hospital staff, organisation of reinforcements, leading the assailants in perpetrating the attacks, the selection of Tutsi patients by means of previously established lists to have them taken away and killed by the Interahamwe.  

The Prosecution maintains that the Accused, having studied at Butare university and having done his internship at the hospital, was therefore in a milieu that he knew well.  

The Prosecution's evidence, in paragraphs 82 to 95, including the footnotes, establishes beyond all reasonable doubt the responsibility of the Accused in -- for the events that occurred at Butare University Hospital.  

Witnesses ALV, GIO, HF, RJ, XV and ALW were all eyewitnesses of the acts committed by the Accused, who ordered that Tutsi patients be not treated and withdrew or ordered that their drips be withdrawn.  The patients and Tutsi refugees were, on his orders and following on the Accused checking of the ID cards, selected and taken away to be killed.  André Rwamakuba personally struck and killed, with a hatchet, patients and Tutsi refugees, hence participating in the killing of members of the Tutsi ethnic group who were present there.  

All the references necessary are provided in the Prosecution's closing brief -- closing arguments.  

These acts occurred between the end of May and beginning of June 1994, at the place where the Médecins sans frontières had set up tents in the surgical ward, the paediatric ward, the intensive care ward and the maternity ward.  

It should be noted that all these acts committed against the patients and Tutsi refugees -- Tutsi patients and refugees were confirmed by the Defence witnesses who -- and we'll come back do that -- do not mention the presence of André Rwamakuba.  

The Defence -- the Prosecution witnesses that I have mentioned heard what the Accused said and leave no room for doubt as to his criminal intentions.  And what he said is fully quoted in the Prosecution's closing brief.  I shall mention some of them: "Look at the world for the last time."  "What are these refugees doing here?"  "They are Tutsi; they must be killed.  We don't want to see them here any more."  "No Tutsi must survive."  And, "Snakes have no place to hide."  He'd also say, "Take off that -- take away that rubbish over there."  These are eloquent words and show the Accused's firm determination to eradicate the Tutsi ethnic group.  

The evidence provided in paragraphs -- in paragraph 96 establishes, in spite of the difficulty to give -- put an exact figure on the number of victims at Butare University Hospital, that hundreds of people were massacred there.  These massacres -- those figures were not contested by the Defence witnesses.  

Regarding the events at Butare University Hospital, the Prosecution sees that they are repeated by both Prosecution and Defence witnesses, reiterated by both Prosecution and Defence witnesses.  The doctors were mentioned on several occasions because of their participation in the genocide, both by Prosecution and Defence witnesses, as being Dr. Gatera -- Drs. Gatera, Sostène, Munyemana and Dr. Jotham.  

The testimony of the witnesses also mentions the presence of soldiers accompanying the doctors.  And all witnesses mention the existence of lists that had already -- that had previously been established of the victims, and explained how it was possible, on the basis of those lists, to select the Tutsi patients and take them away -- Tutsi patients and refugees.  

Also frequently mentioned is the fact that the Médecins sans frontières' tents that had been put up at the hospital were torn down -- were torn down.  

The differences to be pointed out between the Defence and Prosecution witnesses are due to the fact that they weren't always -- the witnesses were always at the same time or in the same place and could not, therefore, see the same situations.  And most of the Prosecution witnesses -- and we'll come back to that -- were not -- were -- didn't know -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could -- could counsel please repeat that sentence because it wasn't clear if we were referring to Defence witnesses or Prosecution witnesses, for the sake of clarity?  

Sorry, Mr. Webster, can you ask her to repeat that?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Ms. Fall, the interpreter has requested that you -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Mr. President, sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreter has requested that you backtrack a bit because he missed the last couple of sentences.  Ms. Fall, you should take note of the fact that he asked Mr. Webster to ask you to slow down.  
MS. FALL:
I will repeat the -- I'm sorry, I thought I was speaking slowly.  

The result is that most of the Defence witnesses could not establish the presence of Rwamakuba at that place because they did not know him before.  Some say they never saw him.  They did not have the benefit of information concerning the Accused's identity which was, from time to time, contrary to the situation of the Prosecution witnesses, who certainly didn't know him, but were informed as to his identity and even what his official functions were.  

The Prosecution evidence concerning the crimes committed in Gikomero commune and at university -- Butare University Hospital, and refuted by the Defence in the strategy that I will now analyse:  The first argument is alibi.  The first Defence argument is alibi, and it should be pointed out that in claiming an alibi defence, the Accused not only claims that he didn't commit the crimes of which he's accused, but he also asserts that he was -- at the time the crimes were committed, that he was in another place than where the crimes were committed.  

The alibi or alibis proposed by the Accused do not at all make it -- establish such an assertion.  It does not raise any reasonable doubt as to the Accused's participation in the commission of the crimes of which he's accused.  Moreover, the alibi defence does not establish a specific burden of proof.  The Prosecutor must establish beyond all reasonable doubt that the Accused was present and he committed the crimes of which he's accused.  

The first alibi given by the Defence witnesses is that he was not present at the meetings where violence was incited against Tutsi that he committed in Gikomero at the end of '93 and the beginning of '94.  That alibi tries to establish that André Rwamakuba was undergoing training at the tropical medicine -- Antwerp Tropical Medicine Institute from the 23rd of September 1993 to the 27th of March 1994.  To do that, the Defence brought four witnesses:  Pierre Mercenier and André Van Balen, professors at the Antwerp Tropical Medicine Institute, Edith Van Wynesberghe, a close family friend, and Francis Monet, who worked at the Kigali regional health department, where he worked with the Accused.  
The Prosecutor submits that the evidence provided in paragraphs 104 -- 119 of the closing briefs shows without any doubt that all the alibi witnesses do not confirm what the Accused has said, and his assertion that throughout the period from the 23rd of September 1993 and the 27th of March 1994, he was indeed in Belgium.  

The evidence led by the Prosecution, and which is provided in detail in the closing briefs, indicates that regarding the statements of witness Pierre Mercenier and witness Van Balen contain numerous contradictions and inconsistencies.  They accepted with regard to the duration of the training programme and the dates of departure of the Accused from Belgium.  These alibi witnesses were not able to establish that André Rwamakuba participated in courses as well as colloquiums offered for trainee doctors in December 1993.  Witness Van Balen acknowledged that the dates relating to the duration of the training and which are contained on the attestation are not accurate, which attestations he himself delivered, or issued.  

The Prosecutor submits that the testimony of Edith Van Wynesberghe, in light of the evidence in the closing arguments, is tainted with partiality, given the intimate relations between him (sic) and the Accused.  She tried to give dates based on documents in her possession.  These documents dealt with significant purchases made by André Rwamakuba.  It is important to note here inconsistencies between the witness's and Van Balen -- this witness's testimony and Van Balen's testimony that the Accused did not have the means to engage in such luxuries.  

The Prosecutor, in paragraphs 116 up to 117, demonstrated that the attempts by the witness to raise the alibi defence for André Rwamakuba did not cover the entire period referred to.  There are, indeed, very lengthy periods during which she did not see André Rwamakuba.  She is, therefore, not in a position to assert that the Accused, throughout the period concerned by the alibi, was in Belgium and that he never left Belgium during that period, or that he never returned to Rwanda during that period.  

The analysis of witness Francis Monet, in paragraphs 113 to 115, raises very significant points.  He indicates that the Accused left Rwanda on the 23rd of September 1993 to go to Belgium and that he returned on the 10th of March 1994 to Kigali, to leave again a week later, that is, on the 17th of March, to return on the 29th of March.  He contents himself with saying that he never heard that the Accused returned to Rwanda during the period from the 23rd of September 1993 and the 10th of March 1994.  

Witness Francis Monet, nevertheless, admitted that his relations with the Accused were purely professional and that putting aside - or, outside of his work relations, he could not know what the Accused did.  He even stated that he was not aware that the Accused had recently been a member of MDR Power.  
The evidence led by the Prosecution highlighted the fact that from the 4th of April 1994 -- that regarding the date of the 4th of April 1994, which is important in the Prosecutor's case, given the acts that he's alleged to have committed at the Ndatemwa centre regarding that date, whereas witness Mercenier requested that reference be made to the statement of witness Francis Monet to the effect -- that is, to know whether André Rwamakuba was indeed present or not at the airport when he arrived in Kigali,  witness Francis Monet was not able to say whether or not the Accused was present at the airport.  

In light of the Prosecution's evidence contained in the closing arguments, the contradictions between Professor Monet and Professor Mercenier are obvious.  Regarding the date of the 5th of January 1994, Francis Monet claimed that he had met with the Accused in the morning.  However, there is no mention of Rwamakuba's name on his diary, and yet he claimed that he noted everything in the said diary.  

The Prosecutor submits that the evidence adduced both by eyewitnesses GII, GIT, GLM and GAC shows that the Accused was present at the time and in the places where the crimes were committed.  They also show that he participated in committing the said offences.  Regarding this first batch of alibi witnesses, the Defence did not lead any evidence likely to refute the arguments of the Prosecutor.  

The alibi notice tendered by the Defence on the 13th of September 2005 deals with the period from the 20th of April to 3rd of May 1994, a period during which, according to the allegations of the Defence, the Accused was in Gisenyi with his family.  To corroborate their arguments, the Defence called witnesses 9.1, 1.1, 3A and 1.15, all close relatives and friends of the Accused.  These testimonies, if at all, they support the claim that André Rwamakuba was in Gisenyi, would nevertheless not clear him of the charges brought against him with regard to the offences committed at Butare University Hospital.  

The Prosecutor, in paragraphs 121 to 144 of his closing arguments, highlighted significant inconsistencies in the said testimonies regarding the duration of Rwamakuba's stay in Gisenyi.  And his so-called determination to resign from his duties as minister in the interim government, his willingness to leave Rwanda with members of his family, or the visits -- the very rare visits in the homes of his parents.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I'm sorry to do this to you, but we need to have a short break.  
MS. FALL:
(No interpretation) 
(Court recessed from 1553H to 1608H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall, I'm sorry for the interruption, but I gather that it provided an opportunity for a few technical problems to be resolved.  You may continue.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, regarding the alibi concerning Gisenyi and analysis of the evidence, I said that if it is admitted that André Rwamakuba was in Gisenyi towards the end of April 1994 up to early May 1994, the fact remains that it was established that on the 25th, 26th, 27th, 29th and 30th of April, he went to Gitarama every morning between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. to carry out his duties as minister and returned late at night.  

The witnesses accepted the fact that they were unable to know what the Accused did during the period when he was in Butare préfecture.  The Defence called witnesses who were not permanently at the Butare University Hospital, to try to establish that during that period Rwamakuba was not there.  On the other hand, the Defence suggested that the distances between Gisenyi, Gitarama and Butare were very long and that it was very difficult to get there.  
(Pages 1 to 16 by Karen Holm)



















1610H
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I believe those distances were assessed, and it should be pointed out in light of the evidence we have adduced, that the proposition that it was difficult to cover those distances, that that proposition could apply to an ordinary person and not to a minister who enjoyed the services of a driver and an escort.  All the details and the various aspects have been developed in the closing arguments.

Apart from the evidence that has been mentioned, the Prosecutor submits that all those statements made by close relatives of the Accused are tainted with partiality.  In fact, it would have been very surprising if Witness 1.1, who is very close to the Accused, were to come before the Tribunal to confirm the responsibility of the Accused in the crimes he is charged with.

The same is true of Witness 3A, which the Prosecutor did not want to cross-examine because at the time that witness was only aged 11, and it is obvious that that witness would do everything to help the Accused be released from prison.  As for Witness 1.15, who was assisted by the Accused when he had to leave Rwanda, it would be inconceivable that this witness would give evidence against the Accused.  Regarding Witness 9.1, who is still the **************************************************************************, the strong emotions she expressed before this Chamber show that she could not appear before the Tribunal to confirm that André Rwamakuba is guilty of the heinous crimes with which he is charged.

Those testimonies do not irrefutably contradict the Prosecutor's evidence as to the criminal responsibility of the Accused in the crimes committed at Butare hospital.  Another argument -- Defence argument calling Defence witnesses who stated that in the course of the events of '94 they neither saw nor heard -- neither saw nor heard the presence of the witness mentioned at Gikomero or Butare university, all claimed that had he been present, they would have known it.

As regards the acts committed in Gikomero that the Accused is accused of, the Defence called 12 witnesses.  I won't go into the details because the details are in our closing brief -- our closing submissions.  But in paragraphs 149 to 160 and in -- the footnotes related thereto allow us to maintain that those witnesses do not refute the Prosecution's theory as to the presence of the Accused in Gikomero commune to commit, there, the crimes of which he is accused.  The Prosecution's evidence makes it possible to put those witnesses into three categories: the first category would be that of witnesses who were prosecuted for genocide, who were seven in all, who themselves acknowledged their participation in those crimes and who were or are in prison -- have been to prison or are in prison and provided no concrete element proving that the Accused was not present because, in any case, neither were they in some cases.
The second category of those witnesses would be those who were not, and who admitted it, at the places the crimes were committed -- were not there at the time -- at the time when the crimes were committed.  There are numerous examples of that, but let me just mention one: Witness 7.14, who very convincingly gave many details on what had occurred in Gikomero during the events of April 1994 and who explained that he was not in Rwanda at that time and that the time when he first arrived in Gikomero was in October 1995.  The evidence shows that that witness could not testify in respect of the accusations against Rwamakuba, and the sole reason for his presence was due to the fact he wanted to discredit Witness GIN.

Witness 3.22 -- this is another example I'm giving -- asserts that he never heard Rwamakuba speak on the radio.  He even said he hadn't heard him at the swearing-in ceremony, and the reason he gives is that it took place not at Kigali, it took place in Gitarama.  That is the sort of witness, as most of the witnesses we've heard, and shows the true knowledge they had of what André Rwamakuba is accused of. 

There is also a third category, as I said, which is those witnesses who admitted they did not know the Accused and, under cross-examination, before the evidence adduced, admitted not being able to either assert anything as to his presence or not at the site of the crimes.  I'm coming back to the first category, which you will remember is that of criminals and who -- some of whom admitted having been present at the site -- some crime sites, especially Kayanga health centre.  The Prosecution evidence, Mr. President, on the basis of the witness testimony, shows that those witnesses were not present, indeed, at the time -- at the times of the crimes of which the Accused - with which the Accused is charged.

Mr. President, what one can say is that common thread running through these witnesses, who gave ample information on the crimes committed at Gikomero parish church and school, showed the total lack of knowledge of the events that occurred at Kurupangu and Kayanga health centre at the time when Rwamakuba was present.  Most of these witnesses -- of those witnesses often state that they did not hear the Accused mentioned in their commune's Gacaca hearings whilst admitting -- whilst acknowledging, and the evidence clearly shows -- whilst acknowledging that they were not aware of all the information provided throughout the commune.

The Prosecution, for its part, adduced -- led the evidence showing that the Accused had been mentioned in some communal Gacaca sessions by the Prosecution, and even Defence Witness 3.10 also admitted that at the end of the information collection, the name of the Accused was cited.  It's in paragraph 151.

The Prosecution presented in -- paragraphs 163 (sic) to 158 of the final brief clearly show that those witnesses were not in a position to know whether or not the Accused had been, or not, president of the university hospital because they did not know him.  The Prosecution, in light of the evidence also adduced by the Defence regarding accusations levelled at the Accused, regarding the university teaching hospital -- or, Butare university hospital, clearly shows that all those witnesses, six in all, acknowledge that they were not in a measure -- not in a position to know whether the Accused was present or not.  They claimed they had never heard that a minister had come -- allegedly come to the hospital, which would be surprising if one refers to the government delegation that visited the hospital on the 15th of May 1994, which several witnesses referred to.  Those witnesses --********************* -- all accepted, and the Prosecution relied on, the Defence witnesses' testimony before the Trial Chamber.  The evidence shows that they all acknowledge not having been present at the hospital full time.  They were only there from time to time ********************************************************** ********************************, which varies according to what the various ************ say.  Those witnesses also have stated that they left ***************** on the 21st of April and only returned on the 15th May 1994.  Five of the -- of those six witnesses assert that the Accused was never mentioned in the Gacaca hearings, which is clearly contradictory to what another Defence witness stated, Witness 5.10, who asserts having, from time to time, in the course of the Gacaca sessions heard information of the crimes committed by the Accused at the Butare university hospital, and she said that his name was mentioned in the ********* cellule Gacaca sessions.  And it must be mentioned that that witness, herself, also was mentioned in the Gacaca sessions, as well as another Defence witness.  Witness 5.7 also provided testimony as regards the events at the BUH, the Butare university hospital.

Prosecution assert that the Defence has adduced no evidence to disprove the Prosecution theory that Rwamakuba was, indeed, present at the BUH at the time of the events mentioned in the indictment and he planned, ordered, incited, committed -- or had committed, or in any other way aided and abetted the systematic or generalised attacks in -- against the Tutsi patients and refugees.

Another Defence argument is connected -- is in relation to the problem of identification of the witnesses.  In a document we have annexed, the Prosecution submits further Prosecution evidence on that specific point, in paragraphs 1 and 3 of that document, to prove the identity of the Accused at the site of the crime.  The Prosecution has stressed three aspects, and the three aspects together prove beyond all possible doubt that it was André Rwamakuba who committed the crimes of which he is accused, and he was identified by the Prosecution witnesses.  Those three aspects are: the involvement of the Accused before, as well as in, 1994 in the MDR Power movement; because of his notoriety with the local population in inciting the violence in Gikomero secteur; and his behaviour at Butare hospital, the BUH, where, again, he used his conduct to facilitate the massacre of the Tutsi defence list -- Tutsi patients and refugees.
The proper legal approach, we feel, is outlined in paragraphs 5 to 7 of the document, in accordance with established case law.  Established precedents, or jurisprudence as we now say at the Tribunal, requires that the evidence be seen in a holistic and integrated fashion.  It is obvious that taken one by one an item of evidence might, on the face of it, lack evidentiary value, probative value, but in conjunction with other items of evidence, it becomes more positive.  That argument was largely developed in the paragraphs I've just mentioned.

The Prosecution also maintains that an item of evidence can be, directly or indirectly, supported by another item of evidence, and the Prosecution wishes at this stage to examine the value of corroborative evidence, supportive evidence.  The process of corroboration, which is analysed in paragraphs 8 to 12 of the annexed -- of the annexure, shows that the concept is very vague and that the Appeals Chamber, to date, has not given any clear indication as to what the term means; however, it can be said that in common law countries, there is a wide recognition of what supportive evidence or corroborative evidence is, and the Prosecution would claim that the recent jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber, especially in the matter of Kamuhanda, indeed, applied that common law principle.

In our arguments, the Prosecution has shown that a body of circumstantial evidence, confirming what eyewitnesses stated, identify the Accused.  The Prosecution, in paragraphs 13 to 18, in respect of the assessment of witnesses' testimony stress this great degree of discretionary power of the Tribunal in assessing witness testimony in -- when seen in light of what the Appeals Chamber has stated to as the criterion establishing the credibility of witnesses in the case of what is considered contradictory testimony.  The Prosecution stresses that the testimony of a witness, although it might be considered to be very complex at one time or another, must be assessed in the light of the whole body of testimony received by the Trial Chamber.

In paragraphs 19 to 25 of the annexure, the Prosecution sets out its arguments regarding the evidence in respect of the identification of the Accused and considers that, in that field, account must be taken of the time factor, how the witness knew the Accused, and under what circumstances an accused must be identified.  It is obvious that it should not be considered that the rigour required -- the consideration of elements of identification is an additional element in the Prosecution's burden of proof.  The Prosecution would submit that in the light of what the Appeals Chamber has said, a credible witness supported by another witness, who is considered to be credible, can easily establish the identification of an accused even if the previous association was limited and the occasion to identify the Accused at the site of a crime was momentary.  Nothing requires that an identification witness need to have known the Accused for a lengthy period of time.  It is now legally established that circumstantial evidence can support the testimony of an eyewitness, and in that respect there's a whole body of circumstantial evidence incriminating the Accused, as I shall show.
It should also be noted, Mr. President, that the Accused has refused to take part in this trial and thereby removed any possibility for Prosecution witnesses to identify him in the course of the hearings.  So they can't use the argument that no witness was -- could -- or had the opportunity to identify him.  Practice in that respect -- it should be noted that the practice -- the methods used by the Defence of showing a photograph in cross-examination in respect of identification of the Accused are unacceptable and should not be admitted because of the lack of probative value.

The Prosecution submits that the following principles established in the ICTR jurisprudence should be relied upon, which is that the matter be assessed in its globality, in its entirety, that the Trial Chamber invested with high powers as to assessing the credibility of a witness must do it with caution and prudence.  That supporting evidence can be direct or indirect and, therefore, can be of greater or lesser importance, but the most correct fashion to assess them is to see how they match and fit in with the body of the -- body of the charges against an accused --  the accusations levelled against an accused.  And identification does not require, finally, a level of evidence higher than any other aspect.  It is in light of those principles, Mr. President, that the Prosecution has rapidly analysed the elements regarding identification -- or, identity of the Accused, which, as we have earlier said, comes from three sources: his belonging -- his membership of MDR Power faction; his actions in Gikomero commune; and at BUH, Butare university hospital.

In paragraphs 27 to 32 of the annexure, the Prosecution provides evidence incriminating André Rwamakuba in respect of his belonging to the MDR Power faction and, in doing so, referred to Witnesses ALA, GIQ and GLM -- ALA, GIQ and GLM.  It should be stated that those three witnesses are independent, one from another, and each one made a complete and convincing narrative as to actions of the Accused within the MDR Power faction.  If it is true that those witnesses could have identified the Accused, had he been present in the Trial Chamber, it is nonetheless true that each of those witnesses provided precise and matching information of the circumstances under which they came to know the Accused.  All that information is, of course, detailed in the Prosecution final brief.

Mr. President, it must be stressed that the combined evidence of the three testimonies confirm the genocidal intention of the Accused.  There is, indeed, a similitude between the descriptions given by Witnesses ALA and GIQ, in particular, as regards the use of the vehicle equipped with loudspeakers; moreover, that the element -- the evidence provided by these witnesses, by deduction, proves his guilt because of his conduct, and the Accused, a recognised and influential authority, used his position to broadcast a message of violence, and it is probable that he used his position, also, to commit those acts of violence during those -- genocide committed in Gikomero at the health centre and at the BUH.

As regards the Prosecution's elements of identification in Gikomero, they are provided especially by Witnesses GAB and GAC who had seen the Accused beforehand on several occasions and were able to observe him at leisure, but there is also the evidence provided by Witness GIM (sic), AVC and GII.  These statements would tend to confirm the testimony of eyewitnesses, as should this integrated approach to elements of information -- of identification among the -- all the evidence adduced by the Prosecution.

In order to undo the testimony of GMB, Defence refers to a previous testimony provided by that witness in Kamuhanda, but in that matter, in that trial, the witness did not describe what occurred at the health centre, although I dare to say that that is of relative importance.  As we have stated previously, the value of the evidence provided -- testimony depends on the character of the witness, although it had not been proven that in Kamuhanda, the Trial Chamber expressed any doubts as to the credibility of that witness.  Of course, the Accused does not mention any case law to the effect that the Chamber should reject the testimony of that witness, or does it argue that it should be rejected because the witness testified in another case.  Such a finding would, of course, be illogical and groundless.

Mr. President, Witness GAB should be assessed on the basis of his own testimonies in this trial, particularly when, as in the present case, some indirect evidence makes his testimony more credible.  Furthermore, the Prosecutor argues that CAB (sic) was cross-examined at length and there were no flaws in his testimony.  The evidence led by the Prosecutor establishes the circumstances under which the witness was able to identify the Accused.  The said Witness GAC, in light of the evidence he gave, reinforces the truthfulness and reliability of GAB's testimony.  Furthermore, as related by GLM, ALA and GIC, the Accused was a man who espoused openly the ideology of anti-Tutsi violence, which means that if he had the opportunity to translate his ideology into action, he would, of course, have done so.  The question is: wouldn't he have done so?  The answer is that, after arming the assailants, he would probably have participated in the attack.  The evidence given by GAB should, therefore, be considered credible and admissible.

The Accused availed himself of his position and influence to disseminate his anti-Tutsi violence ideology.  This was evident in GIN's testimony.  The Prosecutor established the conditions under which GIN had informed -- was informed of the massacres committed at the Kayanga health centre.

Mr. President, the Prosecutor submits that the combination of the evidence of GIN, GII, AVD and GAC and the evidence led in paragraphs -- in the paragraphs indicated, establish the anti-Tutsi sentiments of André Rwamakuba and his intentions and criminal acts against this ethnic group.  In conclusion, the evidence led, taken in its entirety, proves the guilt of André Rwamakuba in relation to the massacre committed at the Kayanga health centre.  Those massacres were also committed in Gikomero.

Regarding crimes committed at Butare university hospital, the evidence led reveals, besides what ALV and ALW stated, that the identification of Rwamakuba was established by the eyewitness XV who knew the Accused and who had known the Accused for a long time, since his student days.

If the Chamber admits that the evidence of XY -- XV is credible, nothing would justify failure to admit the identification of that witness as being beyond any reasonable doubt.  Witness XV stated the specific circumstances under which he knew André Rwamakuba.  From where he was at the hospital, XV was able to observe the Accused, who ordered the Interahamwe to put Tutsis on board the famous red pickup.  He observed him during -- over five minutes -- over a period of about five minutes.  In all objectivity, the circumstances show that XV was in a position from which he was able to properly observe André Rwamakuba.

The criticisms leveled against XV during the cross-examination are not founded.  The first challenge of his credibility is premised on the allegation that the name of the Accused was not mentioned in any of those statements or testimonies.  The Prosecutor submits that the testimony of XV should not be analysed in isolation; it is part of a whole range of pieces of evidence establishing the guilt of the Accused.  Furthermore, the Prosecutor produced other testimonies to corroborate the testimony of XV.  Two witnesses, GIO and HF, provided evidence situating the Accused on the scene of the massacre at the Butare hospital.

Three other witnesses -- ALV, RJ and ALW -- stated that they heard about the identity of the Accused from other persons at the hospital, mainly students.  If it is true that those testimonies identified the Accused through third parties, it is nonetheless true that this has probative value.  All the testimonies of those witnesses confirm that of XV, and corroborate directly the statements they made.

The Prosecutor submits that the evidence is of the same type and same calibre as the type accepted by the Appeals Chamber in the Kamuhanda case.  Even if only one witness had known the Accused previously, the combination of all the evidence leads to one conclusion: the guilt of the Accused has been established beyond all reasonable doubt.

The last question on this point is as follows: it was asserted during the cross-examination of XV that he had previously given contradictory evidence before a Defence investigator.  The witness did not admit that assertion; nor did the Defence prove it as it ought to have done.  The evidence led by the Prosecutor and the statements of the witness are explained in detail in the closing arguments.  The Prosecutor submits that no probative value should be attached to that allegation by the Defence.  To conclude, the testimony of XV confirmed by the evidence referred to above clearly establishes, beyond any reasonable doubt, the guilt of the Accused in respect of the massacre committed at the hospital.
Mr. President, I'll now very quickly deal with an argument raised by the Defence to the effect that the witnesses are not credible, given their -- the inconsistencies in their testimonies.  We have dealt with that, so I will not dwell on this issue at length.  Insofar as it is my opinion that we have raised all the arguments mentioned, insisting on the various aspects, the Chamber should take all this into account in its assessment of the evidence and it should be considered that the evidence concerning the Accused, which -- was not mentioned in prior statements and investigations.  With regard to this, the Prosecutor has given references.

The Prosecutor has provided references on these points as far as jurisprudence is concerned.  Regarding prior statements which were mentioned by the Defence, it is established by the Tribunal's jurisprudence that the absence of prior statements in the record - or, on the records, or the existence of inconsistencies between prior statements and the oral testimony of a witness does not automatically nullify the evidence given by the witness.  Reference was made to the Kajelijeli case -- the judgement in the Kajelijeli case.  Another argument was that during the period referred to in the indictment the Accused was unable to go to Gikomero because the roads had been blocked by the RPF.  They also argued that, apart from the main road, there were no other roads leading to Gikomero.

In paragraphs 178 to 193 of his closing arguments, the Prosecutor led evidence establishing that on the basis of the evidence given by Defence witnesses, and the Prosecutor used statements of Witnesses 1.5, 3.4 and 3.13, and -- the evidence they provided show that there were nine roads from Gikomero to Kigali.  Those roads were the following.  I wouldn't give any more details, I just mention them:  Kigali-Remera-Bumbogo-Gikomero; Kigali-Kabuye-Kajevuba-Gikomero; a road passing through Kanombe; and another passing through Deutsche Welle-Bombogo-Gikomero.  There was another road from Gatsatsa, passing through Kururama and Nyacyonga; a road passing through Gisozi; and the road passing through Sha, Nduba, Shango; and a road passing through Ndera or Rugende.  I forgot the last; that is, the road passing through Kajevuba-Sha-Gasabo-Kayanga-Rutunga.

All this is detailed in the closing arguments, and the references to those statements are also provided therein.  The Prosecutor submits that, in spite of the evidence given by Defence witnesses to the effect there were many roads leading to Gikomero, the same Defence witnesses did not mention those roads going from Kigali to Gikomero.  The Prosecutor and investigator Upendra Baghel, confirmed the existence of a road -- the existence of six roads leading to Gikomero from Byumba.  He stated that in the east there were five or six roads leading to that location; that is, Gikomero.  All the roads situated, according to him, to the left in Rwamagana led to Gikomero.  This proposition was accepted by the Defence, and, again, all references are found in the closing arguments.

Witness Upendra Baghel also referring to Exhibit P. 2, confirmed the existence of several roads that left Remera and led to Kigali.  The Prosecutor submits that Defence witnesses established, and the witness investigator also established, that in 1994 there were several roads that could lead from Kigali to Gikomero, other than the road passing through Remera towards Amahoro stadium.

The fact that it was accepted that some of those roads were not tarred, that there were difficult routes to take, does not in any way deny the fact that they are impracticable.  Furthermore, the Prosecutor points out that Defence witnesses stated that several refugees and assailants came from Rubungo and Remera and that they arrived in Gikomero.  These statements, contrary to the argument of the Defence, show that the entire zone was not occupied by the RPF.

The Defence, which did not deny the fact that many Tutsis were massacred, tried to suggest in its argument that, although these -- although they were regrettable, these killings were due to the war and that the victims were both Tutsi and Hutu.  The evidence -- the evidence adduced by the Prosecutor throughout its closing arguments establish with certainty that at the sites on which massacres were committed, Tutsis were killed without any distinction between men, women and children, and at times even babies were massacred.

Clearly, those victims were non-combatants, displaced persons who had fled their homes because of the attacks and had no means to defend themselves.  The Prosecution submits that the Trial Chamber was not seized of any evidence showing that the RPF was present in the Gikomero region and the Butare university hospital, or that the Tutsi were an armed force.  On the contrary, the Prosecution evidence clearly shows that the RPF was not present at the places where the crimes were committed, and Defence witnesses -- and we give the detailed references in the Prosecution's final brief -- were incapable of stating at what exact place and what exact time they had allegedly seen the RPF soldiers.  It has been established by the Prosecution that when a place was occupied -- attacked, it was especially that the -- because the Tutsi were Inkotanyi and the -- under the pretext that the Tutsi were Inkotanyi.  The fact that RPF attacked and that Hutu were killed in no way diminishes the guilt of the Accused of the massacre of Hutu civilians, in no way justifies the massacre of Tutsi civilians, and it is not proper in the field of international humanitarian law to base a defence on reciprocity.

1715H 
MS. FALL: 
The Prosecution in chapter 2 and the constitutive elements of the crimes of which André Rwamakuba -- clearly lays out the points for the offences of which the Prosecutor -- the Accused is accused to be clearly -- establishes and clearly identified.  

The constitutive elements of genocide and jurisprudence in respect thereof are laid out in paragraphs 200 to 221 of the Prosecution's final brief.  They have been widely established in various documents submitted to the Tribunal and it is not necessary to go into any further detail in that regard. 

The evidence adduced also in respect of that crime are laid out in -- also in paragraphs 213 to 219 and describe, in detail, the acts committed by the Accused in his firm intention to violate the physical or mental well-being and to exterminate the Tutsi. 

The Prosecutor, beyond all reasonable doubt, has established that that was the purpose of the massacre of people in Gikomero commune and at Butare hospital at the time of the events stated in the indictment.  

In paragraphs 221 to 224, the Prosecution lays out the constitutive elements of that crime, and provides for that specific crime the item of evidence that establishes beyond all reasonable doubt 
André Rwamakuba's guilt in that regard, and I shall not come back to all those items of evidence, which are clearly set forth. 

In paragraphs 225 to 239, the constitutive elements of crimes against humanity.  Because of the systematic and generalised nature of the attacks, the target, which was the civilian population, the cause of the attack, which was because of the political - national, political, racial or ethnic character of the group of the victims, and also, the clear evidence of the Accused's involvement in that crime. 

The Prosecutor, in paragraphs 241 to 246, covers extermination.  And the Prosecution evidence, which establishes, beyond all reasonable doubt, the guilt of André Rwamakuba -- and item 3 -- under Article 3 as extermination being a crime against humanity.  

The same procedure was followed in paragraphs 247 to 252 concerning murder and the evidence adduced, which established beyond all reasonable doubt André Rwamakuba's guilt under charge number 4 in the indictment regarding murder. 

Mr. President, in paragraph -- in chapter 3 of the Prosecution's final brief, we show what was the individual criminal responsibility of the Accused, which must be applied under 6.1 -- Article 6.1 of the statute.  And is clearly set forth, moreover, in paragraphs 257 to 269 -- 257 to 269, the clear judicial criteria for the various forms of individual criminal responsibility as defined under Article 6.  

There is a detailed analysis of the various acts that establish the various forms of direct participation of the Accused, and gives very clear references to what means -- what it means to plan, instigate, order, commit or otherwise aid and abet -- and, in each case, set forth which was the enemy -- evidence adduced in this -- in that matter -- in that regard in respect of André Rwamakuba.  

The Prosecution has also underlined that omission, by the Accused, is a form of aiding and abetting, referring in that respect to the jurisprudence -- in that respect, was provided in the Prosecution's final brief. 

Mr. President, in chapter 4, the Prosecution speaks very quickly of the accumulation of offences and jurisprudence in that regard.  I don't need to dwell on that.  And also in chapter 4, the Prosecution submits its recommendations as to sentencing.  

In accordance with paragraph C of Article 86 of the rules -- Rule 86 in light of the established facts, the Trial Chamber, by way of the rules of evidence and procedure of the Tribunal, has discretionary powers in fixing a sentence. 

Article 23 of the statute stipulates that the Trial Chamber takes account of factors, such as, the seriousness of the offence and of the personal situation of the person convicted.  The Prosecution submits in light of all the pertinent factors and Rule 101 and 101(A) of the Rules that the most appropriate sentence is life in prison -- life imprisonment for each charge in the indictment and on which the Accused will be found guilty.  The Prosecutor grounds its position on the seriousness of the crimes committed as well as aggravating circumstances. 

Genocide is the crime of crimes.  And the intrinsic gravity of the offences André Rwamakuba must answer, that is to say, genocide, and complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity, is not to be -- it is not necessary to show further -- to prove further, and the Trial Chamber will decide of (sic) the sentence to be applied.  

André Rwamakuba, because of his participation of the attacks in Gikomero commune and at Butare university hospital, in planning, ordering and inciting other people to commit them, in committing them himself, played a decisive role in the murder of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi. 

A sentence of life imprisonment is the only punishment commensurable with the odious crimes that he committed or had committed.  The fact that André Rwamakuba was minister of primary and secondary education at the time of the events referred to in the indictment, is an aggravating circumstance, which the Trial Chamber will have to take into account in the course of its deliberations.  

As a minister, the Accused had an official position and was a person of stature recognised in Rwandan society.  He was known in his home commune, Gikomero, recognised as a member of the MDR Power faction.  His ministerial duties should have led him to stick closely to the principles set forth in the constitution and show a high standard of morality.  Unfortunately, he failed in all his duties.  

He supported the anti-Tutsi campaign.  He took part in the massacre of the Tutsi ethnic group, and he incited, aided, abetted, ordered other people to commit massacres of that Tutsi ethnic group.  He, himself, personally participated in the murder of members of that group, which is a further aggravating circumstance, Mr. President. 

The Accused as a doctor should, in conformity with his professional ethics and in light of his profession, save human life and treat and care for the suffering of sick people, wounded people, vulnerable people.  But unfortunately he decided to do the opposite and participate in the massacre of numerous Tutsi, innocent and defenceless victims. 

Mr. President, I have come to the end of the Prosecution's final submissions.  I should like to beg your pardon if I have been longer than planned.  

But before concluding, I should like to ask you to allow me to thank all the parties involved in the trial, beginning with the Bench, the registry.  I should like to greet -- to salute the court stenographers and apologise for having made them suffer.  I should also like to thank the interpreters and salute them very warmly and also beg their forgiveness, because when one speaks, one doesn't realise how quickly one speaks, but it would appear that, unfortunately, I was speaking very quickly.  

I should like also to thank other parties, the security, the WVSS, the Chamber management and, more particularly, my team that have supported me throughout this trial.  And I should finally like to salute my learned friends in the Defence, and even if perhaps we have had to confront one another, which is quite normal, in the well of the court.  But outside the well of this court, there is nothing personal about -- or any animosity between us.  I should like to salute them and once more thank all those who have contributed to the smooth -- to the way in which this trial has so smoothly proceeded.  

Thank you, Your Honour, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor. 

I think we should just say this:  Because of a number of factors involved, including the participation of members of our Bench on another case which is being carried on now -- next week, the preference of the Bench would be to see if we could finish the arguments this evening.  

Now, we are going to take a break now and ask the registrar to consult with the officials in the courtroom to see how possible that is.  So we'll just rise for a few minutes now. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper, did you wish to say something?  

Okay.  We'll rise now.  
(Court recessed from 1732H to 1747H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would just to express my appreciation to the court staff, all of the court staff who have agreed to tough it out to the bitter end so we can complete the closing arguments today.  Thank you very much. 

Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, I'm very much aware that the sight of counsel rising to his feet at a quarter to six on a Friday afternoon is not a happy apparition for a Judge or for anyone else, perhaps, for that matter.  And I thank those who have enabled us this evening to complete our submissions in this case.  

And may I, without repeating, join with Ms. Fall in her thanks to all those staff who, with a gentle touch and infinite politeness, assisted us in -- in the months that have preceded today. 

Mr. President, you have our closing arguments and submissions.  It's a substantial document, we hope in content as much as in length.  It deals with as many of the points as we reasonably felt we could or should.  It deals with evidence really as narrative.  We took the view that if ever there was a case that centred on evidence, this was it and that the evidence spoke for itself and needed no gloss from me, as counsel, and was a story best told in the words of the witnesses who gave it. 

At one time I had thought we might just lay that substantial document in front of you, knowing that perhaps the sooner you were able to start reading it, the better.  But then we appreciate that -- or realise that the entire document is under seal, and it is, in those circumstances, really incumbent upon us to state in public what it is that causes us to submit to you, the Judges, why you should acquit 
André Rwamakuba. 

You are the Judges of both law and fact.  And the focus of this case now moves from the witness box and counsel and to you.  And can I repeat what, in fact, I submitted and stated at the outset of this defence case, and that was that it's no part of my function, no part of my job as Defence counsel to instruct you, the Judges, as to how you view the evidence.  That is a matter for you, and that is entirely a matter that falls within your province.  

Our function at this stage is to make submissions that we hope advance our client's case, the case of André Rwamakuba.  It will be for you to judge, of course, whether they do or do not advance his case. 

The background to this case is, to put it mildly, emotive.  But you are not here to judge a genocide but, of course, to judge an individual, a single accused, and his alleged involvement in these events. 

So let me start with him, with André Rwamakuba, who you now know, despite his nonappearance before you, a great deal.  He was born in Nduba in 1950.  He's now 55 years of age.  He was born, of course, in Gikomero commune.  Now, you've visited that commune.  You've seen it.  You've been there.  On the map, a stone's throw, it would seem, from Kigali city.  But in reality, as it may well be you would agree, it seems quite distant, a very isolated and different place, a place of valleys and steep-sided hills, as beautiful as it is poor.  

Rwamakuba's family, like so many within Rwanda, is of a mix genealogy, mainly Hutu, but a father's direct line to the Muhunde of eastern Congo, a grandmother who was Tutsi.  His father went to the Katanga copper mines to better the family fortunes in the early 1950s.  The family joined him there.  He succeeded in bettering his fortunes.  The family were regarded, as we've heard, as rich, rich in cattle, rich in animals, rich in land.

André Rwamakuba spent nearly all his early life, up until the age of 14, as you've heard, not in Rwanda but in Kayanga.  He returned to Nduba aged 14.  A bright boy, he did well.  He had had the advantages of the educational system in Kayanga.  In 1970, aged 20, he won a scholarship to Louvain university in Belgium, and he remained there for four years until 1974.  And then at Butare university from '74 to '78, where he obtained his diploma in medicine and qualified as a doctor.  

He practiced for a relatively short time after that in clinical medicine, but he rapidly began to specialise, as you heard, in public health.  And, but for one short break in Kigali hospital for about a year in about 1990, public health remained his one field, and one he both excelled and exceeded in, becoming director of regional health for Kigali and Kigali rural health area, a massive area in 1991. 
This was a man with massive professional commitments and extensive responsibilities.  I note, with some bewilderment, that the Prosecution refer in their closing brief to Rwamakuba being, at some time, medical director at Butare hospital.  That's mentioned twice in the brief.  Where has that come from?  Reading it I wondered, have we been doing the same case?  Have we been sitting listening to the same evidence?  And when we showed that to Rwamakuba yesterday in the UNDF, all he could do was shake his head and raise his hands.  The truth be said, there's very little this Prosecution could do or say that would surprise him. 

He's a travelled, sophisticated, cosmopolitan.  He likes to dress well, neatly, fastidious.  The one criticism we heard about him from any witness was that he was a workaholic, but his family, his children, remained his priority.  And not just his children, with his brothers he opened two free schools to let others benefit as they had benefitted in education, schools that were open to all. 

Outside the evidence of Prosecution witnesses, there's not the slightest hint of prejudice to anyone.  The family embraced Michel, a Tutsi, as the husband of Nyarwamakuba, his sister.  Rwamakuba worked with and had many friends who were Tutsi, which isn't too surprising.  After all, this was one community, not two communities, in Rwanda.  

You saw the letter from his friend, the nun, a Tutsi, to him in Belgium.  And you may recall the evidence of Dr. Monet, how in 1993 he saw Rwamakuba was angry and he said he had come -- he had come back from the ministry and they had tried to change the candidates that had been proposed for the scholarships.  They wanted to replace Tutsi by Hutu, and he wasn't very happy with that -- with what was being done, because the list had been changed.  So there we have it.  1993, an angry Rwamakuba, because he is witnessing prejudice to Tutsis, observed by as neutral a man as Dr. Monet. 

Well, I'm not here to prove the negative, to prove that he wasn't prejudiced.  Let the Prosecution prove that, if they can.  There's plenty of evidence in the way of them doing so and a lot of evidence that this man was, in fact, a gentleman.  

In his political life he was, as (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), perhaps put it -- I strike that word (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), put it 15, I'm sorry -- a technocrat, not a politician, but a sense of public duty led him to assume a political role, and he joined the newly formed MDR in 1991. 

This was a party that was open to all.  It was largely Hutu, but then so was the population of Rwanda.  It was not ethnicist, nor were its policies.

MR. HOOPER:
It was, in our submission, a decent, middle-of-the-road, democratic party dedicated to the rule of law and to the removal of the one-party state.  That, may I say in our submission or observation, is contrary to the Prosecution's assertion in their brief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, you did attempt to withdraw a name from the record. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I think I should formally order that it be redacted. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'll clarify with the registrar at the close of my submissions what that was. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
It is Witness 1.5.  Thank you.
MR. KIYEYEU:
I have taken a note, My Lord.  
MR. HOOPER:
So I was submitting that all the evidence shows the MDR to be a democratic centre-road party; a decent party, and that submission is contrary or runs counter to the Prosecution's assertion in their brief, which in our submission, is misplaced and has, presumably as its basis, a misunderstanding of the evidence.  

Our assertion -- submission is amply demonstrated by the Prosecution's own exhibits.  The MDR statute, for example, and it's supported by their expert, Des Forges, and also, of course, by our own witness in respect of MDR, Nkezebera and by those MDR communiqués, which were exhibited and which you have.  

The MDR was a party within which, as a democrat, as a moderate, Rwamakuba was in good company for it contained Agathe Uwilingiyimana; Boniface Ngulinzira, his best friend, architect of the Arusha Accords and agreement, who he supported.  We heard from Witness 1.1 during that process.  Both Agathe and Boniface murdered in the early days of the genocide for being moderates.  Gasana, Anastase, his local president, minister for foreign affairs at the time of Habyarimana's death, and continued to be under Paul Kagame's new government.  

Twagiramungu, Faustin -- later prime minister, his ambition achieved under Paul Kagame -- a clever -- is Twagiramungu, a clever man, but ambitious and perhaps too ambitious for the party as demonstrated by the Kabuzunzu difficulties in July of 1993, and the political tensions that resulted from that.  There's a depth of evidence there.  I'm not going to review it now; it's all dealt with in the brief.  

Now, the Prosecution made much of Hutu Power.  It's, in our submission, a label that's been attached more retrospectively, more since the events leading up to April than was at all current at the time.  Des Forges was the principal Prosecution expert witness on that subject.  The other Prosecution witnesses demonstrated, we say, a paucity of knowledge, an unreliability that may leave you, the Judges, with a great reluctance to place any weight on their evidence in respect of this field.  Des Forges is reviewed again in the section on Hutu Power in our brief, at length.  

Nkezebera, a Defence witness, was well placed, because he was right at the heart of the party, to give authentic evidence of contemporaneous events which were, in fact, lost on Des Forges.  Many things she hadn't heard about and were new to her.  

Nkezebera, in his evidence, was not effectively challenged by the Prosecution.  There was little or no challenge to his evidence; his credibility was not questioned at all.  So it's more our surprise to now find it asserted in the Prosecution brief, closing brief, that he allegedly was Hutu Power, something never put to him when he was in the witness box, something the Prosecution had a duty to do, if they were going to assert such a thing, to give him and the Defence an opportunity of dealing with the matter.  And, indeed, it's an odd thing to say of a man who told you that after the Hutu Power Nyamirambo speech of Karamira in October of 1993, he, Karamira, and others within the MDR, upbraided Karamira immediately afterwards for what they saw as a fit of wholly inappropriate rhetoric on his part.  

He was also the man who praised Boniface Ngulinzira, architect of the Arusha Accords, praised him to the rafters in the witness box in front of you, so not a lot there to indicate a Power member, if there were or was such a thing.  

We all agree, from Des Forges through -- right through the Defence and the witnesses, that Hutu Power was voiced by Karamira at Nyamirambo in October, late October, 1993.  It followed the murder of Ndadaye, the first Hutu president of a majority Hutu population in Burundi.  On that date of the introduction, mention of Power is supported by Des Forges, and it contradicts those Prosecution witnesses which, I submit, deserve to be spurned, who claim that Power came into being before that speech.  

The context of that speech, as we know, was not just the death of Ndadaye, but the destabilising effect of the attack by the RPF in January, in 1993, during the Arusha peace talks, which led to the displacement of a million Rwandans, over a tenth of its population.  And many decent people were questioning the true motives of the RPF, for reasonable cause.  

But the fact remains that by the 6th of April 1994, the MDR party was the one party that was, as it were, together -- reasonably together, with its ministers nominated, its parliamentary representatives appointed and ready to go -- ready to go and enter into the broad-based transitional government proposed under Arusha -- and with the prospect in 18 months' time after that, of probable substantial gains in the open elections that were to be held, it was the party of the future.  

It may be borne in mind that in the six months leading up to April 1994, when there were very difficult times within Rwanda, these were not times directly shared in, in our submission, by Rwamakuba, who was, as you know, we assert -- submit, in Belgium, disconnected, to a great extent, from party affairs.  A disconnection amply demonstrated, in our submission, by that letter from Ngulinzira's wife, Florida, giving Rwamakuba a very slight tittle-tattle about what was going on within the party, demonstrating a man who needed to be informed of -- why?  Because he was disconnected.  

So there's the MDR as of 6th of April.  Whoever shot down the plane must have appreciated the chaos it would bring, the ethnic reaction it would or could inspire, and the effective derailment of the democratic process underway and in which the MDR played, and was playing, a prominent part.  

There is, we submit, no good evidence of a Hutu Power party.  There's no good evidence of what such a thing stood for.  It's a loose, misleading label stuck on a ragbag of things.  Strangely, the Prosecution have raised it in the Prosecution document -- part of their closing brief identification document that deals, in fact, with many other things -- they've raised Hutu Power there to "a political organisation set up to promote a pro-Hutu, anti-Tutsi ideology."  

We have, we submit, heard not a jot of evidence in respect of that.  In both Prosecution briefs, Rwamakuba is described as being a member of its executive committee, this Hutu Power party's executive committee.  We've had no evidence of such a committee, not a whiff of it, nor of Rwamakuba being on it, because it never existed.

The Prosecution cannot produce one document with MDR Power on it that was a contemporaneous document, a document of the time.  And, when one pauses and thinks, it would, prior to April '94, be mighty strange, would it not, for a political party to hide its colours?  Because political parties or tendencies, just don't do that.  So where are the references in Isibo, or in Democratia, or other current papers, for or against?  Where are all the announcements of meetings, the agendas that relate to this party?  Or, was it a ghost party, or just simply a figment?  A figment.  

And if the MDR Power -- as the Prosecution witnesses, those, as I've said, that should be spurned -- if the MDR Power, as they assert, emerged at the July conference, how can the Prosecution explain all those witnesses, those pointed motions calling on Habyarimana to speed up the signing and implementation of the Arusha Accords?  How can those two propositions possibly sit together?  

A backdrop to the evidence of this case is the genocide.  For all the time I've spent on this case, it remains, for me, an enigma.  Not the fact that it occurred.  We, in this Defence have, from the outset, plainly -- plainly accepted the obvious:  That it did occur.  That is to say, that thousands upon thousands, running into hundreds of thousands, of Tutsi people, were butchered for no other reason than that they were Tutsi or perceived as enemy.  

And that whether they be young, or old, or mothers with babies on their back, or children, we don't deny that genocide and all the horrors that attended it.  And our thoughts and hearts go out to those who suffered so cruelly in it.  

Many of our own witnesses were Tutsis who had suffered so cruelly in it.  But how it happened, and how decent and intelligent people, such as the Rwandans -- how they fell into that abyss, that remains an enigma, and, fortunately, not one that I need begin to try and seek to explain this afternoon.  

The Prosecution say that the man that we described earlier, that decent, hard working, unprejudiced democrat family man, played a part in the genocide.  He's charged with going to Gikomero to kill those who were his neighbours and who he must have lived and grown up with.  He's charged with killing patients and defenceless refugees.  He's charged as a doctor with killing at Butare hospital the bedridden and infirm, loading them up to be taken away to be killed, or killing them in their beds, killing five men -- five women in their beds by a blow with an axe, two men he happens to meet outside with a blow with his axe to their head.  

That's a shocking feature of this case, as the Prosecution have said, that Dr. Rwamakuba, a man who set out on what is normally an idealistic path of medicine is alleged to have killed patients, to have killed the sick, the infirm, the needy.  

It's perhaps not surprising, if those allegations are, as we submit, untrue, that Dr. Rwamakuba has turned his back on this Prosecutor and has not attended his trial.  

It's plain that this trial concerns two sets of allegations and little else:  Gikomero, events there, and Butare hospital.  Whereas many know, Rwamakuba was, in fact, was the minister of primary and secondary education in the Interim government, appointed to it on the 8th of April 1994.  

There's no evidence that Rwamakuba participated in any process of selection for the post.  Indeed, there's evidence that he did not participate in any selection.  There's good evidence that his appointment only came about because of his previous participation in the democratic processes of his party.  And you may recall the meeting he had with moderate, Faustin Twagiramungu, during the brief time, in our submission, he was back in Rwanda in March, as to suitability for post.  But when those who had fled or were dead were discounted, the names on that list were limited.  Rwamakuba was called as a result.  

His appointment as a minister in that government is not, in our submission, an indication of any disposition on his part.  You've heard how the announcement on the radio of the 8th of April of Rwamakuba's appointment as minister was a bolt from the blue for him and for his family.  What choice did he have?  Which one of us here today would have refused the invitation of the military -- the army officer, to accompany him in the armoured vehicle to the swearing-in ceremony?  Which one of us would have closed the door and said, "No, thank you"?  And both he, as you've heard, and his wife, had doubts whether he would ever return.  As Dr. Monet told us, such appointments were not unusual.  

There's no evidence in this case of Rwamakuba's participation in the affairs of government.  And for that reason, it's not necessary for us, the Defence, to deal with that aspect at all.  We're not concerned with Rwamakuba, the minister.  We're not concerned with government, only in so much as if you find as a fact various matters he may have -- may be an indication of disposition.  But we're not concerned with Rwamakuba qua minister.  Nor do I need make submissions as to the authority and power of that government, that several witnesses who appeared before you described, perhaps amply, as useless.  It may well be that real power, post April the 6th, lay elsewhere in Rwanda, running along other established lines of power and familiarity.  In any event, we're not concerned with what the government did or didn't do in this case.  

There's no evidence of individual acts or omissions on the part of André Rwamakuba within the competence of his office as minister of education.  The Prosecution have, in our submission, in their closing brief, misrepresented his de jure authority, which can only stem from his authority as minister of PrimSec.  He was not in charge of gendarmerie, the army, the hospitals or civil defence.  We have not a jot of evidence that he was.  And command responsibility is expressly removed from this case as a feature, as we know.  We're not concerned with that concept.  

So we were concerned to see in the Prosecution closing briefs, paragraphs 11 and 12, which seemed, on the limited opportunity or view we had of the document, to be couched in terms of 6.3, command responsibility.  And you will recall, Mr. President, that we'd argued against severance from the -- having argued for it in 2000, when the Prosecution opposed.  Just before the end of 2004, the matter was raised again, and we initially argued against severance if the issue of government remained, as we felt the Accused could best demonstrate his innocence in his ministerial position in a joint trial.  

The Prosecution then put forward a second amended indictment on the basis that they would focus on the direct actions of the Accused in Gikomero and Butare.  We agreed to severance on that indictment, on the understanding that the Prosecution had abandoned both joint criminal enterprise and command responsibility, and inviting them to respond if our understanding was misplaced.  They didn't respond, but the Chamber ordered the removal of command responsibility from the indictment, and that was done.  They had already, of their own volition, removed joint criminal enterprise as a form of participation.  

So we've conducted the defence of André Rwamakuba on the plain understanding that command responsibility, joint criminal enterprise, were out and that the relevance of his being a minister was confined to disposition and ideology.  

While dealing with the Prosecution brief, may we also refer to paragraph 9?  Now, there's a reference there to Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's diary and to events recorded or alleged to have been recorded by her on the 16th of April and the 17th of May and which evidence, it says in that paragraph, relates to Rwamakuba.  I say paragraph 9.  I think it may be 15.  Can you give me one moment?  Yeah, it's another one.  What's 9, then?  

Yes, it's 15.  It's paragraph 15.  Now, we're very concerned about this.  We haven't ever seen this reference at all.  It's entirely missing from the exhibit.  We've checked that.  Mr. O'Shea spent until one or two o'clock this morning hunting through documents, and what we found was this:  That the Prosecution had misled us and the Chamber.  I hope that's not an inappropriate comment, because such a clear statement, unfounded by the evidence, is misleading.  

It says at paragraph 15 -- and I'm sorry when I say at this stage in a closing speech, that I have to address detail, but it's my only opportunity to do so.  But it says there in paragraph 15, in the French, that her diary records for the 16th of April that Rwamakuba -- André Rwamakuba was present at the meeting of conseillers de ministre, cabinet ministers, that had taken place at Murambi.  That's the first thing in that paragraph.  

The second thing is that it goes on to state that there's a second reference to him in her diary relating to a second conseil de ministres of Murambi, the 17 May.  "Under that date, information is given concerning civil defence, including the words 'checking' and 'identity cards'.  It is stated that the responsibility for civil defence was with the ministry of defence -- with the minister of defence and his ministry.  And amongst others in his ministry was the minister of primary and secondary education which was charged with mobilising the population."  

And the note -- footnote says, "See Exhibit Prosecution P.25."  Is it 26?  25.  Well, you go to those dates, and there's nothing there.  As I say, Mr. O'Shea won't let things go like that, so he spends a long time yesterday hunting down references, and he begins to think, well, there must be some reference somewhere to this.  So he goes to a secondary source, and that's Guichaoua.  Now, Guichaoua was not the expert witness in our case, but he produced a document by him on Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's diary, which was part of his expert testimony in the Butare case.  It was admitted in this case as a document, but it was not admitted as expert evidence.  

We've got one expert in this case under Rule 94 and that was, of course, Des Forges.  That's as plain, I hope, as the nose on my face.  We have not had any request to receive expert evidence from Guichaoua.  Now, I mention all that because in his reference or his review of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's diary traces a reference to -- let me deal, first of all, with the reference to the 16th of April, the allegation by the Prosecution that Rwamakuba is at the minister's meeting of the 16th of April.  In fact, all the document -- or, the diary shows is the entry for -- and this is not, by the way, a diary.  It's more a notebook, as one can see at a glance, because none of the actual entries appear under the dates as one would expect in a diary.  This appears elsewhere on page 12 of the diary.  

It refers to the 16th of April.  It has many things in it, and then it has a name, "Rwamakuba".  We don't know the context.  We don't know which Rwamakuba that is, because we've heard there's other Rwamakuba s, incidentally, from Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's Butare.  And it's wholly unclear what on earth that reference is about at all.  There's nothing to support the Prosecution assertion that it demonstrates Rwamakuba was present at a meeting.  

We then go to the 17th of May.  That entry is an entry that's found in February; that is, it's not under the 17th of May.  You have to go to the 22nd to the 28th of February, that part of her diary that deals with February.  And there you'll find an entry, but again it's very difficult looking at it, on the face of it, to determine what on earth it means.  And there's nothing here -- right, nothing -- that talks about civil defence, minister of defence and some kind of hierarchy of responsibility or any responsibility in respect of it in the diary.  

What one has is a footnote, which I'm straining to read, but I saw it earlier.  And from recollection and my note, you'll find that that, in fact, is Guichaoua's thoughts on what Pauline Nyiramasuhuko may have been thinking about another ministry.  Not only that, but if you look at the footnote, it ends, "...."  it's incomplete.  It's obvious Guichaoua was going to come back and look at that again.  

Now, I think I've said enough, I hope, about that.  It's taking up limited time, but it needs to be dealt with.  And we submit what the Prosecution assert in their paragraph 15 is just misleading.  In any event, we've never had an opportunity to deal with any of it, a breach of Rule 90; it's never been referred to at any point in the trial.  And here we are, half past 6:00 on a Friday night, and I'm trying to ask you, the Judges, in a way to deal with it.  

Aside from any issue of disclosure, we would comment obviously that, on the face of this, it's wholly -- well, it's probative of little or nothing, documentary hearsay not referred to in evidence, not the subject of discussion or investigation, nor evidence from us, solely relevant to the state of the mind of the maker, who turns out not even to be Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, but rather Guichaoua; certainly not the mind of André Rwamakuba.  

What it was, what it represents, has never been explored.  And, of course, we know and certainly understand that the case we are dealing with here this afternoon does not concern Rwamakuba as minister anyway.  

And, finally, in respect of government, may I remind you that Des Forges told us that government met and agreed matters on a consensus basis and that that meant, she said, A, the consensus only of those only actually present at the meeting -- and we have little or no evidence of Rwamakuba's presence -- and, B, that consensus would be reached despite the silence of some, two very significant observations if we were concerned with government, which we're not.  

The Prosecution claim that Rwamakuba did nothing to stop the massacres.  Well, we have instructions from him that he did, but, of course, that's not evidence.  But where outside their witnesses, the ones who came into that witness box, is there evidence that he did do nothing?  We're left in this position:  There's no evidence one way or the other.  The Prosecution could have called such evidence, if they were able to, if they had wanted to.  

I'm shortly coming to the evidence which I'm going to review, I hope, very shallowly and lightly because it's all set out in our closing brief in much, much more detail.  But before turning to the evidence, we know -- we all know -- that you'll be viewing the evidence necessarily within certain parameters.  This is not a level playing field; it's tilted heavily in favour of an Accused, and so it should be.  André Rwamakuba didn't ask to be brought here eight years ago, to be -- to have his life with his family broken and fractured, to be taken from his work as a doctor in the hospital he was working at in Namibia under his full and ordinary name, to be separated from his wife and young family for eight years.  He didn't ask for any of that, or to be the subject of the appalling prevarication of the Prosecutor in this case.  I should say "Prosecutors" in this case, going back eight years.  Opposing severance, asking for severance, delays, indictments, unnecessary legal arguments have peppered the road for the last eight years.  

Rwamakuba asked for none of that.  The Prosecution brought him here.  It's only fair, common sense, really, that having brought him here and charged him, that they should prove the case against him, and to a high standard, as we know, beyond a reasonable doubt.  And we all know that the more serious the crime, while the standard of proof, of course, doesn't change, the degree of care does.  That's why we have in our national systems lower courts and higher courts, for lesser offences and more serious offences.  

And this is a very high court.  It's not here to administer an average kind of justice.  It aspires, as we know, to administer a very high standard of justice, which is why the international community has invested almost a billion dollars into this institution, to ensure, as far as possible, that the quality of justice here is exemplary.  The burden on the Prosecutor doesn't shift on to the Defence at any point, and it's important to bear in mind throughout, but particularly when one considers particular aspects of the case, such as alibi or the issue of access to Gikomero.  

With alibi, it may be misleading to describe an alibi as the defence of alibi.  It's an issue raised, rather, and it places no burden, when the Defence raise it, on the defence; the burden of proving or disproving it rests with the Prosecution.  The Prosecution must prove the alibi to be untrue, rather than the Defence having to prove that it is true.  And that's not, as my friend -- and I'm very grateful to her acknowledging it this afternoon, it's not a different burden of proof, and we agree with the Prosecution as to that; it's simply the same old burden.  They have it; we don't.  

We are critical, may we say, of aspects of the Prosecution closing brief, which is there to see, for its apparent departure from this fundamental concept.  From time to time, in our submission, their brief slides into a posture which appears to reverse the burden of proof.  This afternoon we were told the Defence had not produced any concrete evidence to contradict the Prosecution theory.  We don't have to produce anything in respect of Prosecution theories.  It's not up to us.  If the Prosecution want to transform a theory into established fact, they do so through the witness box.  Or to say, as they do at paragraph 23 of the identification document, that "The Chamber should not reject such Prosecution evidence unless there is very good reason as to why a doubt is raised."  That can't be right.  In fact, it's wholly wrong.  And those are but two examples.  But, in our submission, going through that brief, there are others for the unwary.  We are confident that you are wary.  

There are also a number of legal positions assumed without authority, which is regretful in a Prosecution brief, and the occasional use of an over-selective use of authorities in support of an argument or concept.  I'll give you one.  In reference to murder and premeditation, Akayezu is in lights, but there's no reference to the well-known dissenting judgments in Kayishema and Kupresic.  Enough of criticism, but if it's valid, it should be made.  

Alibi is an important aspect of our case.  And the Prosecution witnesses relating to rallies and events in Gikomero, I'm going to deal with briefly in the context of alibi.  Four Prosecution witnesses, the first four we had, came and told you that in the six months leading up to April 1994, André Rwamakuba, who they knew well, or knew, came, as one said, almost every weekend to hold meetings, where words such as, "The time has come to exterminate the Tutsis" were uttered by him.  All this on his home plot.  

The Defence called evidence before you that during that period, for the six months from September to mid-March and after that for two weeks in Egypt, Rwamakuba was on an intensive, highly specialised course at the Prince Leopold Institute in Antwerp.  I'm not going to repeat the evidence given -- and they had to be brought here to give it -- by Professor Mercenier, Professor Van Balen, Dr. Monet of the World Health Organization, and Edith Van Wynesberghe.  Nor am I going to report evidence of relatives, nor the reference to the many contemporaneous exhibits, the 1993 diary of Rwamakuba that was exhibited, the receipts that Van Wynesberghe produced, the letters that were produced, the envelopes with addresses on them and date stamps, the passport, the visas the entry and exit stamps, the Christmas cards, all that evidence so logically, intrinsically, internally right.  

Now, we don't have to prove he was there in Belgium at that time.  But can anyone have the slightest doubt where Rwamakuba was for those six months; or that he was at the subsequent World Health Organization conference in Aswan, Egypt for the last two weeks of March of '94; or what he was doing with Dr. Monet in the days, day-by-day, leading up to the murder of Habyarimana?  

So, what is the Prosecution response to this?  Well, that he popped back to Rwamakuba -- sorry, he popped back to Rwanda when no one was looking, without telling his wife or his professional colleagues?  And why?  In order to harangue the peasantry on that distant hill, to harangue them to exterminate Tutsis.  Is it not a trifle ludicrous in the light of the evidence that you've seen?  
The importance of this evidence is not just that it refutes the allegations lock, stock and barrel, made, that is, by the Prosecution, but that, if accepted, that evidence, naturally compellingly, leads to one conclusion.  But there's little room here amongst those first four Prosecution witnesses who claim Rwamakuba was in Gikomero -- there's little room here for simple mistake.  They're either telling the truth or they are lying, and the Defence submit the latter.  Of course, we don't have to establish that they were lying.  We need only raise a doubt in your minds as to whether they were reliable.  But if they were lying, and if that is correct, and in our submission it is, it demonstrates right at the outset of the case a state of affairs that we might have thought a little improbable in a Court at this level.  After all, the Statute of this Court establishes this Tribunal for "the Prosecution of persons responsible for genocide."  There's no "allegedly" there, we all know.  But it goes on -- or, essentially, the function is -- of the Prosecutor to arraign here those who are most responsible.  

Now, I remember shortly after I was appointed, back in 1999, to represent Rwamakuba, being asked by a high court judge in England what I was doing and mentioning defending an Accused here.  And he said, "But they're all guilty, aren't they?"  Like many, I may have thought then that he was probably right, or he should have been.  

Surely, after scrutiny and study, the Prosecutor could not rely on consecutive untruthful witnesses in a case.  It would go beyond my experience, perhaps all our experience, for that to be the case.  And yet here, with the first four witnesses, we submit exactly that has happened.  And it is extraordinary.  And the Defence submit that they weren't alone in this case.  Witness after witness entered the witness box, we submit, with the intention of misleading you, the Judges, and of bringing false testimony against Dr. Rwamakuba.  We don't have to pitch our case as high as that, but if it is there, then it should be stated and not ignored.  

Why would they want to do that?  Every witness called by the Prosecution was Tutsi.  We called Tutsis, as well, but every one of their witnesses was Tutsi.  Many had terrible experiences in surviving the genocide, particularly those from the hospital.  With the Gikomero witnesses, most of them had left the commune at an early stage.  It may be, and some Defence witnesses alleged, including Tutsi survivors who came to give evidence for the Defence, that some of the Prosecution witnesses for Gikomero played a part in later excesses by the RPF of killing of Hutu by Tutsis, of looting and other excesses.  

There's evidence in this case, as you've heard, that a number of Tutsis in Gikomero set out to target Hutu intellectuals and to make false allegations against many others.  I'm sure this may have been motivated much by revenge.  It may have been motivated by other base motives.  It may be to cover up their own excesses and to silence those who would come forward against them.  It may have been and remain a demonstration of power and control.  
The Prosecution devote some time in their brief, and it was mentioned again this afternoon, to our surprise, that the Defence introduced the RPF excesses as some kind of defence of provocation or self defence.  We didn't.  There's no possible defence to genocide.  It was introduced as part of the picture, and it may have involved acts by Prosecution witnesses and it may be -- or have afforded a motive for them not to tell the truth and not to be frank with the Court.  It is also, if such excesses occurred, a useful indicator of the frankness and veracity of those Prosecution witnesses, all of whom denied all knowledge of such excesses, then or now.  

With the Butare witnesses, the situation is even stranger.  Not only are they all Tutsi, but they've all got jobs since the genocide, and you know where.  There was evidence from a number of Defence witnesses, including Tutsi survivors, people who had lost most of their families in the genocide, Tutsis, that the Prosecution witnesses, these Prosecution witnesses, were effectively a clique willing to give false testimony.  It would seem that they had profited from doing so.  

Interestingly, when they joined to give evidence against one doctor in Rwanda, Dr. Twagirayezu, whose judgement you've got in various procès-verbal statements, when they gave or sought to give, or gave evidence against him, he is acquitted, their evidence disbelieved and rejected, and that in Rwanda.  

The Defence are reluctant to go further into this.  We would submit, however, that there may be -- or it may be -- that there are interests or powers today in Rwanda that support these false witnesses.  It's difficult, we submit, to see how, if we are right in our submission, they could act as they do, were they not, in fact, to receive higher support from higher authority.  

We would also stress that while we as a Defence team have met and continue to meet undoubted difficulties, difficulties, for example, in conducting our investigations within Rwanda, we would like to put on record the fact that we've also met young professionals within the criminal justice system there that are a credit to any country.  Unfortunately, there remain some who are not.  

I do not review those four witnesses further, though there are comments aplenty in the written argument about them.  But perhaps one point, because it's from amongst those witnesses that evidence -- or alleged evidence of allegations against Rwamakuba come in respect to those broadcasts.  Well, obviously, if those witnesses are, in your view, discredited in respect of their seeing Rwamakuba on those visits, then, logically, they'd be discredited on the broadcasts.  But, even so, we note that the Prosecution have produced no tape or transcript that stands to Rwamakuba's discredit in this case.  

Where we have a transcript that relates to an alleged incident, an alleged inciteful broadcast, that is, where a Prosecution witness is claiming at such-and-such a time Rwamakuba made such an inciteful broadcast, and we have the transcript, well, it flatly contradicts the witness.  All his recorded broadcasts essentially call for peace and calm.  

Ndatemwa:  Three Prosecution witnesses here, none of them know Rwamakuba, and all say he was identified to them by an unknown or an unavailable informant.  And we raise the issue of the weight and reliability of such evidence in our preliminary arguments of law in our submission.  There's only one description from these witnesses, and that is the description given you by GII, who describes the man he saw as, "a solid man with glasses."  And we say that man, if he existed at all, just cannot be Rwamakuba.  The evidence of these Ndatemwa witnesses is thick with inconsistencies, and all those consistencies are paraded, in part, in the written argument.  

And I pass from them to the Defence witnesses who, in contradiction to them, for example, you heard number 9.20, a Tutsi survivor who lost family in the genocide.  She doesn't know Rwamakuba.  She has no interest in him.  ****************************************.  She was there all those days.  And she told you that no one came -- no one like him came.  And in the 11 years since then, she's never heard him spoken about by anyone, generally, or in the Gacaca courts, not even by the Prosecution witnesses.  She added that she knew those three Prosecution witnesses, and they'd gone and left by the time of the relevant events.  

And you may recall that the Prosecution in this case sought to discredit that Tutsi survivor by a spurious allegation that, as it turned out, concerned someone living on the other side of Rwanda and not that other person.  

It is of interest that in questioning her what emerged from that witness was that the man who she said and was talking about, she'd last seen being marched away in a column of 500 men by the RPF, marched away from their displaced person's camp that was managed by the RPF.  Five hundred men marched away and only one of them ever came back. 

Well, Ndatemwa, it's dealt with at length in our brief and noting the time, I move on.  Just before I leave it, I'd better mention ********** because, unlike the Tutsi survivor, he came from the other side, didn't he, of the divide?  He came from prison, where he's held as a genocidaire, although he's untried -- though he's untried and proclaiming his innocence, even at the price, he told us, as appears to be the case, that it's preventing his release.  And he's the one Rwamakuba was alleged to have delivered machetes to, and he told us a lot, and I don't repeat it all, but -- and this is uncontradicted, he told us that the serious allegation of distribution of weapons was something that had never been alleged against him.  

All the post-6th of April allegations in Gikomero are, we submit, unlikely to have occurred because access was not feasible.  And I'll deal with this briefly.  It's dealt with in much greater length, as you know, in the closing brief.  We hear from the Prosecution eight or nine routes.  Is that a misunderstanding on the part of the Prosecution, or is it misleading?  There are four routes to Gikomero, we assert.  We were told that by Defence witnesses, that they were cut by the fighting and the occupation of key areas by Inkotanyi forces.  The latter displayed, of course, exceptional strategic abilities during that war, and it was a necessary aspect of that strategic ability that they invested the area around Gikomero to protect their routes and lines of communication, to link up with their forces embattled at the CND.  

Remera was taken as early as the 8th and all the routes from the eastern side of Kigali passed through Remera, just as going up the arm to the hand, you have to pass the wrist.  

The route to Bumbogo, via Deutsch Welle, passed right by the CND, overflowing with RPF troops on the 7th of April.  The main Byumba road was controlled, in our submission, by the 9th and Nyacyonga was taken by the 11th.  Rutunga was occupied by the 8th, all along the main Byumba road there.  And you received direct eyewitness account of that.  The start of the Byumba road is Gatsatsa. It passes up, as you know, past Gisozi.  And Witness 3.10 -- sorry, Witness 3.4 told you that was the first place he went to try and get home, and he couldn't.  There was fighting and shooting.  

Now, we submit that it's been plain to the Prosecution for at least two years that this issue of access was a significant issue in the case.  We don't have a burden on the Defence here to prove a lack of access.  We raise it, and it's for the Prosecution to prove that there was access.  In their argument they talk of nine routes, but that is misleading, for, in our submission, the simple reason that their further suggested routes are just extensions of the four primary routes.  

The Prosecution has had every opportunity to demonstrate what the alternative routes may be, both on the judicial view and also with the Defence witnesses.  You may recall one of those Defence witnesses actually saying to counsel for the Prosecution, "Well, if you're saying there's another route, which is it?  Tell me.  I will deal with it."  And of answer came none.  So there's the Prosecution position; in our submission, a duty to explore, if there is one, with a witness, an alternative route.  We say, given that state of evidence, the Prosecution have not proved their case on a crucial aspect.  

If you are left with a doubt as to whether access was feasible, and then you should give that doubt obviously to the Accused.  And, in any event, whatever the physical circumstances might be, at Remera, for example, wherever, we ask you to ask yourselves as a matter of common sense:  Is it likely, given the circumstances as you know them to be, with the fighting after the 7th of April, that Rwamakuba would place himself at risk with the Inkotanyi in the shrubbery, to go up there at all, to tootle about in a white car like Noddy -- "Oui-Oui," I understand in French -- driving about, all that risk, all the way through to the Kayanga incident, without a bodyguard, without an escort, or at all?  You've heard how many were dead in Remera.  You've had names.  

Gikomero secteur:  Witness GIN is the sole witness, and her evidence is very extensively reviewed.  She gave a fundamentally different account of both Rwamakuba, her knowledge of him and how she came by it, the events in her written statement to account in her testimony.  

Let me say that again.  We've got different accounts of her knowledge and a basis of knowledge for Rwamakuba, and the most striking feature, inexplicable feature, in our submission, of her evidence is the complete sea change of her account between her written statement and her testimony.  It's not a matter of detail; it's a complete change in the whole thrust of her story, of its logic, of the internal consistency of her account, fundamental.  

She provides a different date, perhaps because she'd got wind that the 12th of April was not a good date to have Rwamakuba there because he would have had a ready-made alibi by the Prosecution, with their assertion that he, of course, was on his way to Gitarama with a change -- with the movement of the government on that day.  It nevertheless demonstrates - or, the Prosecution indictment demonstrates the difficulty that they found themselves in, because if you look at the indictment, Rwamakuba is, on the face of it, charged with inciting the events at the Protestant Gikomero secteur school.  It's still there.  Well, that couldn't be the case because, of course, GIN has altered her evidence now.  That was, perhaps, the case in her statement, but now, now, of course, Rwamakuba can't appear until some days after the date of the school massacre, which we all know now is the 12th, and that's been admitted by the Prosecution now. 

We have a description of Rwamakuba, plainly not him.  She dresses him in MRND colours, and she has him giving the green light, as she put it in her statement, to the start of the genocide in Gikomero secteur, when now she tells us the place was littered with bodies and that were 4,000 dead at the school.  And there were many more significant differences in her various stories and no reasonable explanation to account for them.  She is, in our submission, a manifestly unreliable witness, and she's further discredited by her recent murder conviction for something, nothing to do with the events that we're concerned with here, a murder committed a few years ago; and also by a close companion's testimony, a witness who was a Tutsi and who told you that he'd been present when GIN and others set about -- began fabricating evidence against intellectuals in Gikomero commune.  She's the only one who has come to give evidence about those events in Gikomero secteur.  

The Defence called eight witnesses from Gikomero who gave you and testified to a very different history of events, and to the absence of Rwamakuba.  Rwamakuba, they said, played no part.  None of them had heard that Rwamakuba was alleged by anyone in the area that Rwamakuba had come there, either generally or in conversation, or in Gacaca hearings, and that's uncontroverted.  None of them supported the account of Witness GIN, and several testified to you that she was an unreliable, an untrustworthy witness, and two testified to her being not in Gikomero secteur at all, but down at Kibobo at the time the events occurred.  She was found to be a credible witness in Kamuhanda, but, with respect, that is no reason for her getting away with it again.  Kayanga:  She also provided evidence relating to Rwamakuba going to Kayanga several days later, despite saying in her statement that after the 12th she never saw him again, and despite the fact -- or, the fact stands that she only mentioned the Kayanga incident very, very late, as you know; in April 2004, first mention ever of it.  I don't repeat the general criticisms made above or in the brief at length.  

Kayanga:  Witness GAC gave evidence of arms distribution.  His evidence is much reviewed in the written brief.  We cannot for a moment accept the Prosecution's statement of a while ago that his evidence remained untouched.  His evidence, in our submission, was a disaster, with wide variations of account and unreliability, all out of his own mouth.  It doesn't need a gloss from counsel.  He didn't mention Rwamakuba until very recently, even though he gave evidence in Kamuhanda on the identical subject and had given evidence not only on an identical subject in Kamuhanda but over the same period of time, a parallel story within the same place.  When he comes to this trial, it's almost as if he just swaps Rwamakuba's name for Kamuhanda.  

He was disbelieved by the Tribunal in Kamuhanda.  They didn't believe his story.  They rejected it.  But he's been dusted down by the Prosecution and brought out for you, and we submit he deserves to be disbelieved again.  

Witness GAB is another witness who arrived before you wholly discredited, having also been disbelieved on his oath in respect of his evidence in Kamuhanda.  Again, we deal with him at length and make submissions in respect of him at length in our closing brief.  Again, as with GAC, the Prosecution went to GAB in November 2004, after he was disbelieved in Kamuhanda, that is.  And he then mentions Rwamakuba for the first time in any account he had ever given.  

He was, poor boy, only 17 at the time of the genocide.  He suffered appallingly.  His mother, his father, his brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts and cousins were all butchered.  His account of all that is different, of course, in his statements and in Kamuhanda, but I don't dwell on it.  He said in our trial that he witnessed Rwamakuba come to the health centre and supervise the murder of hundreds, including many of his relatives.  In fact, he said this was the only time in the genocide, in the war, that he saw anyone killed.  So it's the more remarkable that he never, ever mentioned the incident until the Prosecution approached him post-Kamuhanda, post his account in Kamuhanda, and asked him about Rwamakuba.  He is, we submit, a further demonstrably unreliable witness.  

The Prosecution, incidentally, have said in their brief and repeated this afternoon, **************************************************************.  But their own witness, another witness, whose pseudonym escapes me -- I won't mention his name -- told you and wrote down a list of people he said had survived the killings.  There was one who wrote down a list, and it turned out they were living there; there was another one who said he could name those who did survive.  If I'm wrong about that -- I see my friend shaking her head -- I stand corrected.  But you have the evidence and it can be checked.  

The Defence produced several eyewitnesses to the events at the health centre who were ipso facto survivors.  So it's not right to say that they were not survivors.  And the fact that they were survivors and were present there was never challenged.  They gave their evidence.  It was never put or suggested to them that they weren't there.  

One of those witnesses was a Tutsi.  She suffered dreadfully.  You heard her story, running from pillar to post, separated from her family, uncles and nephews and cousins murdered; a young boy murdered in front of her, escaping shell fire; falling into the Kayanga health centre, witnessing the killings there; waiting to be taken herself; then joined by another relative, as you heard, and witnessing the final killing of the Pentecostalists who were there; and eventually being saved by the RPF soldiers who arrived.  And then having to suffer the separation that she did, which I won't go into.  

She saw what happened.  What motive does she have to mislead you, the Judges?  And she said Rwamakuba was not there and she said she had never heard it claimed that he was there, in 11 years.  

You heard from a principal genocidaire in Gikomero.  He told you Rwamakuba played no part in any of it.  He wasn't asked; it wasn't put to him when he gave evidence that Rwamakuba wasn't at Kayanga, that Rwamakuba wasn't at Gikomero secteur, both places in which the Prosecution assert that witness was.  It wasn't put to him.  What was put to him were his previous statements, procès-verbal statements, that he had made to Rwandan authorities, where he quite plainly, in our submission, had been hedging his bets -- not quite hedging his bets; it's the wrong phrase.  He was playing the system, year by year, admitting as little or as much as he had to in order to put himself in a good light with the authorities.  

But what was most interesting about those statements was that this man who wanted to play the system, who wanted to put himself in the best light as possible, had the opportunity to say, "Well, goodness me, there was a minister there called Rwamakuba," doesn't mention Rwamakuba.  Not only that, neither do the authorities ever suggest to him that Rwamakuba played a part.  He's absent from any of those procès-verbal questions, and that's is a very significant point, you might think.  

Again, we remind you the date of the massacre is about the 15th of April and we again stress the unlikelihood of travel and access to that place.  

And, finally, Butare.  There were six Prosecution witnesses, and I'll deal with them as briefly as I can.  It's all set down in the brief.  But, for the record, and in public, it's right that I should say perhaps just a few things.  They're all survivors; they've all got jobs in a certain place since a certain time, as you know.  They're said by some witnesses to be part of a clique that comes to mislead this Court and others, others in Rwanda.  We've commented on that already.  Many of them displayed a striking lack of frankness, in our submission, as to their knowledge of other Prosecution witnesses, part of that clique, we suggest, and were contradicted both by their own previous statements and also by later witnesses.  

So those are the sources of these appalling allegations against Dr. Rwamakuba.  There's no other voice, no doctor, no nurse.  We know various reports have been made:  Médecins sans frontières, admitted by the Prosecution or put into evidence; Des Forges; amnesty reports.  No suggestion that Rwamakuba features in any of them.  You bear in mind who and what he was in April of 1994 in the hierarchy of this country.  All but one of these Prosecution Butare witnesses say they didn't know Rwamakuba from Adam before the genocide, and the one who does, and who I deal with briefly now, was XV.  

He's very significant because he provided the basis for no less than three of the six witnesses as to their being able to say it was Rwamakuba.  He provided them with the name:  "That man is called Rwamakuba."  RJ, GIO and HF all get their identification of Rwamakuba from him.  If he goes, he goes and he takes three with him as witnesses.  So he's significant.  

And he said he knew Rwamakuba.  I'm not going to go through the discrepancies of accounts.  It would take a very long time.  They're in the written argument, and others that you know.  But he accepted he knew Rwamakuba from the time when Rwamakuba was a student at the university.  He didn't seem to quite know the dates, you might recall.  But, for us, and perhaps for you, the most illuminating aspect of his evidence is his firm assertion that he next saw Rwamakuba in late 1993, following an MDR meeting where he saw him at a place called the Dancing Bar, and again he saw him, and very specifically and firmly said, in January at a rally in Huye, which is part of Butare.  And Rwamakuba, incidentally, as you know, had no connection with Butare.  He hadn't had any connection to Butare since he'd left with his medical diploma.  
So, was XV right when he said Rwamakuba was there at the end of '93 and in January?  We say he was in Belgium and that the evidence, in our submission, couldn't be better that he was.  So, if he was in Belgium, who's XV talking about?  

He describes André Rwamakuba, the man he recognised, as having thick glasses.  He thought the photograph of the priest looked just like Rwamakuba, and you know how thick those glasses were.  Well, on those three aspects -- dancing club, Huye and the photo -- set against, we say, compelling evidence in relation to Belgium, Witness XV's evidence should rightly fall and with it, of course, that of the other three witnesses.  

He first mentioned Rwamakuba in 2003, nine years after the events, and after XV had given 11 separate accounts of events in Butare, without mentioning Rwamakuba.  In his first statement he did mention Rwamakuba, the Rwamakuba from Huye.  You may remember, the sous-lieutenant in the Kayanga regime, a completely different man.  And you'll have in mind also of course what he said to the Defence investigator, which is a document that came lately to be admitted -- I don't know its number.  I haven't referred to it by number in the closing brief -- but we ask you to also pay attention to that.  

While at the hospital, XV said that he experienced what was, for him, the most traumatic incident that befell him in the genocide, and that was attempted abduction to his death by André Rwamakuba.  And the very first time he mentions this dramatic event is, as you know, in the will-say made two days before he gave his evidence and after 11 separate accounts that he'd given of his time in the hospital.  He had, in fact, been withdrawn as a Prosecution witness.  He had featured in an earlier and previous witness list, but he was withdrawn, perhaps for a very good reason and sense.  And then he was put back on the list for this trial, perhaps because the Prosecution became aware that other witnesses were claiming he was their source for naming Rwamakuba.  

RJ:  She suffered greatly in the genocide.  And may I say that the suffering of the witnesses, we don't lose sight of.  Perhaps, at root, that's their motivation to come and give this kind of evidence, that their motivation perhaps is rooted in those experiences.  She claims to have seen Rwamakuba at the hospital on several occasions and also at the préfectoral offices, and she bases her evidence, her identification, on XV.  There's also a Hutu woman, of course, but it doesn't matter.  If it's XV who confirms that that's the man, then the Hutu woman's evidence doesn't - or, identification adds nothing.  If XV is wrong, as we've said, we plainly submit that he is, then her evidence falls, too, on that point alone.  
But there's so many differences of account, and the Prosecution in their brief seem to suggest that we should overlook discrepancies of account.  There's a lot about "Look at the global picture."  Well, we accept there's going to be discrepancies, and we hope that we haven't overdwelt in our treatment of witnesses with fine detail.  We accept that over 11 years and with people subjected to trauma, there's bound to be differences.  But it's a matter of fact and degree, and with these witnesses the differences of account become so striking that they cannot be explained away by such excuses as failure of memory and the rest, or by blaming incompetent investigators or inadequate court reporting.  And it's important that these discrepancies of account be seen in a context of a trial, and a trial where the Accused, through his plea and through his instructions and our manifestation of those instructions, denies that he did these things.  

So, differences of account by someone who claims she saw him and remembers particular incidents take on a deeper significance if set against that backdrop that here's a man saying it's all untrue.  After all, it's easier to recall that which is true than that which didn't happen, and consistency of account is often -- not always, but often -- an indicator of reliability.  

Well, RJ's evidence is reviewed at length elsewhere.  There's so many differences, and not ones that, in our submission, can be explained away or overlooked.  She's made 11 statements, either for here or for cases in Rwanda.  She gave evidence before, here, in this case which was, as you know, restarted, and four times in Rwanda.  And she was, incidentally, one of those witnesses who was disbelieved on her oath by the Rwandan court in the Twagirayezu case.  When she came here, she knew the problem she faced.  She knew from the experience of that first trial that we had, as it were, something up our sleeve, and that something were her previous statements, her previous procès-verbal statements.  So she adopted the employ of not recognising her signature on Rwandan court documents. 

In the Gatera case, she said it was a false signature.  She then accepted it was her signature.  That was the case, you may recall, where she said Gatera sent soldiers in to her and they broke her spine.  Her statement in the Twagiramungu case, where she was disbelieved on her oath, that, she said, was an imitation signature, and then she accepted that it was hers.  In that statement, her story is it's Gatera and Twagirayezu who take people away.  And she says in that statement she found her elder sister in maternity, who was taken away, too, someone who had never featured in any of her accounts.  She denies she ever said that about her elder sister; that was a mistake by the Rwandan court.  

Rwamakuba, by the way, here, makes a brief cameo appearance saying -- and we heard the words from my friend this afternoon -- "Look at the world for the last time."  I should mention here that in her procès-verbal in Gatera, she says Gatera said, "Look at the world for the last time."  In the Kageruka case, her sister is again taken away, so it doesn't look as if that was the mistake as she claimed, and it's Kageruka who says, "Look at the world for the last time."  

Well, there are too many differences and evasions to go through now, and I hope we've done an appropriate job in the closing brief in drawing your attention to those matters with that witness and others that lead, we submit, to one compelling conclusion.  

Witness GIO:  Now, her account, she agreed, was very straightforward.  She flees to the hospital.  After three days Rwamakuba asks her brother, who she's fled with, for his ID, and Gatera kills her brother with an axe.  Rwamakuba she names because he was named to her and identified to her by RJ, who got it off XV.  So that's the line there:  XV goes; RJ goes; GIO goes.  But just think of that story.  It's simple, isn't it?  "We fled to the hospital, me and my brother.  My brother was wounded.  After three days, Gatera and Rwamakuba came.  Rwamakuba asked for his ID.  Gatera killed him with an axe."  And central to the story is the axe attack.  It couldn't be more central, could it?  

Well, she made a statement in 1997 against Rwamakuba.  It's very detailed, and you have it.  There's no mention of an axe attacked -- an axe attack.  There's no attack at all.  What she said there was that her brother was loaded up on to a lorry, alive, with her father -- though that's changed -- and driven away.  Was that an incompetent investigator?  Well, no, because she gave evidence, on oath, here in Arusha in 2003 in the first trial.  No mention of an axe attack or any other kind of attack.  Her brother is again loaded up into a pickup and driven off and not killed at all.  

"A.	Yes, they were compelled to get into the vehicle, into the pickup.  
Q. 	Was your brother among these people?  
A. 	Yes, he was among them."  

And just to make it clear, she then said:  
"Q. 	Have you ever made an allegation that anyone killed your poor brother who fled with you to the hospital, at the hospital with an axe?  Yes or no?  
A.	I never saw my brother being killed by an axe.  I don't know where you're getting this information from."  

Well, it couldn't be plainer, could it?  But, perhaps, in putting those questions to her -- almost certainly -- the alarm bell rang in that witness's mind.  We had her previous statements elsewhere, her Rwanda story which was different.  There, of course, Gatera kills the brother with an axe.  

Twagirayezu:  She gave a procès-verbal statement in which she says, "He came with a worker " -- this is Twagirayezu - "He came with a worker called Athanase.  I don't know where he is now.  When they arrived, Dr. Gatera ordered the worker to kill him, and he executed the order and killed him with an axe."  So there we have the brother being killed at Gatera's behest by a hospital worker.  
So, what's changed between that first trial with Rwamakuba loaded into the pickup and that completely different story that she tells you, the Judges in this trial, her Arusha story versus her Rwanda story?  What's she to do?  Is she going to give up her per diem allowance?  She comes here, she gives evidence and she has to try and cobble these two mutually-opposed accounts together.  And it's not really possible, is it?  Now, is this the kind of discrepancies that the Prosecution are inviting you to overlook?  

ALW:  Again, a simple story, and we've only got one witness to go.  Rwamakuba came and hit five bedridden women on their heads with his axe.  

Are you all right, Madam Judge?  
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
I'll just stand up. 
MR. HOOPER:
I don't mind stopping for five minutes.
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
No, it's okay.
MR. HOOPER:  
All right.  Very well.

ALW, I was talking about, a simple story.  I'll bring it to mind.  Rwamakuba comes.  She's there with her auntie in the hospital.  They're in a ward.  Rwamakuba comes with five -- and kills five women there with his axe, hits them on the head with the axe.  Two days later she sees Rwamakuba go up to two men from Runyinya, and Rwamakuba, without saying very much, goes up to them and strikes them both dead, hitting them on the head with his axe.  That's an improbable story, you might think.  It's improbable that she would make her excuses to go to the loo, as she said, and picking up her aunt, both of them Tutsis, make her excuses, "I've got to go to the loo," and leave after the ID has been handed in.  And when it's obvious they're Tutsis, swathed in bandages, as they are, it's extraordinary that nobody else, in the history of the events at the hospital that we've heard, has ever referred to anything like that.  And it's such a dramatic event, how has it escaped everyone's attention?  

Well, she was caught out, of course, by her evidence in the Gatera case, where she again made a procès-verbal statement and gave evidence.  I'll just read four lines of it:  "I only saw three men who were killed by him."  She's talking of Gatera.  "They were from Runyinya, two of them brought to the hospital, a certain Kazasomaho, Innocent.  Upon their arrival Gatera, accompanied by soldiers, stabbed them with bayonets and he beat them with a small club, saying that their time had come.  They then took them beside the medicine intern block in order to kill them." 
So, how more of a contrasting story could one have?  And this, again, something the Prosecution are suggesting is a discrepancy to be laid to one side.  Or is it, rather, something that goes right to the heart of the witness's testimony and that demonstrates that she's lied?  

The Defence called Witnesses 9.17 and 9.31:  Both of them were Tutsis, both of them women, both of them had suffered terrible loss in the genocide, both were in the hospital, and they told you they knew, because they were related to the two men from Runyinya and saw them and another taken away to their deaths towards the end of May, and that is something they witnessed.  Nothing like ALW's account.  ALW lied, in our submission.  

ALV, to bring to mind, she's the one who saw her daddy taken away to be killed.  She was only 16.  She made a statement in which she related, in a clear and articulate manner, her account of events.  She made that statement in November of 2000.  She told you there -- says in her statement there how she followed her father from Sister Théopiste, where he had been taken by soldiers, two soldiers, followed him down those corridors that you visited in your visit to the hospital, towards maternity, and just as they got to maternity, her father turned to her and indicated with a wave of his hand, and she realised if she went any further she was at risk, and she turned and left.  That's her story there, as clear as a bell.  

In November 2003, three years after making that statement, she's asked, and she can't tell us why she was approached again -- but she's asked to make a second statement in which, this time, Rwamakuba appears as a significant figure.  Now her story is that as her father passes her, as she's in surgery, she follows.  Just as they get down towards maternity, she is struck a blow with an axe held by Rwamakuba, so hard a blow that she's still got a mark today.  And that's why she doesn't follow her father.  Is this the kind of discrepancy the Prosecution invite you to ignore? 

I won't go into the other accounts which are dramatically different as to how long she's at the hospital and what happens after that.  It's in the brief.  But you may recall that when, in fact, we put those matters to her in the witness box, that poor young girl could only turn away, turn away from the questions and remain silent.  There was no answer.  

HF:  Again, a tragic but a straightforward story, and the last of the witnesses on Butare.  What's her story?  You may recall.  She's looking after her pregnant sister at the hospital and they're overtaken by the genocide.  Her brother is brought to the hospital, wounded.  Her brother and her sister are loaded up on a pickup by Rwamakuba.  They disappear and are never seen again.  She's another one whose identification is based entirely on Witness RJ, who got hers from XV, and if XV is wrong, et cetera.  
I pass over the very many different aspects of her accounts, some bigger than others, including the variation of account where her brother and sister are actually killed in the hospital beds, or Rwamakuba in banana leaves and shorts down to his knees, or, alternatively, in a bright yellow track suit.  

I make three points now in respect of HF, and a lot more in the closing brief.  Firstly, her evidence is clear that she's at the hospital until the 28th of April.  But she's provided statements in other cases, quite a lot of them.  And she provided a tailor-made statement for Kanyabashi.  You've seen it.  She says that she was taken from the préfecture building with others to the Kabakobwe valley and there she stayed a night, and then Kanyabashi, Shalom, Nyiramasuhuko, the Butare people -- but Kanyabashi, principally, arrives, and with a wave of his hand, he starts the massacre.  

Kabakobwe is an enormous massacre and it was, quite plainly, a massacre that occurred on the 22nd of April 1994, so says the indictment in the Butare case, and though I know, Mr. President, you and your Brother Judges didn't feel -- and if we can say so correctly that it was a matter that was capable of being taken judicial notice of, it nevertheless remains that there is much -- or, very good support also for the 22nd of April, not only from the indictment, but from Des Forges in her exhaustive review of events in Butare.  And you may recall she got a lot of her knowledge from her resources, from her research itself in Butare and she places it on the 22nd, and that's a Prosecution exhibit.  

What astounds us is the silence of the Prosecution on this matter, which is a matter that concerns you and justice.  Why haven't they admitted it?  And if they haven't admitted it, why haven't they put forward an alternative date?  How does this help -- help this Tribunal?  

HF, at Kabakobwe on the 22nd of April, when she's at the hospital after that, apparently seeing Rwamakuba, and doesn't leave until the 28th.  Defence witnesses, Tutsis, said she was never there.  Secondly, in respect of HF, the Gatera case, when she was first shown the signature on the procès-verbal statement, she said, "This is not my signature.  My signature has been forged.  No, I don't even need to read this document.  It's a fake.  It's not true so I cannot possibly read such a document."  And in the first trial she effectively stopped all further questions by that posture.  She now accepts it's her statement.  

She said in Gatera that it was Gatera who selected and took her sister, and there's no mention of Rwamakuba.  Not only that, it's a different sister, with a different name.  She said that it was a court error.  Thirdly, the Sahera case and judgement, and there she says quite plainly that her sister was abducted -- I'll start again.  We know that her position here is that she says that her sister was abducted by Rwamakuba, or killed in her bed by Rwamakuba, one of the two.  In Sahera, as you've seen from her procès-verbal statement and extracts of her evidence before the Rwandan court in the Sahera case, she in fact said that the sister was killed several miles away in Sahera by someone completely different who, in fact, shot her -- obviously, shot her with a gun.  
When she first appeared here in 2004 she was asked whether she'd ever alleged against another man that he had killed a sister -- a sister.  She said no.  And the Court documents you've seen, and which she accepts, prove a lie there.  She was in a bit of a tight spot, wasn't she, when she gave evidence, confronted with these different accounts?  

She said the name of her sister in the Rwandan document was a mistake, but she had a sister with a similar name.  But HF didn't quite have the footwork in the witness box and she forgot to change the Christian or forename and she ended up, as a result, having two sisters with the same Christian or forename.  Then she said, well, they were twins and it's not uncommon in Rwanda to name twins with the same name, which is a laughable prospect.  And you heard from the lady, Tutsi lady, whose twin children were murdered at the hospital, or at the préfecture, and one taken from the hospital.  She knew something about twins, and you heard her response about that.  

So, there you have it:  two sisters with the same name.  And, again, is that the kind of discrepancy that the Prosecution are asking you to push to the side of the plate?  And there's very much more in her account.  

We accept that they all suffered hurt and grief, a depth of suffering that's -- we don't say this glibly -- difficult to imagine.  And we have said, and say, that perhaps their motives for coming here to mislead you are rooted in that experience.  It may be that there's a perception, or even an instruction, that Rwamakuba was a genocidaire and they feel it their duty to provide the evidence that is otherwise lacking.  As one of them said, "I am a patriot."  They are, as it were, lying for justice, but we dispute their premise.  

You heard from Defence witnesses in respect of Butare who were drawn from both the Hutu and the Tutsi community.  Some were survivors who suffered appallingly and had no discernible interest to serve in testifying here, except perhaps that they were annoyed that others lied.  And the crux of all their evidence -- and they were there in the hospital for several months -- is that they didn't hear, ever, of Rwamakuba coming to the hospital or his participation in killing.  They didn't hear then and they haven't heard of it for 11 years since.  

Compared to the Prosecution witnesses' testimony, where he's a central, dominating, persistent and, in fact, bloody aggressor known to all, contrast couldn't be greater.  It's not explained by the fact that they were in different departments at different times.  That is not a sufficient explanation, in our submission.  How could those Defence witnesses have missed seeing him or hearing about him then, or since, over all those years?  And they also testify against another tenet in the Prosecution's witnesses' account, that doctors themselves killed in the hospital.  They're uniform.  Even those who blame the doctor, like the poor woman who went there whose daughter died because she said Gatera neglected her, and she gave evidence against Gatera, doesn't say that doctors killed in the hospital.  Their criticism is that they, or some of them, knew, and perhaps even helped, patients being taken.  

Those witnesses also testified as to the existence of a clique in Butare who lied and made false allegations, and they also said that many or most of the Prosecution witnesses were part of that clique.  They also said that they'd attended Gacaca.  The document produced by the Prosecution is a fraud, in our submission, dated the 25th of January, the Mamba document.  And what is contained in it but allegations against every Defence witness, so transparent it was extraordinary to behold?  And who is there as the lady of integrity on the Gacaca Mamba court but RO, a witness called in the first trial, abandoned by the Prosecution, and alleged by Tutsi survivors to be head of a clique of liars?  

You also heard from (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  Scrub that, please.  You also heard from two further witnesses, and those witnesses who were present and who know that place, that hospital, like the back of their hands, and since.  You've heard their evidence in respect of the presence of Rwamakuba.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We order the redaction of the profession of the -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you.  

Finally, really a matter for you, is the alibi in Gisenyi.  Because the witnesses were close to Rwamakuba does not mean that they are not capable of telling you the truth.  And the kind of situation the Accused was in, if he was there in Gisenyi with these people, well, who else can he call but them?  A relative, in our submission, is not to be distinguished from any other kind of witness, though it's obviously the case in common sense that their interests as, perhaps, a relative are such that they merit extra care, but if you think what they say may be right, then you should act on that.  

Interestingly, though they were in a position perhaps to -- if they were willing to lie, they could have given Rwamakuba a complete alibi, that he was in Gisenyi every day.  But they didn't.  They told you:  He was leaving in the morning on several days and coming back just as dusk fell, giving him the whole day without an alibi.  Is that a lying witness?  We submit that, in practical terms, it would be unlikely that he could have got to Butare and back so often with such regularity on the total picture that's painted by Prosecution witnesses.  He must have been there morning and afternoon, nearly every day.  

Gisenyi to Butare, return, is just under 500 kilometres, and you can see that figure within the exhibits, the maps, where distances are given between principal towns.  That's 500 kilometres with a hot war on and with drunk and drugged Interahamwe and all those your uncertainties, 500 kilometres.

Finally, may we remind you to bear strict adherence to the dates on the indictment?  With Butare, it's confined, for example, to the 20th to the 30th of April, and also in Gikomero allegations where a date is provided.  

So, here we are then, much later than we thought, almost eight o'clock.  We're at the end of what, for us, the advocates for the Defence, has been a remarkable experience.  We have confronted a Prosecution case that has, in our submission, deeply worrying aspects.  We have met pressure from certain sources that we did not anticipate.  We've heard Defence witnesses who have displayed great courage in coming before you, Tutsis victims who suffered so much.  You may remember the lady with the deep machete scar across her face.  Nothing has touched Rwamakuba more than meeting those Tutsis.  

And, very finally, above the magistrate's bench in ancient Rome were inscribed the words fiat justicia ruat caelum, a phrase highly apposite now, nearly 2,000 years later, and perhaps a fitting headnote to our submission, reading, as you know, "Let justice be done, though the heavens fall."  I know it's not inscribed above you, but we know it's a sentiment in your hearts, and I believe André Rwamakuba has come to believe that is true.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the Bench does not have any questions for either counsel, and we take it that this is the end of the closing arguments on both sides.  This is the end of the closing arguments on both sides?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Can I also extend our thanks to the Prosecution for their assistance in this case?  It hasn't always been an easy route, but we got here in the end.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, this is the end of the case in a practical sense because the only thing left is for us to consider our decision now, and we embark upon that exercise with care and dispatch.  

From the Bench, we, too, would like to express our thanks to counsel on both sides for their presentation of this case.  We think that they've observed the high traditions and ethics of the profession, and we appreciate the way in which the cases has been presented and the way in which the trial has been conducted.  

We also like to thank the court staff, all aspects of the court staff, whose service has been really outstanding and remarkable.  The latest example of that has been what happened this afternoon, staying here until eight o'clock on Friday, when everybody knows that the Tribunal shuts down at two o'clock.  So we express our appreciation, not only for today but for the entire conduct of the trial.  

I'm being prodded by my colleague on the Bench to also thank the general public for the interest that they have shown, and we note that you have stayed until eight o'clock tonight.  We've had our public with us for the entire trial.  Without further -- without further ado -- sorry, Mr. Registrar.  

Well, in closing this session, I will just indicate that the registrar will inform the parties of the appearance date for judgement delivery.  We are unable at this stage to give any particular time window in which that will occur, but we're going to do our best to get it done as quickly as possible.  But the registrar will inform you of the date when judgement will be delivered. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can we be consulted as to the date?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Beg your pardon?  
MR. HOOPER:
Can we be consulted as to the date?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, as usual.  That goes without saying.  We have never been arbitrary and we won't -- 
MR. HOOPER:
No, I know, I know you haven't, but I don't want an opportunity for anybody to be.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we adjourn now, and thank you all very much.  
(Court adjourned at 2000H)
