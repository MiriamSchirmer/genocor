P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 20th of October 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

I think we can note the appearances are the same.  

Mr. Robinson, are you ready to go?
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Good morning and good morning to the members of the 
Trial Chamber.  I'm asking that we have my questions in open session concerning the benefits received by this witness and -- 
MR. MORLEY:
I apologise for leaping to my feet straight away, but it occurs to me that Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues may take the view that this argument should take place in closed session.  It will allow greater freedom of expression for a start, but secondly, what Mr. Robinson is going to have to refer to in part of his argument is arguably material that should be in closed session anyway.  So that's the first observation that I would invite the Court to consider.  Can we have this argument in closed session, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What would be the reason?  
MR. MORLEY:
The reason is because it relates to sensitive matters concerning the witness's -- the circumstances of the witness.  I believe that Mr. Robinson is going to press Your Honour on his present circumstances and wanting to ask questions about those.  And in asking questions about his present circumstances, as Your Honour may recall, as part of the closed session during the direct examination, it was elicited that aspects of his present circumstances he's not able to comment about.  So that having been in closed session, and argument about asking questions about that, I respectfully submit, should be in closed session as well. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, Mr. Morley doesn't know what I'm going to say.  What I'm going to say can be said in open session.  I'm not going to refer to any specifics that would be necessary to be heard in closed session.  May I proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm asking you to allow evidence of the benefits this witness has received to be heard in open session, and including asking you to reconsider the ruling you made yesterday concerning the amount of money that the witness received.  

First of all, I want to point out that Article 20, section 2, of the statute of the Tribunal says that the Accused shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing; and that subject to Article 21, which also calls for the protection of the rights of the witnesses and victims; and under Rule 75, the Trial Chamber may order appropriate measures to safeguard the privacy and security of victims and witnesses.  And I suggest that this question of benefits deal with none of those.  But in any event, Rule 75 says that those measures may be ordered, provided that the measures are consistent with the rights of the Accused.  Rule 78 says -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, Your Honours, could we request that counsel allows the interpreters to locate the Rules so that we are accurate in our rendition in the other language.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, in this instance, counsel is not actually putting the Rule.  He is just making a reference to it; is that correct, Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  That's correct, Mr. President.  So I will just repeat Rule 75 as I paraphrased it, that the 
Trial Chamber may order appropriate measures to safeguard the privacy and security of victims and witnesses, provided that those measures are consistent with the rights of the Accused. 

Rule 78 says that all proceedings shall be held in public unless otherwise provided, and then Rule 79, which provides for a closed session, says that it can be provided where the issue of safety, security and non-disclosure of the identity of a victim or a witness, none of which are applicable to the question of benefits, or for the protection of the interests of justice, which I say is also not applicable.  

So that's the statute and the rules.  The jurisprudence says that it's preferable that hearings be conducted in public, and this includes making public as much of the written pleadings and decisions as is possible.  Although it's also of importance that the safety of victims and witnesses not be compromised.  I am quoting from a decision in the Bizimungu case by the Trial Chamber on 
Prosper Mugiraneza's motion to remove confidentiality from portions of the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief, a decision of 10 December 2004 in which Judge Short participated. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you are going a bit too fast, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I will try to slow down.  And the Appeals Chamber has held that the rights of the Accused are the first consideration, and the need to protect victims and witnesses is a secondary one.  And that's from the Musima (phonetic) Appeals Chamber judgement of 16 November 2001 at paragraph 68. 

The Appeals Chamber, just on the 6th of October, said that witness protection measures should be the least restricted measure necessary to provide for the protection of victims and witnesses, and that's in the Bagosora Appeals Chamber decision on interlocutory appeals, dated 6 October 2005, at 
paragraph 19. 

One of the reasons for that is that there's a domino effect.  Whenever you have something in closed session, it can't be referred to by future witnesses.  Closing briefs have to refer to it in private, redacted filings under seal, and the Trial Chamber's judgement can't allude to the material in closed session that's made available to the public.  So it's a serious step to close a session, and it should be taken very cautiously. 

In this particular case, in the Nahimana trial, on February 20th, 2002, at page 72 of the transcript, in open session, the same witness was asked:  "Between November 1996 and December of 2000, you received the sum of just about $300,000 US (sic) from the Office of the Prosecutor?" And in open session the witness answered, "Well, if you calculate the total on that exhibit and that's $30,000, then that's what I received."  

In that same trial, on the 20th of February at page 74, in open session, the witness was asked if he had been promised a new identity.  Mr. Rapp stood up and said, "I think that it's not an appropriate area of enquiry in this public session because of the protection of witnesses."  And President Pillay, in a 
Trial Chamber, also composed of Judge Møse, now the president, said, "No, we allow the question as framed."  And so the witness was asked, "Have you been promised a new identity?" And he said, "Yes.  In the witness protection programme that I'm in, a new identity was promised and provided."  

And then on the 26th of February 2002, in the media case, again in open session, at page 75, the witness was asked, "Were the travelling expenses of each of your family members covered by the Tribunal?" And he answered in the affirmative in open session.  He was asked if the Tribunal "was contributing to the subsistence of you and your family," and he went on to explain that he is in a programme in which, if you don't have a job, there are social services that take care of your medical and subsistence expenses.  Then he was asked in open session if he requested asylum or had been given assistance in connection with his status as a refugee, and he gave some information and answered about the documents that he were provided in general to allow him to live legally in the country to which he had been relocated.  

All of that was already in public session and is already on the public record, and so I submit there is absolutely no reason for this same information, same type of information, to be heard in closed session in this case. 

Finally, I want to advise you that I have spoken with a lawyer who practices extensively in criminal law in not only the national jurisdiction, but the very province in which this witness is located, or is provided protection.  And I am advised that I can provide you with testimony or an affidavit that, in that domestic jurisdiction, the Defence is always provided with the details of how much benefits the witnesses have received in terms of subsistence or whatever the total is for their cooperation with the government when they are in a witness protection programme, and that they are fully allowed to ask the witnesses in trial, in front of a jury, in public, the nature of those benefits, and that the witnesses answer those questions all the time in that jurisdiction.  And so, in my view, there is absolutely no reason for, not only these questions to be put in public session, but for this witness to be compelled, if necessary, to answer the questions.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
With regard to the argument about how much money has been received by the witness, Your Honour has made a ruling on that yesterday.  Mr. Robinson simply stood up and said he doesn't like it and wants to try again.  If there is to be further argument about money, Your Honour will recall the arguments put forward by Mr. Webster, and I don't propose to enlarge on those. 

With regard to the question about which I am particularly concerned, namely, questions in open session about the witness's present circumstances, Your Honour may recall that what was elicited in direct examination is that the witness has entered into a contract in which he has agreed not to answer questions of that nature, and therefore, insofar as any questions might be put in open or closed session, the difficulty which will arise is, it is part of an agreement which he has entered into, in his present circumstances, not to give answers in public relating to those circumstances. 

That is a difficulty which is squarely before the Court.  The presentation by Mr. Robinson a few moments ago, despite the fact that he said that he wasn't going to go into details about circumstances, he has indirectly done that.  He has told Your Honours about a previous trial and given some examples of the sorts of questions which he wants to go into. 

Now, just because Mr. Robinson says, "I'm not going to go into the details," it doesn't always follow that that is what happens, and my concern about conducting this enquiry, this argument, in closed session, in my respectful submission has been borne out because he has, to the public ear, elicited in his argument all the sorts of circumstances that he wants to elicit from the witness, which is exactly the thing he said he wouldn't do.  He went into the details.  I'm somewhat vexed by Mr. Robinson being able to present to Your Honour that he won't do that, is accepted, and then it's done. 

The short point is that, in relation to the witness's present circumstances, those are matters of great sensitivity within states, and in those circumstances any questions about it would have to be in closed session, I respectfully submit.  But moreover, Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues know that the witness will not answer questions of that nature because of the agreement he has entered into in order to be in his present circumstances. 

Finally, I was puzzled to hear Mr. Robinson say that he is aware of the province, I think was the word he used, where the witness presently resides.  I'm not sure how he can have become aware of the province where the witness resides, and it may be that that knowledge being imparted to him is in breach of the protection order which the witness currently enjoys.  And I would invite Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues to make enquiries as to how Mr. Robinson has been able to locate the province where this witness resides.  It is an interesting feature to his argument that he offers affidavits from that jurisdiction, but what is more troubling is that he seems to know much more about the witness than he really should.  And Your Honour might promptly make an enquiry as to where that information has come from.  It is plainly in breach of the protection order. 

Those are my respectful submissions.  And all of this, I respectfully submit, should have been in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, how do you respond to the information or the proposition that information, which has already been permitted in open session at the trials, why should that information not be permitted in open session in this trial?  
MR. MORLEY:
It's always helpful if counsel are able to exchange information before they get on their feet.  I wasn't aware that Mr. Robinson was going to be dealing with another trial.  I would like to know more about the circumstances of that other witness, and the circumstances under which those questions arose, and why, in the context of the testimony the witness gave, that material became relevant in public session.  Of course, I can't have that information at my fingertips because Mr. Robinson has not been able to inform us earlier that we might need to look at this previous case. 

With regard to this particular witness, whatever about any other witness, the problem which arises is, he is under a contractual obligation not to answer questions in relation to his present circumstances.  So that whatever the position with the previous witness, and I don't know because I haven't been able to research it, the position of this witness is factually different, factually in the sense that he has entered into a contract not to answer these questions.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I first be heard to clarify something?   Maybe it's not clear to everyone because it seems to be not clear to Mr. Morley.  This is the same witness that I read the transcript from.  It's the very same individual who was asked these questions in open session and gave those answers.  He had the very same contract; he was in the very same protection programme at the time.  So I want to make sure we all understand that.  I think Mr. Morley doesn't, but I was hoping that the Trial Chamber would.  And the testimony that I have read is the very same testimony that is contained on your own CD of prior statements of this witness that were disclosed by the Prosecution to all of us that we have, and I would expect that the Prosecution should know its own witness's prior statements on these very same points as part of its preparation.  And what I read to you in our session today is public testimony, so the idea that we should have a closed session for me to read public testimony is absurd. 

Now, we have -- we seem to be getting the cart before the horse on some of these -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, I -- Mr. Morley wasn't finished.  I allowed a general point of info -- clarification. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry.  I thought he was finished.  I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Unless I'm mistaken.  Mr. Morley, had you finished?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, I had finished -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then I do apologise.
MR. MORLEY:
-- with my submissions, but I was remaining on my feet as a courtesy, as I expected Your Honour was about to address me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I do apologise. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I apologise on the subject of what witness Mr. Robinson was referring to.  It wasn't clear to me from the way that the submission was developed that he was referring to this witness.  Of course, it would have been clear to me had I been warned in advance that this testimony was going to be something that he was going to rely on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I'm sorry. 
MR. ROBINSON:
It's no problem, Mr. President. 

So when we started this discussion, I had asked the witness if he had been -- if his relocation expenses had been paid by the Prosecution.  That was the question that was objected to, that was -- generated the request for closed session, and basically that -- the only things that are before the Trial Chamber right now is whether that question can be answered in an open session and my request that you reconsider your ruling, that the question about the amount of money that the witness has received be allowed in open session.  

Those are the only two things that are before you right now, and I think based on the fact that the testimony of the same nature was already provided in open session in another case ought to make your ruling very simple. 

Now, if we want to speculate about what's going to happen next, I'm sure we are going to have many problems as we get to the next series of questions, and eventually the agreement that allegedly this witness has signed may become an issue, and so if you want to deal with that, perhaps the Prosecution can produce this agreement.  If they are going to be relying on an agreement that the witness has not to answer any questions, because such an agreement, if it does exist, I would contend is against public policy, that no police agency in the national jurisdiction can purport to tell a Trial Chamber or trial judge in any jurisdiction what cannot or can be enquired into at a trial of an accused in a criminal case.  But we are not quite to that point yet, but if you want to address that at this time, I'm happy to do that, then I'd ask that you order that the agreement be produced.  If you are satisfied to limit your decision to that that is squarely before you, then I think we can -- you can do that and we can move forward.  Thank you.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl?

MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I thank you.  The issue of having the discussions in open session is of concern to us also, and I would like to say a few words on that.  First of all, I heard the Prosecutor state that there is an agreement between the witness and the Tribunal. 

I have great difficulty in understanding that concept because there can be an agreement between the witness and the Prosecutor, but an agreement between the witness and the Tribunal -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just on a point of clarification, Mr. Morley, did you allege that the agreement was with the Tribunal?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, no. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  I think that was -- 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that's what came out in the interpretation.  So there's a problem with interpretation, and the transcripts of the interpretation will prove that, but it was said that there was an agreement between the witness and the Tribunal, and I am disturbed that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, could you just clarify the position again, please?  
MR. MORLEY:
Those who have placed him in his present circumstances, he has entered into an agreement with, in the relevant state, not to answer these questions, because obviously it reveals all sorts of material and details about how these programs work.  In those circumstances it is a requirement that he don't say anything to anyone about how the system works.  It occurs to me though that, as I'm on my feet, I am intrigued by what's happened in the previous trial which Mr. Robinson has referred to, and if I may, Your Honour, I'd like to address you further on that at Your Honour's convenience. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  Let me conclude, I thank you for giving me the floor.  This having been clarified, I therefore believe that the witness is adult enough, mature enough, for him to be able to answer when he is asked to say that, "I cannot answer that question because I am bound by an agreement," and I do not understand why the Prosecutor, by referring to all the questions, wants to insist on a closed session in order to prohibit the witness from responding and the witness is old enough to answer.  If he does not wish to, he will not, but this is his own responsibility. 

Now, I'm a bit surprised in the manner in which the Prosecutor is refusing that questions be put to the witness in public session, when a witness came and told you that he attaches great importance to the credibility of what he is saying.  If the witness is so attached to credibility, that's his own problem, and if it is his own problem, I must say, in my understanding as a French Counsel, he is already -- it is already extremely difficult to accept that a witness accepts to bear -- the price of this witness, that he accepts payment for these services.  

This is, in fact, making promises to the witness and this is of discredit to the testimony because anyone who receives money for testimony will have his testimony challenged or even set aside, because it was obtained inappropriately.  Maybe the witness wishes to have his testimony considered credible, but I believe that credibility cannot be discussed in relation to the statements made by the witness, nor with regard to the decisions which will be rendered in order to assess the credibility of his statements. 

It is important, therefore, that we have full light on these issues, and that this be done in full public sessions.  But we cannot deal with -- we cannot set aside an element which is so important in the credibility of the witness, and I sincerely hope and wish that we can have this in open session because this is how we would deal with it best in our Courts.  Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley?  
MR. MORLEY:
May I enquire of Mr. Robinson, what is the date of the testimony that he has referred to Nahimana trial?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I referred to the testimony of the 20th of February 2002, at page 72 and 74, and the 
26th of February 2002, at pages 75 to 77. 
MR. MORLEY:
What I would invite Your Honour to allow is for the Prosecution to obtain those transcripts quickly, and we can have a look at what's in them, because it may be that if what Mr. Robinson says is correct about those aspects having been elicited from this witness in open session in a previous trial, it may be that what could take place is Mr. Robinson cross-examines in the previous testimony from the previous trial without asking further questions.  But we'd like, if we may, to have a moment to see this reference which Mr. Robinson has helpfully given us to the Nahimana trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we would like to take a few minutes to consider our decision on this matter, so we will rise for a few minutes.  

Yes, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Would you mind if I raised another issue before we took the break, and that way we can look for the transcript at the same time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It actually comes back to this whole issue of the form of questions that are placed to the witness, and it's on the issue of transcripts.  Yesterday I recall that Mr. Robinson was -- in his cross-examination, referred to the transcript from the Nahimana trial and to the testimony of Omar Serushago during that trial, and I was caught a bit unprepared at the time, but now I have the transcripts in front of me.  I don't think we need to revisit this issue with the witness, but I'd like to explain my concern to the Court.  I'm not familiar with the procedure where a cross-examining counsel refers to the previous testimony of another witness and places that on the record and in front of the witness that is on the stand.  It's not a prior inconsistent statement of the witness that's testifying; it's not a statement from the Accused.  So I query at the outset the propriety of reading the testimony of another witness, who is also expected to be a witness in this trial, to the witness that's being cross-examined, and asking him to comment on it.  That's the first issue.  If Mr. Robinson -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this come under the principle that was raised by the Prosecution on the issue of refreshing memory?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't see it as refreshing memory, Your Honour, because this witness didn't attend the Nahimana trial, and this witness doesn't know what Omar Serushago said in the Nahimana trial.  This witness was asked was he present at a certain location at a certain time and said -- and expressed certain views.  In fact, that was not the question that was posed.  The question that was posed then, did Omar -- was Omar Serushago correct when he said thus and such in relation to you?  I'm not aware of a procedure for cross-examining a witness like that.  I think it is appropriate to go into that line of questioning, but not by reading the transcript from another trial of another witness to the witness that's being cross-examined.  He could have asked the witness, "Were you present at the Meridian Hotel on such and such a date, and did this or that event transpire?"  And the witness could answer that question and then he could confront it.  "Well, a witness known to the Defence has said such and such.  What is your response to that?"  But then to read selective portions of the transcript and then to characterise the declarant, to characterise that witness as a pathical -- pathological liar, and then to say to the witness that's being cross-examined, "I agree with you.  I support your answer, and I think that the witness that made these comments in another trial was wrong or was inaccurate or was lying," that's an improper way of conducting a cross-examination on this issue.  And if we go to the transcript itself, I cannot recall what specifically passages Mr. Robinson read onto the record because there were several.  I noted page 47, but there were other pages that he read, and when I look at the transcripts, and now I'm looking at the transcript of the 26th of November 2001, on page 53, the line of questioning that 
Mr. Robinson pursued is a passage that goes on for three pages, and it starts, and I will quote from page 53 in the English in the middle of the page, "Going back to the events before the 6th of April 1994, had you ever met Mr. --" And then it gives the name of the witness which Mr. Robinson inserted as Witness G, "in Kigali before that date?"  

And it goes on, "Yes, I saw him."  

"Question:  And was that on several occasions or many occasions or just once --" 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, what's the point you're trying to make?  
MR. WEBSTER:
The point I'm trying to make is, if we go down this road in the form of putting these questions to the witness, then it opens up a whole -- an entire line of re-examination that would be unnecessary if we had gone about it in a -- in a -- in a much more fair and straightforward manner.  And if Mr. Robinson is going to read from the transcript, which I have problems with in the first place, he should read the entire portion, or he should give the Prosecution notice beforehand so that we can look and read along and place things in their proper context.  So I'm stating at the outset that we don't need to go back to the witness with this, but I'm bringing it to the Court's attention because I would suggest that the Court could exercise a bit -- or I'm suggesting that the cross-examination should be a bit more disciplined so that we don't have to revisit these issues in re-examination.  

I can direct the Court to the pages that concern me, and the Court can look at them at another time, because the response and the exchange between the attorney that was posing the questions during the Nahimana trial and Omar Serushago is a bit more expansive than what was read onto the record yesterday.  And it starts on page 53, and the portion that interests me ends on page 56, and this is from the testimony on the 26th of November 2001.  But I raise this issue simply as a point of procedure, and it's -- it's an objection to the form, not necessarily to the line of questioning, but the way that the questioning is being conducted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just emphasise, taking umbrage, to characterising the testimony -- characterising a witness that Mr. Robinson knows to be a witness that's expected to testify in this trial as a pathological liar to another witness, and eliciting comment on that, and then addressing the witness that's on the stand and suggesting to that witness, "I agree with you.  You are telling the truth," that is an inappropriate way of questioning a witness, regardless of whether it's a Prosecution witness or a Defence witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we should take the recess, a short break now. 
(Court recessed from 1015H to 1032H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to need a little bit more time to complete our review of the material that we need to look at to come to a ruling on this matter.  So we think that the -- an appropriate method of proceeding, 
Mr. Robinson, would be to interrupt your cross-examination until we rule on this matter.  Perhaps 
Mr. Weyl could commence his cross-examination, and we would expect that by the end of the luncheon adjournment that we would be in a position to make a ruling which would permit you to complete your re-examination.  I thought that that would be practicably suitable for you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, would that also be practicably suitable for you to allow that process to proceed in this manner?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, from what I understood, we will be able to finish Mr. Robinson's -- finish the portions of Mr. Robinson's cross-examination that will not conflict with mine, and I can begin after Mr. Robinson finishes, save for those issues regarding the closed session which will come up at a later stage. 

If the Chamber wishes for me to begin my cross-examination, I am prepared to do so.  It would be preferable to finish Mr. Robinson's cross-examination, but I am prepared to proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson.  There are sections of your cross-examination that you couldn't advance now?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I could. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would that be preferable?  
MR. ROBINSON:
It doesn't make any difference to me.  If it's preferable with the Trial Chamber and Mr. Weyl, I'm happy to do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we are looking at the most practical solution.  If it's better to complete what you can now, and then just leave the issues relating to the witness's -- benefits of the witness until after we are able to rule on that matter, then you may do that, if you have issues that are possible to proceed without a ruling on that issue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I can do that.  I can proceed. 

Perhaps Witness G could be asked to put the headphones on in The Hague. 
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, this is the Registry in The Hague.  We will need two to three minutes to fetch the witness.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We will await you.  
MR. WEYL:
Pardon me, Mr. President.  We need the assistance of a technician.  It appears our screen has been unplugged and we do need some assistance.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's been taken care of.  Registrar is (inaudible).  
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, the witness has arrived.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you hear me now?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we are about to proceed with the continuation of your testimony, and Mr. Robinson will continue examining you. 
WITNESS G, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Witness G. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness G, we are going to go back to some subject that we were going to cover yesterday concerning the Pétit Kigali restaurant, but the video wasn't available yesterday, so we will start with that.  And I want to ask you, the video that we saw of the Pétit Kigali, was that taken at a time when the Interahamwe were fighting side by side with the army? 
A.	I couldn't tell you.  I can't place exactly when they filmed that video. 
Q.	You told us that when you returned to Kigali for your first visit, sometime around the 23rd of April, that the Interahamwe by then were engaged in the fight in the war against the RPF, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	So then the question would be whether this video was shot between 6 and 23 April, or whether it was shot after 23 April.  Do you have any opinion on that? 
A.	It was after the 23rd of April. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  And I want to have just about one minute of this video played, and before it's played I want to ask you if you know a UNAMIR officer from Senegal named 
	Amadou Dene? 
A.	I didn't know him personally, but my friend, number 9, told me about him. 
Q.	And do you think you would recognise -- do you know what he looks like?  Do you think you would recognise him if you saw him on this video? 
A.	I think so, because I've seen the cassette before.  And when I saw it, there were -- there was commentary about the people who figured in the video, so, yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  So, Mr. President, may we have your permission to play the video, which is KV00397A, from 24 minutes and 50 seconds until 25 minutes and 42 seconds?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, Mr. Sendze is trying his best to help.  I'm looking across the audio-visual booth.  Can we push the relevant button so that Mr. Sendze can go online to the television screens please, and may I have a signal when that's done?  I have observed some movement in the audio-visual booth, but I am just wondering whether anybody is listening to me.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have been advised by registry that they need the Prosecutor to start the computer, to turn it on and turn it off again.  So perhaps we can leave this for this afternoon as well and I can go on to something else, if that's how the Trial Chamber feels they want to use the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness G, we can postpone the Pétit Kigali until this afternoon, and also I was asking you questions about the benefits you received for cooperation with the Prosecution, and the Trial Chamber has asked me to not ask you those questions until this afternoon as well.  So we are going to go on to a slightly different subject, and I will ask if you could look at document number 40 that was placed or sent to The Hague, and if you could let me know when you have that. 
A.	Yes, I have it. 
Q.	And have you seen that before? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that document is a list of people wanted by the Rwandan government who they contend are the most responsible for the genocide in Rwanda, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm asking that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ40 and this be under seal because I am going to ask the witness about a name being on there that doesn't need to be public. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ40 admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)
A.	Let me tell you, if you move forward like this, it will be the same thing.  This should be under seal.  This list is everywhere on the Internet.  If you say number so and so, people will easily figure out who we're talking about.  Are we in open session?  How are we going to proceed? 
Q.	Okay, I think you've made a good --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I think he's right. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I agree.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I redact the last question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there some other way of identifying -- of answering the question without using the personal pronoun?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That last exchange is also redacted.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, does the name --
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we don't even have to refer to the list at all.  If he just asked the question to the witness, "Were you ever listed as a perpetrator of the genocide by the Rwandan government?"  The answer to that would satisfy everything that Mr. Robinson is trying to address.  Why do we have to even go to the list?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I could do that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, were you -- have you been listed by the Rwandan government as one of the alleged perpetrators of the genocide? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, it's true, is it not, that you were promised by the Prosecutor of the -- of this Tribunal that you would not be prosecuted for anything in connection with the genocide? 
A.	I don't know where you get that from. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to have the Trial Chamber's permission to read the contents of Exhibit P. 17, which was received provisionally under seal because it has -- it contains the name of this witness, and what I'm proposing to do is read onto the record the content of this letter from 
Carla Del Ponte to the witness without reading his name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the letter is already on the record.  Now, I think that the witness's attention could be drawn to it -- cross-examining him, and you could ask him again the question with reference to the communication. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Well, I'm happy to do that, Mr. President.  I'm just trying to be -- not make reference to an exhibit that's under seal in open session without your permission.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness's attention could be drawn to the communication, and you could question him -- you could renew the question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, if you could be shown Exhibit P. 17. 
THE WITNESS:  
Mr. President?  Mr. President, in the two previous trials I testified at, these questions and these matters were dealt with in closed session.  I'm not sure why these types of questions and these types of exhibits should be dealt with in an open session here. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could be heard on the witness's objection.  If you're willing to allow me to, I'd certainly be happy to give an explanation to him and to the Trial Chamber if it would assist.  We've heard the testimony of this witness in open session, and now the question is the credibility of the witness, and it seems to me that that is also of public interest, and it can be explored and should be explored in open session, unless if some detail about the question being asked that would tend to reveal the identity of the witness.  The fact that the promises have been made to this witness, without anything specifically relating to him, should be allowed to be asked in open session.  His name, date, whatever that might identify him, I agree, I will stay away from that.  But I'm not -- I'm trying to ask questions relating to promises made to him that do not identify him.  So far I don't think we have come close to identifying him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the Court would like to know why you have requested that this question be put in closed session. 
THE WITNESS:  
	Because in the two previous trials the document was dealt with in a closed session.  I have reasons for saying this.  As it turns out, there are journalists who wrote a piece in 2002.  I'm not sure how they obtained their information.  They had a document from the Defence.  In their piece they said such and such a witness received a document from the Tribunal guaranteeing him that he would not be prosecuted by the Tribunal.  There was someone I spoke with who had read that newspaper piece who told me, "You are protected.  You have some benefits and your file has been washed clean."  I think this could be problematic for me after my testimony is given. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, maybe I could comment briefly.  I'm concerned about how we read Rule 68(D) in relation to Rule 79(A)(iii).  Because in the first instance, although questions about this particular document are relevant to the issue of credibility, we've disclosed it to the Defence, even though initially it was protected under Rule 68 because it impacts upon our capacity to conduct further investigations and continuing investigations.  It was disclosed to the Defence.  It was disclosed after it --  initially it was withheld, and it was disclosed because it was potentially Rule 68 material.  But it's the type of information that we usually try to shield because there are investigations that are ongoing, and in soliciting the assistance of informers and providing benefits to them is integral to our investigations and there are arrests that are still underway and investigations that are still ongoing that could be compromised by revealing the details of how we do our work in the OTP.  So while the information was disclosed to the Defence in the interests of justice and one of the provisions that allows the Court to close a session is to protect the interests of justice, and I would argue that it's in the interests of justice to maintain the integrity of the investigations and the investigative procedures of the OTP, which may be compromised by going into the details of how we run our investigations to the extent that we rely on confidential informants.  

So I'd bring that to the Court's attention.  It may be a factor that the Court may wish to consider in relation to this specific issue and in relation to the other issues the Court will decide in the afternoon session.  But it's not simply protecting the identity of the witness.  There are other interests at stake. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I could just reply to that.  I don't know of any Court in the world that would allow a Prosecutor to promise a witness something such as that they wouldn't be prosecuted, and that then would say that that information cannot be made part of the questioning in the public, simply because other people might learn of it.  This is nothing so secret that would compromise any investigations.  I think that argument is not well taken at all. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It's simply a matter for the Court's consideration, Your Honour.  But even with regard to Mr. Robinson's submission, he is referring to the content of the letter, and he and I would disagree on how he has characterised the content of that particular exhibit. 

Mr. Robinson seems to contend that it's a promise not to prosecute, and I think that it can be read another way.  So, I mean, all of these details are things that the Court can consider and decide whether it's in the public interest or not to disclose it or in public.  

The line of questioning is permissible.  I have not suggested that this is improper cross-examination.  It's a question of whether it should take place in open session or not, and whether this exhibit should be disclosed to the public or not. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow.
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, the fact that the witness can testify of his own free will is not proof that he is not being prosecuted.  So there is no interest of the questioning -- of knowing on what basis the Prosecution decided that he should not be prosecuted is to be discussed in closed session.  This is a secret matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we consider that the question can be asked of the witness in open session.  We consider that the document and the contents of the document should not be disclosed in open session.  You may show the witness the document and renew the question to him.  If he persists in this manner and you wish to cross-examine him further, using the document as a basis of your questioning, we will have to go into closed session for that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, thank you very much, Mr. President.  I will do my best. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, as you sit here on the 20th of October 2005, do you have any expectation that you will be prosecuted by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	I don't know how to answer you, but if they are carrying out investigations on me and they find something on me, well, I think the Prosecutor has the right to prosecute me. 
Q.	But it's true, is it not, that they decided not to even open an investigation against you? 
A.	I don't know about that. 
Q.	Well, if you could look at Exhibit P. 17 and read that, and then tell me if that refreshes your recollection about whether the Prosecutor has decided not to open an investigation against you. 
A.	I have just read the letter.  As far as I'm concerned, I believe they did carry out investigations up until the year 2002, and that they found nothing substantive to warrant my prosecution.  I don't know whether subsequently they have carried out any investigations, and if so, whether they have found anything.  I don't know.  If they don't know -- if they have not done that, I don't know.  So I would request that you refer to the Office of the Prosecutor. 
Q.	Well, before you would testify for the Office of the Prosecutor in the very first trial in which you were asked to testify, isn't it true that you requested that you receive in writing some assurances by the Prosecution? 
A.	I only received this document. 
Q.	And that document was received -- it was prepared at your request, was it not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Because you told the Prosecution that you would not testify unless they put something in writing to indicate that they were not going to prosecute you or investigate you further, correct? 
A.	No.  I asked them whether they had carried out any investigations on me up until that point in time.  And if they had, and they had found nothing, I required that they produce a document stipulating the same.  I didn't say that they should produce a document that they have decided not to prosecute me. 
(Pages 1 to 19 by Jennifer Spring)










1115H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But in effect, what you received was an assurance that the Prosecution was not going to open an investigation of you; correct? 
A.	I believe that on that date, we had discussed that issue, and it was decided that it would come about that evidence is found this letter would not prohibit the Prosecutor from doing what it needed to do. 
Q.	Okay.  But, in fact, the Prosecutor as you understood it was not going to conduct such any investigation.  So it made the likelihood of such information coming to their attention much less; correct? 
A.	I don't know -- I told you that I have referred you to the Office of the Prosecutor.  Ask them, I am not working with them in what they're doing and that's something internal to that office.  So, you need to ask them because you are together with them. 
Q.	Well, unfortunately the Rules of the Tribunal do not allow me to cross-examine the Prosecutor.  Believe me I would like nothing better, but I have to limit myself to questioning you at this time.  So, I just want to ask your understanding and what you believe as you sit here today in this trial; do you think that you are ever going to be prosecuted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	What I am telling you, Counsel, is that during that period of time, I know that I didn't do anything, and there are investigators for that purpose.  If they say that I have not done anything, it is up to the 
	Office of the Prosecutor to carry out investigations to see whether or not I had done anything.  I am not in a position to be able to make that kind of judgment.  I am telling you I do not know.  
Q.	And from 1996 to 2005, no charges have been brought against you by the 
	International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, correct? 
A.	I do not work at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  You are the one who is there.  And 
	I am here in The Hague and you should ask your colleagues who are in your Office of the Prosecutor.
Q.	So, Witness G, look for the last four days, you answered my answers very well.  You have given us yes or no answers when they have been called for.  You have done an excellent job.  And now I am asking you very simple questions and you can answer yes or no.  And so I am going to ask you if you could try to do that.  Maybe I am asking the questions poorly, but let me just try to ask you another question:  To your knowledge, are there any charges pending against you at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	No, I am not aware of any such thing.
Q.	And in fact, as a result of your cooperation with the Prosecutor here in this Tribunal, it's not possible for the government of Rwanda to prosecute you either; correct? 
A.	There I would answer that I do not know.  There is Rwanda which is an independent country and there is a Tribunal.  So I cannot know what is happening in Rwanda.  Rwanda exists.  Go there and ask them.  I really do not know how to answer you.  It's not because I don't want to answer you. 
Q.	Well, as part of the benefits of promises, well, part of the benefits you received from the Prosecution in this case was a new identity; correct? 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, before the witness answers that question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Robinson, that comes under what we are going to rule on. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I should leave that out this afternoon then, and very well. 
MR. MORLEY: 
May I also mention that a few minutes ago, the eagle-eared, Mr. Sendze, noted the witness said in his answer his present location?  I would ask that that be redacted. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sendze's -- but we would allow it, but if that is in the record then I order it to be redacted. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I didn't hear it, but I have a note.  I am sure it's written for a good reason. 
MR. PRESIDENT:   
Well, I won't ask you to state it, but Mr. Registrar, is asked to declare the order. 
MR. FRY: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, is the place where the witness is testifying from a secret? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think the witness referred to that location. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is what we thought we heard too.  That is why I made the order to allow the registrar to exercise his discretion. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Okay, Witness G, we are going to put this topic off until this afternoon, and I am going to turn to another topic, which is the preparation that you have undertaken for your testimony of this trial.  So could you tell us what written or recorded materials you have reviewed before giving your testimony in this trial? 
A.	Oh!  I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay, I will asking it again.  It's not a problem.  Can you tell us what written or recorded materials you have reviewed before giving your testimony in this trial? 
A.	Before the beginning of this trial, I read certain documents from the Prosecutor's Office.  They asked me whether I was able to recognise those documents.  So, I looked at some CD-ROMS and there was a preparation of this testimony that was carried out and that's all.
Q.	Okay.  There is something wrong with that, Witness G.  I am just trying to determine what documents you have reviewed before giving your testimony in the trial.  So, first of all, did you have an opportunity to review the transcripts of the statements you have made in the past to the investigators of the 
	Office of the Prosecutor beginning in 1997?  
A.	We looked at the questions that the Prosecutor was to put to me in examination-in-chief.  I didn't see them again.  I didn't review my statements from 1997 to the year 2000.
Q.	And did you review some written documents that contained the questions that would be asked to you by Mr. Rapp at this trial? 
A.	I told you that they showed me documents and asked me whether I knew of these documents prior to that time and if I did, I would say yes and if not, I would tell him that that was the first time that I was seeing those documents and that's all. 
Q.	Okay, I understand, that but with respect to the questions that were going to be asked of you during your examination-in- chief, did you see those in writing? 
A.	He never gave me the documents in my hand.  He had those documents and he was asking me questions and I was answering. I never had documents in my hand from the Prosecutor. 
Q.	Have you ever reviewed the transcripts of your interviews with the Office of the Prosecutor beginning in 1997 which covers some 26 cassettes? 
A.	Frankly, if I were to tell you that I looked at that documentation, I would be misleading you because; I myself was fed up with continuing to testify.  These are documents which I am seeing again and again to such an extent that each time I come to court, sometimes I remember these questions, many of these questions because this is becoming routine.  Sometimes I do not even need to read these documents. 
Q.	But have you ever read the transcripts of your interviews with the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	In full, I would say, no. 
Q.	Have you read portions of them? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you have them -- do you have them in your possession so that you are able to refer to them prior to coming to the location where you are giving the testimony now? 
A.	What I can tell you about the documents that I have in my possession is that they are documents which the Prosecutor did not give me, whereas they were supposed to be given to me before they were placed into evidence.  I should have had them before that was done, but I had documents of the earlier trial, some of those documents.  And, I believe that it was in all that I read these documents, but I didn't have the opportunity nor the time to read them all and that was the only condition that I gave to the Prosecutor.  In 1996, we agreed that they should give these documents so that I could review them if there were any amendments to be made whether I need to make any subtractions or additions, and this was concerning documents which referred to testimony, and this was never done. 
Q.	So, if I understand you correctly, after you gave the interviews to the Office of the Prosecutor back in 1997, they promised you that the transcripts of these interviews could be given to you for your review and any corrections made by you; is that correct? 
A.	You need to understand the reason why these transcripts of 1996 existed.  When we started the interviews, they wanted to get to know about everything that happened in Rwanda, and it was never said that these documents were going to be placed into evidence in any trial whatsoever. So, the investigator at the time told me that before he takes that documentation as documents and not evidence, they needed to be returned to me so that I could authenticate them and that was not done. 
Q.	Okay.  I understand that, but then at any later time, did you receive copies of the transcripts of cassettes of your interviews with the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	I remember that I received documents, not everything, not all the documents.  They didn't come from -- they didn't all come through the Office of the Prosecutor.  These documents came to me through another office and they were documents containing my statements. 
Q.	And so as of now, do you have a large number of transcripts of your interviews with the Prosecution? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And when was the last time that you referred to those documents? 
A.	I would say two, three months before I came here, I reviewed some -- some of the documents. 
Q.	Okay thank you.  Then there was a time in the year 2000 when you were interviewed by a national jurisdiction and they were transcripts of eight cassettes that were produced of those interviews.  Have you received those transcripts? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And do you know what interviews I am speaking about in 2000? 
A.	Yes. I recall. 
Q.	Okay.  Now you also have testified in 2002 in the Nahimana trial and have you reviewed the transcripts of your testimony at that trial? 
A.	Yes, I told you that in the 2002 trial, I had documents and I read them and this was the first time that I was receiving documentation from the Office of the Prosecutor.
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when was the last time that you reviewed any of the parts of that transcript? 
A.	I told you that I think it was two to three months ago that I reread those documents that I had received. 
Q.	And then in June of 2004, you testified in the trial of Colonel Bagosora and others, have you received a transcript of that trial of your testimony of that trial? 
A.	I don't know whether I have them, but I have not reread those documents.  Maybe I have them in my possession. 
Q.	And you also testified in the trial of Casimir Bizimungu and others in June 2004; do you have the transcripts of your testimony of that trial? 
A.	No, I think that the testimony in the Bagosora trial, and in the Bizimungu trial, I have no documents from there in my possession, but as for the Media Trial, I do have documents of that with me. 
Q.	And you have them with you at the location where you are giving the testimony from or at your home? 
A.	I have them at home. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us; is there any other documentation concerning the events of Rwanda that you have in your possession at your residence? 
A.	Apart from letters written by the organization and some documents which I received during the trials, those are the only documents that I have at my home.
Q.	And what is the nature of the documents that you received during the trials? 
A.	Those are the documents that are generally distributed here, some exhibits, some exhibits that are given out, that are handed out.  During the trial from time to time I would take them with me. 
Q.	Okay.  Now have you seen or heard any of the information provided by Number 9? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And in your meetings with the Prosecutor in preparation for your testimony, have you been acquainted with what Number 9 has said about certain matters to which you are testifying? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, do you have any of your own notes or diaries about the events to 1994? 
A.	I believe that after the 2002 Media Trial, I had some difficulty with dates and so I tried to review the dates and in doing so, I did write down the material on a piece of paper which I have at my home.
Q.	Okay.  Did you have any notes or diaries which you kept in 1994 that you still have in your possession today? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And prior to coming to court to testify in this case, have you done any research on the internet about the 1994 events in Rwanda? 
A.	Well, you know that all those who have lived in that country and who experienced what happened in Rwanda when they have access to the internet, they tend to want to find out what others are saying in respect of what happened.  So I want to be honesty with you and tell you that I have been monitoring this quite regularly.  Even today on the internet, I do receive documents from friends; documents they have found along the way on this issue. 
Q.	And you monitor or participate in chat rooms or subscriber lists, service lists about the events in Rwanda? 
A.	No, I have never been in chat rooms. 
Q.	What about -- you know there are servers like Rwanda net and others where there are ongoing discussions about the events, in Rwanda people post messages.  Do you monitor those as well? 
A.	No, I am not part of that.  I may even further say that under the protection rules that I enjoy, I am not allowed to do so. 
Q.	I understand that you are not allowed to make contact with others, but do you read messages that people are posting concerning the events of Rwanda and different servers different internet providers that deal with this topic? 
A.	Well, you know, I am a Rwandan and I must follow what is going on in Rwanda.  I am interested in that. I always think about Rwanda.  So when I get to the internet, I check like everybody else, by the way. 
Q.	Yes, there is nothing wrong with that at all, I am just asking you because we would like to know what sources of information you had available to you before you come to court to give your testimony.  So there is nothing wrong with surfing the net, believe me.  Now, can you tell us when was the last time that you met with Mr. Rapp prior today? 
A.	Before today - - before today?  
Q.	Yes, the most recent time? 
A.	 -- do I think I met him late September or early October.
Q.	And is that when you went over the questions that he would be asking you in his examination-in-chief? 
A.	Yes, that was the day on which he came to prepare me to confront you. 
Q.	And did he prepare you for questions that you might be asked on cross-examination as well? 
A.	No. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take a break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We were wondering whether you would come back to conclude first.  How much more time do you have? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I have maybe about 10 or 15 minutes.  I think about 10 minutes, and I am going to ask that we go into 
closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, let's take the break now. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Before you arise, Your Honours, may I discuss if I may have a slightly longer break than usual, I'd like to speak to Mr. Rapp about the arguments which emerged this morning.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, (inaudible). 
(Court recessed from 1145H to 1215H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Robinson you can proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Witness G, are you with us?  
MS. TALON:  
Mr. President, we were not told that you were coming back. So we need a few moments to fetch the witness.  
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.   
MS. TALON:
The witness is here, Mr. President.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  You can proceed, now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, we have the video T-Kigali ready now so that you can take advantage of that and it's going -- we are going to play a small segment of it.  What I am going to ask is that it be played in mute so that there is no sound coming from the video, and we are going to see some individuals in this clip that I am going to ask you if you could identify who those are.  So, if we could start the video and I may speak over the video as we are going along. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
We haven't started the video at the correct place, so if we could go to 24.50, please. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe you could clarify for the record once more which exhibit we are looking at and which video because I think we have five different CD-ROMS. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  If we could stop the video.  Mr. Sendze has just found the correct portion of the video and for 
Mr. Webster's identification, it's Video KV00397A.  But before playing the video and -- okay. 
Mr. Sendze, would you please play the video and I would tell you when to stop it?   

Okay, could you stop it there, please? 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness G, the person on the right of the screen, do you recognise that person? 
A.	I recognise both of them. 
Q.	Okay, could you tell us who they are? 
A.	The person with glasses on is Mr. Demy.  The other is Number 6. 
Q.	And Mr. Demy is the UNAMIR officer; is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	I think that is actually all we need to play from this video.  So we can stop the video at this point and go back to questions with Witness G.  
Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. Sendze? 
BY MR. ROBINSON:   
Q.	Now --
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe you would wish to indicate for the freeze frame.  What is number we are?  I think it is 24 -- 2450. 
MR. ROBINSON:   
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. ROBINSON:    
Q.	Witness G, we were speaking of your meetings with Mr. Rapp before coming to Court to testify at this trial and you told us that you had met with him in late September or early October.  And could you tell us approximately for how many hours you met with the Prosecutor? 
A.	I believe we saw one another over a course of two or three days.  We would start working at ten o'clock in the morning, and we would work until three or four in the afternoon and we took a break in between.
Q.	And was that same procedure something that you went through in 2004 before you gave your testimony in the cases of Bagosora and Bizimungu? 
A.	Yes, I could say that. 
Q.	And in between your testimony in 2004, and your testimony in this trial besides the meeting you had with Mr. Rapp in late September or October, have you had any meetings with someone, Mr. Rapp or anyone else from the Office of the  Prosecutor during that at period June 2004 through 
	September 2005? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you tell me about how many occasions you met with someone from the 
	Office of the Prosecutor during that period? 
A.	I believe they were two representatives from the Prosecutor's Office.  I met with each one three days a piece. 
Q.	And during that time, were you being recorded at all during any of the time?  Was any recorded statement taken from you? 
A.	They took notes.
Q.	And did you sign any statements during that time? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And in connection with your testimony in the Nahimana trial, before that trial, did you also have meetings with the Prosecutor, Mr. Rapp, perhaps a woman, Ms. Monasebia another representative of the Prosecutor? 
A.	I had a meeting with Mr. Rapp and before that one I had another meeting with a Prosecution representative. 
Q.	So can you give us an estimate in general, I know you didn't keep track of this, of the number of hours approximately you have spent with representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor since you gave your -- not including the statements you gave in 1997, but let's say since the year 2000?  Could you tell us approximately how many hours you have spent with members of the Office of the Prosecutor preparing your testimony? 
A.	I could say that I spent a week with the first representative from the Office of the Prosecutor.  With 
	Mr. Rapp, I spent two or three days meeting with him. 
Q.	And in total from the beginning of your contact with the Prosecutor in -- let's say the year 2000 before your testimony in 2002; coming up to today, would it be fair to say you spent in the neighbourhood about 100 hours or more with representatives of the Prosecution preparing your testimony? 
A.	Are saying prior to 2002 or up until now? 
Q.	I am saying up until now? 
A.	That is possible, but I didn't count. It's possible. 
Q.	I understand.  Now you were also asked if you would meet with me as a representative of the Defence before you testified at Mr. Nzirorera's trial? 
A.	I am not sure, but they were not the ones who asked me.  I believe that you made a request to the witness protection services where I lived.  
Q.	Actually, I didn't make any request directly to them, but perhaps they were transmitting a request I had made to the Trial Chamber.  But were you asked if could be -- or if you would be willing to meet with me before you gave your testimony? 
A.	Personally, I refused. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President at this time, I would ask that we go into closed session for some questions that I think would be appropriate in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sorry, estimated duration of the closed session. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Rough estimation of about 15 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be going into closed session now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 29 to 40] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 20 to 28 by Petrus Chijarira)




(Court resumed at 1548H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  We can resume now.  

Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour will see that helpfully Mr. Rapp is in Court, and there has been a discussion about the Nahimana open-session transcripts.  And I'm able to tell Your Honour, having discussed the matter with Mr. Rapp and also Mr. -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's a problem with the French translation.  

Mr. Registrar, could you check it, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I do believe that it was just a matter of time between what the President said and what Mr. Morley was trying to say.  So the one overrode the other.  If Mr. Morley could begin again, maybe, Mr. President, that would be fine.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
May it please, Your Honour.  I've had an opportunity of speaking with Mr. Rapp, who, Your Honour will see, is helpfully in court.  I've also discussed the position with Mr. Webster.  And it was a lively discussion, but the position I can offer Your Honour on the part of the Prosecution is that in respect of the Nahimana open-session, examination-in-chief section on the 20th of February of 2002, and the short cross-examination section on the 26th of February of 2002, insofar as they are now matters of record before the Tribunal in open session, there isn't an objection being raised to Mr. Robinson cross-examining in the open-session material from those transcripts.  

We would, however, like to make the point that it may be that the fact that that material came in in open session three years ago was unfortunate.  But it's there now; it's on the record.  And there may have been an argument about whether it should be in closed session or should happen at all.  What the Prosecution would seek to persuade Your Honour to avoid are any questions which go beyond what is on the transcript from 2002, for example, any questions which go beyond what has happened since 2002.  If it helps, Your Honour, therefore, having reviewed the transcripts, we're not going to argue.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
That is helpful.  It removes one area of contention.  So I presume that we don't have to deliver the decision we were prepared to deliver in that regard, so we can move forward now.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson, you can proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, are you there?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I am.  
Q.	Witness G, the Trial Chamber has indicated that I can ask you certain questions in open session, and I'm going to go ahead and do that right now.  So, first of all, is it true that as a result of your cooperation with the Prosecutor in this case, you have received approximately $30,000 in cash?  
A.	Let me tell you that 30,000 francs, I do not consider that as money which was given to me as an allowance.  This money was to reimburse me for monies I had spent on behalf of the Prosecutor, and a large part of that amount of money was for the purchase of air tickets and mission -- costs relevant to the mission that I had to effect when I was there.  You will also realise that I have been with the Prosecutor from 1995, and -- until 1999, and this is the report of the amount received.  So you can count how many years that covers.  So 30,000 francs during a period of four years, I believe, is not such a high figure.  
Q.	Nevertheless, Witness G, just to be accurate here, it was $30,000, not 30,000 francs; correct?  
A.	Yes, I was mistaken.  It was $30,000 US.  
Q.	And in addition to that, the cost of relocating you, your wife, and your children, were paid as a result of your cooperation with the Prosecution; correct?  
A.	I don't know whether it's the Prosecution that carried out those measures, but the fact remains that I found myself in the country where I was relocated, together with my family members.  I made a request, like anyone else did, and the request was approved by the embassy in place.  And my family and I left.  
Q.	But the cost of relocating you and your family, the airline, any shipment of goods, all of those costs, you didn't have to pay any of that; is that correct?  
A.	No.  
Q.	So it's true that someone else paid for those costs?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then once you were relocated, you received every month some money for subsistence for you and your family; correct?  
MR. MORLEY:
Sorry, I'm on my feet at this stage.  Mr. Robinson may have an advantage over me, but I'm not sure that's material which appears within the transcript, but my memory may have failed me.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, that does appear in the transcript at the testimony of 26 February 2002, between pages 75 and 77.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And if my memory serves me right, it's also covered by an order we have already made, requiring disclosure of the nature of the benefits, not the quantum.  So I think this question is permissible.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, once you were relocated to the new country, it's true, is it not, that money was paid for you and your family for subsistence each month; correct?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Have you received money from the -- from -- 
A.	I received money, not from the Tribunal, but from the country where I have been resettled, and this is for all immigrants received -- or hosted in the country where I am, everyone has a right to that allowance.  
Q.	And you have received that every month from September 1999, to the present; correct?  
A.	No, not 1994.  
Q.	Did that get translated correctly?  I said "September 1999."  
A.	What I can say is that from September 1999, I was placed in a protection programme in that country, and from that time on, I was under the protection of that country, and I continued to receive money in order to live and to pay for my bills and anything else that I'm incurring in that country.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going to ask a question with a little bit of trepidation because I'm not sure if this is going to contravene your order, but you can stop me if it does.  I'm not going to ask for an exact amount, but I do want to get some idea, and so this is my -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I respectfully submit that "some idea" is descending into the details, and that is where we start to contravene the position that we think Your Honour has adopted.  "Some idea" is detail.  It may not be the absolute specific, but it is descending into detail, and I anticipate he's looking for a range.  I can understand why, but that's something that is, we respectfully submit, not within the transcripts, and, therefore, Mr. Robinson is now seeking to go beyond what is on the public record from 2002.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think it would have been useful to hear my question before making any objection.  May I state my question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will hear what your proposed question is.  The witness does not have to answer it until we allow it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	My question is that, since this has been a period of six years, from September 1999, to the present, that being 72 months, and at the equivalent of $3,000, US dollars, per month, that would work out to $210,000.  And my question is simply whether you have received more or less than that amount.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not allow that question.  In fact, Mr. Robinson, we concluded that the quantum of benefits is a factor which depends on the cost of living, and it varies from country to country.  In relation to this witness, his location is protected information, and we have concluded that information about the quantum of his benefits in those circumstances is not going to be useful in credibility assessment.  So that was the basis of our reason for ruling out the detail of quantum.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I understand that, and I read that in -- I re-read your order this morning, but I think the way it's left right now, I was trying to make this as less lacking in detail as you could possibly make it by giving -- asking him more or less, but I don't think -- right now as it stands, he could be receiving the equivalent of $10 US a month or he could be receiving the equivalent of $10,000 US a month, so -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but our point is that it doesn't help us unless you know where he is.  You see, what $3,000 means to a cost of living varies dramatically from country to country. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's why we don't think it's relevant.  
MR. ROBINSON:
But it seems like there ought to be some -- some middle ground between absolutely having no information about that and having some information.  You could certainly -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have ruled that the information which would be useful to achieve your ostensible objective is the nature of the benefits received, not what they cost.  
MR. ROBINSON:
But all you know right now is that he's receiving some amount per month for subsistence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you can enquire the nature of the benefits.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, just so I'm clear --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, in fact, we had directed the Prosecutor to disclose that information to you.  

MR. ROBINSON:
And just so I'm clear, what do you mean by "the nature of the benefits"?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we had made an order.  I thought that that had been dealt with because the Prosecutor indicated that they had that information available, and we made an order for them to disclose it.  So I thought that that information had already been shared.  
MR. ROBINSON:
There's been no disclosure other than what Mr. Rapp said in open court.  So I want to enquire about the nature of the benefits, but I don't want to say anything -- ask anything that you think would be offensive.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, when this matter was dealt with by way of preliminary motion or pre-trial motion, the Prosecutor had represented that it had information about the nature of the benefits which it was willing to disclose to the Defence.  In our view, we did not think that the quantum was -- ought to be disclosed, and we didn't think the failure to disclose it would affect the credibility assessment of the witness.  Because in our view, it had no value unless we knew where the witness was, and that information was protected.  But we thought that the nature of the benefits received would be useful information.  And the Prosecutor, I understood, had undertook to disclose that.  Now, Mr. Robinson has said it was not disclosed.  But that information, I think, is useful and should be -- should be enquired into.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honours, our position was that in the Bizimungu case, we had made, by way of professional statement, a declaration regarding the nature of the benefits that had been received, and during the course of the examination, my direct examination of him -- it was, of course, during the closed session -- I put to him the matter of asking about specific benefits.  He said that he couldn't answer that, and then I proceeded to make a professional statement based upon our -- based upon our information in the file, that those benefits included subsistence and included educational benefits for himself and other members of his family, and included protective services that were determined by the host country to be required.  And that was the nature of -- of benefits that he's receiving and basically the information, after consultation with the host country, that they would allow us to disclose, even though this witness was directed not to answer specific questions about.  So that's -- that's what's on the record.  

Now, obviously when we get into specifics about, did you receive language training, et cetera, that kind of issue could disclose his identity because it could reveal what kind of country he was in and exclude a number of countries.  But there have been education benefits for each member of his family, including himself, and protection benefits and a subsistence allowance, and that we can disclose and have disclosed.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the problem is this, right, we accept that the issue of the benefits that the witness receives of any kind is relevant to credibility assessment.  So we permit or intend to permit enquiry into that issue.  However, we also think that the issue of witness protection is an important issue in this trial, and we have thought and concluded that the issues which are important in terms of the relationship between your credibility enquiry and our protective orders have to do with the relationship of where the witness is.  That is protected information.  And we thought that from a logical point of view, the -- the quantum of benefits means nothing unless we knew the location of the witness.  So we do not think that the amount of money he's received assists us in credibility assessment without information to which we are not privy.  So we do not intend to allow questions on the issue of the amount, and that is also taking into account the representations that have been made concerning the -- the general principles concerning certain type of protective arrangements.  

Now, we consider that the nature of the benefits is important information.  Now, you have heard a statement from Mr. Rapp which has addressed that issue.  I -- we -- I don't know what to say about what your reaction to that is, because I haven't heard you on it yet.  But that is the area which we will permit enquiry.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Well, I would like to try to make enquiry in those areas and see if I can do it in a way which is in accordance with what the Trial Chamber is expecting of me.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, I'm going to ask you about the nature of different benefits you have received.  Do you have your headphones on?  Yes, okay.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So, first of all, let me ask you, since you have been relocated to the new country, have you been given funds for the purpose of education for yourself?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And have you been given funds for the education of your wife and children?  
A.	For only one child.  
Q.	And have you been given funds for any vocational training for yourself?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And have you been given funds for any vocational training for your wife?  
A.	No.  
Q.	And Mr. Rapp indicated that you received benefits in the form of protection services.  Can you tell us in general what those benefits are?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm on my feet, I hope for obvious reasons.  To start to descend into how a country organises its witness protection programme is, I respectfully submit, firstly irrelevant; and, secondly, even if it was relevant, it is so sensitive that it would be excludable or inadmissible under a general principle of public interest immunity.  The method by which a country organises its witness protection programme, I respectfully submit, has no place before Your Honours.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I would submit that he could answer this question in a general way so that you have some information as to the nature of these benefits that he's been receiving, whether it's a 24-hour guard or funds that he's given each month for -- to arrange for his protection.  Those are general things that can be testified to without compromising any security.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I offer the thought that it's not often that I profoundly disagree with Mr. Robinson.  I can disagree with him, but not usually profoundly.  I profoundly disagree with the observation that general enquiries about the sort of protective measures which were instituted in the country where he's resident somehow is a bit innocuous.  It leads to the public becoming aware of the way in which witnesses are protected and, specifically, in relation to this particular defendant witness in a particular country.  And I respectfully submit to Your Honour that the mechanism by which a witness protection programme works is something which is sensitive and arguably irrelevant, but if relevant it is still on a balance of the public interest against relevance.  It is something which the Court should not enquire into.  It's pleasantly put by Mr. Robinson that it should be okay, it should be relatively innocuous, but it is a very slippery road that Mr. Robinson is inviting Your Honour to go down.  I respectfully submit there is no place for the protective measures being enquired into.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, although we do not adopt Mr. Morley's language in all its respects, we are virtually basically in agreement with the proposition that the -- that this is -- we should not permit enquiry -- that question that you've just asked, both for the reason he's mentioned and also we don't think it would be useful in our credibility assessment just to have a definition of what protective benefits cover.  So we don't permit the question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, in addition to receiving money for subsistence, do you also receive any form of vouchers that allow you to purchase food?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry.  Now we're descending into the method by which funds are distributed, and I respectfully submit that we are trespassing into the method by which the witness protection programme works.  We know as a fact that the witness has been able to say he has received funds for subsistence.  Once we descend then into the method by which the funds are distributed, we are, I respectfully submit, trespassing into how a witness protection works, and that, I respectfully submit, is where we should not be going for the reasons I've been arguing earlier.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm trying to determine the nature of the benefits as you've asked me to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you see, the word "vouchers" dealt with method of disbursement -- fund disbursement, and we agree with Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, do you receive any allowance for transportation?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, it's the same problem.  Mr. Robinson is, as it were, elegantly adopting the position of a locomotive.  He's going to keep going on this, and I respectfully submit that he should just take a moment to stop.  That sort of question is exactly the same as a voucher question.  We are talking about the distribution of funds, the method by which a person is kept in subsistence.  It's the same point and Mr. Robinson knows that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think perhaps this is a feature of the fact that the "nature of the benefits" is a very general term, and it seems that we don't have an agreement between the Prosecution and the Defence as to what you mean by allowing me to enquire into the "nature of the benefits."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think Mr. Morley's distinction is quite clear to me, and I think it's also reasonable, when one understands the purpose of a witness protection programme.  You know, we do not think that -- you see, subsistence could cover food, it could cover transportation, it could cover different headings.  We would permit information as to what subsistence -- that's a point I don't think it's -- it's really necessary to enquire.  But if you want to enquire what subsistence covers, you can.  But when you ask, do you get a separate allowance for this item, do you get a voucher for that item, you go into the issue of the method by which the programme is administered, and we don't think that we should allow enquiry into that.  That has nothing to do with the issue of the witness's credibility, and it compromises the -- or could compromise the way in which the programmes are managed.  We don't have any information ourselves, and we don't think that information of that nature is necessary for the task that we have to do in assessing the witness's credibility.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, has the country in which you are located, or the Prosecution, assisted you in obtaining legal status within that country?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm not sure why I'm on my feet.  The question is phrased in a way which may mean the witness doesn't fully understand it, "legal status in the country."  I would ask that Mr. Robinson rephrase the question so that I can understand what he's actually asking.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday Mr. Weyl introduced the concept of legal and judicial irritation.  I'm looking at the clock.  We want to complete this witness's testimony.  So I'm going to invite counsel, please, to assist in expediting the termination of his testimony.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I'm really down to my last few questions, so I'll try to rephrase that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Have you been given some form of citizenship, permanent residence, asylum, or refugee status within the country to which you've been relocated?  
A.	Mr. President, in the witness protection programme, I am prohibited from revealing anything whatsoever which I signed with the country in which I reside.  If I dare to do this and I return to that country, I will no longer enjoy that protection as of the first day, and I must insist that I cannot answer this question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I am going to make a request that you order the witness to answer this question because this -- a country cannot limit a defendant's or an accused's right to information which is relevant to a criminal trial.  And, first of all, the Prosecution, if there is such a prohibition in this country, should have brought the agreement or whatever, at least to show the Trial Chamber in camera.  Simply to have the witness -- his word be taken for something like this that would preclude enquiry, is, I believe, insufficient.  
MR. RAPP:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp.  
MR. RAPP:
This is -- this is the sort of thing that causes us to deal with some of this file from the point of view of professional statement.  The witness is under certain rules in regard to the programme in what he can answer.  And to the extent that the information is required by the Trial Chamber, we're willing to provide it, and the answer to the question, I think can be fairly be said, is, yes, he does have a status in the country of the kind that was described by Mr. Robinson.  I state from our own knowledge by way of professional statement, but I don't think we should put this witness into a situation where undertakings that he's been required to make as part of that programme should be required of him to answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Rapp.  

Mr. Robinson, although the question has not been answered by the witness, I think that we would accept the professional statement given by Mr. Rapp in lieu of compelling the witness to answer.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Very well.  Then my last question on this particular topic would be, is that status temporary or permanent?  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour -- 
THE WITNESS:
I hope you're not putting that question to me.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I am putting it to you, but it's another question as to whether you'll be required to answer it.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour -- 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I already told you that I cannot answer that question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp.  
MR. RAPP:
And the answer, by way of professional statement, based upon our own knowledge, to the extent that it's determined relevant to Your Honours, is that it is a permanent status.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Rapp.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, my last question is, "Have you been provided with a new identity?"
THE WITNESS:
Once again, I cannot answer that question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness G, you were asked the same question in the trial of Nahimana, and I'm quoting from page 74 of the transcript on page -- of 20 February 2002, and the question was:  "Have you been promised a new identity?"  There was an objection from Mr. Rapp, the President overruled the objection, and you gave -- you gave the answer.  So can you please answer the question?  
MR. RAPP:
Mr. President, if I can raise the objection again before another Trial Chamber, simply to state that this particular country has asked that that information not be disclosed because -- because providing that information whether by witness answer or by statement from the Office of the Prosecutor makes it easier, in at least one way, to locate this witness.  You don't have to look for him by his prior identity if you determine that his identity has been changed, and that's something that they have asked us, as a condition of placing a witness in that programme, not to reveal.  For that reason, it may be in the record in another matter, but we would urge our objection again here and say that this is not something that should be enquired into in this proceeding, and that it goes entirely to the issue of the protection of this individual from possible threats, and for those circumstances, isn't, in a sense, even a benefit to him.  It's a detriment to him, and for that reason we see no way that it can be used to affect or to challenge his credibility in any way, shape, or form.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, if the transcript is going to be put in as a prior record, inconsistent statement of witness, the information is already public information.  It's available.  Is this not like sort of bolting the stable after the horse is out already?  Because the information is already in the public domain.  So it just seems a little bit -- a little bit, you know, technical, a little bit impractical to -- to conceal it in this trial when it's already in the public domain.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, if it would assist the Trial Chamber, we would stipulate to the admission of that particular page here, but under the rules that we have to work with in this particular country, it's not information that should be enquired in a witness, and we are required to continue to raise this objection any time it comes up.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

Mr. Robinson, I think you should just accept Mr. Rapp's offer to stipulate the admission of the page of the transcript. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  It's actually against my better judgement, but since it's your request, then I will do it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The point is, it produces information, and it doesn't offend undertakings that have been given.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand that, but, Mr. President, I just think that these undertakings that have been given between the Prosecutor and this host country is totally against the interest of justice when they can decide between themselves what a witness can answer and what he can't.  With respect to new identity, it's very relevant, not only for a benefit, but he's being shielded from Prosecution by the Rwandan authorities.  So it goes not only to benefit but to his credibility, and it appears to me that it should -- the witness should be required to answer the question.  But so that we don't have judicial disapproval and some bad feelings about the timing, I'm happy to accept the stipulation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The point is, the information is on the record now, and you can address us on it when -- at an appropriate time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  So Mr. President, at this time, I would say that I have no further questions at this time.  I renew my request that the witness be recalled when and if there are further disclosures from the Rule 66(C) motions that are currently pending, but I take this opportunity to thank the witness and the interpreters for their assistance to me during this examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

It's now 4:30.  Mr. Weyl, is there any chance that you might finish this afternoon?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that's, in fact, a challenge that you're putting before my doorstep. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's only a question.  
MR. WEYL:
I don't think that this is something which is possible in one hour-and-a-quarter.  My answer is rather obvious.  It would be impossible for me to complete my cross-examination in the one-and-a-quarter hours allotted to me if I were to conclude this afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, what we'll do, we'll take a very short break now, and then you'll start your cross-examination on our resumption. 
(Court recessed at 1632H) 
(Pages 41 to 52 by Wendy Molnar) 











(Court resumed at 1655H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now resume.  Mr. Weyl, you have the floor.
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, the witness would like to speak with you. 
THE WITNESS:  
Mr. President, after Mr. Robinson's lengthy examination, and since we are moving on to another counsel, I don't feel quite up to starting another examination with a different Counsel.  I am kindly requesting that we delay the beginning of that cross-examination until tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, my immediate reaction is to suggest we only have one hour left this afternoon.  Tomorrow we are sitting only a half day, and then I would really prefer if it is possible for you to -- to continue.  You will have an opportunity -- it will be just one hour this afternoon and then you have a half day tomorrow.  If I may add this consolation to you, we have actually been here the same hours as you have been, and I suppose you have the advantage of youth.  So I'm asking you to try and see if you can last the hour. 
THE WITNESS:  Mr. President, honestly, I don't feel in shape, in form, to be able to deal with another Counsel.  It would be difficult for me to switch from one counsel to another as I have just completed a lengthy examination which was very difficult. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could support my friend, Witness G, in this for two reasons:  Number one, I know how tired he must be because I myself are exhausted, although I am considerably older than him.  Secondly, we do have a few matters we could take up with respect to the next witness that you'd like to have me cross-examine tomorrow morning.  So perhaps we could use some time this afternoon to resolve some of the issues that are still not resolved with respect to that witness and give Witness G a break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am extremely embarrassed, I must say.  I have just been informed by you that we are only sitting a half day tomorrow.  I will do everything I can to move these proceedings forward and to save as much time as possible during my cross-examination.  However, I do not want to badger a witness before I even begin my examination of him.  I don't know when I will be able to start or finish my cross-examination.  If I'm not able to finish tomorrow morning, this will mean that my cross-examination will resume on Tuesday of next week.  I simply wanted to point out these difficulties.  

I had understood from the last scheduling order by the Chamber that we would be sitting all day tomorrow and I simply wanted to raise those issues with you.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness G, we have decided to accept your request to postpone the commencement of your cross-examination by Mr. Weyl until tomorrow morning.  So you are free to leave the courtroom.  However, our proceedings are going to continue for a bit longer, and it might be desirable for the link to continue during the ensuing period of time before we take our adjournment today. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, when do we resume tomorrow morning, and are we sitting only in the morning or will we be sitting the whole day tomorrow, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, a number of factors developed and we are not able to sit after lunch tomorrow.  So our sitting will conclude at 1.30 tomorrow.  Now, we are actually going to start sitting -- we are likely to start sitting at 8.45 tomorrow morning, that is Arusha time, for the continuation of the cross-examination of 
Witness GFJ, and then we will commence with Mr. Weyl's cross-examination of Witness G at 10 o'clock.  So that is our proposed schedule for tomorrow. 
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, would that be 9 o'clock in The Hague?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Witness G's testimony will continue at the time his testimony has continued every morning during his testimony, and I think that is 9 o'clock in The Hague. 
MS. TALON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have three matters I wanted to deal with in respect to the witness 
Ahmed Mbonyunkiza.  First I had invited the Prosecution that, after you denied my motion to have the witness investigated for perjury, to withdraw the witness, and I would ask the Prosecution if they are going to do that at this time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Quite frankly, I didn't take that as a serious request.  Does it really require a response?
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I think I have the response then, so nothing further is needed on that.  

And then, Mr. President, I was wondering, in light of Mr. Morley's invitations to which I was required to respond or suggested to respond, if I could put an invitation to the Prosecution whether it is their case that there is some discrepancy between the two witnesses in terms of date or otherwise, or whether it is their case that Witness G is being untruthful when he has given the testimony concerning Mr. Mbonyunkiza or whether it is the case that Mr. Mbonyunkiza is being untruthful in his testimony? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I wish we had a court reporter that could read back a question in the way that I'm -- because I actually didn't get the first portion of what you asked.  But I surmise you're asking me to inform the Court and inform the parties which witness is more reliable.  That seems to be the gist of the question.  I don't think it's something that the Prosecutor has to answer.  The foundation hasn't been laid.  I -- whether there is a contradiction between one witness's testimony and another is a matter for the Court to resolve when it weighs all of the evidence.  At this stage the question is irrelevant.  It's not appropriate and I certainly don't plan on responding to it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I am actually quite serious about this, because it seems to me that, as an officer the Court, each of us have a duty not to lead evidence which we know to be false.  And it also seemed to me, from the testimony of Witness G, that there is no other rational explanation, then the testimony of one of these two witnesses is false, and it appears to me that the Prosecution has an obligation to make that determination for itself before proceeding with the testimony of a witness who -- the testimony it knows to be false.  I am asking the Prosecutor to make a determination in its own mind or at least inform the Trial Chamber as to what is its position.  Are they taking the position that there is some way to reconcile the testimony of these two witnesses, or are they taking the position that the testimony of one or the other is false?  
MR. WEBSTER:
This discussion can go on ad nauseam, but Mr. Robinson uses the term "testimony".  GFJ testified for over a week.  Witness G testified for almost the same length of time.  What portion of each witness's testimony is Defence counsel referring to when he suggests that there is some inconsistency.  With respect to each witness, even if we limit ourselves to the month of February 1992, which I believe was Mr. Robinson's initial submission, it has not been clarified what time each witness arrived to the meeting in question and if they attended the same meetings.  All of that stuff are matters for the Court to resolve on its own when all of the evidence in the case comes in.  These aren't the only two witnesses that are going to offer testimony about the events in 1992.  So the question is inappropriate.  I have never been asked, as standing in the place of the Prosecutor, questions along this line, neither in this Tribunal, nor in any other jurisdiction that I've practised in. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I just note that I was asked to state my case with respect to the credibility of the witness, which I did, and particularly in this case Witness GFJ or Mr. Mbonyunkiza, the thrust of his testimony is that in 1992, in February, he attended three meetings at which Mr. Ngirumpatse said that Tutsis should be exterminated.  Witness G said that he attended the Wednesday night meetings of the Interahamwe during the same period, and perhaps he missed one, but he would have at least attended three out of four in February, and that no such statements were ever made by Mr. Ngirumpatse, that no songs were sang to exterminate Tutsis, and that no axes were distributed, and that no military training was required of Interahamwe.  

In my view, those two witnesses are irreconcilable, and so I do not believe the Prosecution should be allowed to proceed to offer testimony of a witness who it knows to be false. 

Judge Short, I see you are grimacing, so perhaps I am not making a point that's very persuasive to you, but to me it seems that this is a question of professional ethics. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, do you think this is the time to discuss the credibility of the witnesses, especially when you haven't completed your cross-examination of one of those witnesses?  And what kind of order do you think the Chamber can make in response to your request; compel the Prosecution to withdraw one witness?  I mean, what kind of order are you requesting the bench to make?
MR. ROBINSON:
That's a good question, Your Honour, and I'm not asking the bench to make any order.  I was really calling upon the Prosecution to withdraw this witness.  And I myself was a Prosecutor for ten years in the United States, and if I had the kind of information they do right now about a witness who is going to resume his testimony, I would not allow that witness to take the stand as a witness for the Prosecution, and I'm suggesting that they have a similar duty and that they should be -- they should withdraw this witness on their own.  But I agree, if they don't do it on their own, you have no power to do so.  So I think I have made as much of an entreaty to them as I can make.  Maybe I'll move onto my second point.  The second point, Mr. President, is, may I receive the letter of Mr. Mbonyunkiza that has been the subject of the president's response and the response of the witness victim section to that letter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that your second or third matter?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That was my second matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you ask the third first?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  The third is actually an enquiry that I would like to address to Judge Kam so that I can understand how my cross-examination should be prepared.  And Judge Kam, I would like to enquire whether or not as of now you have had the opportunity to review any of the video of this witness's testimony, so I know whether you are coming into the middle of the movie or you're seeing it from its continuation.  That will assist me in framing my questions to this witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Is this direct or cross-examination?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, with regard to your question number two, the letter, we have considered that the letter is not necessary for -- it doesn't have a necessary relationship to the testimony of the witness.  We also see it as a communication -- private communication between the witness and the president of the Tribunal. 

We are not disposed to grant its publication without the consent of the witness.  So as of now we maintain our order that it is not disclosed, or it is not disclosed as a result of our order. 

With regard to your enquiry, I suppose the most polite way to make the point is that Judge Kam is not a compellable witness.  However, he has asked me to indicate that he is ready to participate in the continued cross-examination of the witness.  Are there any other issues?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, now that Mr. Robinson raised the issue of document production, I did raise an issue some time last week about the inspection of one of the documents that the witness had offered -- offered for inspection, that he brought with him, and I think the registry was going to enquire with WVSS.  If that document could be made available to the parties.  I haven't received it.  I don't know if they have enquired of the witness or not.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, we enquired of the witness and he refused to hand over the document. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have one other issue and that is that, again, I have made an application that the Prosecution be required to disclose, by Monday the 24th, its list of witnesses for the next session, and I see that that time is getting very close, so I would ask that you make a ruling. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  No, the -- we didn't want to make a ruling on the motion at this point.  We -- I -- the Trial Chamber coordinator, I think what he wanted to do was to have a status conference first before making scheduling orders, and I -- I think that our trial coordinator is in the process of making arrangements to schedule such a (unintelligible).  We decided that we should not do it this week because lead counsel for two of the Accused are not in Arusha, and so it will be scheduled as early as possible next week.  At that time we will consider that and other related issues.  I'm sorry I did not tell you this before.  

Are there any other issues?  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have two questions, housekeeping matters, basically.  We have the first problem, namely, that the Defence has been present at The Hague throughout the testimony of Witness G.  Madam Hounkpatin has planned to come back on Friday evening and that travelling arrangement is firm.  Counsel, Dior Diagne also would be travelling back after the hearing, so we request authorisation to be represented by our legal assistant, Counsel Anita Guissé, who would jointly represent the Defence teams from Monday morning -- from Tuesday morning, rather. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think the routine answer is yes, permission is granted.  I think that the order we made initially would permit that to take place in any event. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Second question is much more personal and I -- I'm a little sorry, but let me say that I am disappointed somewhat by this postponement of Witness G's testimony.  I said so because my disappointment is even greater given that I had expected to have the full day of tomorrow for cross-examination which I will try to limit as much as possible, but I don't believe I will be able to finish my cross-examination in one half day, in a half day.  I take note of what the Trial Chamber has said implicitly, but my problem is that I am expected to be in Paris on Monday and Tuesday, so I find myself, professionally speaking, in a very difficult situation.  There will be no hearing from The Hague on Monday, as I understand, and I do not see how I can proceed with my cross-examination on Tuesday then. 

Against this backdrop, would it be possible to start my cross-examination tomorrow morning and wrap up on Wednesday?  Would that be -- would the Court be amenable to that, that is, if I do not finish my cross-examination tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I hope you noticed my grimace.  I think that we should take it step by step.  Let's see what happens tomorrow and then we will decide if necessary. 
MR. WEYL:
Much obliged, Mr. President.  I have heard your answer very clearly.  Thank you, sir.
MR. WEBSTER:
If we have the time, I will go onto a housekeeping matter on translations with regard to one of the Defence exhibits, and I will refer myself to D. NZ34, which was an exhibit in Kinyarwanda.  I am aware that there is a French translation for that which is among the Prosecution exhibits, and it can be found at K-number K0249019 to 9021.  So I don't know if Mr. Robinson wants to have a look at that before -- and consider whether it should be moved into evidence as well, but that would at least give the Court an opportunity to see the Kinyarwanda extract in its French translation. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I would move that into admission as Exhibit D. NZ34B and make the Kinyarwandan D. NZ34A, and if Mr. Webster could tell me what tab that is in so I can find it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That admission is made, and you can make the arrangements with the registrar when you rise. 
(Exhibit D. NZ34A and D. NZ34B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can take the adjournment now, and we start tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1728H)
