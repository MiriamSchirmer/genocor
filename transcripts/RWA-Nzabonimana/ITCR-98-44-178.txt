P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY: 
Yes, Your Honour.
  
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, 
Monday, the 10th October 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of 
the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have appearances, please?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning, Your Honour, and welcome back to Judge Kam.  This morning the Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster; Stephen Rapp, the chief of prosecution, is also a member of the active bench this morning; Ian Morley and Takeh Sendze.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Defence, starting with Ngirumpatse -- Karemera.  
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours, and greetings to the Office of the Prosecutor and its representatives.  My name is Mbape Moussa Félix Sow.  I'm co-counsel for Mr. Edouard Karemera, whose interest I have the great honour of defending.  On our team we have Mr. Léopold Nsengiyumva and Ms. Dior Diagne, who is presently at The Hague.  I thank you, 
Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. WEYL: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours, and greetings to the Prosecution.  My name is Frédéric Weyl, and I am co-counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I have with me Ms. Anta Guissé, who is a lawyer at the Paris bar.  She is our legal assistant.  And we have also Ignace Ngulimanse, who is the investigator on our team, and Ms. Chantal Hounkpatin is at The Hague as you well know.  This was announced earlier before this session.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  I'm Peter Robinson, representing Mr. Nzirorera.  Léopold Nsengiyumva, my legal assistant, will be joining us shortly.  I'm also assisted by two interns, Russell Hopkins and Gina Mensah-Datsa, and I don't have anyone in The Hague.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I take it that you made your presence felt in The Hague during the course of last week, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I did, Mr. President.  I want to give special thanks to Judge Kam for that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And I should also indicate for the records, Your Honours, that Gregory Lombardi is representing the Office of the Prosecutor in The Hague.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I gather that you gave notice that you had an issue or two that you wish to raise this morning.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President, I do.  

Sorry to have to put my computer up here, but our -- we didn't have any -- our printer wasn't working in the Defence this weekend.  

Okay, the first item I want to raise with the Trial Chamber -- when we last spoke I told you that I was considering asking for permission to resign from this case, and I will let you know today that I did consider and I have decided that although I'm disappointed and discouraged, I'm going to continue to fight for my client and, in fact, I'm going to try to redouble my efforts.  So you'll have me with you in the foreseeable future.  

My first motion that I'm going to make this morning is to ask you to reconsider your decision that the next witness testify in closed session.  And that there are some new developments that I would like to bring to your attention.  

The first is a decision of the Appeals Chamber on Friday in the Bagosora case.  In that case, the decision on interlocutory appeals of a decision on witness protection orders, the Appeals Chamber said that when a trial chamber adopts witness protection measures, it's considered to be adopting the least restrictive measures necessary to provide for the protection of victims or witnesses, and its order should be interpreted in that light.  

In that particular case, they decided that the Prosecution should be allowed to make enquiries about the immigration records of Defence witnesses, and even use the names of the witnesses in making such inquiries, interpreting their witness protection order in the Bagosora case in the most -- in the least restrictive light so that that could be accomplished.  

The second new element I would like to bring to your attention is that over the weekend I came into possession of an internal e-mail of the Office of the Prosecutor in which Mr. Webster called the 
Trial Chamber's orders for protective measures for Witness G "extreme".  And he said, "Quite frankly, I'm not completely comfortable that the witness's entire testimony will be in closed session.  I think we should protect his identity only.  I'm ashamed to say I agree with Robinson on the public policy issue of keeping his entire testimony -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President, co-counsel please slow down or provide interpreters with a copy of what he is reading.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, did you hear that?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I did.  

The e-mail said, "Quite frankly, I'm not completely comfortable with the fact that the testimony will be entirely in closed session.  I think we should protect his identity only.  I'm ashamed to say I agree with Robinson on the public policy issue of keeping his entire testimony hidden from the public."  So I would like the Trial Chamber to consider that change of position by the Office of the Prosecutor in its decision on whether the entire testimony of this next witness should be in closed session.  

The third new element I want to bring to your attention is that in connection with his previous witness, Witness Ahmed Mbonyunkiza, who testified publicly, I received a letter last week from a member of the public who had learnt of his testimony and who reacted to it by providing information that the testimony was not accurate in certain respects.  And in this letter he gave me the names of five people I could meet in Kigali who could give me information that could contradict the testimony of that first witness.  And I think that that demonstrates how important it is that testimony be public, and how we are prejudiced when testimony is taken entirely in closed session.  

Finally, to conclude my motion for reconsideration, I would just like to address to Judge Short the fact that this same witness testified in the Bizimungu case, in which you were a part, and it was in open session, and there were no problems.  And even at one point, the Trial Chamber directed the co-counsel for Casimir Bizimungu to cross-examine the witness from The Hague when it appeared that the lead counsel, Ms. Saint-Laurent, might be unavailable that day when she was supposed to do the cross-examination, and I hope you can recall that.  

And, now, in this case, it's completely changed:  there is no cross-examination from The Hague and the entire testimony is to be held in closed session.  And I just don't understand why Mr. Nzirorera can receive less justice than Casimir Bizimungu.  And so, finally, I would like to say that if you have closed session testimony from this witness and Witness T, and witness -- these are the two most important witnesses in the case.  The consequences of that, looking down the road, is that the parties would be able -- unable to discuss their testimony and probably file closed -- closing briefs, and you would be unable to discuss their testimony in a properly filed judgment at the end of this case.  

So, not only will you have decided to hold a closed session based on secret information that's known only to you and the Prosecutor, and hidden from the Defence and the public, but the facts and the reasons, the ultimate judgment, would be hidden from the public as well.  And I think this is a disservice to the Accused and to the public, and to history, and to justice, and I'd ask you to reconsider.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the -- the major topic of your -- that you wished to raise before us?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's the first motion.  I can go through the other ones if you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you give us notice of what they are?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  The second motion is to postpone the testimony of Witness T -- excuse me, Witness G, based on late disclosures and incomplete disclosure of Rule 68 material.  And the other motion, if we go ahead with the testimony, is to permit to voir dire the witness on the necessity of protective measures before he begins his substantive testimony.  So I can -- those are the topics.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, can we hear you on the first motion?  
MR. RAPP:
Yes, Your Honour.  Mr. President, Your Honours, may it please the Court.  I'm happy to be here.  This is, in fact, the fourth time that I've led the testimony of this particular witness, and this involves the decision by the Office of the Prosecutor that with certain key witnesses that it be important that a single Prosecution counsel be involved with those individuals in order that consistent arguments are made by the office, and that matters that had come up before in regard to the witness can be drawn to the attention of the Trial Chamber.  

In this regard, I note that this is, I think, a second motion to reconsider.  I saw a ruling by this Chamber last week in which Mr. Robinson raised again the issue of the closed session after the decision by 
Your Honours of the 14th of September 2005.  He cites, in support, this decision in the Bagosora appeal.  I do not believe that that case does more than state the general principle that -- that witness protection measures should be -- be the least restrictive.  And I don't think that changes anything in terms of your judge -- decision.  

As far as the e-mail, a reminder of perhaps the more gentile time in the 1920s when a certain diplomat said that gentlemen do not read other gentlemen's mail, and I don't know how Mr. Robinson gained access to this particular document.  But that said, the sentiments expressed there are generally those of the Office of the Prosecutor, which is that if you can go in open session, we favour open session, we favour transparency, we want the world to see what's happening here in Arusha; we are proud of what our office is doing and what this Tribunal is doing in -- in establishing justice in this area.  

As to this particular witness, it is correct that in the past -- and I have led him three times -- we have followed a practice of some closed and some open on direct examination because it was possible for me to go through some subject matter without him identifying himself, using certain exhibits as essentially code sheets where he could refer to persons by number, and we were able to do that.  That did require some repetition as we returned to discuss the same topic in closed session to amplify the answer and to provide more personal detail.  There was some artificiality in that the witness was testifying in open session without necessarily establishing his own personal involvement, and -- but it was necessary to do that in order not to be going back and forth between open and closed session on multiple occasions.  

In the particular situation which we find ourselves now, we have a witness that has very important testimony.  I think I dare say more important testimony in this case than in the others because he is providing evidence as to each of the three Accused, whereas in the other cases his evidence focused on only one, not all of the accused.  And, obviously, his involvement in the Interahamwe, being the youth wing of the MRND, relates very strongly to the executive committee of the MRND on which it's alleged these three gentlemen sat.  So it's -- it's important testimony that will take some time.  

I'm going to endeavour to complete this closed -- this examination in two days.  If it's in closed session I believe that's possible because we won't have to bounce back and forth.  If it's in closed and open it may take a little bit longer.  

In regard to the Bizimungu matter, I think it's important to note -- and Judge Short will recall this -- that that actually -- that conduct of that examination, cross-examination of this witness, then known as Witness D, actually confirms the merit in Your Honours' decision.  

In that particular case, co-counsel for Mr. Casimir Bizimungu declined to examine at The Hague when the chief counsel, Ms. Michele Saint-Laurent, took sick in Arusha on the grounds that she was not in direct contact with her client and, therefore, she couldn't engage in proper cross-examination or follow within the direct examination.  And for that reason, we couldn't proceed on that particular day.  And I think that underlies the importance of having the attorney that's going to examine be here with client.  And that's what your -- what Your Honours have ordered to the extent that a team has decided to go forward with only one counsel, instead of two, and that makes sense that that counsel be here rather than at The Hague.  

Your Honours, we are willing to go forward in closed and open session with myself going forth in open session probably for approximately three-quarters of a day and then closed session for a quarter of a day, and then back into open and then back into closed for probably half each of the last day.  So -- or longer, but probably about 60 percent open and 40 percent closed.  

I should note that in doing that there are developments here that Mr. Robinson makes some reference to in his later motions, which have to do with the fact that -- that this case does relate powerfully to the case of Witness T, who'd appear later.  Last week when I was at The Hague, I received notice that Witness T had given a 16-page statement to (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) authorities in regard to Witness G.  Believing that that would be Rule 68 material, I contacted the federal prosecutor in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), had a copy brought to me at The Hague, had it faxed here, and it was disclosed to the Defence with minor redactions consistent with the motion that was filed earlier on our part under Rule 66(C) regarding the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) materials.  

That statement, however, was given on the 29th of September, and in an amazing example of international cooperation and speed, it was in the hands of the Defence within one week.  And -- but I should note that in regard to the Witness T matter, Witness T -- the case of Witness T was referred to (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) authorities in June of 19 -- of 2004.  Even though he is essentially pleading guilty, the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) are conducting their investigations.  They are anticipating a trial in like 2006/2007, so that's very much a moving target.  New developments are occurring all the time.  If the testimony of Witness G is delayed, the -- there would be other issues that would come up whenever it's conducted.  So I don't think there is merit to that argument or that being anticipated.  

But in regard to this issue, I would note that because of the Witness T trial, there's been a lot of notice in the press regarding the relationship between Witnesses T and G, and that having this session -- session here in closed -- in open session, this time as we get very close to the -- to the T trial, will occasion more comments, more disruption, more examples of one witness reading what the other is saying in newspapers, and that kind of thing.  And I think that -- that it's probably a bit more conscious approach to go in closed session here so that we don't create complications for the T investigation and trial.  

Thank you very much, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it seems to me that it might be reasonable to have considered your motions one and two at the same time.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  

My second motion is to postpone the testimony of Witness G, based upon items which have 
recently -- only recently been disclosed to us and items which I do not believe have yet been disclosed to us, but for which -- to which we are entitled.  

Mr. Rapp made reference to the 16-page statement of Witness T on which he was interviewed specifically about Witness G, and so it's highly relevant statement.  I don't attribute any bad motive to the Prosecutor for delay.  I think Mr. Rapp has a history of complying very well with Rule 68, and he did so very honourably in this case.  The fact is, though, that we didn't receive this statement until Friday afternoon.  It's entirely in French.  I tried to gain some appreciation of it with my poor French, but I'm certainly not in a position to use it for cross-examination, and it's highly relevant.  Basically, Witness T calls Witness G a lair, and gives particular examples about it.  And so it's something that's very important, and the substance of which I need to use in the cross-examination.  

Secondly, I notice it's redacted, and I don't believe that under Rule 68 that there should be any redactions for exculpatory evidence.  If there is some application of Rule 66(C), that rule by its own terms apply simply to disclosure under Rule 66 and not Rule 68.  And so I am asking that we receive this statement in unredacted form.  

However, this is just basically the tip of the iceberg of a larger problem because we received last week a CD containing over 1,200 pages and we have not had time to go through that to determine if there are other references to items to be covered in the examination of Witness G.  And these are witnesses who ran together, were best friends, and are joint to the hip for many of the events through which -- the subject of which Witness G's testimony would cover.  And because of that, we are not prepared to begin our cross-examination of Witness G.

Also, that disclosure is incomplete because at the same time the Prosecution disclosed the one CD from Witness T that it took from (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), it has two other CDs that he refuses to disclose and has filed with the Trial Chamber in connection with the motion under Rule 66(C), asking you to apply that rule to (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) materials.  And that's the subject of written pleadings which you already have before you, both motions, responses and replies.  And I believe that a decision on that motion is necessary so that before Witness G testifies so that we could also have access to that material which is now being withheld from us.  

The next issue with respect to non-disclosure is interview reports of Désiré Murenzi.  You may recall that we discussed this in connection with the first witness, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, and I asked that any statements of Mr. Murenzi be produced as Rule 68 material, and Mr. Webster advised the 
Trial Chamber that he was not aware of any statements of Désiré Murenzi.  But I see on page 14 of the Witness T interview that was just disclosed to us Friday afternoon, that there are quotations from an interview from Désiré Murenzi.  And I believe that that interview and its information is Rule 68 material, bearing not on only the previous witness, but on Witness G as well.  And I request that that be disclosed before Witness G testifies.  

Secondly, in the statement of Witness T on -- disclosed to us on Friday, he discloses the existence of what he terms as a conspiracy between Witness G and another officer of the Interahamwe committee named Pheneas Ruhumuliza.  And according to Witness T, after the events in 1996 in Nairobi, 
Witness G and Mr. Ruhumuliza got together and concocted a story that would extricate themselves from culpability as far as the Interahamwe's committee is concerned.  

I'm aware that the Prosecution had many interviews with Mr. Ruhumuliza before he died, and I'm requesting disclosure under Rule 68 and also Rule 66(B) material -- items material to the Defence of all the statements made by Mr. Ruhumuliza because I believe they now are both material and exculpatory because they affect the credibility of a Prosecution witness, that being Witness G. So we're receiving material late and because there's material not yet received, I'm asking that you continue (sic) your testimony of Witness G until we've had sufficient time to receive all that we are entitled to in connection with his testimony and to digest it and prepare for his cross-examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, is it possible for you to spell the Kinyarwanda names that you've just referred to?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I will try my best.  Mr. Murenzi is M-U-R-E-N-Z-I, and Mr. Ruhumuliza is R-U-H-U-M-U-L-I-Z-A.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, I thank you.  

I would wish to remind the Chamber that the matters which have been raised by Mr. Robinson go along with what I said in my brief last Monday.  Maybe you will recall, Mr. President, our exchange when you had the surprise that you expressed by disappointment.  I was specifically asking that all testimony linked to the disclosure of a single CD-ROM concerning Witness T be deferred, and we were told by the Prosecutor that my question was of no relevance because we are dealing with Witness T who has nothing to do with other witnesses, especially Witness G. 

I would like to say that the partial disclosure given to us on Friday shows that quite obviously material concerning Witness T have a lot of consequences on testimony and statements by Witness G, and it is not sufficient for us to have testimony of Witness G without having equality of arms, without having all the documentation concerning Witness T, and without being limited to partial disclosure and discretionary and arbitrary disclosure which you need to consider.  And we cannot continue in this way, and in this is the essence of my motion of 3rd October.  

I'm sorry that I have to come back to this, but this has been brought about by what has been said by 
Mr. Robinson, in other words, the late disclosure of materials which makes it very difficult for us to respond to any testimony given the fact that the Prosecution has in its possession material which it is only partially disclosing to the Defence.  I thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, if I may respond, I hope, briefly because I know the witness and their party -- the witness and the parties are waiting in The Hague.  But, first of all, let me just note that with regard to this Witness T matter, we've endeavoured to make sure that as we went through we provided any material that might be Rule 68 as to witness G in this case.  Now, we can -- we can begin arguing the Witness T issue at some point in the future, but let me just say that this involves an extremely delicate issue where if 100 percent disclosure were made of the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) file, we would lose the testimony of Witness T, that he would no longer -- his attorney would refuse to have him appear.  Or perhaps the Defence wants that to be the result of this situation, but there is an on-going investigation in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal); there are (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) laws; there's his own defence; there's his own ability to call his own witnesses and to provide information to the -- to the juge d'instructions, and if everything in this file is revealed to the Accused in this case, his attorney believes that that would interfere with the trial in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  And it's a delicate balancing issue that's going to have to be made by this Trial Chamber, and obviously with that testimony now deferred until 2006, there would be an opportunity to do that.  

I would note just for Mr. Robinson in regard to the rule issue, and I'm not sure it was cited put we'd certainly cite it in our reply, there is a new amendment to Rule 68, 68(D) specifically, that does provide that the Rule 66(C) procedure applies as well even to exculpatory, even evidence that would be exculpatory in the sense that it would mitigate the guilt of an accused or suggest his innocence, or affect the credibility of Prosecution or -- evidence.  That can be withheld in the interest of on-going investigations or the interest of any state, and we submit that that could occur in this situation in regard to the team material.  

Here, however, we are talking about Witness G, and the Prosecution has made extensive disclosure regarding what it has as to this witness.  We are dealing -- we're dealing right here only in terms of the withholding aspect of the material that's in the possession of the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) government.  And though they've now shared that with us under the understanding that we would ask this Trial Chamber to make its determination under its rules, consistent with the interests of various -- of that state and consistent with the on-going investigation interests that they are pursuing.  

As far as G is concerned, I should note that obviously justice is more important than convenience.  But we've had great difficulty arranging for this witness to appear.  For him to come involves the cooperation of two states.  It required intervention at the highest level to convince the Dutch government to again provide protection on its soil.  Basically, we indicated to them that we would exercise all best efforts to make sure that this would be the third occasion where they would have to provide that protection for the ICTY on our behalf, and said that we would make every effort to assure that this witness could conclude his testimony in this trial and also in the trial of Ndingliyimana (sic) and others during the current session.  A delay further, having been brought to The Hague already and prepared to testify on the 3rd of October, would cause us extreme difficulty in the future in terms of arranging for the participation of this witness.  And as much as we'd like to believe witnesses can come and will always be available, we have to do and WVSS and everybody has to do great efforts to make sure that they are available.  And he might not be available in the future if this were deferred.  

Finally, in -- with regard to the issue of Mr. Ruhumuliza -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  On that note -- 
MR. RAPP:
Pardon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
On that note, a matter which might be of interest to us would be that if, in fact, the -- as time develops and there's subsequent disclosure of information from Witness T which requires consideration of further challenges to the Witness G's credibility, are you suggesting that an order the Court might make for Witness G to be available for further cross-examination might not be one that could be obeyed?  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, for a moment here I lost my sound and so I hope I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question had to do with your comment about -- with -- it related to your comment about Witness G not being able to return to The Hague.  The comment that you made triggered a thought in my mind which I just wished you to comment on.  If we decided to go along with the examination now and the fears expressed by the Defence materialised, in that further disclosures from Witness T produce material which challenged -- which required a further challenge to Witness G's credibility, are you saying that an order the Court might make for Witness G to be cross-examined in relation to that material is one which might not be possible of being obeyed?  
MR. RAPP:
I understand your question, Your Honour.  First of all, understand that the Prosecution would have a great interest in making sure that such -- such cross-examination could take place.  The danger of a witness not being available for cross-examine falls very hard on the party offering the witnesses, and if we were not to make him available under those circumstances, we could well lose the whole benefit of his testimony, and we don't want to take that risk.  So that's our interest.  

In regard to the particular situation of having him testify at The Hague, The Hague -- I mean, this witness under -- refuses under any circumstances to come to Arusha.  There could be other alternatives for the witness, particularly for short testimony from another location by video links.  So I don't want to foreclose the possibility that the witness could come back.  The situation at The Hague, however, works quite conveniently because of the availability of personnel and witness protection services.  That could be occasioned elsewhere, and there's certainly the chance of this witness who'd be recalled for brief testimony in single-accused cases.  

As will be complained during his examination and in compliance with the Court's order of 19th April 2005 regarding the circumstances of the witness and his subsistence and quick measures that he's been provided and a witness protection programme of a third country, one of the difficulties with him has become because of the fact that he must prepared to come for testimony four or five and six weeks segments.  He's been unable to -- that country has not permitted him to look for work because he couldn't tell his employer, under their rules, where he was going for those long periods of time.  It's certainly our hope that after this session he can become fully employed and be, if necessary, occasionally available.  But his availability for a long session, like the one that we have envisioned here, three weeks between the two trials, I think would be very, very difficult to arrange because I don't believe that it would be easy to convince the Dutch to a fourth time provide protection for this witness on this -- while he is in The Hague.  If that clarifies the issue and immediately there are some uncertainties there, Your Honour.  

But we recognise that as we deal with this moving targets of the T case, matters could come out in this trial that would require witnesses to be recalled.  And, certainly, as you know from the 66(C) motion that we filed, we indicate that all material in that (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) file would become available after his trial, and that may well occasion that kind of circumstance.  But we can't actually fix the date of that trial.   They haven't done so yet.  It hasn't been said in the schedule of the -- set down in the schedule of the cour d'assises in ************because the investigation is not complete.  So that may well happen.  

But if we wait on them, we will wait and lose time here and not be able to put on a case that we can put on.  

Now, in regard to the Pheneas Ruhumuliza matter, as Mr. Robinson is aware, we were prepared of course to lead Witness G back on the 17th of May 2004 before this trial had to be re-started, and at that time he had raised the issue of that individual.  I had personally reviewed the statement of 010, as he was called, Mr. Ruhumuliza having been an informant of the Office of the Prosecutor before his death, and determined a very brief handwritten statement that he had provided to our tracking team that there was no exculpatory material in there whatsoever.  And having recalled that statement this morning, that remains our position.  It is not the obligation of the Office of the Prosecutor to provide everything that's in its files regarding these individuals who provided great assistance to our tracking team and the success of this Tribunal in arresting 71 people in 26 different countries.  As part of our -- the strategy of this Tribunal, we don't have to disclose that unless it's exculpatory.  And then, of course, there are provisions such as Rule 68(D) even for excluding it.  

But under the circumstances, I submit, having reviewed this it file, that a more than adequate cross-examination can be done, based upon everything that's been provided, and that I know of no other material that -- in our possession that calls into question the credibility of this witness.  If I discover that matter -- and I will continue to search every day and every night -- we will, as I've done in the past and as Mr. Robinson recognises, make that material available.  And so I think that we need to proceed with this witness on this occasion, take advantage of the time, take advantage of the fact that he is in The Hague ready to be heard.  
Mr. Robinson may complain about the fact that the statements are in French.  That's the language they were given in on the 29th of September.  He can presumably obtain the assistance of people to assist him with translation as can -- as can others, and that can't really be an excuse from dealing with original documents which were produced of themselves -- actually statements given themselves on the very eve of the testimony.  We can't basically tell the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) you can't proceed or hide the statement.  It's in French and Mr. Robinson couldn't understand it.  Our obligation is to provide the best that we can.  And with the individuals on the Defence side, with the assistance of his Francophone client, to understand that document and be able to cross-examine not today, but no sooner than Wednesday.  

Thank you very much, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I'm a bit confused but I'm surprised at how each time we are told that possibly if we get there, we can bring back the witness for further cross-examination.  That conditional statement shows how difficult it could be to be sure about that matter.  

Furthermore, it's not an issue of just allowing the cross-examination.  The Defence has rights to ask all of the witnesses it needs to, but also to know which questions it should ask, when, and how to ask them, and also if it should not ask them.  We cannot build a cross-examination when the adversary is hiding their hand.  We need to know what their cards are to build our cross-examination, even if it's the case maybe to fill out questions that I otherwise might have asked, and that can only be known if we have the full information.  

The solution proposed by the Prosecution is to put it off to a later date.  We want a transparent case where the Prosecutor is not hiding anything and hiding any information and prohibiting the Defence from playing its normal role.  This has caused considerable prejudice to the Defence, and it cannot be repaired by the possibility of a further cross-examination if the witness should like to appear for that.  

I would like to add that for all of these --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, your comment "hiding their hand," is there any evidence to support the conclusion that the Prosecution has information which they are hiding?  

As -- I understand that they have an obligation, a continuing obligation to disclose material as it is discovered.  And my question had related to the possibility of the discovery of future material -- the future discovery of material.  I was not alluding to the possibility that they might have information which they are not disclosing, and I wasn't aware that that was, in fact, was the situation.  I don't know if you have any comment on that.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, on this issue, I can only go back to my own brief of the 3rd of October in which I mentioned that the Prosecutor even admitted that they had elements that they received following the Chamber's decision saying that they were obstructing the proceedings by not disclosing documents that we should have.  The Prosecution themselves acknowledged that they have information that they are keeping and thereby refusing the Defence access.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, if I could also answer your question.  I think it's answered by the fact that there is redacted material both in the statement that was given to us on Friday and the two CDs that were given to you last week, along with the Rule 66(C).  So we know that there is material in their possession that they -- currently that has not been disclosed to us and the propriety of those redactions is something that we ask the Chamber to decide before we proceed with the testimony.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, the -- the question relating the redaction, what was the protective order which was being observed in the particular redactions that were made?  
MR. RAPP:
Understand we are dealing here with Witness T and the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) materials, where there has been resistance on the part of the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) authorities to provide us materials here because their cases under investigation before a judge of instruction or examining magistrate are secret.  And we proceeded with him and with counsel for the accused to discuss a way in which a certain matter could be disclosed and other matter posed for redaction or exclusion from disclosure, and that we would approach the Trial Chamber with -- with our basis for doing that, and do that in the context of this motion that we filed under 66(C) and 68(D).  And so the proposal that we have made is in the motion that was filed here about two weeks ago regarding the redactions.  The matters that are redacted deal with issues that if they were disclosed, would impact the right of fair trial of the accused Mr. T, not of Mr. G, but of Mr. T in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  And for that reason, they must be excluded from disclosure until his trial takes place in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  And we've given that -- we -- we've indicated before everything that we've received from the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) has been disclosed to the Trial Chamber.

Additionally, there were some Rule 70(A) material entirely internal for the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) system communication between judges and prosecutors in their civil law system, and between judicial police and examining magistrate that we submit are 78(A) material and would be so here.  We don't think that material should ever be made subject to disclosure.  But our position with this material was that very much to say, we will obtain it from the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal); we will deliver it in total to the Trial Chamber.  We will disclose what we believe we can, according to the proposal given to us by the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) and -- and then leave it to the Trial Chamber to decide whether what we are doing is reasonable.  

Now, we have in the course of doing that --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp.  
MR. RAPP:
Yes, sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you misunderstood my question.  The -- you disclosed a statement to the Defence over the weekend.  
MR. RAPP:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In that statement, there were certain redactions.  My question related only to that statement.  You see, we noticed when we saw it that there were also certain protected information which were disclosed, for example, the name and the address of the witness was disclosed.  And so my question related to what was the basis of the material that was redacted?  What -- which order, what was the interest of the redaction?  
MR. RAPP:
This relates to what I have indicated.  This is part of the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) judicial dossier, and we followed the same pattern with that statement that we followed with all the others, and that was not to redact information about this particular witness whom we know where he is and what the situation is with him, not to redact it in the conventional witness protection way, but to redact only a small amount of material in which something is presented to the witness to comment on and we excluded that presentation to the witness, but then proceeded to include his full answer.  So the sum and substance of what he wanted to provide on that material is then disclosed to that Defence.  It's that precis in the question where they were referring to something that is a secret part of their investigation that we have excluded, and we have done that based upon their -- their request to us.  

Frankly in this particular case, the matters that are redacted are not particularly damaging, in my own view, but we are committed to our (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) colleagues to provide for this measure of protection until the Trial Chamber decides differently, and if the Trial Chamber decides differently, then we will have to go back to them and see if it's still possible for arrange for the presence of Witness T.  So that's -- that's why we've done this particular matter.  

And if you look at the statement, Your Honours, that were provided to you in an unredacted form and the relatively minor redactions on the latter pages of that 16-page statement that we've made, I think you'll see exactly what's been excluded and you'll see that there is not a material prejudice to the Defence that that matter is redacted.  And I believe there'd be time to consider that before cross-examination begins. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  May I also make a comment on that question of yours.  

I notice that this Rule 66(C) procedure that the Prosecution has engaged in was something that you considered when you granted my request to the assistance of the government of (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) to produce these records.  And you rejected the Prosecutor's use of Rule 66(C). You said it was inappropriate, that if the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) government had some interest in their records that they wanted to seek protection, that they were the ones that were supposed to do that to the Trial Chamber.  But, instead, the Prosecutor, despite an explicit order from this Trial Chamber to the contrary, went ahead and took material that I had requested that the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) government was obligated to give to all parties, which is exactly the words you used in your order, they took it and hijacked it for themselves and now are applying 
Rule 66(C) in direct contravention of your order.  So my answer to your question is they have no legal right whatsoever to make any of these redactions, and that the material should be given to us unredacted before Witness G testifies.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber will rise for a few minutes at this time.  
(Court recessed at 1000H)
(Pages 1 to 17 by Gifty C. Harding)




























(Court resumed at 1057H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have come to a decision on the -- on both of the motions which were moved by Defence for Nzirorera.  With regard to the application to reconsider the protective order to hear the testimony of this witness in closed session, on the basis of the Prosecutor's statement in open court this morning, the Chamber considers that it is appropriate to grant the Defence motion to hear the witness in open session.  The Prosecution can apply for closed session -- sessions where appropriate during the witness's testimony.  

The Chamber invites the Prosecutor, however, to combine all of the closed-session questions in one segment as far as that is possible.  Likewise, if the Defence has to cross-examine on issues that ought to be in closed session, the Defence is also invited to combine those closed-session questions in one session as far as that is possible.  

On the postponement of Witness G's testimony, the Chamber notes, as a preliminary comment, that the statement of Witness T was filed and disclosed to the Defence in a very short time after it came into the possession of the Prosecution.  The Chamber finds, therefore, that there's no late disclosure in that respect.  At this stage, the Chamber is of the view that this disclosure does not prevent the commencement of the examination-in-chief.  

With regard to the cross-examination, the Chamber hopes that the resources available to the Defence -- and that really is the Defence for Nzirorera -- will enable lead counsel to become familiar with the content of the document before the commencement of his cross-examination.  It may be that the order for cross-examination may be adjusted to facilitate Mr. Robinson's preparation, if that becomes necessary.  For these reasons, the Chamber denies that motion, and we think that we should proceed with the examination-in-chief of the witness now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  There was that one other issue that I told you I would like to raise with respect to my application to voir dire this witness before his examination commences.  And before making that application, I would like to be assured that the witness is not currently in the room in The Hague.  I don't believe he should be present for this discussion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, can you make that enquiry, please?  
MR. FRY:
This is the registrar from Arusha calling The Hague.  Could you just confirm for all parties that the Witness G is not in the room at this time, please.  

MR. JUMA:
The witness is in the room, but without headphones and away from the mic.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, is that good enough?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, it's been held that the subjective fear of a witness is insufficient to justify special protective measures, and the fear must be underscored by objective considerations.  And that was made -- decision was made in the Nyiramasuhuko case, on the decision on Nyiramasuhuko's strictly confidential, ex parte, under-seal motion for additional protective measures for some Defence witnesses, decided on 1 March 2005; and the Mpambara case, the decision on the protection of Defence witnesses of 4 May 2005.  And I'm asking permission of the Trial Chamber to question this witness about his fears concerning giving live testimony in Arusha, so that the Trial Chamber can make a determination as to whether that special protective measure is necessary and objectively reasonable, and also whether he does, in fact, have such fears.  So far your decision on this issue has solely been one-sided.  You had an affidavit from the Prosecutor submitted ex parte, under seal.  And we've not had an opportunity to have any -- elicit any facts whatsoever with respect to that issue.  So now that the witness is in The Hague and he's ready for cross-examination, I would ask that I be allowed to ask him questions, so you can make a determination based on hearing both sides, as to whether or not these special protective measures are justified.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp?  
MR. RAPP:
Yes, briefly, Your Honour, I think this may be a third or fourth occasion to revisit the protective issues in regard to this witness.  Also, this matter has been determined by three prior Trial Chambers.  It's clear from the record that the person's actually in a witness protection programme in a third country, a formal programme, and that under all of these circumstances, we don't think it's appropriate to engage in this voir dire to basically allow for a reconsideration, the result of which would seem to be that the witness testimony couldn't go forward, if Mr. Robinson were successful, at The Hague, that the witness would have to be brought to Arusha.  

Moreover, if one looks at the record in Bizimungu, there was difficulty in that particular case because the witness has been instructed, by those who run the witness protection programme in the country where he's located, not to answer certain questions.  He's entered into a binding contract that he can't answer certain questions that might compromise his protection, and that's why we proceeded by way of professional statement to describe the services that he was receiving because he'd been prohibited from doing that at peril of no longer being protected.  

So I don't believe that this would be a productive exercise.  It would obviously occasion further delay in commencing this interrogation, and if successful, would obviously occasion even further delay in conducting this examination.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, if I could just make a very brief reply.  First of all, this is our first opportunity to have this -- have our side of the issue debated.  So any delay is certainly not our fault.  We've been asking that the decision and the communications be open as to what the reasons are for his having to testify in The Hague.  

And I just note that this is a witness who's come from a third country, and he's been transported to The Hague.  I simply want to ask him why he couldn't be transported to Arusha as opposed to The Hague.  What's the difference, if he has to be transported from one place to another, whether he gives his testimony in The Hague or whether he gives it in Arusha?  If there's some legitimate reasons for that, then I think we should hear them, but I don't think we should be precluded from this enquiry and precluded from the process of contributing to the decision made by the Trial Chamber concerning protective measures.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, just so I can understand you properly, you're saying that the -- the -- your inquiries were limited to the issue that you just put before us?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, this is an appeal from the interpreter's booth.  Could the microphone at The Hague be disconnected, because it's really causing great disturbance for -- for our work.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

In fact, the registrar had just drawn that to my attention, and I would like to invite them to comment to the The Hague on our behalf, please.
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
I just wanted to remind everyone who's in the witness room in The Hague that the microphone there is extremely sensitive.  So even minor whispering or shuffling of papers becomes very loud in the ears of everyone here in Arusha and does also bother the interpreters.  So if you could be quiet, that would be most helpful.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. JUMA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  We have taken the necessary measures. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Yes.  We have come to a decision that the motion should be denied.  This is an issue which we have already -- on which we have already adjudicated, and we do not think that the possibility that further information may be derived by a voir dire is a justification to have a reconsideration at this stage.  So we deny the motion.  

Mr. Registrar, could you arrange for the witness to be prepared to commence his testimony.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

The Hague, could you please call the witness.  
MR. JUMA:
Thank you.  We are ready.  And now (inaudible) to swear the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may swear the witness.  
(Declaration made by Witness G in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, briefly, I believe that the situation for closed session -- open session for this witness has always been not to provide that the witness's image would appear on the public monitors, and I see the same image on both monitors at the moment, and I just want to be assured that before we're connected to The Hague that we're not actually going to physically see the image of the witness on that public monitor in the gallery.  If that's the case, that's fine, but I want to make sure that that doesn't occur inadvertently here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I've consulted with the registry and the technical team.  The -- what will happen is that the image of the witness will be shown on the video screen that is within the Chamber.  The video screen in the public gallery will be turned off.  The members of the public will have access to the audio of the proceedings, but they will not see the video transmission.  

I can see that the order has already been complied with, and I thank the members of the security team.  

Witness G, this is the Trial Chamber in Arusha, and we are now ready to hear your testimony.  You are being examined in open session, but the video is not being shown to the public gallery.  It's -- the video screens are switched off in the public gallery.  Your testimony will commence, and you will be examined by the Prosecutor, who will now commence his examination-in-chief.  

Mr. Rapp.  
WITNESS G,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  
MR. RAPP:
I'm looking for the image of the witness in the courtroom, and I don't see it yet.  Can we be sure that we have an image coming from The Hague?  

Very good.  And can I ask the member of the registry here to turn his television slightly, about 45 degrees in my direction, so I can see the witness when -- a little more, just so it can't be seen in the public gallery but so that I can see the witness as he responds.
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, would you state your nationality?  
A.	I'm Hutu by nationality.  I do apologise.  I'm of Rwandan nationality.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, you've answered my second question as well, and you're Hutu ethnic identity -- or Hutu nationality, as you referred to it.  Were both your father and your mother Hutu?  
A.	No.  
Q.	And what were their ethnicities?  
A.	My father was Hutu, and my mother was Tutsi.  
Q.	Now, let -- in what region of Rwanda were you raised?  
A.	I grew up in the Butare region.  
Q.	And were you still living in the Butare region in the -- in the early 1990s?  
A.	No.  
Q.	And where were you living then?  
A.	I was living in Kigali.  
MR. RAPP:
Now, at this point, I will ask the registry in The Hague to place before you a document, "Protected Information."  I believe this has been part of disclosure in this case, but I'm not sure that it's in the binders.  So if I could ask the registry -- excuse me -- to distribute this in the courtroom. 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	And I'm asking the registry at The Hague to place a document in front of you that's -- that has the title "Protected Information of Witness G."  Do you have that document in front of you?  
A.	Not yet.  

Yes, I have just been given the document.  
Q.	If you would look over that document for a moment, and it -- it indicates name, birthday, birthplace, and other items.  Would you just review it and tell us whether everything on that document is true, to the best of your -- to the best of your knowledge.  
A.	Yes, the information contained therein is true.  
MR. RAPP:
Okay.  We would ask that this become a Prosecution exhibit -- and I was checking here with the team to see what the next number is.  

Mr. Fry, do you know what our next number is in order?  
MR. FRY:
I believe it's P. 8, Your Honour (sic). 
MR. RAPP:
P. 8, number 8.  Okay.  I would ask that this be Exhibit P. 8, Your Honour, and it would be under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted P. 8, under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. P. 8 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Now, I'm going to ask that the registry in The Hague place another document before you, and I want to be careful about this particular document because it's -- it's a document that contains a series of names and offices in regard to a particular organisation.  And it's been disclosed and used in prior cases but always under seal in those cases.  Let me hand this document to the -- to the registry here and ask that it be distributed in the courtroom and ask that at The Hague that that document be placed in front of you.  It's a document that has a large Z, I believe, on the top corner, or number 2, and it lists a series of names.  Witness, do you have that document in front of you?  
A.	Not yet.  
Q.	I believe our Prosecution representative, Mr. Lombardi, has it there, and we also had provided -- 
MR. JUMA:
Your Honours, we'd ask for one second so that we provide the document to the witness.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I now have the document.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Okay.  Witness, do you recognise -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, does the document have a K-number?  
MR. RAPP:
No, it does not.  It's been an exhibit in a prior case.  I believe on the bottom of it, it indicates Pros- -- or that it's 1D. 68, a Defence exhibit in a prior case.  It's a document which I believe in the form we've handed it out has a "Z" at the top and a registry number 20075.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Okay.  Witness, do you recognise the names on this list?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did these individuals hold the offices that appear to the right of their names in the organisation that is named at the top of the document?  
A.	Yes.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, then we would ask that this particular document be admitted in evidence as the next Prosecution exhibit, P. 9, and it should be because the witness will refer in open session to these individuals, we would ask him by number, the document itself should be under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted P. 9, under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. P. 9 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Now, Witness, I know you may -- we may have done this before, but it was some time ago.  But I just want to ask you to keep that document, P. 9, in front of you, and if we're talking about those individuals on that list, that you refer to them by the number on that -- on that page, so that we can carry on an examination, in large part, in open session, without revealing the -- their names or the name of this -- of this organisation in relation to them.  Do you understand that?  
A.	I do.  
Q.	Now, Witness, let's go forward and ask you about the Accused in this case.  Do you know a gentleman by the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Yes, I know him.  
Q.	And when did you first meet him?  
A.	I met him first in 1991.  
Q.	When did you last meet him?  
A.	I last met him in 1994.  
Q.	In what month?  
A.	In around June 1994.  
Q.	Now, Witness, later on we're going to get into specifics of meetings with him, but right now I'd just like to ask you to give me a range of the number of times that you met him personally, that you were close enough to exchange words with him, over the course of that period of time that you told us, from '91 to '94, a range, whether it's, you know, five to ten or ten to fifteen, something broad as an estimate.  Unless you can fix a specific number, a range would be satisfactory.  
A.	I could say 15 or so times.  
Q.	Do you know Joseph Nzirorera?  
A.	Yes, I know him.  
Q.	And when did you first meet him?  
A.	I must have met him for the first time in 1992.  
Q.	When was the last time you saw him or met him?  
A.	The last time I met him, I believe, was in 1997 or '98.  
Q.	And could you tell us where that last meeting was?  
A.	I met him for the last time in Benin.  
Q.	Again, as to him, would you give us a range of the number of times that you met him over the course of that period, from '92 to '97 or '98?  
A.	I believe that I've met him several times --  
Q.	Again, the question was -- 
A.	-- especially in 1997 and '98.  
Q.	Do you want to give a range of more than several?  You've indicated 15 times or so in regard to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Was it more or less than the times that you met Mr. Ngirumpatse?  
A.	From 1992 to 1994, I would say that I met him 20 or so times.  Then in 1997 and 1998, I met him several times.  Perhaps I could say 20 or so as well.  
Q.	Do you know Édouard Karemera?  
A.	Yes, I know him.  
Q.	And how many times did you meet him?  
A.	I met him four times.  
Q.	And between what period did those meetings take place?  
A.	I met him between 1991 and 1994.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  

MR. RAPP:
At this point, I don't know if it'll be necessary, but since obviously this witness is testifying to the conduct of these individuals and identification is sometimes an issue -- though it may not be in this case -- I would simply make enquiry of the Defence whether they will stipulate that this individual knows each of the Accused and that they're the persons that he's mentioned here.  If not, then I'd ask for an identification where the -- where the booth would -- would pan the courtroom, all sides, and the witness would be given an opportunity to identify the persons that he's mentioned, if he can so identify them in the courtroom.  But I just want to know from the Defence whether that will be necessary.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I'm not authorised to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  As a general rule, I do not have both counsel standing at the same time in my courtroom.  Thank you.

Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON, 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.  I'm not authorised to enter into any stipulation, so we won't be doing that, but I would like to note an objection based on my motion made prior to trial, that the in-court identification procedures are suggestive and that identification should be made by photographic array.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I don't see how he would be able to recognise my client, as we have difficulties recognising the witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the Prosecution must take that responsibility.  If they want the Accused to be identified, they must do so in the most appropriate manner.  We have reservations otherwise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, we do not permit the method you are proposing for identification.  
MR. RAPP:
Fine, Your Honour.  Let's proceed, then.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Do you know with what political party these three gentlemen were associated during the period of '91 to '94?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And what political party was that?  
A.	They belonged to the MRND party.  
Q.	Do you know if they held any positions within this party?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And beginning with Mr. Ngirumpatse, what positions, to your knowledge, did they hold?  
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse was chairman of the MRND party.  
Q.	Do you know when he became chairman?  
A.	If my memory serves me well, he became chairman in around July 1993.  
Q.	And do you know if he held a position in the MRND political party before July of 1993?  
A.	No.  Before July 1993, he was national secretary of the MRND party.  
Q.	And do you know for roughly what period he was national secretary?  
A.	He became the national secretary of the MRND in around May 1992.  
Q.	Do you know if he held any position in the MRND at any level prior to that time?  
A.	At that time, I believe it was called national coordinator of the MRND -- that was his position -- for Kigali ville préfecture.  
Q.	Now, one other question in regard to him.  When he became chairman, as you indicate, in July of 1993, who did he succeed as chairman of the MRND political party?  
A.	He succeeded Juvénal Habyarimana, who was president of the republic and chairman of the MRND party.  
Q.	Now, then, as to Mr. Nzirorera, do you know if he held any position in the MRND political party between 1991 and 1994?  
A.	Mr. Nzirorera was national secretary of the MRND party.  
Q.	And do you know when he began service as national secretary?  
A.	He became national secretary also in July 1993.  
Q.	And to Mr. Édouard Karemera, do you know if he held a position in the MRND political party?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And what position was that, and, if you know, approximately for what period?  
A.	In 1993, in July, he was elected as one of the two vice-chairmen of the MRND.

1145H 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	And finally, just to tie this up at the other end, you have mentioned each of these three gentlemen having particular positions as of July of '93.  For how long, thereafter, there they hold those positions, if you know? 
A.	They remained in their positions up until 1994. 
Q.	And approximately what month? 
A.	I would say up until July 1994. 
Q.	Now, Witness, at the time that they held these positions in Rwanda in this period '92 to '94 that you have described, was there more than one political party in Rwanda? 
A.	There were other political parties in Rwanda. 
Q.	And when did it come to pass that other political parties entered the scene in Rwanda? 
A.	They entered the scene in 1991. 
Q.	Now prior to the other parties entering the scene in Rwanda, what was the political party situation in Rwanda; in other words, prior to that date in '91 that you have just given us when other parties came on the scene? 
A.	Before we had multiparty politics, it was a single-party state; the single party was the MRND. 
Q.	After multipartyism came to Rwanda, was there one political party that you were close to or that you were associated with yourself? 
A.	With the advent of multipartyism in Rwanda, I remained in the MRND. 
Q.	Did you pay attention to the other political parties? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And how did you learn about the other political parties? 
A.	When the parties were created each one introduced their statutes.  When they became certified, they would organise popular demonstrations.  On those occasions, I was able to attend some of those popular demonstrations of the new political parties. 
Q.	Let's be clear about the term, "demonstration" I'm not sure that is clear in English.  Describe what these demonstrations were or where they were held? 
A.	Those popular demonstrations were held in the stadium. 
Q.	Let me ask about one of the other political parties, the CDR; were you familiar with this party and its programme? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know anything about its membership base in terms ethnicity or regional background? 
A.	What I know about the CDR is that in order to be a member of that party you had to be a Hutu. 
Q.	And as far as the geographical area from which its membership came, was there a particular area of the country that predominated among its membership or was it spread throughout the nation? 
A.	Most of the party's members were from Gisenyi and Ruhengeri prefectures. 
Q.	Was there any relationship between the MRND and CDR? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what was that relationship? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President; I have an objection for lack of foundation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question can be answered. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. Prosecutor, could you kindly repeat your question to me. 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Yes.  Was there a relationship between the CDR and MD -- and MRND, and can you describe that relationship.  I think you answered the first part yes, and now we are asking you to describe it? 
A.	The relationship between the MRND and the CDR was that when the MRND set out in the multiparty scene they created unity, all members, Tutsi and Hutus could join it.  The MRND could not unite all of the Hutus, the Tutsi and the Twas.  So within the MRND they decided to create another party which would defend the Hutus.  On that occasion they created the CDR.  At first it was founded by members who were previously members of the MRND.
Q.	Well, how do you know about this role of the MRND in forming the CDR? 
A.	Before the CDR was created, I had an opportunity to meet members of the MRND.  I met           Mathieu Ngirumpatse at one meeting, and he said that they were going to try to create another party which would be particularly -- an exclusively Hutu party. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I have an objection.  I would move to strike the answer as the allegation that the MRND -- or particularly, Mr. Ngirumpatse created the all-Hutu CDR party is not contained in the indictment to my knowledge; and, therefore, this is an allegation which is material to which we are not -- not have notice. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp. 
MR. RAPP:
I believe this issue is dealt with in the pre-trial brief.  And I would like to look at the particular section, but I think it appears in all of the background, the expert reports and other things about the political period in Rwanda, and can come as absolutely no surprise to the Accused in this case.  It is not something for which the Accused are being alleged to have been involved in, in and of itself in a crime, but only in way of background in terms of the associations that did exist. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, if I can just reply briefly?  I do have the amended indictment here.  I did a quick word search for "CDR" to see if it is mentioned in the amended indictment.  And the only place that it is mentioned that I could find is under paragraph 6C -- excuse me, 6 on number 3.  And among the long list of people who are considered to be members of the joint criminal enterprise is listed "Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, a leader of the CDR political party."  So, to my quick check, that is the only reference to the CDR party in the indictment.  And we don't believe it is sufficient to put us on notice that any of the Accused are charged with creating this party.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, could you direct us to where this has been referred to in the indictment or -- 
MR. RAPP:
Well, I think in terms of the indictment it is correct that there is no reference to obviously the association of Mr. Barayagwiza of the CDR.  And I have asked my colleague to bring up the pre-trial brief and we are having difficulty with the computer.  So, let me just withdraw the question and allow the answer be stricken, if we can tie it up later, we will,  though we are dealing with the individuals involved here and their specific acts that are alleged. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will allow the Defence objection to strike the question and answer.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, did you attend any rallies of the CDR? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Where? 
A.	At the Nyamirambo regional stadium in Kigali.
Q.	And approximately when was that?
A.	If it wasn't March, it must have been April 1992. 
Q.	And why did you attend the rally? 
A.	During the establishment of parties and during that first rally there was no authorisation or permit required to attend meetings or rallies; and on that occasion I went and attended that rally.
Q.	And do you remember who spoke at that rally? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have an objection to this question that this meeting also is not included in the indictment.  And you recall in our previous issues regarding the Kibungo meeting with           Witness Mbonyunkiza, you ruled that meetings such as rallies of political parties were needed -- material facts that needed to be specified in the indictment before evidence could be led on those.  So I am objecting that this is not in the indictment, and ask that no evidence be led as to this meeting. 
MR. RAPP:
If I might be permitted to reply; I believe that this may misstate the ruling, although I have not reviewed it personally.  It has been represented to me that in this particular case it involved statements of the Accused themselves as needing to be cited in the indictments.  And that meetings of which there were many and they are referred to quite generally in the indictment would not each have to be specifically pleaded to provide information about what happened during this long period in Rwanda.  However, if I may say so, Your Honour, we are proceeding to deal here with aspects of the JCE, and the personality mentioned earlier in an objection.  And I think I am entitled to precede the evidence that is alleged in the indictment regarding that other individual and the ties to that individual. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, actually this is exactly the same situation we had because the speaker we were referring to in some of these earlier meetings that were excluded, one of those was                Robert Kajuga, which is not an accused but is listed as a member of the joint criminal enterprise.  

Now, Mr. Rapp is trying to elicit the statements of Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza who is also listed as a member of the joint criminal enterprise at a meeting.  So I think it is exactly the same situation and your previous ruling should extend to this.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, we don't have a decision at the moment.  It is bothering us.  What we would like you to do, if it is possible, if it is possible to address another aspect of your examination-in-chief, and we should come back to you shortly with a decision in this matter. 
MR. RAPP:
Thank you very much, Your Honours.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, you did testify earlier about the fact that the CDR was a Hutu only political party.  I would like to talk about the other political parties and their ethnic and regional membership base.  Dealing with the MRND prior to the beginning of the war, October 1, 1990, what was its position in terms of ethnic membership? 
A.	The MRND was a single party and its composition was that all Rwandans were officially members of the MRND. 
Q.	And you mean all ethnic groups, Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did the position of Tutsis in the MRND change after the beginning of the war on October 1st 1990? 
A.	With the war of 1990, the position within the party with regards to the ethnicity or the different ethnic groups changed somewhat. 
Q.	How did it change? 
A.	After the victory of the Rwandan Armed Forces on the 30th of October, there was in the period between the 1st to the 30th October, around the 5th or 6th October, during the war led by the RPF, there were people who were taken and arrested, imprisoned; and most of these people were Tutsi.  They were considered to be accomplices of the RPF. 
Q.	Well, when the opportunity came for there to be place in other political parties for the Tutsi, where did the Tutsi go? 
A.	On that occasion there was an establishment of a party which was known as the Parti Libéral.  This was a party in which the Tutsi who were previously members of the MRND went to join. 
Q.	And do you have from your observation any estimate of the percentage of Tutsi or percentage of members of the PL Party that were Tutsi? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to object for lack of foundation. 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, obviously we asked if the witness had any knowledge of this issue.  Let me put it more precisely.
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Do you have any knowledge or basis for knowing what the Tutsi percentages were in the PL Party? 
A.	I would say that the majority of the PL members were Tutsi.  I would say 85 percent were Tutsi; 85 percent of the membership was Tutsi. 
Q.	And just to be precise, because I know there -- we are dealing with the basis of your knowledge; how do you know such things as to what the rough percentage of a political party was?  How did you gain that information? 
A.	The basis of my knowledge, I would say is that I was seeing in the membership of the PL -- you could see them on -- at meetings which were organised in the stadium.  You would see that they were Tutsi, especially in the executive committee.  But there were many -- but if there were -- if we were to take the membership as a whole, I wouldn't say that there were not any Hutus either. 
Q.	Now, Witness, before I asked you about the other political parties -- now, I was going to ask you about the MDR and the PSD party.  For instance, did you have occasion to observe and to gain information about their membership base; and if you did, how did you gain that information? 
A.	I would say that I didn't have any information concerning the percentages; it was by mere deduction, mere deduction if you will. 
Q.	And what was -- and from what did you deduce your conclusion in regard to the membership base of these political parties? 
A.	The composition of these political parties in Rwanda between 1991 was based on one's region and one's ethnicity. 
Q.	Witness, how did you know that? 
A.	You know when you look at the composition of these parties you would see the origins of the founding -- or founder members.  And one knew very well that the founder members belonged to such a region or such an ethnic group, and that was something simple. 
Q.	Well, then based on that observation on your part, what was the membership base of the MDR political party, and the leadership base of that party? 
A.	The MDR was a party which had its bases in the prefectures of Gitarama and Ruhengeri.  
Q.	Now, in regard --  
A.	And --  
Q.	Witness, I believe I may have interrupted your answer and the translation.  You had just told us that it had its bases in these two prefectures.  You were going to conclude your answer, would you please do so? 
A.	And the leaders of this party were mostly from the Gitarama prefecture and Ruhengeri prefecture. 
Q.	Now, what of the party called the PSD, what was its membership or leadership base? 
A.	The base of this party, the PSD was Buyenyeri (phonetic) and Gikongoro.
THE ENGLSIH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter didn't quite hear the first name properly.
THE WITNESS:
And the people who were members of this party came from Butare, Gikongoro and Gitarama.
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Now, you talked about five political parties, MRND, CDR, the PL, the MDR and the PSD.  Did these political parties have youth organisations or youth wings? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know which party was the first to have a youth wing? 
A.	The first party to establish a youth wing was the MDR. 
Q.	And do you know what it was called? 
A.	The name of the youth wing of the MDR was Inhoba (phonetic). 
Q.	Did the MRND political party have a youth wing? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know whose idea it was to establish a youth wing for the MRND political party? 
A.	It was the MRND central committee. 
Q.	And do you know when the youth wing was established? 
A.	The MRND youth wing was established around November 1991. 
Q.	And do you know what that youth wing was called? 
A.	The MRND youth wing was known as the Interahamwe za MRND. 
Q.	Did this organisation have a president? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And who was he? 
A.	The chairman of the MRND youth wing was Number 1 on P. 9, Exhibit P. 9. 
Q.	And do you know how he came to be chosen as president? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you know how it was that he was chosen president and how was it, and why was he chosen? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Well, could you just explain why it was or in what manner it was that he was chosen president, why he was chosen for that role, to your knowledge? 
A.	Number 1 was invited to the meeting for the establishment of the Interahamwe by a member of the central committee of the MRND who during that period of time was Mr. Desire Murenzi.  And he was invited for that purpose because he was the chairman of a football team in Kigali town and that team was known as Loisir.  Now Loisir team was a team which played on every Sunday morning and it was composed of Hutus and Tutsis.  

Now during that first meeting he was invited, and he brought along his team members during that first meeting.  During that first meeting was the time when the nominations took place for the interim members of the committee of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Now, you indicated that -- that his soccer club or his football club included Tutsis and Hutus; did Tutsis as well come to that first meeting?  
A.	Yes, there were also Tutsis at the first meeting. 
Q.	Did the participation of Tutsis continue in the organisation in the period after the first meeting? 
A.	Yes, Tutsis rather continued to participate after the first meeting. 
Q.	Did there come a time when that changed? 
A.	Yes, the moment changed at one point in time. 
Q.	And when was that and --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please. 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	When was that that it changed and why, according to your observation, did it change? 
A.	I would say that at around May 1992, participation of Tutsis in the Interahamwe began to change.  They joined a different youth wing of the PL Party.  At that time people were considered as Ibyitso.  Those were Tutsis or people in the opposition. 
Q.	And you use the term "Ibyitso" what does that term mean to you, if you can express it in French?
A.	I'm sorry for using that term in Kinyarwanda.  The word means accomplice or people who work with the enemy.  And the enemy at that time was the RPF. 
Q.	Now, when the Interahamwe was established in November of '91, did it -- did membership cover the whole country? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	We are talking November of '91? 
A.	In November 1991 the Interahamwe were created.  Those were Interahamwe from Kigali-ville prefecture, but made up of people from all of the prefectures of Rwanda. 
Q.	So, I just want to get this clear, in November of '91 there were people -- were they living in Kigali at that time or were they living outside of Kigali? 
A.	They lived in Kigali. 
Q.	Did there come a time when the Interahamwe began to have members that lived outside of Kigali? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when was that? 
A.	It was after the MRND congress in May 1992.  During the congress they decided to create the Interahamwe for all of the prefectures. 
Q.	Now, let me just ask you to move ahead to November of 1992, one year after its creation.  How many members did the Interahamwe have in Kigali, in your estimation, and how many would the Interahamwe have who lived outside of Kigali? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, which period are you referring to?  
Q.	In November 1992, approximately how many members in Kigali, approximately how many outside of Kigali? 
A.	I could say that in Kigali there were between 2- and 3,000 Interahamwe and throughout the country there were 15- to 20,000.  
Q.	Could you indicate whether the movement had changed at all in what the members were doing between November of '91 and November of 1992? 
A.	In 1991, and I could say until May 1992, the youth wing of the Interahamwe -- of the MRND, of the Interahamwe, rather, was in charge of discipline during the rallies held by the MRND.  They were there to support members of the MRND parties, and there were people who began to leave the MRND because they were terrorised by other parties, so the Interahamwe were there to support those people, to show them that they were in a very strong party.  So at that time I could say that there was something going on in Rwanda.  Opposition parties began what we call Kubohoza.  They began recruiting members within the MRND.  After 1992, there was a change within the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe were created within the prefectures, and the Interahamwe within the prefectures were led by the MRND coordinator within that prefecture.  Those people did not fall under the national Interahamwe committee in Kigali.  Even the Interahamwe in Kigali, both Kigali-ville and rural had national coordinators within their prefectures.  

There were other formations within the MRND.  The leaders of the MRND, some of them, some of the wealthy members of the MRND even created their own Interahamwe organisations who were tasked with providing their personal security and the security of their residences.  So that change did occur after the Interahamwe were created at the prefecture level. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you have just described this business of other political parties potentially having taken MRND members forcefully, and the Interahamwe being there to prevent that or to provide protection.  Did that result in conflict between -- and physical conflict between the MRND and those other political parties when that occurred, or those other organisations? 
A.	When those events occurred, there were many confrontations between the youth wings of the different parties, especially that the Interahamwe and the youth wing Inhoba (phonetic) from the MDR and the PL youth wing. 
MR. RAPP:
Now, if I could ask the registrar to put a document in front of you and we will be now be working for a period of time with some of the information that is in the binders that have been provided to counsel and to the Court and specifically and to a large extent the binder that is contained at Tabs 51 through 95.  And I think that is Volume II of the binders.  And at The Hague, I believe we provided the witness with a smaller set including just the exhibits that we intend to bring to his attention.  So if the witness could be shown what, I believe, is at Tab 54, which is a document -- without suggesting anything here, but just we know we have the correct one because tabs sometimes can be incorrect, it's in Kinyarwanda, and it begins with the words -- well, it has a date on it 27/05/1992.  And it corresponds to another document at Tab 25, which is in French; that is the same document, the French translation, also 27/5/1992; if those documents could be placed before the witness. 

And we would note at The Hague that if we could just keep it in the binder, so that if we refer to the document again, we can locate it by tab number.  These things are difficult to do long distance, and we have to make sure we are all on the same page.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, do you now have that in front of you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And, Witness, looking at the tab at 54 and 55, one being in Kinyarwanda and the other in French, could you tell me what this document is?  Do you have it now, Witness?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Could you tell me what it is or what these two documents represent? 
A.	As you can see under "subject" it is a protest against the acts of intimidation and terrorism by the Liberal Party.  In May 1992, the chairman of the PL was Mr. Mugenzi.  He held a rally in -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A location we did not get.  
THE WITNESS:
During that rally, Mugenzi's party said that they were going to suspend their political activities to attack the MRND.  After that statement there were altercations between PL Party members -- rather, the youth wing of the Liberal Party and the youth wing of the MRND. 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	And would you describe, specifically, your knowledge of those altercations or conflicts that gave rise to this particular letter? 
A.	According to Mugenzi's speech, you could see that he wanted to attack the MRND, and especially its youth wing.  From that point on, the PL youth wing started attacking MRND members.  The youth wing of the MRND wanted to defend itself.  There were always cases of people who were beaten and wounded and it continued on; to such an extent that the national committee of the Interahamwe wrote this letter to the prime minister informing him of everything that had happened after Mugenzi's speech.  He was requesting that the Liberal Party be suspended because they were no longer playing the political game as was necessary, so they should be suspended.  In summary, I think that is the content of the letter.  On that occasion, the minister of justice was requested, there were complaints lodged by other parties against MRND members. 
Q.	Witness, let me just deal specifically with the item attached, 54 and 55.  Whose idea specifically was it to write this letter? 
A.	That letter was written by the JMRND Interahamwe committee. 
Q.	And the -- continue if you would, Witness? 
A.	The letter written by the Interahamwe was covered by -- supported by the MRND.  The drafting of the letter in large part was supervised by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Now, Witness, on the document I see several signatures.  And looking at P. 9, could you tell me what numbers, if there is any individual who signed that letter who also appears on P. 9, and give me those numbers of those individuals? 
A.	In Exhibit 9, you find the names of the signatories to the document.  You see one, two, three, four and five. 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, we would then ask that this particular exhibit be admitted into evidence (inaudible) producing one number for it, P. 10 and then (inaudible) -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could the Prosecutor kindly repeat; we are having a great deal of interference over the lines, apparently, and the French interpreters were not able to hear anything (inaudible). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. RAPP:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreters have requested that you repeat.  The interpreters were not able to hear what you said. 
MR. RAPP:
I think we are hearing the binders moving across the table at The Hague and we have to be very careful about that.  What I was asking is that these two items be admitted into evidence, and I don't know the practice in this Trial Chamber, but when you have the identical documents and when one is in English and one is in French, and there may later be another translation --  excuse me, one is in Kinyarwanda and one is in French and there may later be one in English, it is perhaps a good idea to give it a single number, and make it 10A for the Kinyarwanda and 10F --  or 10B for the French or give the initials of the language, whatever the conversion is.  But may be easier, if that's -- if there isn't the convention to call the Kinyarwanda 10K and the French 10F.  And then if an English one later is done, it can be admitted at that time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp.  

What are the exhibit numbers please?  
MR. RAPP:
If you are asking me, I don't want to ask --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I asked the registry.  
MR. RAPP:
Oh, I`m sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have, in fact, developed a practice already. 
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I believe it would be P. 10A and B for French and Kinyarwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry, (inaudible). 
 (Exhibit No. P. 10A and P. 10B admitted) 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, I don't want to step in if Your Honours are waiting to make an announcement in regard the exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have already. 
MR. RAPP:
Okay, fine. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registry --
MR. RAPP:
Thank you, Your Honour, I just wanted to avoid interrupting deliberations.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, on this particular exhibit, I see a post office box, PB1055.  Are you familiar with that post office box? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what is -- or what was that, the post office box for this at this time? 
A.	That post office box belonged to the MRND party. 
Q.	Witness, if I can now ask you to look at tab 48 in the binder, and that also in the same Volume II of the document, in French around three pages.  And ask if you are familiar with that document.  It is at tab number 48.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me.  Excuse me, Mr. President, for Mr. Rapp's information, in case Mr. Rapp is not aware of this, this has already been admitted as P. 2.  It may shorten his examination if he is aware of that. 
MR. RAPP:
Thank you very much, Mr. Robinson.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Do you have the document in front of you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And are you familiar with that document? 
A.	I did not know about this document. 
Q.	Well, we will just pass that by as it is already in evidence in this case.

Let me move to Tab Number 53 in the binder and ask if you are familiar with this particular document?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you would describe what the document is? 
A.	I knew of this document through the internet.  I became aware of it in 2003 I believe.  The document was written by Anathase Gasana.  Before writing this document he was a member of the MRND; then he changed over to the MDR.  After that, he wrote this document.  He wrote it on the basis of what he had observed in the MRND.  
Q.	Now, Witness, directing your attention to the version in French, and going to page 3, do you see the names -- at 3 in French, and I should say look at 6 in English?  Do you see the name of any persons listed on this that appear on P. 9? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President; I'm going to object to the use of this document.  I don't think a sufficient foundation has been laid for this witness to refer to this document.  I don't think the document is admissible; it is a particularly unreliable document.  And I don't believe that it is proper to question this witness simply because he saw it on the internet in 2003. 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, I could attempt to lay more foundation for this particular document, if you wish. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Through this witness?  
MR. RAPP:
Yes, hum hum. 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q. Well, Witness, do you know when this document was prepared? 

MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
MR. RAPP:
I'm asking if he knows, Your Honour, and that is the question.  I'm seeking information as to whether it is a contemporaneous document; but if the witness is simply seeking information from the document itself, I don't think that is sufficient. 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Apart from observing the document itself, Witness, do you know when it was prepared? 
A.	This document must have been prepared in Kigali within the MDR party.  And as I can see from the document, it was written on the 14th of May 1992.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honour, I'm not going to pursue any more questions with regard to this particular document at this point.  So let me ask you Your Honour, in terms of our schedule today and our break and how we coincide with The Hague, are we -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone please, counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the scheduling in which you have worked out in conjunction with the -- what is convenient for The Hague is that we take the lunch at 1:30, which is 12:30 in The Hague, and resume at 3:30 here, which is 2:30 in The Hague.  And I think we sit until 6 o'clock, which is 5 o'clock in The Hague.  So, that is the schedule that we had planned. 
MR. RAPP:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	So let me proceed, Witness, to talk about your own specific experiences.  Did you have occasion to go to public meetings, this things you called demonstrations, where the Interahamwe were present during the period from November '91 to November of '92? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And where did you go, specifically? 
A.	I went to Kigali, Karama and Ruhengeri.  I also went to Gisenyi in the Kimiya sous prefecture; and I went to Gikongoro.  
Q.	And what did the Interahamwe do at each of these meetings? 
A.	During these meetings, the Interahamwe were in attendance.  They attended these meetings by being involved in demonstrations, and they were also responsible for ensuring security at the stadium. 
Q.	You mentioned a rally in Ruhengeri.  Approximately when was that rally? 
A.	In Ruhengeri, it was around the 15th November 1992. 
Q.	Now, Witness -- 
MR. RAPP:
And, Your Honours, we are going to attempt at this point to play a particular video about that rally -- that was taken of that rally that has actually been disclosed to the Defence; it is in six CD, purportedly of the rally.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Let me ask you, Witness, have you had occasion to see a video that was produced that reported the rally that was been digitized and placed on a series of CD-ROMs. 
A.	Yes. 
MR. RAPP:
At this time, I would ask that a portion of that video be shown to the witness and I believe it is the portion and in each case we will play about a segment of only about two or three minutes, and then provide an opportunity for the witness to lay foundation on it.  I don't know of any other way we can do it.  I believe if we put it on the screen here, it is possible for him to see that on the screen at The Hague.  And if we can start that at the beginning of the document, I believe the exhibit is -- the particular CD-ROM has the KV number 000392B.  So if we can start that particular CD from the beginning for about three minutes. 

(Video played) 
MR. RAPP:
If we could stop the --   
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Okay, Witness, were you able to see the video at The Hague? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what -- from your own knowledge, what is this a video of and who is represented there? 
A.	Following the clip which was projected, I saw President Habyarimana, I saw his wife, I also saw members of the MRND who were in uniform of the -- in the uniform of the MRND, and that is it.  The president of the republic was greeting people who were at the stadium. 
Q.	And this particular uniform, these colours that we saw that some of the individuals were wearing, including the woman who was with the president who, presumably, is his wife.  Is that what are you referring to as the uniform of the MRND? 
A.	Yes, this was the MRND uniform. 
Q.	Now, was that distinguished in anyway from the Interahamwe uniform? 
A.	No.  The Interahamwe wore the MRND uniform. 
Q.	Now, just to be clear, were you present at that rally to see this particular scene? 
A.	Yes, I saw the president arrive. 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, we can proceed and deal with some other portions of this DVD.  We intend to show just another copy, small segments from the third reel, but we would ask at this time that the Defence would stipulate to its admission as an exhibit.  I believe we would deal here now with Exhibit 11, and with each of the CDs being separated (inaudible). 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, we have no objection to the admission of this exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exhibit is admitted, P.  11.
	(Exhibit No. P. 11 admitted)
(Pages 28 to 42 by Donna M. Lewis)





























1315H 
MR. RAPP:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  Let me then move to the third CD which was -- which was given the KV00032 - 392(C) number which would presumably be now Exhibit 11(C).  We need to get copies.  Okay, in a moment.  And -- and let's focus on a particular scene that occurs, I think, at about 1645 into that -- into that DVD, continuing for about a minute and a half.  
(Video played)
MR. RAPP:  
If we can stop at this moment.
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, were you able to see that video clip at The Hague?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And let me ask you:  The individual who was admitted -- or who was recognised to speak, who came forward in the uniform, who was that individual?  
A.	One can see number 1 on Exhibit P. 9.  We can also see number 3 on Exhibit P. 9, and they are surrounded by Interahamwe who are dressed in the MRND uniform.  
Q.	And the particular individual who's introducing the -- the -- at the very end of the segment who appears to be introducing (inaudible) to the rally, who is that? 
A.	There was the presenter.  The one making the introductions is the MRND coordinator in Ruhengeri préfecture, and he was Mr. Casimir Bizimungu who was making a presentation on the newspapers.  He said that there was a newspaper known as Interahamwe which was on sale on that day, and he was saying that it was a well written newspaper and he was encouraging the people to buy it.  
Q.	Let's move ahead to a -- another segment at 2430 of this.  It'll be about three minutes -- 2430, about a four-minute segment.
(Video played)
MR. RAPP:
So if we can go ahead and stop the video at this point.
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, were you able to see that video clip at The Hague? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you tell us what was occurring there? 
A.	What I can tell you is that the sound was not very clear.  We couldn't hear everything, but it's a -- a song which was being performed by the Interahamwe during this period of time.  But I saw that the song was very interesting because I saw the president of the republic and the chairman of the MRND, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, had been pleased by the song.  But I can't tell you about the content because I wasn't able to hear it.  The sound was poor.  
Q.	Witness, just in terms of the action that was going on there -- we obviously heard a song and saw some dancing, what -- there was some particular action between individuals and what was that, to your knowledge?  Would you describe from your own experience what was occurring then?  
A.	What I can say is that what I saw was someone who was being followed or pursued, and the end is that the person was caught.  But I don't know whether it was an accomplice or not because this was a period of war.  Was it an enemy element who was caught?  It's -- it's difficult to say.  An enemy was either a Tutsi, a member of the RPF, or a member of the opposing -- the opposition party.  That's all I can understand from this video. 
Q.	Let me just follow up that question briefly.  You said an enemy was -- included a Tutsi.  At this particular time, were Tutsi viewed as the enemy?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, Witness, I see -- I saw some people waving things in their hands.  Could you tell me what they were waving?  And if you could describe what they are carrying at that time and what you actually saw at the stadium at the time this occurred.  
A.	During that period of time, people would carry sticks or some traditional weapon or other, and what I saw at the stadium is that they were carrying sticks and clubs.  
Q.	And when you refer to "traditional weapons", what are you talking about?  
A.	For traditional weapons I can say these would include a machete, a spear, sticks and clubs.  
Q.	And during this rally or other rallies that you attended, would Interahamwe carry traditional weapons that you just described, each of those weapons?  
A.	What I can say and what I can see is that the traditional weapons which were carried during demonstrations would mostly be sticks.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The last part of that answer did not come out clearly at all.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, they indicated the last part of your answer didn't come out.  Could you just repeat your answer, if you would, so we get a proper translation here in Arusha?  
A.	You had asked me about the traditional weapons that the Interahamwe would carry or members of the MRND during demonstrations or rallies.  Many Rwandans traditionally carry a stick when they move from one place to another if they're going somewhere.  And I saw that these sticks were being carried, sticks that people would carry during demonstrations visibly.  That's what people seemed to like to carry.  
Q.	Witness, did you attend another rally the following week in -- in rural Gisenyi, in Kabaya?
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
THE WITNESS:
I attended a -- a popular rally which took place in the Kabaya sous-préfecture. 

MR. RAPP:
The President was speaking.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you think you can complete this before the 1:30 break?  
MR. RAPP:
No, I don't think so.  Well, I was going to introduce the speech at this time.  And if we could do that, then I think we'd then know what we were dealing with.  And we could talk about the speech later so I'd need about two questions, and a reference to the speech might save a little time at the afternoon session.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Who spoke at that rally?  
A.	As usual, at all rallies, the local authorities of the MRND would take the floor.  But on this occasion, the man of the day was one Mugesera, Léon. 
MR. RAPP:
And if I can ask at The Hague for them to give you the thing that's at Tab 197, and if the people in the Chamber could have 197 in front of them, we could briefly introduce it or do it in a minute, if you can obtain it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to have an objection to any evidence being elicited concerning this meeting as it does not appear in the indictment.  Perhaps this is something we can think of over the lunch break.  
MR. RAPP:
Under those circumstances, I think we can take our break now and be prepared for that objection but -- well, obviously, we've already made reference to the exhibit at Tab 197, and we can take that up again when we return, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think this might be an appropriate time to take the adjournment.  

Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  This is the Judge talking.  We are going to take an adjournment. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We are now going to break for lunch.  I think it is 12:30 where you are located, and we will resume at 2:30 where you are located.  There is a one-hour time difference here, so we resume at 3:30 in Arusha.  I want to let you know that during these adjournment -- during this or any other adjournment while you are giving evidence, you continue to be a witness before the Tribunal, and you're not to discuss the case or your -- your evidence with anybody.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Thank you very much.  

Now, we'll take the adjournment now. 
	(Court recessed from 1333H to 1545H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, before we begin this afternoon, we needed some assistance to complete our determination on the matter we had reserved this morning.  Can you point us to where notice was given concerning the evidence sought to be adduced about the CDR meeting, and what was said at it?  
MR. RAPP:
Well, a specific example on -- 
THE ENGLISH TRANSLATOR:
The Prosecutor's microphone, please.  
MR. RAPP:
Excuse me, Your Honour.  Mr. President, Judges, in the pre-trial brief -- and we're looking at page 11 specifically -- it contains the footnote, "the creation of the youth wings of the political parties, the Interahamwe from MRND and the Impuzamugambi from the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic originally established to encourage or even force adherence to one or another party in the newly established multiparty system provided Habyarimana's circle with a large, devoted, and effective workforce to implement the adopted strategies.  And these youth organisations, which were affiliated to political parties were soon manipulated as part of the anti-Tutsi campaign," and then it proceeds to talk about their association.  

Now, obviously, this is not specifically on the issue of the particular conversation that the witness may have had with the member of the MRND secretariat in terms of its involvement in the establishment of the CDR, but we think that it's sufficient to be able to lead evidence on this as a matter of historical background. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, there's interference, great interference for the French booth.  There's something -- something in the airwaves.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The French booth have not been hearing you for about two minutes. 
MR. RAPP:
Okay.  And I have -- my hearing, I have interference.  And I'm trying to talk over it in the hope of dealing with the technical problems that are inherent in this work.  But, in any case, let me go back again to say what our position was, and that is, in the pre-trial brief, which is a form by which one can provide notice to the other side of the evidence that you're going to lead, according to the well-settled law that comes to us initially from the Appeals Chamber in the ICTY in the Kupreskic case, there is this -- these comments on page 11, which refer specifically to both political -- both the CDR's Impuzamugambi and the Interahamwe as having been established by the inner circle, by the Habyarimana entourage, and then having been financed and supported in a variety of ways.  

That, we think, gives sufficient notice to be able to at least lead, by way of historic background, the information about the involvement of one of those members of that entourage, going to lead, by this witness and others, Mr. Ngirumpatse to the -- to the establishment of the CDR; and here, of course, we're talking about historic background.  It will be in this case, I submit, very difficult, given the nature of the events that we're talking about, given the desire to craft relatively short indictments, to be able to deal with all of the background, both from a Prosecution and a Defence standpoint, all of the events that occur if the requirement is that every single one of them, in order to show what follows what and in order to provide that context, must be in the -- in the indictment.  

And I submit that, particularly in a case like this, this involves the political dynamic of Rwanda for the years leading up to 1994, that it's more than sufficient if these ideas are referenced in the pre-trial brief.  Now, in a moment, we'll deal with the Mugesera issue as well because that's explicitly laid out there.  But in this matter, this involvement in the establishment of the CDR, is referenced only in this footnote on page 11.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you wish to comment?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  But may I inquire first if the witness's headphones are off, so that he's not listening to this discussion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
This is the registry in Arusha.  Can the registrar's representative in The Hague please let me know the status of the witness, whether he's listening to our discussions?  Thank you.
MR. JUMA:
Your Honour, the witness has the headphones on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is -- Mr. Registrar -- 
MR. JUMA:
We are ready now.  We have removed the headphones from the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think there's two matters with respect to the CDR party, one is whether the MRND and particularly some of the accused had a role in setting up the CDR party, and that's what Mr. Rapp responded to.  And I think it's sufficient to say that the footnote on page 11 is nowhere near the clear, concise notice that is required when something is to be ordained from a pre-trial brief.  There's simply no connection that can be made between what's in that footnote and an allegation, which is very serious, that the MRND set up a racist party in 1992 in Rwanda.  

I think the second evidence about CDR -- and I believe that this was actually the thrust of your question -- was evidence that was attempted to lead as to what was said at a CDR rally in 1992.  I believe the witness said it was either March or April 1992.  And I would say that there's absolutely nothing in the pre-trial brief that deals with that particular rally nor is there anything in the indictment.  So I would ask that, consistent with your earlier rulings on the jurisprudence, that you not allow evidence either of the CDR events to be admitted.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, we have not had a chance to -- to review this matter yet, but what I will do at this point is remind you of the ruling that we had made just for -- to let you know what should be applicable.  The Chamber recalls that per (inaudible) Rule 89(C) of the Rules, the Trial Chamber may admit any relevant evidence it deems to have probative value.  Although it is not specifically provided by the rules, the Chamber has to exclude testimony when its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  

The admissibility of evidence should not be confused with the assessment of the weight to be accorded to that evidence, an issue to be decided by the Trial Chamber after hearing the totality of the evidence.  And I can refer to the Appeal Chamber's decisions in the case cited by Nyiramasuhuko et al, Case Number ICTR-9271-AR-73, a decision that asks (inaudible) on the decision of his urgent motion to declare parts of the evidence of Witnesses R and QBZ inadmissible on the 2nd of July 2004. 

Now, when it has been found that a material fact has been sufficiently pleaded in the indictment, this alone does not render the evidence inadmissible.  The evidence can be admitted to the extent that it may be relevant to the proof of any allegation pleaded in the indictment, as was expressed in the above-mentioned decision of the Chamber, paragraph 40.  In the instant case, the Chamber is of the view that testimony made by the witness that Mathieu Ngirumpatse attended the meeting at Amahoro Stadium should be excluded since it is a material fact which is neither pleaded in the indictment nor disclosed in the witness statements or the witness statements previously disclosed.

Moreover, we think that its prejudicial effects to the Accused outweighs its probative value.  However, the fact that the meeting took place is evidence that is related to the general allegations pleaded in the indictment with respect to the mobilisation of the Interahamwe.  To that extent only, the evidence is, therefore, admissible.  

Now, that was the basis upon which we granted the Defence motion -- or the Defence objection as specified.  Now, it might be related to this matter.  Once we've had a chance to make an assessment of the quality of notice, if any, we're likely to exclude the evidence if we find that notice was not given.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honour, under the circumstances, I'm not going to return to the CDR meeting or the CDR contacts today, in any case.  And we'll consider this issue further and at this point wish to move forward with the -- with this speech of this rally on 22nd November '92.  I think we'll probably have this faith in a moment, and I'll defer my comments until we get to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. RAPP:
If it please the Court, if I -- if the witness can have his headphones restored in The Hague.  We want to continue with the examination in regard to the item that was at Tab 197 of the -- of materials provided by the Office of the Prosecutor.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  When we left, I had lodged an objection to this speech of Mr. Mugesera on the grounds that no notice was provided of a material fact in the indictment.  So can we allow the witness not to quite yet have his headphones on, and can we have a ruling on that objection before we go to the testimony?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. RAPP:
If I may be heard on the objection, I think under that law that you just read to us from your previous decision, this -- this is a much clearer case.  It is rather explicitly in the pre-trial brief in Paragraph 39 -- it says "About a week thereafter"-- after the rally in Ruhengeri that we've just seen - "on 22nd November '92, Léon Mugesera, vice chairman on the MRND for the Gisenyi préfecture, addressed a rally in Kabaya where he called upon his constituency to send the Tutsi back to Abyssinia by the Nyabarongo river, a virtual call to arms to the public to exterminate the Tutsi and their accomplices."  And this is in a portion of the pre-trial brief that refers to historical background.  But, I think, as your Honours recognise under Rule 89(C) where there's been this kind of notice, it's certainly possible to lead evidence about this event.  

I would note as well that Your Honours said that when the statement to the witness also provides the disclosure, I would note that the witness has previously talked about the Mugesera speech in his declarations and in other testimony.  But clearly in this case, under the -- under the pre-trial brief exception and also because, as we say, things in regard to historical background, may not always necessarily be pleaded, may not be in the pre-trial brief.  But in this case it's explicitly there.  So we'd submit that we can lead evidence about his attendance and to the content of that speech.  Now, when we get to who was at that rally, then we may be closer to the issue that you dealt with in that decision.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I be heard on this?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can hear you -- we are ready to hear you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Briefly, in reply, I note that yes, the Mugesera speech is mentioned in the pre-trial brief.  It's not in the indictment.  And we believe this is the type of material fact that should be in the indictment, as are the other meetings which are specifically laid out in Paragraphs 24 and 25 of the indictment.  

I point to your own decision in the Zigiranyirazo case, and that was a decision as recently as the 30th of September.  It was the decision on the Defence urgent motion to exclude some parts of the Prosecution pre-trial brief.  In that case, you were confronted with -- of additional information in the pre-trial brief which was not charged in the indictment, and you held that those were material facts which would prejudice the accused if offered at trial.  And, therefore, you excluded the evidence of those events raised for the first time in the pre-trial brief.  

And I believe that the same situation occurred -- takes place here, although admittedly what was excluded in that case was evidence of additional murders, as opposed to simple words, but, nevertheless, the principle is the same.  This is a very notorious event.  If the Prosecutor wanted to lead evidence as to this event or to make some inference of guilt on the part of the accused arising from this event, it should have plead it in the indictment, and so we're asking that it be excluded on that basis.  Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, this is an appeal from the -- an appeal from the interpreters' booth.  There's a lot of background noise which is making our work very difficult.  Suggesting that the microphone or -- be switched off.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) the paragraph 39 in the pre-trial brief, and we've gone through the text that the witness may disclose prior (inaudible) in which there's reference to this testimony.  We think that there adequate notice was given to the Accused, and we permit the question and answer. 
MR. RAPP:
Thank you, your Honour.  

To the witness again, presuming he has his earphone on, I wanted to ask him about the exhibit at 197. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, Mr. Rapp, electronic disclosure would have been very helpful to us.  
MR. RAPP: 
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone please, Mr. Rapp.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we referring to both generally and specific?  
MR. RAPP:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, with all the technology around us, we could easily move towards a paperless situation.  It's so much easier to access material in that form.  
MR. RAPP:
I concur generally, Your Honour.  Obviously, it was a desire here to make sure that things were available, and it was done in hard copy at great effort, but -- we'll look at electronic alternatives for these kinds of materials as well.  

Your Honour, are we with the witness yet at The Hague, or are we dealing with our technical problems?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreters are having problems, audio problems, and the registrar is making an inquiry as to the method in which it can be resolved.  

Yes, the registrar has advised that the matter is being addressed.  He has asked the interpreters to bear a little bit longer, and the technicians are in contact with their counterparts in The Hague.  They are trying to resolve the problem, but he suggests that we continue as we have.

Now, Mr. Rapp, I don't understand why the witness is to be shown this document.  It's not his document, and he would not be entitled to refresh his memory from its contents.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honour, as in the case of so much of the material in Rwanda, the exact source of that document can't be supported through normal foundational evidence.  Who created the recording?  We don't know who created the recording.  This is a tape from RTLM from July 1st, 1994, purported to be.  But it contains what appears to be the text in Kinyarwanda -- well, it contains the audio from the speech by Mugesera on that day and following it, of course, are the texts that are at 197 in the binder.  This witness can provide foundation for the admission of this exhibit by having fully reviewed this and determine whether this was the speech that he heard on that particular speech. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Yeah.  But, see, you're going to show him the speech first.  Let him refresh his memory as to its contents, and then ask him the contents.  Isn't it normally the reverse that's done -- 
MR. RAPP:
Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
-- that he gives evidence about what was said, and we determine if what was said was captured in the document that you have before us? 
MR. RAPP:
That's normally the practice.  But having gone through the Media case where we had twenty thousand pages of documents, almost all the documents had to be brought in by persons who had some knowledge about their contents.  And we wanted the whole document in, not just the witness's recollection and recounting exactly every word that he heard, we wanted the witness to lay a foundation for a particular exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why does he need to refresh his memory from the document to lay a foundation for the exhibit?  
MR. RAPP:
That's -- if the witness -- and we suspect the witness will remember exactly what he heard and he won't -- we won't need to put in the document to refresh his recollection, but I want to put in the document for another reason because we want to build a documentary record of what was said in Rwanda.  And when the final arguments are made, we want to be able to go to page 3 of the speech, or page 7 of the speech, or page 9 of the speech, parts that that he didn't talk about in his testimony.  

If we're going to get documents in, we're going to need that.  Now, we'll later have investigators coming in here trying to bring in great volumes of things without having heard them produced.  This guy heard it, so we want to offer this as a foundation witness to get this document in, not just to refresh his recollection, because his recollection may be fine. 
However the Trial Chamber wishes to proceed, it's not necessary for the content of his testimony today.  It's just, in my view, a necessity when it comes to providing the documentary record that turns out to be the best evidence of what happened in Rwanda during this time period.  

Your Honour, let me proceed with the witness and ask him whether he attended the rally and what he heard.  But then I will want -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have already ruled that you are entitled to do that. 
MR. RAPP:
Okay.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, did you -- you indicated that you attended a rally in Kabaya in rural Gisenyi approximately a week after the rally in Ruhengeri, and you told us who gave the speech -- who was the man of the hour that day, I think was your expression, a Mr. Léon Mugesera.  What did -- what do you recall Mr. Mugesera saying in his speech?  
A.	In the speech that Léon Mugesera made, I can tell you that this speech by Mugesera -- in it he was asking the population to attack their neighbours, those whom they knew and allegedly sent their children to get training from the RPF.  These people were to be hunted down and punished, because he was referring to the Tutsis here.  And, if necessary, they would be sent back as fast as possible to their homes through the Nyabarongo river, which was considered a fast way and send them back to their country of origin, which was Ethiopia. 
Q.	And was the Nyabarongo river a navigable river where living persons could use to get back to Abyssinia or Ethiopia?  
A.	No, it wasn't a navigable river. 
Q.	What did it mean -- what did you understand him to mean when he spoke of sending them back to Ethiopia or Abyssinia through the fast route of the river?  
A.	Throwing someone in the Nyabarongo was certain death.  Departure was like a death which was certain.  
Q.	And what position did Mr. Mugesera hold at the time that he was giving this speech?  
A.	Léon Mugesera was one of the members of the executive committee of the MRND in Gisenyi préfecture.  
Q.	And the -- the rally itself, who sponsored the rally?  
A.	That gathering was a rally organised by the MRND, and it was organised at the level of the Gisenyi préfecture.  
Q.	You indicated that you had come from that rally and you were living in Kigali during that period.  Were there other individuals from outside of the Gisenyi area?  
A.	I'm going to explain.  Because each time there was a popular rally or people's rally in the MRND, the préfecture which was organising the rally would also invite members and the Interahamwe from each préfecture.  On this occasion, it so happens that the Interahamwe from Kigali were in Gisenyi, and many other préfectures had also sent their delegations.  
Q.	Were there representatives there from the national level of the MRND?  
A.	That was certain because each time there were rallies at préfecture level, there would be someone from the executive committee of the MRND at national level who needed to attend the rally and also make a speech.  
Q.	And did such an individual attend from the national level and make a speech?  
A.	As I have just said, each time that there was a rally in the préfectures at local level, the members of the executive committee representing the MRND had a place in the speeches that were to be made on such occasions.  
Q.	Well, do you remember whether there were any speeches by MRND national officials that followed the Mugesera speech?  
A.	You know, there were many speeches made, but the speech of the day was that made by Léon Mugesera.  
Q.	Was there anyone who -- who commented either for or against Léon's message in the speeches that followed his presentation?  
A.	To my knowledge, I didn't hear anyone who may have made a comment, apart from the fact that this speech I think I heard it played on the radio.  
Q.	From your observation, what was the reaction to the speech?  
A.	The general reaction was that killings subsequently took place in Gisenyi préfecture.  There were killings in Gisenyi préfecture, and I think also in Ruhengeri people were killed.  
Q.	To your knowledge, who was killed and what kind of numbers of killings were there?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have an objection to this as now beyond both the indictment and the pre-trial brief, and in the witness statements from this witness.  I don't believe there's any reference whatsoever in any of these materials to killings taking place in 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp. 
MR. RAPP:
(Microphone not activated) my colleagues to quickly take a look at this.  But certainly from my review of the materials, there's reference to a number of killings that occurred in this geographical area of Rwanda at this time and the killings of the Bagogwe that continued into this period and also the killings in Kimilira (phonetic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you -- can you point us to a paragraph in the indictment?  

MR. RAPP:
Yes, certainly.

1630H
MR. RAPP:
Anyway -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We were waiting on you, you know.  We were ourselves making a review of the indictment, but we are waiting for your assistance, if you could point us to -- to where reference is made to these allegations.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honour, as I would note under your decision of -- that you were citing earlier, one of the other ways that one can look at -- at this issue is the statements of the witnesses and also the references in the pre-trial brief that includes annexed thereto the statements of witnesses.  Particularly, I would note the testimony of ZF that would describe the meeting that took place in November 1992, involving Léon Mugesera, and continues to say these meetings were proximate in time and place to the attacks on Tutsis in Gisenyi in 1992.  

Moreover this witness that we have in front of us now, has in all of his prior testimony described at length or testimonies disclosed in the form of witness statements, prior witness statements, to the Defence.  His statement that -- what the effect was of Mugesera's speech in terms of the killings that followed.  A decision was made in this particular case.  This used to be a 100-page indictment.  It went through every item of historical background.  And to shorten it and to deal with the background information by way of the witness statements or by way of the pre-trial brief and not deal with the same level of specificity as it occurred in the prior indictment, and --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Rapp, I thought that the degree of specificity in the present indictment had improved.  It's just that the allegations were more limited.  Certainly, if the Prosecutor proves the allegations in the indictment, they would have got a conviction.  So why do you need to prove other allegations that are not in the indictment?  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, this -- this is a case that involves complex historical facts, background and information that is necessary to know in order to -- to draw the conclusions, the inferences from the evidence that would be presented about events that occurred that are specifically pleaded.  That Nyiramasuhuko decision, of course, allows evidence that's unpleaded in regard to intent to be led specifically, and we certainly submit that this kind of evidence is intent evidence.  It's the kind of thing that we need to present background.  

It is not a surprise to these Accused in any way, shape or form.  We shouldn't be engaged in a game of "gotcha here" where every time someone leads testimony that's been noticed and heard many times in these Chambers beforehand, it's part of the background of these events that occurred in Rwanda between 1990 and 1994 to say, "Oh, it's not in this particular indictment, therefore, we are going to ignore this particular historical context."  We think that's important, and we've made general reference to it in the pre-trial brief and in the statements of witnesses and we submit that that is sufficient.  If it isn't, we are going to have a very difficult time presenting this particular witness because we're going to lead him through a lot of what he said.  Without update, it was never objected to in the past.  A lot of background is necessary to understand the context to the events that are alleged in the indictment, and we are not going to progress as we hoped in terms of completing his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, you see, what bothers me is:  why do you think it's necessary to lead evidence of the killings of people who are not referred to in the indictment?  Here we have a case dealing with killing, and now you are leading evidence of killings that is not pleaded.  Is that necessary for this trial?  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, we have, of course, a temporal jurisdiction of 1994, and it hasn't been raised yet, of course, but obviously what occurred in 1992 is outside that temporal jurisdiction.  That would be another ground upon which he could object.  But what you have, we allege, is a sensitisation, a sort of action/reaction sort of method that is developed over time that's followed by impunity on the part of officials.  We think that understanding that context makes it possible then to understand why when particular things are said in (unintelligible) in '94, the reaction occurs at that time.  And we think that's important to understand that.  Now, that's not to say that those allegations that we're talking about in the past are in and of themselves criminal.  We can't allege that.  It's criminal unless we can tie them into conspiracy, which we are not attempting to do at this moment with this testimony.  But, you know, it's necessary to understand the background and the context of what was meant in Rwanda when a person said something about the Nyabarongo river, once one talked about the enemy, when one talked about Ibyitso, when one talked about Inkotanyi and Inyenzi; that's necessary.  And you have here a witness who was there and who can talk about what he heard and what the reaction was.  And we think that's important to understanding the context and we short ourselves if we don't hear that evidence, and in terms of our mission of trying to understand what occurred in Rwanda in 1994, and what led to these crimes and why -- and how these gentlemen could have formed this intent.  We think it's important.  And if we can't lead it, we will not be able to able, in my view, to fulfill part of our mission here.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, may I be heard briefly on this?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
First of all, I hope the witness doesn't -- isn't listening to this entire dialogue.  I didn't want to interrupt Mr. Rapp, but if the people in The Hague could take -- could be asked to conduct the practice of having the witness remove his headphones when we have a legal argument, I would appreciate it if you could give that direction.  
MR. FRY:
This is the registry in Arusha.  Could you please organise for the witness not have his earphones on.  I can see him now.  Okay, thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I'd like to answer your question about the indictment, because I think it's very important.  Now we are talking about killings at a different level than speeches, and it becomes even more prejudicial when uncharged killings are sought to be admitted.  

The only count that could be even possibly related to events before 1994 is the conspiracy count, and in Count 1 in the indictment on page 7 it talks about -- it charges a conspiracy and that in the -- that over a period of at least one year leading up to the 6th April to 17th July 1994, there was this conspiracy.  So that one year would begin in April 1993, and these events are well before that.  

Secondly, in paragraph 23, it says that over the course of several years leading up to and including 1994, particularly after 1992, and it goes on to say that there was this conspiracy.  So the evidence of killings that's sought to be admitted is even outside the scope of what is alleged in the indictment.  So not only is there not notice of these specific killings in the indictment, but the indictment leads us to believe that the conspiracy, the broadest possible count, wasn't even in existence during these events.  And I think it's even more reason for excluding this evidence.  

And the jurisprudence is -- this very pre-1994 evidence has to be scrutinised very carefully.  The Bagosora decision which was -- went up to the Appeals Chamber set forth a number of factors to be considered when taking evidence of crimes committed before 1994 and trying to have them admitted.  And it certainly doesn't arise to the level of intent on the part of Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Ngirumpatse or Mr. Karemera, to admit evidence of killings that occurred in 1992, particularly when there is no evidence that any of these members -- people were present at this speech, authorised the speech or with Mr. Nzirorera's case, was even holding an office of the MRND at the national level in 1992 when the speech was given.  So the prejudicial value of admitting evidence of this for intent purposes for 1992 is strongly outweighed -- the probative value is strongly outweighed by the prejudice.  We would ask that this evidence be excluded and any reference to killings following the speech of Mr. Mugesera be stricken.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the view we have is that the question, "What was the general reaction to the speech?" was a question which we'll allow and we allow the answer to that question.  So what is on the record, we allow.  

We do not allow the question which sought to elicit the identity of specific individuals who were killed and the circumstances of their death, because we think now that introduces issues which are not -- not pleaded and which adequate notice was not given.  So the question as to the names of the individuals that were killed, we do not allow that.  
MR. RAPP:
If we can ask the witness to have his earphones on again and we'll proceed.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, can you hear me?  No  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The connection to The Hague has been lost.  The -- we will take our -- a short break now.  We hope it doesn't take longer than 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1651H to 1708H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, if -- you can you hear me?  
A.	Yes, I can. 
Q.	Witness, earlier you talked about several rallies that you attended around the country during the period from November '91 to November '92.  Did you continue to attend rallies in Rwanda where the -- where the Interahamwe appeared, rallies sponsored by the MRND political party? 
A.	Yes, I attended rallies organised by the MRND in various préfectures.  
Q.	And earlier we had talked about the arms that were carried by Interahamwe at some of those rallies.  Did there come a time that the Interahamwe received arms that were not traditional weapons? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when was that? 
A.	It was in 1993. 
Q.	And what kind of arms did they receive? 
A.	The Interahamwe received firearms; in other words, guns. 
Q.	And do you know what the source of those guns were -- or was? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what was that source? 
A.	About 800 guns were given by the ministry of defence, MINADEF, a position occupied by a member of the MRND, who gave them to the chairman of the MRND of the time, who was Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	And did all of those arms reach the Interahamwe? 
A.	No. 
Q.	About how many did reach the Interahamwe? 
A.	The ministry of defence had been given 800 (sic), out of those, 400 were given to person number 1 on the Exhibit P. 9.  Four hundred in all. 
Q.	And those 400 that went to person number 1, where did those -- what was the designation?  Where did those arms end up? 
A.	The majority of the weapons were distributed in Kigali secteurs, in secteurs where the Kigali Interahamwe were.  In each secteur weapons were distributed. 
Q.	What kind of weapons?  You said guns.  Could you describe them with more particularity? 
A.	They were guns which were known as Uzi and other guns which were also used by the Rwandan army. 
Q.	You indicated it came from the ministry of defence and they were of the type of guns used by the Rwandan army.  Was there any training provided to the Interahamwe in how to use those guns?
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to interpose an objection here.  I was actually waiting for Mr. Rapp to lay a foundation as to how this witness knows of the distribution of weapons and -- before we move on to another topic.  I see that that's not being done, so I'm going to ask that the entire testimony about distribution of weapons be stricken for a lack of foundation, unless a foundation is laid as to how he knows that and you can determine whether or not those sources of information are reliable before it's admitted.  Thank you.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, I would be a happy to do that.  Some of -- as I indicated, one of disadvantages of open and closed sessions, and sometimes it's difficult to lay a foundation in open session, but we'll attempt to do that.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	What was the source of your information about the receipt and distribution of the arms? 
A.	I was told about the distribution of the weapons by person number 1 who received these weapons.  And the distribution was done by person number 1, assisted by person number 6 on P. 9.
(Pages 56 to 60 by Gifty C. Harding)










1715H 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Did you see any of these weapons?  
A.	-- and these weapons were given to one Emmanuel Turatsinze, who was working within the MRND and was the link between the chairman of the MRND and the Interahamwe.  He gave 800.  Out of the 800, there were 400 which were consigned by Turatsinze, Emmanuel, and the remaining 400 were given to person number 1.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. -- excuse me, Mr. President.  I now would like to move to strike the information about the distribution of weapons on grounds under Rule 89(C), and it's related to hearsay and reliability.  Obviously hearsay evidence can be admitted under some circumstances in this Tribunal when it's deemed to be reliable.  In this particular case -- and I'd ask that the witness take his headphones off if it's not already being done.  

In this particular case, the source of the information number 1 is deceased, first of all, so he can't be cross-examined or is not available for this evidence to be tested.  And, secondly, he is a person who's alleged to be the head of this organisation, alleged to have been engaged in many criminal activities and not the kind of person who one would necessarily find to be reliable.  And so based on the information that you've been provided, that this was the source of the hearsay information, I believe that lack -- the Prosecution has not met its burden of showing a reliable source for this information, and, therefore, it should be excluded.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp?  
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honour, frankly, we're prepared to respond to that, and we think clearly it is admissible under the precedence of this -- of this Tribunal.  But I would note there was a follow-up question that I asked and wasn't interpreted because the witness was talking, and I hadn't been aware that his answer had not concluded.  And that was the question, had he seen these arms.  And I'd appreciate it if perhaps we could get an answer to that question before we move ahead to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly. 
MR. RAPP:
-- to rule on this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may ask that question.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, if you could put the headphones back on.  Did you see any of these arms?  
A.	Yes, I saw them.  
Q.	And where did you see them?  
A.	I saw these weapons in the home of number 1.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, with that evidence, I submit that even if -- even if the decisions weren't as they are on hearsay, that there's sufficient foundation for this witness having received this information from number 1 and having physically seen arms there to -- for its admission.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, can I just reply briefly to that?  Certainly as to what he saw, there's no problem, and that's correct, but he's also testified that these guns came from the ministry of defence by virtue of Mr. Ngirumpatse, and I don't believe that there's any foundation for the reliability of that information.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we think that this goes to weight rather than admissibility.  

You may proceed, Mr. Rapp.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could you kindly repeat your ruling for the benefit of the interpreters in the French booth?  They didn't hear you, unfortunately.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  I said that Mr. -- we have decided that Mr. Robinson's objection is not allowed.  It goes to the weight of the testimony rather than to its admissibility.  And then I asked Mr. Rapp to continue his examination.  
MR. RAPP:
Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, we were asking about training, and the first question is, do you know if the Interahamwe received training, military training, in the use of arms?  And -- and then if you could also state what the source of your information is in answering that question.  
A.	The Interahamwe received military training, in other words, how to handle the weapons.  The first source is that one of the Interahamwe went for training in Gisenyi.  And one day, when he came back from the training, I met him, and I asked him where he had been, because it had been a time since I had seen him.  So he explained to me that he, together with a group of other people, had gone to Gisenyi for training.  

Another source is person number 9 in Exhibit P. 9, and I had a meeting with him.  He told me of the venue at which I should meet him after work.  So after work I went to see him where I was supposed to see him.  When I got there, there was a watchman whom I told that I had come to see one person under the name number 9, and he went to call him from where he was.  And when the gentleman under number 9 came back, I asked him what he was doing there.  So he told me that they started military training, and that during that training, they learned how to clean a weapon, how to use a weapon, and how to handle a weapon.  And this is a reliable source, and this is how I came to know about the military training which was being undertaken.  
Q.	Witness, just in terms of the sequence of events, did the military training occur before or after the distribution of the 800 arms that you described -- or, rather, that 800 arms being given by the MINADEF and the 400 going to the Interahamwe?  Which came first?  
A.	The training in the handling of weapons took place before the distribution of those weapons.  
Q.	And I think you've described two examples of training, one where you were talking about number 9 receiving some training in handling, and then you referred to an individual that you had spoken to that had received training elsewhere.  Was there a difference in the kind of training that we're talking about here, between what number 9 received and what your other individual told you about?  
A.	Yes, there was a difference.  The difference was, the first individual received training in one of the camps which was used for the training of military personnel.  And the other individual received training in a place where there was no possibility of having in-depth training, in other words, shooting, because it was in a location where everybody would be able to hear the sound made by the weapons.  
Q.	Now, Witness, and Your Honours, if we can look at a document that's at page 70 or tab -- I believe tab 77 of binder 2, a document that -- it says "MRND Interahamwe 14-2-1993," being 14th February 1993.  Witness, I believe at that tab, you'll find a handwritten letter in French, followed by a translation in French.  Have you reached that document?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And who -- who signed this document?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  We're not finding that in tab 70.  We're finding a typed document.  
MR. RAPP:
Tab 77.  Excuse me.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, do you have that document in front of you?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And just by way of identification, who signed this document, and what's the date of the document?  
A.	This document was signed by Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 15th of February 1993.  
Q.	Are you familiar with the document?  
A.	I believe this is a document which was a personal letter which was being written to the president, who was also the chairman of the MRND at the time.  It's -- it was very confidential.  I have not been aware of this letter before.  
Q.	Well, then, leaving aside the particular document, were you aware of the position of Mr. Ngirumpatse regarding the training of young people by the Interahamwe -- by the military -- the training of the militias by the military?  
A.	I think that as chairman of the MRND party -- or, rather, as secretary-general of the party from May 1992, and as chairman of the party from July 1993, I believe that he knew that there was military training going on for the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to that as being speculation, without foundation.  
THE WITNESS:
May I add something?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, you may say something.  
THE WITNESS:
Here I feel I can add something, and that is, in 1993, I believe it was, there was a meeting that Mr. Ngirumpatse had, together with the opposition parties of the time, parties which had had problems, in other words, parties which had been infiltrated.  And one of these parties was called Power.  On that occasion, he allegedly asked the members of the MDR Power, who were there in the person of Édouard (sic) Karamira, if they could send some of the members of the JMDR for military training, because the Interahamwe -- some Interahamwe of the MRND had received such training.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	And just to follow that up, Witness -- well, first of all, you used the word "Édouard Karamira."  Is that the prénom of the individual that we're talking about from MDR Power?  
A.	I'm sorry.  I meant Karamira, Froduald.  
Q.	Thank you.  And in regard to that particular bit of information about that approach to the MDR Power wing, what's the source of your information as to that approach having been made by Mr. Ngirumpatse to Mr. Karamira?  
A.	My first source was my brother-in-law who was one of the persons who attended the meeting, and he spoke to me about it.  My second source is the Prime Minister Kambanda when we met in Nairobi.  On one occasion we spoke, and he told me that the MRND had suggested that our youths be sent for military training and that the MDR had not sent its own youths for military training.  
Q.	Just in regard to brother-in-law, because we have two of them listed on Exhibit P. 8, and we don't want, of course, to identify you by the name of the brother-in-law, looking at P. 8, at "Protected Information of Witness G," there are two persons on that list as brother-in-laws.  Is it the first one or the second one?  
A.	It's the first name.  
Q.	Thank you.  With the advent of military training, what had the Interahamwe become, in your observation?  
A.	From my observations, with the military training and the distribution of the weapons, the Interahamwe became bodyguards for MRND personalities.  
Q.	Let me ask, what kind of person became a member of the MRND -- or, excuse me, of the Interahamwe?  And particularly here let's talk about the period -- well, the various periods of the party -- or the Interahamwe.  Did the type of person change after November of 1991?  Be my first question.  
A.	Yes, it changed.  
Q.	How did it change?  
A.	In 1991, when the Interahamwe were created, there were young people brought in by number 1.  During the rallies we were told to invite our friends.  At one point they asked to recruit Interahamwe from the ranks of the unemployed.  After 1991, at one point, the Interahamwe included army reservists who became Interahamwe in the different préfectures.  
Q.	And was there a reason why there were army reservists available for recruitment at this time?  
A.	You know, at that time, the MRND did not have the same power as it did before when it was a single party.  With the multiparty system, the MRND could not allow itself to have bodyguards from the gendarmerie or from the army.  The MRND did not trust those gendarmes, or soldiers, but they did trust the Interahamwe.  That's why they used people who had left the army.  Those officials or authorities took them as Interahamwe, and they became their bodyguards.  
Q.	Earlier today you mentioned the Interahamwe going out to the préfectoral level, the level outside of -- of Kigali, and establishing Interahamwe organisations in those préfectures, after that party congress in 1992.  Were those Interahamwe organisations in the préfectures outside Kigali under the control of the national committee of the Interahamwe?  
A.	After the Interahamwe were created in the different préfectures, they fell directly under the MRND committee at the préfecture level.  
Q.	And did anyone at the national level exercise any control over those Interahamwe at the préfectoral level?  
A.	The national committee had no authority over the Interahamwe in the préfectures.  
Q.	If the Interahamwe national committee had no control over them in the préfectures, did the MRND at the national level have any control over them at the préfectures?  
A.	The executive committee of the MRND was above all.  It had all of its -- all of the authority with regard to MRND activities, be it in Kigali or any other préfecture of Rwanda.  
Q.	And as of July 1993, who was on the executive committee of the MRND, nationally?  
A.	There was a congress in July 1993.  Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse became party chairman.  There were two vice-chairmen, Édouard Karemera and Ferdinand Kagima (phonetic), and the national secretary was Joseph Nzirorera.  
Q.	Did any of these individuals have a specific role to play in the formation of the Interahamwe in the préfectures outside of Kigali?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Who had such a role, and what did they do to establish the Interahamwe in a préfecture outside Kigali?  
A.	I could say that Joseph Nzirorera was a member of the MRND committee in Ruhengeri préfecture.  In Ruhengeri, in Mukingo, his commune, it was said that there were Interahamwe who belonged to Joseph Nzirorera personally.

If I may be permitted, Your Honour, to ask the question of the witness:  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	What is the source of your information as to the role of Mr. Nzirorera and the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I can give you an example, a very specific one.  In Mukingo commune there was a woman who worked at the commercial bank; that woman, I'm sorry to say, had a child with Nzirorera.  The Interahamwe from Mukingo commune killed the Bagogwe in that area; that woman was Bagogwe herself.  Her family was saved because she had a child with Nzirorera.  That woman was someone who I met once.  She told me that, "Thanks to that child, the Interahamwe of Mukingo commune belonging to Nzirorera spared her family."  
Q.	You have mentioned this killing of Bagogwe by the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune; when did that occur? 
A.	You know the killing of the Bagogwe took place for several periods in 1992 and 1993.  There were many killings of the Bagogwe. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to object to any evidence of killings of Bagogwe in 1992 and 1993 as not being pleaded in the indictment, and asked that that answer be stricken.  And if I can also add to that objection this appears nowhere in any of the witness' statements or previous testimony of this witness.  It is completely new material.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, I believe that this witness is -- the person he is referring to may be on the witness list, and I believe that there has been disclosure about it.  I would note, however, that when the counsel for the Accused asked -- or asked the witness for source -- or demands the source of his information, and isn't willing to trust his account, and the witness then has to draw on his memory to recall exactly the basis for the conclusions that he has reached, that is fair game, that is part of the process of sourcing information.  And that in regard to Bagogwe there is certainly allegations in the pre-trial brief; indeed, there are allegations in the indictment itself about pre '94, about killings.  

And I believe -- and perhaps the question of exactly the time period of the Bagogwe killings is over a range of time periods and isn't specifically nailed down always, but we submit that there is sufficient notice of the killings of the Bagogwe in northwest Rwanda, and all of the materials that have been provided, for this answer to be admitted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, where as your attempt to refer us to the source of notice might be very extensive, it is rather too extensive for us to find it --  
MR. RAPP:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you point to it?
MR. RAPP:
(Microphone not activated) -- okay in the --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, we think, that the evidence, until your last question, was admissible.  You have a problem with your last question when you are now trying to be specific.  Tell us when the Bagogwe killings occurred --  
MR. RAPP:
If we look at -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is where we have a problem. 
MR. RAPP:
Okay, in 43 of the pre-trial brief, and it refers to the period after the breaking of the ceasefire, February -- this is page -- this is page 12 of the pre-trial brief, paragraph 43.  And it refers to the time period when the RPF violated the ceasefire agreement by attacking Ruhengeri once again.  I think that it is a matter of clear knowledge, I think on the 8th of February 1993, albeit in response to attacks against the local Tutsi population, "The MRND ferociously unleashed the Interahamwe against the Bagogwe in Mukingo commune, burning their homes and arresting and killing scores of Bagogwe men, causing hundreds to abandon their homes and take refuge in public buildings, where they were guarded by the local gendarmerie."  

And the footnote here, Number 8, deals with, "The massacres were instigated and organised by local authorities with the complicity of certain prominent persons within the president`s circle; therein can be found the components of the strategy which culminated in the genocide of 1994."  

So here we are talking -- the witness is telling us about killings of the Bagogwe occurring in `92, `93 and referring to specific information about Nzirorera, a particular woman who was Bagogwe having been saved.  And I submit that there is appropriate notice here.  And, indeed, once again we are talking about this sort of background that is relevant to the case entirely.  And I think we'll get into it more specifically with the witness herself, if she comes, we will deal with that as well there in the context of the allegations. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I could respond briefly to that?  Mr. President, first of all, this is a very serious incident involving killings.  And to -- even if it is alluded to in the pre-trial brief, your decision in the Zigiranyirazo of September 30th is identically on point, where there were additional killings in the pre-trial brief that you excluded evidence of because they weren't in the indictment.  This is the exact same situation.  

Furthermore, I think you can rule on a much more narrow ground than that, that is in none of these witness statements or testimony which runs into probably over a 1000 pages, there is never any notice that this witness will give testimony about the events in Mukingo commune, or the killing of Bagogwe. And so on that basis alone, we have no notice of it and it should be excluded.  And also simply because it is not in the indictment and the reference in the pre-trial brief to a serious thing like killings is insufficient.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Our concern really is on an issue which has not been actually argued.  The witness has identified his source of information, which is what he was told by the lady about whom he spoke.  In that context, the question you asked is speculative, because he has not given any information to show how he could know when the Bagogwe killings occurred.  He might have information about when this lady's life was spared.  So, it is difficult to see how, from the source of information he identified, you could ask him more than about what he gathered from his informant, which would have had to do with her (inaudible). 
MR. RAPP:
I'm not sure I follow.  Obviously, we have these Bagogwe killings that are prominent and discussed by international commissions and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this witness was asked about his source of information.  And he said he was told by this lady about how her life was spared. 
MR. RAPP:
Right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you have asked him a question which calls for speculation on his part, unless some other foundation is laid, he has not shown how he could know about the Bagogwe killings but he knows how this lady's life was spared, and he could probably say if she gave him information about when this occurred. 
MR. RAPP:
Right.  Then if I might be permitted to proceed, Your Honour.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	From this individual with whom you spoke, Witness, did you have an indication of when these killings of Bagogwe occurred in Mukingo commune? 
A.	That woman spoke to me about it personally; it is not something I heard, she told me personally.  I knew her well. 
Q.	You may not understand the question.  We were asking about the time that these killings occurred, you said that you had spoken to her, obviously, some time after they had occurred.  And in the course of your conversations with her did you discover when the killings had occurred in Mukingo commune based -- and it doesn't have to be an exact date, but did you determine what period they occurred?  
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you the date but what I can say is that when I spoke to her, when we spoke about this, it was fresh.  It was something which had happened a few weeks prior to our conversation, but I cannot tell you the specific period. 
Q.	In that regard, when did you talk to her, approximately? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to give you the date or the year, but what is certain is that I spoke with this lady just a little time after the killings of the Bagogwe took place in Ruhengeri prefecture.  
Q.	Was this prior to 6 April 1994? 
A.	Yes, it was well before the 6th of April 1994. 
Q.	And on the other end, was it after the establishment of the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri prefecture? 
A.	No, as I have said, it was the Interahamwe of the Ruhengeri prefecture.  It was the Interahamwe belonging to Nzirorera and it happened after the establishment of the Interahamwe in the prefecture itself. 
Q.	Let me proceed then to ask -- you mentioned Mr. Nzirorera having this role of establishing Interahamwe at the prefecture level.  Did either of these other Accused gentlemen, Édouard Karemera or        Mathieu Ngirumpatse play any specific role on the establishment of Interahamwe at the préfectural level outside of Kigali? 
A.	As I have said earlier, in the prefectures it was the members of the préfectural committee of the MRND in the prefecture in question who were responsible for the establishment of the Interahamwe.  And in Kibuye prefecture, Édouard Karemera was a member of the préfectural committee; therefore, Karemera as a member of the préfectural -- or the executive committee of the MRND in the prefecture must have played a role in the establishment of the MRND in that prefecture.  
Q.	Witness, you just used the term "MRND" did you mean MRND establishing in that prefecture or something else that was established in that prefecture? 
A.	It is the -- it is the establishment of the Interahamwe in that prefecture. 
Q.	And finally, Witness, Mr. Ngirumpatse, did he have any role in the establishment of the Interahamwe in Kigali itself? 
A.	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse played a role in the establishment of the Interahamwe in Kigali town.  Even during the establishment in November 1991 he was there; he was there as the coordinator of the prefecture of Kigali.  And I think on one occasion he even attended a meeting for the establishment of the Interahamwe during which he encouraged the members present. 
Q.	Did Mr. Ngirumpatse meet with the executive committee of the Interahamwe, the national executive committee that was in charge of the organisation in Kigali? 
A.	Mr. Ngirumpatse was secretary general of the party and he also became chairman of the party, but before he became secretary general of the party, he was the coordinator of the MRND in Kigaliville prefecture. 
Q.	Just, if you could estimate, and I want to be clear on this because we are running late, I think, did -- did he meet specifically with the national committee of the Interahamwe, as you have indicated, in charge of the Interahamwe in Kigali, during the period that he was in either of these three roles as local coordinator in the prefecture, before he became secretary general of the national party or after he became chairman or president of the national party? 
A.	Yes, he met members of the national committee of the Interahamwe when he was coordinator of the party, MRND in Kigali and when he was secretary general of the party, and when he was also the chairman of the party. 
Q.	And can you give a range as to the number of times he had these meetings? 
A.	As I said earlier, he met members of the national committee, I would say about 15 times, one, five.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, I'm prepared to proceed on till which ever time you want to designate to conclude this evening.  I was uncertain, you indicated earlier that we would break at six our time and five there. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a convenient time. 
MR. RAPP:
I can begin to deal with another subject if it would be a convenient time to break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this is the Judge speaking.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we are going to take our adjournment now until tomorrow morning.  As I mentioned to you earlier today, during this as on any other adjournment, you remain a witness of our Tribunal and you are not to discuss the case with anybody or your testimony with anybody.  We will take the recess now until tomorrow morning at --  
MR. RAPP:
I believe we said 9:30 here and 8:30 there, unless we wish to meet earlier to deal with other matters before 9:30. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I don't recall that there is anything that was pending.  Does --  do you have any issue to deal with?  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
There is though one minor thing that I would like to raise, we can raise it after this witness is dismissed.  It should only take around five minutes, Your Honour, or we may want to wait until tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, any issues?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, Your Honour, not right now.  I may think of some overnight, but nothing at the moment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was about to think of something nice to say, but I need to hold it until tomorrow morning.

Yes, the witness is now excused, and you are to return tomorrow morning, is it 9:30 or 10 o'clock, 9:30 here, 8:30 in The Hague.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Actually, Mr. President, your scheduling order says that we begin at 10, we can come at 9:30, but your scheduling order says 10. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that was to accommodate the time when The Hague opens for business.  Yes, the scheduling order did say 10 o'clock.  We start here at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, and 9 o'clock in The Hague.  So the witness is now excused.

Mr. Robinson, we will hear you now -- oh dear, I mean Mr. Webster, we will hear you now.  You did comment earlier that you and Mr. Robinson were finding common ground.

1815H
MR. WEBSTER:
Since he's been reading my e-mails, I don't know how much more common we could -- we could get, which I'm still a bit miffed about.  But it's a minor issue.  It's in relation to the first witness that we took, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  When he was in the middle of his cross-examination, I believe Mr. Robinson raised the prospect of asking him for one of the documents that he had allowed us to inspect around two weeks ago.  

There were two documents, one was his letter of resignation; another was a document in Kinyarwanda.  And I believe Mr. Robinson expressed an interest in looking at it, and we in the Prosecution would also like to see it, and I'm wondering if it wouldn't be convenient to ask WVSS to ask the witness if he could provide a copy for us to have it translated during this period, which would give us at least a week to ten days before he appears before this Tribunal.  

And then, again, addressing the Court's scheduling order, I believe there was mention of there being a holiday in The Hague on the 24th or -- I don't recall -- the 24th.  So if we could ask the WVSS to make that witness available on that date when it's impossible to continue with the video link and we could at least be prepared on a specific date, and also to perhaps have a copy of the document that he made mention of.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Fine.  Mr. Registrar, would, in fact -- do you recall the witness's position and the position of counsel?  So we would authorise you to ask WVSS to request the production of the documents for inspection by the Prosecutor and the Defence counsel in this trial.  We will also consider the resumption of the cross-examination of GHJ.  In fact, we had hoped that the entire testimony of this witness would be concluded by the 4th, so it would be more or less automatic.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm just anticipating the contingencies, Your Honour, but with respect to the inspection, we've already had inspection of the documents.  So, actually, what I'm asking is if the witness could consent to providing us with a copy and he could provide the copy to CMS -- or CMS through WVSS, and CMS could then make a copy available to us, the Prosecutor, and to the -- to the Accused.  And it's only one document.  There were two that were allowed for inspection, his letter of resignation -- we all have copies of already.  It's just the press communiqué or the press release that interests me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How -- how large a document is that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe it was two pages.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Two pages.
MR. WEBSTER:
It was one sheet, double-sided. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  Mr. Registrar, it really seems to be more than inspection.  There's a desire to have it translated, so if that could be communicated to the witness.  His consent is necessary.  
MR. FRY:
So noted, your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Can we take the adjournment now?  
(Court adjourned at 1820H)
