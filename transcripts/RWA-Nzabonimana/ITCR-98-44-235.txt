MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Emile Francis Short; and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, 
Thursday, the 16th of February 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Now, appearances, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:

I think I should repeat everything. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  I'm Peter Robinson for Joseph Nzirorera.  It's my pleasure to introduce to the Trial Chamber my co-counsel, 
Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi, who is joining us for the first time today.  We're also assisted by our our legal assistant, Leopold Nsengiyumva. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the Bench welcomes your co-counsel, and we trust that he has a protective -- productive tour of duty in the case. 

This afternoon we are about to deliver orally our decision on the motion applying first day of proceedings, and I will get straight to the main business of the day.  

Decision:  In a motion filed on the 6th of February 2006, Nzirorera moves for a stay of proceedings until 60 days after all the material identified in his motion is disclosed.  Nzirorera claims that the Prosecution's failure to disclose is depriving him of a fair trial.  

Ngirumpatse joined Nzirorera's motion on 9th February 2006, and further requests his provisional release during the stay of proceedings.  

The Chamber ordered oral arguments to take place on Monday, 13th of February 2006, on the issues at stake.  During the arguments, Karemera also supported some of the submissions made by his co-defendants.  At the oral hearing, further information was provided by the parties, which assisted the Court in ruling on these matters.  

The Chamber is of the view that the following disclosure issues raised by the Defence in the motion for stay of proceedings are now resolved:  One, the disclosure of Rwandan documents has been decided in the decision on motions for the order for production of documents by the government of Rwanda and for consequential orders dated 13th February 2006.  

Two, time limits for filing expert witness reports have been decided in several prior decisions.  
Three, the impact of partial or late disclosure of material regarding Witness G and Mbonyunkiza on their cross-examination has also been previously addressed by the Chamber.  We had ruled that the witnesses could be re-called at a later stage, if necessary. 

And, four, the partial disclosure of documents concerning Witness T has also been already decided by the Chamber.  

There is no need for the Chamber to repeat the content of these decisions.  It must be emphasised, however, that in each case the Chamber expressly took into consideration the rights of all the Accused to a fair trial, including the right to cross-examine a witness, the right to have adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence, and the right to be tried without undue delay.  

Accordingly, the issues that remain for the Chamber to resolve with respect to the present motion are, firstly, alleged violations of Rule 66(A)2; secondly, alleged violations of Rule 68, disclosure; and, thirdly, issues of unavailable translations.  

Now, firstly, Rule 66(A)2, disclosure.  The Defence for Nzirorera requests a stay of proceedings until the Prosecution has complied with its obligations pursuant to Rule 66(A)2, which requires it to disclose the statements of all the witnesses it plans to call at trial no later than 60 days prior to the commencement of trial.  In particular, it requests disclosure of Witness AWB's prior statement from the Bagilishema trial six years ago and of Witness GFA's testimony in the Ndindiliyimana case from the week of 30th January 2006.  

The Defence for Nzirorera also claims that the Prosecution failed several times to disclose witness statements in its possession within the 60 days prior to the commencement of the trial.  

The Prosecution responds by disclosing AWB's requested statement and argues that, although the disclosure might have been late, this does not justify a stay because information is already in the hands of the Defence.  It concedes that it has not yet disclosed Witness GFA's testimony in the Ndindiliyimana case but contends that its failure is due to the delay in posting the transcripts on the TRIM database.  

In the present case, the Chamber notes that the Prosecution recognises that it did not act with the required diligence when disclosing Witness AWB's statement.  Additionally, although the transcript of Witness GFA may not be posted in the TRIM database, the Tribunal's standard procedure is for the parties to be served with the transcripts by the registry five days after the testimony is heard.  The Prosecutor should be able to comply with its obligations in respect of this witness, and we order the immediate disclosure of the requested transcripts.  
Although the Prosecution cannot disclose what it does not have in its possession, it is expected to make the disclosure at the earliest opportunity.  As a result, the Chamber expresses its disapproval of the conduct of the Prosecution.  The Prosecution trial team is expected to perform its disclosure duties in accordance with the rules and the due administration of justice.  

However, the lack of diligence on the part of the Prosecution does not substantially handicap the preparations of the Defence because they already have access to the statements regarding -- relating to AWB and will get GFA's transcripts in time to avoid the kind of prejudice that would require a stay of proceedings.  

Now, secondly, the Rule 68 disclosure.  The Defence also claims that the Prosecution has not complied with its obligations under Rule 68 of the rules.  From the oral arguments submitted by the parties in Court, it appears that they have a conflicting interpretation of that rule.  The Prosecution has a positive and continuous obligation under Rule 68 of the rules to disclose, as soon as practicable, to the -- to the Defence any material which, in its actual knowledge, may suggest the innocence, or mitigate the guilt, of the Accused or affect the credibility of the Prosecution's evidence.  

It is an important part of the machinery to provide a fair trial to the Accused.  That initial assessment of such exculpatory material must be done by the Prosecution in good faith, and it must assist in the proper administration of international criminal justice by providing the Accused with any information which may assist him to impeach the credibility of the Prosecution's witnesses.  

If the Accused wishes to show that the Prosecution is in breach of these obligations, it must identify specifically the materials sought, present a prima facie showing of its probable exculpatory nature, and prove the Prosecutor's custody or control of the materials requested.  Breach of the Prosecution's obligations do not always create prejudice to the Accused, partly in cases where, as the appeals Chamber stated in the Niyitegeka case, the existence of the relevant exculpatory evidence is known and accessible to the Defence. 

When the disclosure of material which could assist the Accused to impeach the testimony of a Prosecution witness is made so late that it has an impact on the fairness of the trial, different lines of remedies have been utilised by Trial Chambers.  The evidence could be excluded, the trial or the testimony could be postponed, the cross-examination of the witness could be deferred, or the witness could be re-called.  In addition to these remedies, sanctions can be imposed against counsel when there is conduct which willfully interferes with the administration of justice, obstructs the proceedings, or is contrary to the interests of justice.  

The Chamber notes three different circumstances concerning the Prosecution's compliance with Rule 68 in this case:  One, the Prosecution claims that it does not have the requested information; two, the Prosecution agrees that it has some of the information sought but claims that it is not Rule 68 material; or, three, the Prosecution had the material and has or is making late disclosure.  

One, where the Prosecution does not have the requested information.  The onus of showing that the Prosecution has custody or control of information requested is on the Accused.  In relation to material -- to certain material alleged to affect the credibility of Witnesses Mbonyunkiza, UB, GFA, and GBU, Prosecution counsel declared that, to his knowledge, the Prosecution did not take or have -- or, have statements, as asserted by Nzirorera.  

The Defence was not in a position to provide evidence to rebut the Prosecution's representations but invited the Chamber to draw inferences from the circumstances that the Prosecution had made admissions of custody of a number of statements only after the Defence had been able to establish that the Prosecution, in fact, had the documents.  He also suggested that the Prosecution had indicated that there were deficiencies in the certain mechanisms available so that the denials of possession were not reliable and the Chamber should weigh the likelihood of enquiries having been made from the surrounding circumstances, such as the testimony referring to the witnesses and the likelihood of consequent investigations in search of supporting and corroborating evidence. 

In view of remarks made by the Prosecution counsel, it seems necessary to emphasise that the Prosecutor's obligations under Rule 68 are not dependent on the knowledge of any individual person in the Office of the Prosecutor.  As the Apeals Chamber in the Bagosora case stated, "The Prosecution teams are all representatives in the same Office of the Prosecutor."  

It should also be emphasised that the existence of an -- of an electronic database created by the 
Office of the Prosecutor for storage and retrieval of documents, which allows the Defence to do its own searches for exculpatory material, does not relieve the Prosecution from its positive obligation to disclose all Rule 68 material in the possession of the Prosecution.  

Nonetheless, the Chamber is unable to draw the inferences for which counsel for Nzirorera contended.  There are too many other conclusions that could be drawn from the circumstances on which we relied, and the Chamber finds that the application fails in relation to those statements where no evidence has been adduced to rebut the -- the denials by the Prosecution that any statements had been taken.  It would be meaningless to make an order for disclosure of material which may not exist.  

These include 14 out of 16 witnesses alleged to affect the credibility of Witness Mbonyunkiza; four out of six witnesses relevant to Witness UB; and five out of seven witnesses relevant to Witnesses GFA and GBU.  

For purposes of witness protection, particulars will be provided in the order which will be read in closed session.  

The Chamber considers it necessary to point out that the administration of justice depends on the integrity of the Prosecution to the extent that, if it is subsequently established that the declarations made in this session were inaccurate, the Chamber will revisit the issue to consider whether there has been misconduct on behalf of the Prosecution.  

Secondly, where the Prosecution has the requested information but has determined that Rule 68 is inapplicable, the Prosecution has admitted having possession of material the Defence has categorized as exculpatory but indicated that it had assessed that it was not exculpatory.  Among the material requested are statements from a German priest at Saint André, a survivor at Saint André, and the statement of Joseph Munyaneza, which have been shown to probably contradict the impending testimony of Witness UB.  These documents bear a Prosecution K-number, and their content has been adequately described.  

Having considered the descriptions provided by the Defence, the Chamber finds that a prima facie case of the exculpatory nature has been shown and orders their disclosure.  

Also among the materials requested, the Prosecution has admitted to having statements for two of the seven witnesses listed by Nzirorera as allegedly contradicting the impending testimony of Witness UB.  The Defence provided no specific information as to the probable exculpatory material in the statement and, as so, no order can be made for disclosure.  

The Prosecution denied that the credibility of Witness AWB could be impeached by a document showing that he was not one of the persons assigned to the roadblock he claims to have supervised and by statements of other witnesses at the same roadblock who never saw Ngirumpatse, contrary to what Witness AWB has claimed.  

There is evidence that the document has been already disclosed and is in the exhibit bundle.  No order is required.  
(Pages 1 to 6 by Ann Burum)



1530H 
MR. PRESIDENT: (Continuing)
The Chamber finds that the statements of the persons at the alleged roadblocks, whose statements refer to the same time window as Witness AWB's intending testimony, may affect the credibility of the witness and should be disclosed.  

The Prosecution conceded possession of statements from two persons concerning the potential testimony of Witness GFA and GBU, but denied that the information in those statements falls within the ambit of Rule 68, despite indicating that the statement of the first person had been previously disclosable under Rule 66 because he used to be on the Prosecution's witness list.  The Prosecution persisted in refusing to disclose.  The Defence had no information about the probable content of the other statement, and were unable to refute the Prosecution's assessment that there was nothing of an exculpatory nature in that material.  

The Chamber orders the disclosure of the statement of the first person on the list, but rules that the Accused has not crossed the threshold of a prima facie showing of a probable exculpatory content in the statement of the second person, and makes no order for the disclosure pursuant to Rule 68.  

Finally, the Prosecution also claimed possession of statements of three individuals which are alleged to contradict the testimony of Witness Mbonyunkiza.  For one of these individuals, the Chamber has already decided the statement -- the status of his statement in the decision on Rule 66(C) material delivered on 15 February 2006, another individual the Prosecution claimed that the statement did not constitute exculpatory material.  The Defence provided no information as to the probable exculpatory material in the statement, and so no order can be made for disclosure.  

Finally, the Chamber notes that the Prosecution undertook to disclose the unredacted witness statement of the third individual who is a protected witness.  

Now, thirdly, the way the Prosecution has disclosed the requested material: The Prosecution admitted in open court to finding the statement of the Catholic priest which could affect the credibility of Witness UB, and has disclosed it to the Defence, who already had the requested information.  The Prosecution also indicated that it found the three requested statements regarding Witness ALG's alleged involvement in an attack at the CELA institute and killings at the St. Paul pastoral centre, and the Prosecution undertook to disclose them as well.  

As a result of the Prosecution's denial in open court and at the consequent direction of the Chamber, the Defence for Nzirorera provided the Prosecution K-numbers of the statements which he alleges affect the credibility of Witness HH.  In response to this additional filing, the Prosecution admitted possession and agreed to disclose the requested material, while claiming that the information contained in those statements should already have been known to the Defence through other disclosures.  

In its filing after the hearing, the Prosecution admitted possession of, and offered to disclose, eight statements from six out of fifteen witnesses listed by Nzirorera in relation to the material which could affect the credibility of Omar Serushago.  The Prosecution asserts that all the information resulting from finding these statements is already known to the Defence through Mr. Serushago's own testimony in many cases, which goes beyond his indictment and plea agreement with the Office of the Prosecutor.  

Disposition:  As a result of the information provided, the Chamber finds that the Prosecution failed to comply with its obligation pursuant to Rule 68 of the rules.  

The Chamber now determines whether the Accused suffered any prejudice, and if so, which remedy will be the most appropriate.  The Chamber is mindful of the imperative of ensuring that the Defence has adequate time and facilities to prepare its case.  In this case, the indictment against the Accused was confirmed on 22nd August 1998.  They made the initial appearance on 7th April 1999, and their trial originally commenced on 27th November 2003.  This is a hearing de novo which commenced on 19th September 2005.  Consequently, the Defence has had substantial disclosures relating to all of the witnesses scheduled for this trial session.  The Defence already had knowledge, or was even in possession of much of the material which the Prosecutor ought to have disclosed, and that circumstance diminishes or removes the prejudice to the presentation of their case.  

The Defence contends that the lateness of this disclosure makes it unfair to proceed with the trial.  The Chamber is, however, satisfied that the material which they have demanded and is now being disclosed, albeit in breach of the Prosecutor's obligations, will not hamper the effective cross-examination of these witnesses or the management of the Defence case.  In the event future problems arise, the Chamber will make any necessary orders on a case-by-case basis.  

The Chamber does not consider that the interests of justice require any postponement of the proceedings, and in particular, the Chamber is satisfied that the testimony of UB can commence forthwith.  

The Chamber is very concerned about some of the explanations given by counsel for the Prosecution in open court.  Difficulties faced by the Prosecution in searching the database or other deficiencies in research are not satisfactory explanations.  The Chamber strongly recommends that the Prosecution improve its management of disclosure in its case.  Lack of diligence or other default may require the Chamber to consider whether this is conduct which willingly interferes with the administration of justice, obstructs the proceedings or is otherwise contrary to the interests of justice.  

The Chamber would like to add that it expects the parties to cooperate on such disclosure issues for the remainder of this trial, as Rule 68 is a continual obligation, and that it should not have to intervene unless a true issue of law arises.  

Now, thirdly, translation issues:  Now, finally, to support its motion for a stay of proceedings, the Defence for Nzirorera claims that some documents disclosed to the Defence concerning Witness HH, UB and ALG are only available either in Kinyarwanda or in French.  In particular, the Defence contends that it cannot cross-examine Witness UB if not provided with the translation of the Rwandan judgement of the witness recently disclosed to the Defence.  Relying on the Karera case, the Defence requests the postponement of Witness UB's testimony.  The Prosecution submits that some missing translations are not a ground for declaring the trial unfair.  

According to Article 20 of the Statute of the Tribunal, Rule 3 of the Rules, and established jurisprudence, the Accused is entitled to be provided with the indictment, the supporting material, and all evidentiary material which will be used in the adjudicative process, in a language he understands.  For all of the documents, unless it is deemed to contravene the interests of a fair trial, it has been held sufficient for the Defence teams to be bilingual, to be able to communicate those issues to the Accused, and to facilitate an efficient trial.  

In the instant case, the Accused speaks and understands Kinyarwanda and French.  The Accused, therefore, has a full knowledge of the content of the documents.  Further, the Defence team is bilingual.  The Chamber has no doubt that the Defence team can work with its resources and will be duly able to deal with the documents, even if not yet available in English.  

In addition, different practical steps were adopted by the Chamber to provide the translation of the documents requested as soon as possible, particularly the translation of the relevant portions of Witness UB's Rwandan judgement, as determined in an agreement between the parties, was provided orally before today's hearing.  

The Chamber is, therefore, of the view that a stay of proceedings is not warranted.  In addition, there is no reason at this stage to postpone the testimony of Witness UB.  The witness can start his direct and cross-examinations.  

This was the situation in Karera, where the Chamber did not postpone the proceedings, as Nzirorera asserts, but simply allowed the witness to be recalled for further examination, if required, by virtue of new information of an exculpatory nature from the Rwandan judgement.  

Now, the order disposing of this -- well, I suppose I can read the first part of the order in open chambers -- in open session.  

Now, for those reasons, the Chamber denies the Defence motion for a stay of proceedings, and consequently denies Ngirumpatse's request for provisional release.  

The orders regarding disclosure will be read shortly, in closed session.  But before going to closed session, we have to address another application for a stay of proceedings filed by Nzirorera after an inadvertent disclosure by the registrar.  

The final issue that the Chamber must decide at this time is the other outstanding motion by Nzirorera filed on 30th January 2006, which was precipitated by the disclosure of a document filed ex parte to the Prosecution.  Here, Nzirorera requests a stay of proceedings until the circumstances of this serious violation of trust is disclosed and remedied.  

After this motion was filed, the Chamber made an order, requesting the registrar for a submission to explain the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.  The registrar made his submission on 6th February 2005, wherein he explained to the Chamber the human error that was involved when the document was filed in the TRIM database.  The registrar made further representations about how he plans to avoid these problems in the future.  

Nzirorera responded to the registrar's submission on 8th February 2006 and acknowledged the error as inadvertent and made suggestions to the Chamber to remedy the situation by ordering the Prosecution to destroy and delete any copies it might have of the ex parte annex and ordering the Prosecution to refrain from communication with Defence witness NZ, or his legal representative, without first making a request to counsel for Nzirorera, who will then undertake to facilitate the interview, if agreed to, by NZ and/or his legal representative.  

The Prosecution has no objection, in principle, to destroying the documents containing the confidential information, but claims that, in the first instance, the document should not have been filed ex parte and therefore shouldn't be disclosed to the Prosecution.  Further, it strongly objects to the second proposal made by Nzirorera restricting any contact with the witness.  

As a result of the registry's submission, the Chamber finds that the matter concerning the inadvertent disclosure of the confidential annex is now resolved.  

The Chamber will deal with the ex parte nature of the confidential annex and the remedies sought by the Defence when it decides the merits of the Defence motion regarding Defence Witness NZ1.  The Chamber is of the view that, in the meantime, the Prosecution should delete any electronic copy and destroy any paper copies of the document and refrain from contacting Witness NZ1 or his legal representative.  

For these reasons, the Chamber denies Nzirorera's motion for a stay of proceedings, grants the Defence request that the ex parte annex be destroyed and deleted from any Prosecution file, and orders the Prosecution to refrain from contacting Witness DNZ1, or his legal representative, until the Chamber has decided the merits of the motion.  

Mr. Prosecution, Witness UB available?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, he is, Your Honour, he's here in the waiting room. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We are considering whether to read the confidential part of our order now.  What is holding us up is that there are people in the public gallery, and we're not sure if we should inconvenience them by making them leave immediately, or whether we could hear the testimony, and just before the adjournment at 5:30, we could then go into closed session and deal with it at that stage.  Would there be any objection to that?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, that would be fine.  However, I have a number of oral motions that are consequent from your decision that I would like to make before the witness comes in.  It's going to take some time.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I also mention as a matter of, I hope, good administrative practice, I would welcome 10 minutes with the witness before he gives his testimony, and I have been aware that my learned friend Mr. Robinson was going to be inviting certain legal arguments, and I thought I would get the 10 minutes anyway.  And I'm a little uneasy if Your Honours are thinking that the witness is about to walk into court.  I need just a few minutes with him, arising out of events yesterday.  I should say, I've seen him already, but I need to talk further with him for 10 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what are the nature of these motions?  Could you just identify what are the questions being asked?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Yes, Mr. President.  The first is a request for a deadline for the disclosure that's been ordered in the motion and the decision that you've just read. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I hope you're not trying to waste our time.  I told you that those disclosure issues will be dealt with in closed session.  There's a deadline in that; that's part of our order. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  That makes it easy, then.  Thank you.  

The second is a motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 46(A).  

The third is a motion to acquire certification by the Prosecution of compliance with Rule 68.  

The fourth is a motion for inspection of statements pursuant to Rule 66(B) that the Trial Chamber has declined to order disclosure of.  

The fifth is a motion that the Prosecutor deposit, in camera, the statements which the Court has declined disclosure for the purposes of appeal.  

The sixth is a motion for certification to appeal the denial of the motion for a stay of proceedings and a consequent motion to stay that -- your decision until the resolution of the appeal.  

The seventh is a motion for certification to appeal your decision on the motions for orders for production of documents by the government of Rwanda and for consequential orders on the 13th of February.  

The eight is a request for certification to appeal your decision on the Defence motion to report the government of a certain state to the United Nations Security Council and Prosecution motion under 66(C) dated 15th February 2006.  

The ninth is a motion to exclude testimony of Witness UB for violations of Rule 68, 66(A)(ii) and 98, and pursuant to Rules 89(C) and 95.  

And the tenth is a motion to postpone the testimony of Witness UB concerning matters which were disclosed when the judgement was translated yesterday.  

That's my list.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what I feel is that you should reduce your applications to writing, except those which relate to the testimony of Witness UB.  Can you re-state your list in that direction?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just one moment, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may make a comment that may help the Trial Chamber with its decision.  I understand that the first set of questions that will be directed to Witness UB will be closed session questions, so maybe it will be more convenient for all concerned to just deal with all of these issues now, including the order, since we'll be in closed session for the initial stages of UB's testimony as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I would just like to identify the issues which have to be put in writing, as opposed to those which we will hear orally, and so I'll ask Mr. Robinson to specify the applications which are related to the testimony of Witness UB. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  The first would be a motion for inspection of statements pursuant to Rule 66(B), and there are three particular statements of witnesses that deal with Witness UB that are listed in my motion, and you've dealt with them in the decision.  And, also, my motion for the deposit of those statements, in camera, if they're not -- if we're not allowed inspection.  I believe that the motion for certification to appeal the denial of your motion for stay of proceedings needs to be heard before the witness's testimony because it also requests a stay, pending appeal.  

Also, I believe that the motion to exclude the testimony of Witness UB has to be made orally, as well as the motion to postpone the testimony of Witness UB.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think that we have just adjudicated on the issue of excluding Witness UB's testimony and his postponement.  Why do you think that should be re-argued at this time, when we have just considered it and ruled on it?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, with respect to the postponing of Witness UB, I have some additional arguments that you haven't considered, arising from the translation of the Kinyarwanda judgement which occurred yesterday.  

With respect to the motion to exclude testimony of Witness UB, I have, first of all, some documents I wish to tender as exhibits to that motion so that they're on file for purposes of appellate review, and secondly, I have additional grounds that are not related -- that are related to Rule 89 and Rule 95. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but why didn't you raise these when -- we have just considered this motion, and I don't see any reason why we should reopen the hearing of these issues to allow you to argue matters which you could have argued at the time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I'm not re-arguing matters. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you are.  You are saying that you want to use additional arguments, present documents.  I mean, I don't think that's acceptable at all.  If you want to make an application for review, that's a separate matter, but you can't -- I mean, I think it's very offensive to a court, for us to make a ruling on a particular question and you stand up immediately after we have ruled and ask the same question again.  
MR. ROBINSON:
My motion was for a stay of proceedings, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that is exactly what we have ruled on. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Exactly.  Now I wish to make a motion to exclude the testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We've already ruled on that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
You've ruled on it in the context of a motion to stay the proceedings.  I haven't made the motion to exclude the testimony -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have ruled on that exact question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That may be, but I think I have the right to make -- at least make a filing of documents in support of a motion to exclude.  You may have gone ahead and considered that as a possible remedy. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that was what you dealt with in your motion. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I asked you to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can't just ask questions cumulatively.  There's no court in the world that will allow litigation to dribble on indefinitely by having you ask one question after another on the same subject matter.  You have an obligation to deal with all matters that you can in the same area at the same time. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I don't make a motion to exclude testimony, the record on appeal will show that I've never asked for that remedy. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, then that's your problem.  We have just adjudicated on the issue.  If you wish to appeal, then you appeal.  But you can't tell us that we must hear a hearing again, to give you an opportunity to put matters on record which you didn't argue for the purpose of an appeal.  That's quite ridiculous.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I'm prepared to provide arguments on those things that were not covered by your decision and to make arguments in relation to certification to appeal your decision.  So I'm ready to proceed, if you're willing to hear me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the best thing to do for these matters is to put those applications in writing, so I think it's better for me not to hear you orally on these matters, but to require that you make all of your motions in writing.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm happy to do that, Mr. President.  I just don't wish the witness to be called until those matters have been submitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have already made an order that the witness's testimony should start forthwith. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand that, Mr. President.  But regardless, if I am to make a motion to postpone the witness's testimony in writing, I don't see how you can adjudicate that motion, given the fact that I cannot submit that in writing in the next two seconds before the witness walks in the door. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, there's no pending motions before us affecting the matter, and we have just made a judicial ruling that the witness's testimony should commence and we will enforce our order. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'd like then to make an oral motion to postpone the testimony of Witness UB, so a motion is pending.  I'd like to be heard on that motion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have already made a scheduling order that that must be done in writing. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So, let's not hear the testimony that I'm asking to postpone until I've had an opportunity to make that in writing.  You can't make an order that something has to be in writing and then go ahead and vitiate the motion itself by hearing the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, why not?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Because you don't give me an adequate opportunity to be heard. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have had an opportunity to be heard on this matter.  You have had an opportunity to be heard.  You filed a motion asking for that exact relief, and we have just ruled on it.  It's very offensive to the Court that when we have given a considered decision on a matter, that you stand up and ask the same question again.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I don't think you understand the grounds for my motion.  I've told you that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the grounds are not the same thing as a question.  You've asked the same question again.  You could have complete -- you've asked the same question again.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, a Rwanda judgement was made available to us for the first time yesterday in the English language.  As a result of that judgement, I have a motion to postpone the testimony of Witness UB.  I didn't have that judgement before.  It's not part of my motion to stay the proceedings because I didn't know the contents of that.  It was only disclosed to us by the Prosecution on Monday.  So how do you expect me to make a motion that -- based on information I don't have?  It's not covered by your rules. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is covered by a rule specifically.  You stood up at the bar -- at the dock and suggested in a very rude manner that we should follow the decision in the Karera case, where the proceedings were stayed because of that same judgement.  Now, you did not cite that case accurately, because that is not what happened in the Karera case.  The testimony of the witness was not stayed.  The testimony was heard, his cross-examination was taken, and the Court ruled that he could be recalled, if necessary.  We addressed that very issue in this judgement, and used almost identical language. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, first of all, I beg to differ.  You are completely wrong about that, and I ask you -- I beg you to read the transcript of the Karera case.  You are absolutely wrong.  

The Karera cross-examination that took place was about 10 questions, only about the existence of this judgement:  Does the witness have it in his possession?  Does he have it at home?  There was no substantive cross-examination.  In your decision you have absolutely mischaracterised the ruling of Karera, but besides that -- okay, that's -- and I urge you to read that transcript.  It's only about five pages.  You can read the cross-examination, and you'll see I'm exactly right on that.  But the point is, now that we have the judgement, I have a right to make a motion to postpone testimony based on the con -- on what we've learned subsequent to receiving that judgement.  

It's not our fault we didn't have the judgement until we come to court to hear the witness.  That's the Prosecution's obligation.  You are continually putting the burden on us to bear the burden of the Prosecution's problems.  Now, on behalf of my client, I have a right to be heard on the issues that are not raised that are new.  This is a new issue, and I ask to be heard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Sorry, Mr. Prosecutor, do you have anything to say?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, yes, Your Honour, but maybe I should submit it in writing as well.  I thank the Court for its decision.  It's obvious that the Court took the issue very seriously and weighed the issues and looked very carefully through the witness statements, so I thank the Court for its attention to this matter, but there are some things I'd like to place on the record.  It concerns our EDS system.  I can put them in writing, if the Court prefers, but I wanted to have the record reflect in the same location as the Court's decision that, with the exception of two statements of the 14 or 15 that the Court has requested be disclosed, that these are all available in the EDS, and I can detail that in a separate writing and I will file it with the Chamber when we make our disclosure.  By the way, all of the disclosures have been prepared.  We've simply been awaiting the Court's decision before we serve them.  And also to note that everything the Court ordered us to disclose, we had agreed to disclose in our responsive filing to Mr. Robinson's supplemental filing.  But I did want to make the point, and I will do it in writing, that everything, with the exception of two statements, was available to the Defence in the EDS.  

This brings us to a question of policy in the OTP.  Because if the EDS is not going to assist us in moving the trial along, I wonder if it's useful to set it up in the first place.  So I will address that with the Prosecutor himself, if the EDS is not going to be helpful, it certainly shouldn't slow the proceedings down.  Because it's apparent to me that the information that Mr. Robinson relies on to make his motion was coming from the EDS in the first place.  

But, once again, I thank of the Court for its decision, and I will put this in writing and file it with the Trial Chamber.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, I would like to urge you to show some respect for the decision of the Chamber.  The Chamber has given its ruling and has indicated that if you have any other issues you have to raise, you can file written motions, and the Chamber has indicated that it wants to go ahead with the testimony of the witness.  Even if you want to postpone the testimony of this witness, you can file that in a written motion.  

As regards doing it orally, the Chamber has declared that it cannot take this oral motion presently.  If it accepts this motion then, theoretically, every time the Chamber gives a decision, you can frustrate that decision by getting up and make an application orally for the same relief by introducing new grounds, and that's not permissible.  So I would urge you to accept the decision of the Court.  And if there are any other issues you want to raise, you can raise them by filing a motion in writing.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I appreciate that very much, Judge Short, and I completely agree with that.  My only problem is, when I'm being asked to raise issues that are too late because -- simply because you don't want to hear -- and it's a new issue, it seems foolish to make a motion to postpone the testimony after the testimony has already commenced.  You've already denied my motion, without even hearing the merits of it.  And I've told you it's based on new information, not based on things that were presented in the motion.  

So I understand -- obviously, I'm going to comply with your direction, but sitting here with my client and trying to understand how his fair trial rights can be respected, when his lawyer is not even allowed to make a motion to postpone testimony until after the testimony has commenced, I find it hard to justify that to my client, and it seems to me an unfair procedure.  

I'm here to be heard in a timely manner.  I'm not trying to waste your time, but, on the other hand, if I can't be heard in a timely manner, I think that it -- it seems to be an unfortunate -- unfortunate for my client.  But I appreciate your words, and I'll act accordingly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have decided to proceed.  For the benefit of the waiting public, many of the witnesses in this trial are the beneficiary of protective orders and the -- to a large extent, these orders are aimed at protecting their identity from being revealed to the public.  We address that issue by hearing certain sections of testimony and certain sections of orders are heard in closed session at which the public are excluded.  So we're going to have to ask you to move, as we move into a closed session at this time.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 19 to 34] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.  Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness UB, from what year did you become active in the MRND? 
A.	I became a member of the MRND from its very inception, that is, when multipartyism came in, in 1991, that was. 
Q.	As a member from around 1991, were you an active member or a passive member? 
A.	At the beginning I was just an ordinary member.  I was one of the signatories to the documents setting up the MRND.  Subsequently I served in positions -- various positions in the various organs of the party, at elections organised by the party at various levels. 
Q.	As a member of the MRND, did you ever meet Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, I met Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He was an MRND party member in Kigali-ville, and I was also a member of the MRND, Kigali city.  It was within that framework that I met him. 
Q.	As a member of the MRND, have you ever met with Édouard Karemera? 
A.	I did not meet Édouard Karemera in Kigali city within the framework of the MRND, but I used to see him at other levels in other organs of the MRND party. 
Q.	As a member of the MRND, did you have any occasion to meet Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Well, I knew Nzirorera.  He was an MRND party member.  After a time he became secretary-general of our party.  I believe there was an occasion at which he convened a meeting with us in Kigali-ville. 
Q.	Are you familiar with the power structure within the MRND party? 
A.	Yes, sir.  I know of the organisational chart of the party.  I knew how the party functioned. 
Q.	What is the most powerful office within the party, please? 
A.	Well, the MRND had a national structure and it went all the way down to the level of the cellule.  The chairman of the party and the president of the party was the leader of the party, and he had two vice chairmen, a vice president, and a national secretary-general.  Regarding the various organs of the party, you had firstly (microphone not activated). 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you will just give us five minutes.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't hear.  Is Your Honour going to rise, yes?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, just for a few minutes. 
MR. MORLEY:
All right.
(Court recessed from 1515H to 1522H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
For your information, Mr. Morley, we intend to take the adjournment at a quarter to six today. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  Very well.  With Your Honour's leave, turning to the witness. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we will talk about other officers and the structure of the MRND a little later.  But, for the moment, you have told us that there was a chairman or president and he was assisted by two vice presidents and a national general secretary.  That collection of four people, what was the title of that collection of four people within the MRND? 
A.	These four people were responsible for running the party and implementing decisions taken by the party.  In other words, they were responsible for managing the party's activities at national level. 
Q.	Collectively, as four people, what was the title of their bureau? 
A.	It was called the MRND national bureau, which was, therefore, a bureau at national level. 
Q.	In 1994, during the genocide, who was the president within that bureau of the MRND? 
A.	The president of that bureau was Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Within that bureau, can you name the vice presidents in 1994 during the genocide? 
A.	There were two vice presidents, that is, Ferdinand Kabagema and Édouard Karemera. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you spell Ferdinand Kabagema, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Kabagema is spelt K-A-B-A-G-E-M-A.  Kabagema. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
I don't imagine -- 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. MORLEY:
I don't imagine Mr. Robinson will argue, it's a matter of public knowledge that Mr. Kabagema is deceased. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Turning to the secretary-general within that bureau, who was that during the genocide of 1994? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I want to object to Mr. Morley's questions in which he asks who was the president during the genocide and who was the secretary-general during the genocide.  The issue of whether there was a genocide is something you have already declined to take judicial notice of, and it is assuming conclusions that are not in evidence. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very helpful, thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What sort of influence over the MRND party did that bureau of four people exercise?  Can you describe it, please? 
A.	Regarding the power that they had in the party, I would say that there were senior officials who took the decisions for the party.  They also had to have the decisions they had taken implemented.  So, in short, they were responsible for the party's relations with other parties, they were responsible for planning and scheduling party rallies, and they represented -- they were the legal representatives of the MRND, in court or before any other institutions.  There was nothing that could be done inside the party without their support or their agreement, because they were responsible for implementing any decisions that were taken within the party. 
Q.	Having described the national bureau, what's the next level down within the MRND organisation structure, please? 
A.	After the national bureau, there were préfectural bureaus.  These were MRND committees at the level of the préfecture.  There was a party chairman for each préfecture, and this party chairman was the one responsible for managing the préfecture bureau. 
Q.	So, we go executive bureau to préfecture bureau.  What's the next level down from préfecture bureau, please? 
A.	As I said before, there were party organs that started at national level and went down to the cellule level.  At the commune, there was the commune chairman; there was also a chairman at the secteur level, and he, too, had a bureau. 
Q.	So, we go national bureau, préfecture bureau, commune bureau, secteur bureau.  Anything below that? 
A.	There was a cellule as well, and there were (sic) party had an organ there at that level as well.  There was a president or a chairman, and his assistant for the cellule. 
Q.	Did you ever sit on any meetings at either cellule level, secteur level, commune level, préfectural level, or even national level?  Can you help us, please? 
A.	I told you that I had a position of authority at the préfecture.  There were 20 of us.  In my capacity as a figure of authority, I could attend meetings at national level.  I was also a member of the bureau for the commune.  This bureau was made up of 10 people, that is, the commune bureau. 
Q.	In your position as an active member of the MRND sitting at préfectural level, can you give us some idea as to how often there would be préfectural level MRND meetings? 
A.	After the setting up of the préfectural committee, we met at least once a week.  This was the case for the commune as well.  So, for the préfecture, we would meet at least once a week, and any other time if the chairman called a meeting of the members of the bureau. 
Q.	How many members of the préfectural committee would there be, approximately, please? 
A.	The préfectural committee was made up of 20 persons.  In each préfecture there were 20 members of the committee -- of the préfectural committee of the party. 
Q.	And at commune level, meeting once a week, how many members of that committee would there be, please? 
A.	The commune committee was made up of 10 people who elected a bureau -- a communal bureau, that is. 
Q.	And can you help us with, at secteur level, how many people would be members of that committee? 
A.	There was a secteur committee made up of five people:  the chairman, his vice chairman, and the secretary, including a treasurer, and they were in the bureau at the secteur level. 
Q.	And at cellule level, have you any -- can you help us with how many people would form a meeting committee at cellule level? 
A.	Members of the party elected a committee made up of a chairman and a secretary, but the committee was made up of five people, which included the chairman and the secretary. 
Q.	So, how many people would be returned from a cellule committee to sit on the secteur committee, please? 
A.	It was these five people who were elected at the cellule.  They would meet with the other elected members from other cellules, and thus form the secteur committee. 
Q.	And how, from the secteur level, would people be returned to the commune level, please? 
A.	The members of the various secteur committees would choose 10 people, who would then become members of the commune committee. 
Q.	And how would members of the commune committees select those who would sit at the préfectural committee, please? 
A.	The members at commune and secteur level would meet and elect a committee of 20 members, which was the préfectural committee. 
Q.	Now, how would people at préfectural committee level communicate with the national bureau; was there another level of meeting, or was there some other mechanism of communication? 
A.	The préfectural committee, which was made up of 20 members, would then vote a bureau made up of a chairman, a vice chairman, and a secretary.  The chairman of the préfectural bureau took part in meetings of the political bureau, which was made up of representatives of the various préfectures.  So, at that level, he could meet members of the national bureau of the MRND party. 
Q.	All right.  Well, if we pause there, then, is the structure of the party -- please correct me if I am wrong; I am relying on what you've said -- national bureau, four members; political bureau, representatives from the préfectural committee; préfectural committee, which consists of representatives from the various communes; commune committee, consisting of representatives from the various secteurs; secteur committees, consisting of representatives from the various cellules.  Is that the basic organisational structure, please? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I first wish to explain with reference to the party organs, but the way you've put it is correct. 
Q.	Would it be fair or unfair, right or wrong, to characterise the structure of the MRND throughout the country as being a pyramid? 
A.	According to organisational chart of the MRND, all representatives were elected by their peers.  It means representatives in the préfecture, of which there were 11, would come together and elect a bureau.  So, the national committee, that is the national committee that was referred to.  So, that is how people could become members of the various party organs.  It is thanks to this procedure that the highest party bodies had very few members, who would then disseminate all decisions taken towards the grassroots. 
Q.	Thank you.  That's helpful.  But I want to see whether the word fits.  It may not.  It is a matter for you.  From the grassroots level to the very top of the power structure, as an organisational chart, would you agree or disagree, would you say it was right or wrong, that the structure is one of a pyramid? 
A.	Yes, that's how it was.  Grassroots organs had less power than the higher echelons.  
MR. MORLEY:
And last two questions before I see the time, Your Honour; I may be stating the obvious.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	During the unhappy events -- I hope that pleases Mr. Robinson -- in 1994, who was right at the top of the pyramid, please? 
A.	It was the party chairman and his vice president, that is, the bureau.  If I refer to the vice president, I also include the national secretary-general.  So it is these people who were the highest echelons of the party, and it is they who could take decisions that could be implemented at national level. 
Q.	Don't be shy of naming them.  It's the last question of the day.  Who were the most important people in the MRND at the top of that pyramid structure during the events of 1994?  Names, please.  
A.	The chairman of the party was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  In a way, he was the spokesperson for the party at national level.  He was followed by Édouard Karemera, who was the vice chairman.  He became minister of the interior after that.  The secretary-general was Joseph Nzirorera.  He was responsible for implementing all party decisions and organising its activities.  He was subsequently appointed president of the national assembly.  I did not mention the name of the other vice president because he is -- because he is deceased.  It is common knowledge that he is no longer with us, so I only mentioned the other three people who were the bosses of the party at national level. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Is that a convenient moment, Your Honour?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  Thank you very much.  We will take the adjournment now. 

Mr. Witness, I need to inform you that during this or any adjournment, while you are a witness in this case, you remain a witness, even when you are not in the Court.  And this means that you are not to speak to anybody about the case or about your testimony.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I understand, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
None of the legal representatives or the investigators should be speaking with you about the case or your testimony.  We will resume tomorrow morning, where your testimony may continue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  We have had this discussion before.  We ask that the order -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I have understood everything, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, we ask that the order of non-contact be that there be no contact whatsoever between representatives, not about the -- limited to about the case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I thought we already had undertaken from counsel that that was the position, but I don't know if you need to specify it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I thought that that was the case as well.  It's clear, that was the usual practice from our office and we gave that assurance with the first witness that was sworn. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe (unintelligible) specify the case or testimony.  
But do you understand, Mr. Witness, that you are not to have any contact with the representatives of the parties in this case, either for the Prosecution or the Defence?  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will take the adjournment now.
