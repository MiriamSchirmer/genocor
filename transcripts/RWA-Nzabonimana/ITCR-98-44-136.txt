MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, 
the 30th of June 2005, for continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, 
Case Number ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Fry.

The appearances are the same.  

Madam Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
President's microphone please, is not turned on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your evidence will continue this morning.  You are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you commenced your evidence yesterday.  Your examination by Mr. Hooper will continue this morning.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I have understood.  

MS. FALL:
Mr. President, before proceeding with our cross-examination, I would like to provide some information.  In reading the transcript of yesterday, I realised that there was a mistake, probably from translation and -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I am sorry, Mr. President, to interrupt.  My friend already raised this with me.  I believe it would be a matter that would be best done appropriately in the absence of the witness because it relates to a detail of evidence that I would rather she didn't hear the discussion about it, if that's possible.  Perhaps we could defer that to a later moment.  It is not -- well, it is not a compellingly significant matter at the moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it controversial?
MR. HOOPER:
Not necessarily.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So both of you have an agreed position on it?  
MR. HOOPER:
No, we don't, because I don't know quite well what the position is or what the interpretation issue is, in specifics.  But if the witness were to remove her earphones, that might be quite sufficient.
MS. FALL:
That was going to be my proposal, Mr. President, that the witness be asked to take off her headset so that we discuss this issue which might, indeed, be controversial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It might be controversial.  Is it an administrative matter or decision?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, it is a mistake that figures in the transcript and which might have a bearing on the witness's credibility, because when Counsel Hooper did ask the question, she confirmed.  
MR. HOOPER:
The witness is present and has her earphones on, I would much prefer she left, actually, if we are going to discuss it now.  I am not entirely convinced she doesn't understand English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness, I am going to ask you to leave the courtroom.  

Ms. Fall, can you explain the details; is it an issue of translation?  Why is that a matter -- isn't there an administrative process for addressing it?  If the problem is just one of translation, there are audio recordings of the proceedings, and the method of resolving a translation mistake is organisational.  

MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, but when I read the transcript of yesterday evening, I believe that a problem might arise as to the credibility of the witness, because when the question was put to the witness for the first time, it was as follows:  "Could you describe the vehicle?"  And she said, "It was a white Berline," in French, Berline which was translated as a station wagon.  And then, subsequently, when Counsel Hooper revisited the question, he said:  "Isn't it true that you have never said or provided such a detail as to a vehicle belonging to the state being white, a white vehicle belonging to the state, and this is your first time of mentioning it is only today, isn't it?"  And if we were to compare, then we would realise that there was contradiction with what was said before; namely, that there was a white vehicle involved, and that is why I said that the issue arises with Mr. Hooper having never mentioned that it was a vehicle belonging to the state.  And in the English version, this is what we have.  "Later -- is a white state car.  That should be "a state car" and not "a staff."  Estate translated as station wagon or estate car.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I think hearing my friend describe the translation difficulties, I think for my part -- I can understand the history which involves just an element of misunderstanding and then mistranslation.  The witness referred in French to a Berline, which Mr. O'Shea drew my attention to the proceedings yesterday.  A Berline, I understand, I don't know, but a Berline I understand in French is a saloon car, simply a saloon car.  It was translated as an estate wagon and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Station wagon.  
MR. HOOPER:
I am sorry, a station wagon which then transmutes in English, into an estate car, which is a car which you can drive around your estate on -- in, if you are lucky enough to have one, that is an estate, and it is a different kind of vehicle.  It is a longer more utilitarian vehicles as we know.  And I think it is the use of my use of the word "estate" that may have got translated into estate which well, would be, of course, consistent with the kind of car that we heard a previous witness talking about, perhaps which was a government vehicle, or the fact that the government vehicles were marked with something.  

So I think it is being the use of the words between languages -- inappropriate use of words between languages, which I am perhaps at fault here, that has led to a chain of translation which has led to a position that Ms. Fall, who doesn't agree with what I am saying -- I can see by the shake of her head, but I think that's the history of it.  I, for my part, never suggested it was a vehicle belonging to the state.  In English, I probably used the word an estate car, it might be, Mr. President, your original suggestion that we go to -- we don't have the draft transcripts at the moment and the question I have asked in English is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I haven't -- I can confirm that what you said is what happened in the English version.  What Ms. Fall is saying is that in the French version, it was translated as a car belonging to the state, which is a simple mistake.  I heard Mr. Hooper speak of the English and that is not what he said.  So if that is an issue of a translation issue, I am advised by the registrar that the method of solving translation issues of that nature, is to consult the audio transcripts of the proceedings, administrative, organisationally and have the correction effected.  So it would seem to me that I just need to direct registrar to revisit that issue and take the necessary steps to have the translation corrected.  I am advised that's a procedure to deal with matters of that nature.  

Is it that right, Mr. Fry?  
MR. FRY: 
Yes, Your Honour, it's so noted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, I will give you the direction now.
MS. FALL:
Obliged, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Madam Witness, in order to satisfy your curiosity, and I can tell you, that the matter was a very minor issue of a mistranslation between the English and the French languages and it has been suitable corrected.  So everything is back to normal now, do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you as well, Mr. President.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I am going to pass a document up to you which has a list of names -- just a moment.  And you will see in front of you a document with a list of names, some nine names in all.  And what I would like you to do, if you have one or if you can be provided with one, a pen or biro, is to put a cross in the columns to the right of the name or anyone who you know or you have heard of.  So the first name there you can see that, we are not going to refer to the name out loud because it is unnecessary.  So the first name is a number one, if you know that person or if you think you know that person, can you put a cross against that name?  Thank you very much.  
A.	I have read through, Counsel.  
Q.	Have you put any ticks there or recognised any names at all?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  If you have finished putting ticks of people you know, then if the document can come back to me, I can locate it and deal with it.  Thank you very much.  And you put --
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, could we also be served a copy of that document or could we have a look at it before he proceeds with his examination?  That has been the usual practice, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And we can see that you have put a cross against number one, a cross against number 7, and a question mark in the box next to number 8. 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, Counsel, is this the document with the name and then GIN at the top or is it another one, just so that we are speaking of the same sheet, excuse me.  
MR. HOOPER:
No, this is a document which has become known as a tick list, which I think all you gentlemen, or ladies if there are any this morning, will have from last week.  It is a list of names and the first name at the top starts with the K, and there is a list of ten names in boxes.  I hope that the interpreters are familiar now with the document.  Thank you very much.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, sir.  
MR. HOOPER:
And so, just for Mr. Frank, number 1 and number 7 have been ticked, and number 8 had a question mark set against it.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, by a question mark, am I to take it you are not sure whether you know that person or not?  Would that be correct?  
A.	I did put a question mark because -- against that name, rather, because it is possible for people to have the same first name while living in the same area.  So, as far as I am concerned, there are two people whom I might know who bear the same first name.  
Q.	Okay.  Can we have this document back so that you have got it in front of you, and I am going to ask you, first of all, about name number 1 that you have ticked, the one at the top.  How do you know that person?  
A.	I know that person because that person was a figure of authority.  
Q.	And in what way?  
A.	******************************.  
Q.	And that was secteur Kayanga, would that be correct?  
A.	Yes, indeed, it was Kayanga secteur.  
Q.	Now, I have noticed that the time after you made your statement you were visited by investigators and lawyers on several occasions.  I will come to those in more detail, but I am looking at a report of an interview of investigators dated the 27th of May 2003, and our page GIN93.  It is not a document, Madam, you have in front of you.  I am not going to provide you with it at the moment, but in it at number 5, and the document is in French and I will translate it loosely or as best, rather, as I can.  "The witness says that the civil defence in her commune was organised by bourgmestre Rutaganire and ***********************************************************," and that is the man you are talking about; is that correct?  
A.	No, that is not correct.  
Q.	The man *********** is not the man that you referred to at number 1?  
A.	I am not familiar with the document you are referring to, Counsel.  
Q.	Please, maybe it's my fault, but please be attentive to the question.  Did the man at number 1 on the list in front of you that you ticked or agreed that you know, ***********************************************, yes or no?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Let me read on from the document -- you don't have in front of you, but I have.  "It was them who were concerned in the formation of young Hutus, the training of young Hutus at ********* in the préfecture of Kibungo."  Was that your understanding about the role of number 1?  
A.	No, I have just told you clearly that I am not familiar with that document, and I am convinced that those were not my statements.  
Q.	Well, you've agreed that ************************************************************.  That's one part of the segment I am reading to you, and that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, he was *************, but you are mixing up issues.  He became ************** after the war, whereas Rutaganire was no longer a bourgmestre.  Rutaganire was a bourgmestre before the war.  So you see, there is no link between what I am saying and what you are saying.  
Q.	Right.  Now, what the document relates you said to the investigator, do you understand?  It is not signed by you, but it's a note that the investigator has made of a conversation that he has had with you, as recently as May of 2003 or as relatively recently as that, and is that you are saying that person trained young Hutus.  I am going to suggest what it indicates is that it was your belief that that person trained Interahamwe; is that correct?  
A.	Counsel, you need to distinguish between training Interahamwe and being **************.  It is said that he trained Interahamwe, but at that time, he was no longer **************.  
Q.	But you don't have to complicate our lives too much, it's a very simple question:  Was it your understanding that that man trained Interahamwe, yes or no?  
A.	I have just said that I found out that *********** purportedly trained Interahamwe. 
Q.	Why can't you just give us straight questions -- straight answers to straight questions?  It would be much easier for all of us, do you understand?  So the answer is yes.  So do you think that then this is something you indeed told the investigator on the 27th of May?  
A.	As you have indicated, this document is not signed and it is necessary for the document to be signed if one were to acknowledge one's authorship of the document.  Now, if it is not signed, it may be a fake document or forgery.  
Q.	Now, we are going to have a very long day here, you understand?  So this is a possible forgery, is it, this document?  
A.	No, I did not say that.  I cannot assert that because I haven't seen the document.  You have the document in your hand, Counsel.  
Q.	All right.  Well, let's press on it and let me just ask you about the next thing it said you said.  It says this, and I will limit it to the name -- to the first name there.  It goes on to say that "She supposed that those two had received orders from superior authorities, notably Kamuhanda and André Rwamakuba."  Now, is that something you said?  
A.	You have just said that those persons received permission or authorisation from Kamuhanda and 
	André Rwamakuba.  Is that what you said, and if that were the case, what authorisation would they have received, authorisation to do what?
Q.	Maybe it is the form of my questions.  You see, what I am putting to you is something that it said you said on the 27th of May.  You were telling the investigator, having named that person, that he trained young Hutus.  You were saying and you supposed that he had received orders from, among other people, Kamuhanda and Rwamakuba in respect of the genocide -- in respect of committing the genocide.  Now, forget the piece of paper now for a moment.  First of all, is that something that you learned or believed that they had received orders or he had received orders from Rwamakuba or Kamuhanda in respect of the genocide -- to commit the genocide or participate in it, simply that, is that something in which you believed?  
A.	First of all, I don't accuse him of genocide, so I can't say that he received instructions or orders to commit genocide.  
Q.	Let me step over and merely ask you this.  Do you remember talking about him to an investigator?  
A.	Are you referring to the man mentioned on the list before me or the two other people you mentioned? 
Q.	I think you can do a lot better than that, Madam Witness.  Let me move on.  
A.	You are not putting the question correctly, Counsel, which is why I cannot answer properly, adequately.  
Q.	Well, I am doing my best, and can I please ask you to do your best.  The next name that you crossed was name number 7.  How do you know that person?  
A.	I know that person as a leader, an authority in my commune where -- in the commune where I resided.  
Q.	Did you ever have any association with the Parti Liberal?  
A.	No, no connection; no relationship.  
Q.	Did you know of any meetings that were held in the commune, political meetings in the year before the genocide? 
A.	At one time I learned that some people had come for a meeting and I heard that sort of thing twice.  
Q.	Did you attend any meetings at all?  
A.	No, none.  
Q.	Did you ever hear vehicles with loud speakers in your area?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Can I come to number 8 against which you have put a question mark.  You are unclear whether you know that person.  Let me just give you some indication that that person lived in Kayanga secteur, at ********* cellule.  Does that help you?  
A.	No, that doesn't help me at all, because I don't know the cellule in that place; I only know this name of the secteur.  
Q.	He was someone who was about 40 at that time in 1994, does that help you?  
A.	Let me tell you what my points of reference are, but it might not show anything as far as whether I know him or not and you will see the difference because I can't see the difference between the two people.  
Q.	So the person that you know of that name and which you say you could obviously be confused with someone with the same name, did they live in that secteur, and were they about that age in 1994, or is it someone that doesn't fit?  
A.	The two people I know do live in the same secteur, but are not immediately neighbours, they were adult men, but I cannot be specific as to their age, and that is the reason why I can't tell the difference between the two -- distinguish between the two.  
Q.	Now before the time of the massacre of the Protestant school, had you heard any firing of guns or shooting before that day?  
A.	No, I did not hear any gunfire.  
Q.	No gunfire at all?  
A.	No, Counsel.  Now these events occurred some time ago, Counsel.  And as I remember, I did not hear any gunfire, but I wish to stress that one cannot remember everything that occurred in view of the length of time passed.  
Q.	So first of all, excepting all difficulties of memory and time, before the date of the Gikomero school killing, you didn't hear any gunshots, rifle shots or machine gunfire before that day?  Yes or no. 
A.	You do persist in asking me to answer yes or no, but you know, on some matters, it is impossible to answer yes or no.  So, please, let me express myself.  
Q.	Well, is it yes or no?  
A.	I have asked you to allow me to answer you according to what I remember.  I didn't hear any gunfire.  Perhaps there was gunfire, but I personally didn't hear it.  
Q.	So the answer to that question is no, isn't it?  This isn't a particularly difficult exercise.  Let me ask you this then, so we are clear.  Did you hear any louder guns, bigger guns before the day of the Protestant school massacre?  And if you think you have answered that question, forgive me; be patient with me, but, again, it could be yes or no.  So which is it, please?  
A.	Please explain to me fully so that I can understand.  Are you speaking of gunfire I would have heard at Gikomero or gunfire from anywhere else?  Please explain to me so that I can answer your question, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, without being facetious, you hear gunfire through your ears, and if your ears and you are in Gikomero, you will hear it there.  And if you had gone somewhere else and you might hear it there.  So what is the answer, wherever you were before the day of the school massacres did you hear gunfire?  
A.	I heard gunfire when I was in Gikomero but, in fact, it was exchange of fire.  We could see flashes and explosions in Kanombe and we could hear the firing -- explosions from there -- in Gikomero, we could hear.
Q.	And was that over many days or not?  
A.	I don't understand, you mean throughout the period that I was there?  
Q.	Did you hear those explosions over several days or just on one day?  What was the position?  
A.	I heard that firing for some time.  
Q.	Let me ask you this.  Now you were listening to gunfire.  Did you hear any gunfire or explosion from the other direction, not from the Kigali side, but from the north?  
A.	I don't know what you mean by north, in view of where I was living?  What do you mean in reference to the north?  
Q.	Let me move on, please.  Having made your statement in February of 1998, I am going to put to you occasions after that when investigators or lawyers or both came to see you and speak to you.  Now, you weren't having these documents that I have, I am sorry for that, but the Prosecution sitting over there, they have the documents, and if I say anything that is wrong, you can be quite assured that Ms. Fall would get on her feet and she'll put things right for you, all right?  So the 27th of March 2002, two investigators -- 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, yes, I leapt up immediately, if only to make a clarification and say that the documents that we referred to are investigators notes and we never disclosed them.  We never intended to because I had myself seen that there were mistakes, but if we did, it is because during the preceding trial that is when we hadn't disclosed them, Counsel Hooper already had them in hand, and you can check that in the transcript from last year, which is why we obliged to disclose the document after Niyitegeka, and I would like to tell the Court that those documents, I, personally, wouldn't have been disclosed because we personally realised that there were many mistakes, but we couldn't correct them.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall.  
MR. HOOPER:
I am somewhat concerned about what was said, but I don't think this is quite the time to address -- maybe no criticism in what was just said, knowing the more profounder implications of what was just said.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The exercise, Madam Witness, is merely this, to try and jog your memory as to times when investigators came to see you.  None of these documents, may I add, have come into my possession until they were served on me by the Prosecution recently, within the last month; none were disclosed earlier nor did I get them through any other means which is the implication I heard.  

And, Madam Witness, you gave your statement on the -- in February 1998.  On the 27th of March 2002, I have a document that shows that you were visited by two investigators.  I want to pause there.  By then you had given evidence in the case of Kamuhanda on the ************** 2001, and again on several days at the end of that year.  Let me just correct myself, I may be wrong on the subsequent hearing.  Just pause for one moment.  
MS. FALL:
I could specify, Mr. President, with your permission, that I do not know the date of the ************* 2001.  I have the **************, but no transcript for the ********** 2001.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But that is what I said,*******************.  Well, there has been -- it's lost in translation.  The **********, the *****************, 2001, you give evidence in a case called Kamuhanda; that is correct, isn't it?  Forget ********** for a moment.  
A.	Yes, I do remember.
Q.	You then gave evidence on the ******************************************* 2001 in the same case; that is correct, isn't it?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And so I am sure that before the 27th of March 2002, you were seeing investigators and talking about your evidence, investigators and Prosecutors, but I haven't had any disclosure of anything relating to that, but that would be right, wouldn't it, when you came here and in preparation for your evidence in ********************* 2001, it would be quite natural for you to meet Prosecutors and investigators.  
A.	On that day the ********* 2001, I testified here, ***********.  
Q.	No, I am not asking you about that.  Can we come to the point of the question.  Would I be right in saying that in 2001 as part of your preparation for giving evidence, you would have met with Prosecutors and investigators in preparation for that, either in Kigali or here or at home, if you weren't ********** by then?  You would have met people, wouldn't you?  
A.	Yes, I did meet them.  They were telling me that I would have to come back here to testify again for various reasons.  
Q.	So let's come to the first record I have got, but you must have those in mind, those previous occasions.  The 27th of March 2002, *****************************, you were seen by two investigators and an interpreter, you may not remember that day and that opportunity to discuss evidence, but would you accept it from me that that meeting occurred?  
A.	I can remember the dates, but it is possible they came to see me.  
Q.	Not possible, it was a fact that they came to see you, do you accept that?  
A.	Various teams of investigators came to see me.  If I tell you that I don't remember the date, it is because I don't want to make a mistake as to which team came to see me, perhaps you are talking about a different team than that which I am thinking about.  
Q.	The next record I have and these are all and the only record that I have, is that you were seen on the 27th of May 2003.  You were seen by two investigators and an interpreter and the Prosecutor here 
	Ms. Dior Fall.  Do you remember that May 2003?  
A.	I remember having met Prosecutor Fall.  I can no longer remember those people who accompanied her.  
Q.	Again, it is two years ago and who can blame you, but you do remember that meeting, don't you?  
A.	I have already agreed to that, Counsel.
Q.	And they went through your interview with you, didn't they, and you made some corrections to come to today or tomorrow; that is right, isn't it?  
A.	I don't quite follow.  I didn't correct the statement I made here because I had not yet begun to testify here.

1000H  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, I've got a note of six specific corrections you made -- may I say, I think you remember this meeting very well, don't you? 
A.	That document that you have, does it bear my signature so that I can remember whether, indeed, those six corrections were made by myself and that I saw them?
Q.	I believe it does bear your signature.  Try -- can I pass a document up to you, which is our page GIN 87, and this is the certificate that goes with the rest of the document.  And I'm going to just pass you up 
	GIN 87, and if you look there, does your signature appear twice on that document? 
A.	Yes, I see my signature. 
Q.	Did you see it twice on that document? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you see five other signatures on that document of all the other people who were there? 
MS. FALL:
Monsieur President --  
THE WITNESS:
I see four of the signatures.  I don't see where you see five. 
MS. FALL:
Are we talking about the witness statement or the investigator's note because the signature is on the statement, but not on the investigator's note.  I should like that clarification -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- But I think I lost the end of it, the microphone was switched off, so --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, the witness is giving testimony and she was asked to identify what she was looking at.  I think that we should take her evidence on this matter. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you have the document in front of you.  It maybe that -- that there are four other signatures; I accept what you see in front of you, and your signature appears twice and if I could have the document back?  Thank you very much.  And where you've signed it, it says in English and I'll read it to you in English or have it translated:

"13A, positive report of reconfirmation.  The witness has confirmed all matters mentioned in her statement as being true and correct."  

And then it says the same in French and everybody signs it.  In fact, there's four signatures there and I'm not sure if Ms. Fall has signed that herself or not.  Perhaps she can confirm if she has or not because -- while we're on the point. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I have been questioned and I would respond and that's why I say there's a lot of confusion in what Counsel Hooper is doing.  He started with the investigator's notes, 27th of May, 2003 and without warning, he returned to the reconfirmation procedure where there are signatures, but not our signature.  

I think, really, in order to be clearer and to help the -- the witness to be able to answer clearly, he should not go from one statement to another without warning us and avoid this confusion.  So really, it is -- after speaking of the investigator's notes, he can then explain that he's coming back to the procedure of reconfirmation.  But to go from one document to another without giving us any warning, that is what creates the confusion.  So I should like him, Mr. President, to be more specific in what he is addressing so that we do not delay proceedings. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	It's essentially one document all emanating from the meeting on the 27th of May and we all have the document.  And there's four other signatures.  We have two investigators, we have one interpreter and that makes three people, so I'm puzzled as to how there's four signatures.  And I wondered if the first signature was Ms. Fall's, but she assures me it isn't, and I accept that. 

But, in any event, that's not the point.  The point is that you confirmed on that day with those investigators, with Ms. Fall present, with an interpreter, and signed, to this effect, that you confirmed all the matters mentioned in your statement as being true and correct.  That's right, isn't it? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, could Counsel Hooper tell us exactly which document he is referring to?  And, this is very important, Mr. President.  I want to insist on this point so we avoid creating any further confusion. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm -- I'm sorry if I'm dealing with this in a way that's not being followed.  I'm looking at the documents that resulted from the meeting between investigators, Ms. Fall, and an interpreter *******************, Kigali on the 20 -- or, maybe, I'm mistaken -- on the 27th of May, 2003.  So we've dealt with the 27th of March, 2002 and now we're in the next year, and the document is dated the 27th of May, 2003. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we have two documents of 27th of May, 2003.  Could Counsel please be more specific as to which document he is referring to?
MR. HOOPER:
I was beginning to doubt my own sanity for a moment.  But, yes, I don't see the problem.  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	GIN, we -- we have page numbers.  Let me recap.  GIN -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I've got the document myself now. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right, okay. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.      So just to recap, so we can all follow the position -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think, Madam -- Ms. Fall, I understood that counsel had shown the Witness, GIN 87, and that's a document I have retrieved. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think it is the reconfirmation document of 27th May, 2003 that was shown to the witness.  It bears the signatures of the investigators, the interpreter, and the witness.  But counsel is suggesting that the document is -- he's suggesting that the witness signed the investigator's note.  That is quite different from the other document of 27th May, 2003.  There is the reconfirmation document, which was effectively signed by the witness, but there is also the investigator's note, which was not signed by the witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
I have made no such suggestion and when we revisit the transcript, Ms. Fall, you'll realise there's been no suggestion of that. 

Let me recap the position, so that we're all crystal clear, I hope, on what I am putting. 

First of all, the first record I have of this witness being seen by an investigator is the inter- -- the investigator's interview report at page GIN 88, dated the 27th of March, 2002.  In respect of that, I commented and pointed out that it's obvious that before then this witness would have been seen on several occasions by investigators and lawyers in preparation for her then ongoing testimony in the Kamuhanda case, both in April and again, in September of 2001, all of which predates this first document -- this first evidence that I have that she's been seen by an investigator. 

We dealt with the 27th of March, 2002.  I've moved to the next meeting that she had and this witness recalls that she had.  She doesn't recall all the personalities but she does recall Ms. Fall as being there.
The date of that meeting was the 27th of May, 2003.  The product of that meeting, in terms of documents, is on our page GIN 91, 92 and 93, which is the document rapport d' interview d'enquêteurs. That document has been signed, as we can see on page 93, by all those present.  But as we well know, and it's already been the subject of a very concise and articulate submission by Mr. O'Shea, these particular documents aren't signed by witnesses.  That, at the time, was a device so that they wouldn't be served on the pros -- on the Defence. 

But this particular document is dated the 27th of May, 2003.  In it, as I pointed out to the witness this morning, she makes six -- or, it's been recorded that she makes six specific changes and observations on her statement.  We can see those listed at GIN 93, and I'll be coming back to those in more detail at a later opportunity. 

The document she has signed that day is the document that I put in her hands and which she's acknowledged.  She has acknowledged her two signatures, which appear at GIN 87.  That document, one can see, is dated the 27th of May.  It may be that my friend was confused because, of course, the page sequence doesn't follow the other documents. 

The page sequence, in fact, puts this document, as it were, in the pagination as before the 27th of March of 2002 document.  It should be extracted from there and put, in my submission, obviously, after page 93.  This document has been signed by the witness and by all those present and a mysterious fourth signature appears.  At section 13A at our GIN 87, on the 27th of May '03, this witness has confirmed all matters mentioned in her statement as being true and correct. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So Madam Witness, I apologise for that detour over the last 15 minutes.  Can I take you back to your evidence.  You were good enough to recognise your signature that appears twice on this document and I've had read out and translated to you that your signature appears beneath the English and the French where you confirm all the matters in your statement as being true and correct.  Right?  So do you remember signing that -- signing that all the matters other than your corrections that day in your statement were true and correct? 
A.	What document are you referring to, Counsel?  My statement or the document dealing with the corrections that I made to my statement? 
Q.	No, don't worry about any line that Ms. Fall has been expressing in court.  The document that you just saw and had in your hands with your signature upon it, that's the document I'm talking about.  Do you want to see it again?  Perhaps you should be shown it again. 
A.	Well, I have been shown a document, which was bearing my signature, but I didn't look at the content of that document. 
Q.	Now, if you look at the top of that page, Madam Witness, and I appreciate it's not in a language that you speak, but everybody there -- including everyone there, not Ms. Fall, but everybody else there has signed that part of the document, including you.  And it says there, and you had an interpreter present, "I confirm that everything I say in my statement is correct."   Do you remember doing that and signing that?  What are you saying about that now? 
A.	I did recognise my signature on that document.  I do concede that, but I see other signatures as well on that page.  Now, on another page I can see some names, including the name of the Accused person and I do acknowledge that, yes, indeed, this is my signature.  But I do not see part of the contents of that document.  I can see the signatures, but I do not see the content of that document. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I'd like to ask Counsel Hooper whether he looked at paragraph 13B of that very document, 13B.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Right.  Now, let me have the document back because I haven't finished with this document yet and I'll give you it back, if it's necessary.  And I want to come to 13B and I'll read it so that you understand what it says.  13B -- having confirmed your statement as being true and correct at 13A, 13B reads that the witness wishes to make changes or additions to his or her existing statement.  As a result, a further interview has been completed and a supplementary statement taken.  Or, it reads, a further interview has been arranged for. 

In French, it reads, "She has made a new declaration."   And, then, in brackets, and this has been circled and indicating, therefore, what the position is, "Or a complementary declaration." 

So what 13B says is that you've made a complementary declaration and that's your note d'enquêteur, isn't it?  That's what everyone's referring to there.  But we know in those days it wasn't signed, so that it could be hidden from the Defence.  And you've signed that again. 

So do you want to see the document again?  I don't think it will help you and if I've said anything that's wrong, then I'm sure it will be corrected by Ms. Fall when she has that opportunity.  But it's obvious on that day that not only did you -- and this is a question now -- it's right, isn't it, that you both confirmed your original statement as true and correct, subject to certain changes that you made, which are contained in the document that accompanies this document, you made changes that day, but, otherwise, you accepted the truth of your statement.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	That is not correct.  I believe that you have read somewhere that I indicated that I was going to make some changes to my statement.  Therefore, what you're saying is not correct. 
Q.	The document that accompanies this, called a note -- an investigator's note, a note d'enquêteur is at our GIN 93 and it reads this.

"The witness wishes to make some modi- -- minor modifications to her previous statement of the 
3rd of February '98."

I'll say that again.  "The witness wishes to make minor modifications to her previous statement dated the 3rd of February, 1998."  That's in French, but I think that's an accurate reflection of what's said. 

And then it goes, one, two, three, four, five, six - and, against each of those numbers there's a change. So for example, the first change you make is this.  It's in French and I'll translate it:  

"She saw André Rwamakuba at the commune bureau of Gikomero between the 12th and the 20th of April, 1994 and not the 12th exactly." 

I'm not asking you about -- much about that.  You see, you've changed something that's been recorded and the rest of your statement hasn't been changed, except where it's referred to here.  So you see, you did make changes that day and they were recorded -- six of them.  Do you remember that?  
A.	No, I do not remember the number of changes that I made, but I do know that I did make some changes.  Now, you have just referred to the Gikomero communal office, whereas it is the office of the Gikomero secteur. 
Q.	We'll -- we'll come back to that, don't worry about that.  Your next interview report was the 13th of February, 2004 at ****************************.  You were seen then by someone called Holo Makwaia who, I understood, was a lawyer, but I may be wrong, but it's an interviewer here.  And someone called Fadila Tidjani (phonetic), another interviewer.  And other persons present are Dior -- Dior Fall, legal advisor and an interpreter -- that is, the 13th of February last year *************.  Do you remember having that meeting? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Do you remember discussing your statement? 
A.	Yes, I do remember. 
Q.	And we can see on our page GIN 96 the changes that you've made to your statement, and I'll be returning to those.  And then, finally, and I don't have the page number in the bundle, but I believe it's in the bundle, there's a document called, "Notice of additional evidence pursuant to Rule 67D," which was served on the 23rd of April of last year.  And it was submitted by Mr. Don Webster, senior trial attorney and Holo Makwaia, trial attorney. 

So it's the same person who'd seen you in ***************.  And as a result of meeting you here, this two-page document was served on me and that contains radical changes to your statement, and the mention for the very first time of André Rwamakuba in the context of the Kayanga health centre -- and I'll be returning to that document. 
MR. HOOPER:
And I see the time, and I must say I'd estimated that at this point I'd have reached in 30 minutes.  But I'm afraid it's taken very much longer and I very much doubt I'll be able to finish this witness today, given the material I have to put to her. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the indication. 

We'll take the morning break now. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1056H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can we resume now?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

Before I resume questioning, I had thought that the last document I referred to, which was the 
Rule 67(D), notice of additional evidence, was part of the GIN file on the dossier that was provided. 
But we've discovered it isn't and that matter is being put in hand at the moment.  We're having it photocopied and with no electronic copy, I'm afraid at the moment, but it may be that the Prosecution, whose document it is, can provide a -- yeah, oh, it's come.  Yes, I've sent Mr. O'Shea away, so he'll be rather cross with me when he gets back, I suspect.  But -- there we are. 

All right.  And there should be an electronic copy of that for -- for the Bench which, I understand, Ms. Fall acknowledges there is, and that will be provided to you, I hope, by the Prosecution.  We don't have one. 
So just for the record, the document that's just been provided to the Bench is dated the 
23rd of April, 2004.  It was served in the course of the previous court proceedings in this case and is self-explanatory on sight. 

And in respect of this document, the Defence put to the witness before the adjournment that it was a radical departure from her original statement at that late date and, in addition, it's the first mention of the Kayanga health centre in the context of André Rwamakuba. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, we've dealt, really, so far with two elements.  First of all, your making of the statement of February of 1998 and your subsequent opportunities to alter and correct that statement.  And those corrections -- the corrections we haven't dealt with in detail, we'll come to those.  But I want now to return to the statement and you said yesterday that you didn't have the statement in front of you in a -- and -- and we acknowledged that we didn't have a Kinyarwanda version of the statement because none were provided.  And that, in those circumstances -- subject to the view of the Bench, 
	Mr. President, what I propose to do is to read the statement and I understand that or parts of the statement, a large part of the statement, and I understand that the statement itself is in the hands of the interpreters who are going to have to do that translation. 
So I'm going to read the statement in English in -- word for word and the interpreter can follow me.  But I'll be reading it until the second page in the English version, all the matters that deal with Rwamakuba. 
So let me start reading it and this is your statement, I remind you, Madam Witness, of the 3rd of February of 1998.

"During the events of April of 1994, I remained at home in Gikomero secteur, in the commune which bears that same name, I was able to move around a bit because ************************************** -- " and I'll omit the name -- and I'll omit or perhaps we should -- I don't know whether we should go into closed session for the reading of the statement?  I think that's the only personal details -- indeed, it is.  

Anyway, you give your husband's name; your description of what he was.  The fact that ************* 1995, but "I cannot tell you the cause *************. I know Dr. André Rwamakuba for I saw him driving his car many times.  I do not know the make nor the colour of the car.  The last time I saw him, I was able to see him closely.  He arrived in Gikomero secteur, the commune office of which was in a small centre, which bore that same name, Gikomero.  It served as a refuge for threatened people, be they Hutu or Tutsi. 

This happened on the 12th of April, 1994, between 10 a.m. and 12 noon.  *************************************************; I was shocked by what he did to two people.  He seized their certificates and tore them up.  I do not know how the certificates got to the hands of Rwamakuba.  I only saw him tear them.  I think they must have asked them for their identity cards, but as it was dangerous for the Tutsis to present them, it was common practice for them to say it was lost and produce any document which did not reveal their ethnic group. 

I asked my husband who that man was.  He told me he was Dr. André Rwamakuba.  I then told him that I'd seen the man several times.  The person my husband told me was Rwamakuba, was wearing a pair of trousers and a shirt with the MRND party colours -- that is, green and yellow. 
He was wearing a cap of the same colours with a hoe and a pruning knife." 

May I read that again?  "He was wearing a cap of the same colours with a hoe and a pruning knife called urunana in Kinyarwanda. 

Rwamakuba was stout, average height and fair in complexion." 

If I can just pause there.  The word "stout" in the French version is translated in the statement as 
forte corpulence or forte corpulence.  I'll continue.  

"That day he was with the bourgmestre of the commune Mr. Rutaganira, Brigadier Nyarwaya, the commune's accountant, Mathias Kabanguka."  

Pausing there, that should be Rubanguka -- R not K -- "and two communal policemen.  Two vehicles were parked nearby.  I cannot tell you the make, colour nor the registration number of any of these vehicles, which may have belonged to Rwamakuba.  The second vehicle, a red Toyota pickup, belonged to the bourgmestre.  I do not know its registration number. 

After tearing up the certificates, Rwamakuba ordered the crowd to seize the people and kill them.  The following people seized them.  Ngiruwosanga, an inhabitant of the secteur, Officers Ngarambe and Kayibanda; both communal policemen.  All took them away followed by a crowd, which included 
André Rwamakuba himself, to the woods located about 70 metres away where they were killed. 

I must confess that I didn't witness the murder, for I didn't follow the murderers, so I cannot tell you how they were killed.  However, the people who made up the crowd were carrying different kinds of weapons:  Firearms, machetes, clubs, et cetera.  However, I believe these young people were killed for they didn't come back with the crowd and I've not seen them since then. 

I did not know these people before then and consequently cannot tell you who they were.  I know some people who were present during the events and I think can confirm the inc- -- the incident.  They are two women who live in Gikomero secteur.  I can take you to them.  Their names are Drocella Mukayiranga, M-U-K-A-Y-I-R-A-N-G-A, Mukayiranga and Murekatete, M-U-R-E-K-A-T-E-T-E, Murekatete.  Others are men whose complicity in the crime can be easily established.  I doubt if they would be willing to speak to you about the incident.  

At that time, the killings had not started in our commune.  I'm sure that it was an attempt to give a green light that Rwamakuba came.  I followed all that was said and done, ********************************************************, made up initially of about 100 people, but which later swelled when the people realised that the massacres were about to start.  This was how I was able to hear what was being said and see the things I have described. 

Rwamakuba came to sensitise the people so that they could start the massacres.  After assembling some people upon arrival, he asked them why they had not started killing.  In fact, he said, "There are police and military reservists here, who can help you.  Do you need anything else?  What is stopping you from starting the killing?"
My husband confirmed what I just told you concerning why Rwamakuba came to our secteur.  My husband prevented me from approaching the crowd and made it clear to me that I was personally threatened because I was Tutsi. 

After the gory task, the crowd came back to the front of the secteur office.  Five minutes later, a young man arrived on a motorbike.  The brigadier ordered him to stop and asked him where he was coming from.  He said that he was fleeing the massacres in Rutongo commune, which shared a north-western border with Gikomero.  The crowd discussed what to do with him.  Some said he was Hutu and should be spared.  While those who thought he was Tutsi asked that he be killed.  André Rwamakuba said the fugitive could not be a Hutu for only the Tutsis were fleeing.  He, therefore, decided that the man should be killed. 

The young man was taken into the same woods where the first set of young people were killed and was definitely killed there.  In any case, his motorbike was retrieved by Brigadier Nyarwaya.  After these incidents, Rwamakuba told the people they had just started the killings and that it was a good start.  I did not see Rwamakuba again.  But the massacres intensified.  

After André Rwamakuba left for Kigali, the Interahamwe militia, and elements of the presidential guard arrived in the afternoon.  With the help of the population, they started killing the refugees.  More than 4,000 people were killed at the Gikomero Protestant school complex ****************************************.  The bodies were thrown into latrines built by the centre.  Most of the survivors are still around, for the victims had come from different locations, Remera, Kigali-town centre, neighbouring communes like Gikoro -- that is, G-I-K-O-R-O; Kabuga, K-A-B-U-G-A; Rubungo commune, R-U-B-U-N-G-O -- another neighbouring commune.  Sorry, Rubungo commune, another neighbouring commune, and certainly from other regions to take refuge.  Only those from Gikomero were later given a decent burial by their relations. 

My parents were massacred at another site in *****************, in the same commune where about 2,000 people were killed.  It was at this location that my mother, *********** -- you give the name of your mother, your aunts, uncle, sister and your brother were killed.  More were killed in the hills.  Most, if not all, were killed because they were Tutsis. 

Apart from the few things I mentioned earlier, I didn't hear any speech which I can attribute to 
André Rwamakuba neither directly nor on the radio; I do not remember any. 

Regarding contribution in cash or in kind, which Rwamakuba gave, I can only tell you what he said at the meeting I've just mentioned and this is related to your question.  He urged those who did not have the necessary means to effectively take part in the killings to seek assistance from him. 
I cannot tell you what he did nor the political party he belonged to." 
And then your statement continues concerning Mr. Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda.  And you say, ************************************************************************************.  And you say he was a minister in the Abatabazi government; that he'd come on the 5th of April, the day before the president's plane crashed, and he came three days later to your salon.  You describe it as "my salon" where he met ***************************************************.  

And you describe him giving -- that is, Kamuhanda, as giving grenades and a knife and other details in relation to that.  You said that he told his listeners that they were the only ones who had not started killing and urged them to start with the weapons he'd given them.  

And he came to leave.  And, you end up saying, "Well, this is all I remember for the moment.  If I remember anything else, I'll let you know." 

Now, that statement, is, in fact, a statement of great clarity relating to André Rwamakuba and his coming to Gikomero secteur, isn't it? 
A.	I believe that you have just read my entire statement.  But, previously, you said that you had read a document in which I had indicated that I was going to make some changes to my statement.  I believe that we are all agreed on the fact that there are some items that are clear and others that deserve to be clarified. 
(Pages 12 to 22 by Jean Baigent)


















1115H
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Your statement, which you've just heard me read, is a clear, consistent account of the events in Gikomero, isn't it?  It reads, and it has the shape and the form of a clear and consistent account of the history of events.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	You have read the statement.  But before I proceed with my testimony, I would like to put a question to you.  You say that I am a protected witness, but there are materials in there which you have read which can enable any intelligent person to identify me.  You have referred to my husband's name, to my mother' name, *******************************************************************************.  And I believe that from that material, that information that you have provided, it is very easy to identify me. 
Q.	Well, I certainly stumbled into mentioning your husband's name, and I'm sure that would be ordered to be redacted.  I didn't mention your mother's name, the first name, but I'm sure that wouldn't be sufficient as we've heard these names are very common.  And I didn't mention ******************************* and anyone else you knew.  So I hope -- in fact, that I did stumble on one or two occasions -- I hope I've done my best to protect your -- your position.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, can I -- would it be sufficient for me to order redaction?  Would that be a sufficiently clear order?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, so noted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, the difference between your account and your statement here -- and your evidence is, I suggest, considerable.  There is a considerable difference, isn't there, in your relating of the story.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	No.  No, I don't agree. 
Q.	We'll have to look at that a lot closely.  Now, may I say that it may well have been the two young people were confronted in your centre, and it may well have been that a young man on a motorbike was similarly confronted in your centre.  But I suggest that André Rwamakuba was never ever there in your centre, at any time, in any month, in any year.  
A.	You are his lawyer, and I am not surprised that you would make such a suggestion.  I was present.  I am a witness, and I'm testifying before this Court as to what I saw.  He came to the spot. 
Q.	What I suggest you have done is that you have attached Rwamakuba to these two incidents that you've described.  I think I have made it plain.  You've attached him when, in fact, he wasn't there at all.  And I'd also add that I don't necessarily accept that you yourself even witnessed those incidents, that you were necessarily even in Gikomero at the time of those incidents, and that you may have come by that information from talking to others, such as your husband or other people who did participate in what went on.  Right?  That's my position in respect of your evidence.  So I'm putting my position, I hope clearly, at the outset so we understand things.  
A.	Well, let me also put my position on those allegations you have made.  Am I allowed to do so?  
Q.	If you consider it assists us, yes, please do.  
A.	Very well.  You have asserted that Rwamakuba did not come to Gikomero and you deny the fact that I was an eyewitness of that incident.  Well, if you did conduct your investigations properly, I was in Gikomero, I lived *************, before, during and after the war.  I am not inventing anything whatsoever in respect of Rwamakuba.  My testimony is based on what I saw.  Now, you claim that Rwamakuba is innocent, whereas, he knows full well himself that what we are saying is the truth, and that he is not innocent.  He must have -- somehow laugh at you when you claim that he is innocent. 
Q.	Well, thank you.  When you say "what we are saying", who do you mean by "we"? 
A.	I am talking about discussions that have taken place here within -- before the Court, as well as statements by witnesses.  When the Prosecutor questions a witness, I, for example, as a witness, have made a statement or a testimony in respect of that.  And that is what I was referring to. 
Q.	So, by "we", you mean I, what I have said; that's right, is it? 
A.	Yes, but let me add the Prosecutor as well. 
Q.	You see, what I suggest is that since you have made this statement, you have changed your story.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, to facilitate matters further, I would wonder whether it might not be best to identify those contradictions so that the witness may answer specifically.  When you say that the witness has changed, that is not a clear question.  If the contradictions were brought to the notice or the knowledge of the witness, she would be in a position to answer properly.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right, let's start with your knowledge of Dr. André Rwamakuba.  In your evidence, you've told us that you met him or had the opportunity of knowing who he was as a result of seeing him, first of all, at a wedding, and secondly, seeing him when you were at a house in Kigali.  And I suggest that those are very recent additions to your evidence.  And the very first time they saw the light of day, first time you made those suggestions or gave evidence or suggested you'd seen him on those occasions, was in April of last year.  That was the very first time you mentioned it to anyone, wasn't it; is that correct? 
A.	Well, Counsel, you are not putting your questions in the same manner in which someone else may put their question.  Everybody puts their question in view of objective they seek to meet.  My statement indicates -- my written statement indicates that I had seen Rwamakuba on several occasions but I wasn't asked to mention specifically what those occasions were. 
Q.	Well, in April of last year, in a document which we now all have, you refer, first of all, there -- at paragraph 9 on page 2 -- of seeing him at Kariyonga's, and seeing him at Nyirorinkwaya's.  And I think you agree, don't you that that was the first time that you ever mentioned that to anyone.  Do you agree with that; yes or no?  If that's possible.  
A.	It was the first time that I talked about the place where I saw him because that was the time at which such a question was put to me. 
Q.	Now, let's deal, first of all, with what your present evidence is, and that is that he was introduced to people by the giver of a wedding party; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And who -- how old would you have been at that time? 
A.	In 1992 I was 20 years old. 
Q.	Were you married yourself by then or not? 
A.	I was still single. 
Q.	And who were the bride and groom? 
A.	I told you that on that occasion it was a dowry-giving.  Kariyonga was the maternal uncle, but I'm not sure exactly what the relationship was between the young lady due to be married and Kariyonga.  It was a dowry bestowing ceremony. 
Q.	So it wasn't a wedding then? 
A.	And why do you say it's not a wedding ceremony?  When dowry is bestowed it is a wedding ceremony.  I don't know why you are saying it's not a wedding ceremony. 
Q.	So, please forgive me if I, perhaps, don't appreciate your wedding traditions.  Be patient with me, please.  Was this a wedding or some other -- some other celebrations?  For example, in my culture, people might have an engagement party when people promise to marry one another; they are not yet married but they might use the occasion to have a party.  And then later, perhaps, many months later or so, they would have a formal wedding.  What was this?  Can you explain what this was, this ceremony you went to or occasion you went to? 
A.	Your culture is different from ours.  In my culture, everything depends on people's means, their wealth.  We can have -- if you have sufficient means, one ceremony for the dowry and then a separate ceremony for the wedding.  But in this case, it was a single ceremony and it was a wedding ceremony. 
Q.	So it was a wedding ceremony? 
A.	Yes, it was a wedding ceremony. 
Q.	Now, how many weddings did you go to in 1992 when you were 20? 
A.	To answer your question, I would say that I cannot answer your question.  I didn't know that such a question would be put to me today. 
Q.	Will you tell us, please, the name of the bride and groom at this wedding? 
A.	I have told you that it was a person who Kariyonga was the paternal uncle, but I don't remember the names any more, but I can see their faces.  I did not -- I don't remember the name of the groom. 
Q.	What about the bride, do you remember that person's name? 
A.	I would answer your question by saying that I remember the face of that person.  I know the -- I know the place where that person resided, but I don't remember their names. 
Q.	Well, why were you invited?  What was your relationship? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you please repeat the question, Counsel?  Sorry, it's a request from the booth.  
THE WITNESS: 
**************.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I didn't finish my question, I'm sorry.  I meant to ask you --  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What was your relation to the -- ******************?  Because I think you've answered a question I haven't quite finished.  You are on the right line.  ***********
A.	*********** to the family of the girl. 
Q.	All right.  And how long had they been *************? 
A.	A long time. 
Q.	So what was her name? 
A.	The fact that one -- **************************** doesn't mean that one knows their names.  This was some time ago and I can't remember her name. 
Q.	Was she your age? 
A.	She was a bit older than me. 
Q.	Was she your peer? 
A.	Yes, she was a friend. 
Q.	But you can't remember her name.  What about the family name, perhaps you can remember that, after all they were ***************?
A.	Yes, I know that that young lady lived with her grandfather, who was Kariyonga's father. 
Q.	So this girl was Kariyonga's niece or daughter; which was it? 
A.	I think I explained that the young lady lived with her grandfather and I knew that Kariyonga was either her paternal uncle or a cousin of her father's, but I know that there was close family relationship between that young lady and Kariyonga. 
Q.	You've made up this wedding, haven't you? 
A.	Why do you think I've made this up, invented that wedding?  
Q.	To give substance to you knowing André Rwamakuba.  You have slotted him in to this occasion, to this opportunity.  That's what you have done, isn't it? 
A.	The fact of stating that there was a wedding and that André Rwamakuba was present adds nothing to my testimony.  I merely pointed out that I knew him. 
Q.	Just remind us again, please, the circumstances in which you came to know André Rwamakuba at that wedding?  Can you just tell us briefly, please? 
A.	I told you that he was invited to that wedding, that he came with Kariyonga to Kariyonga's parents' home and Kariyonga introduced him saying, "Here is Dr. André Rwamakuba".  That is what I remember. 
Q.	And the name stuck in your memory, did it? 
A.	Inasmuch as I saw him on several occasions, I never forgot it. 
Q.	And how long did that wedding last, that celebration? 
A.	You are seeking hours from me.  I don't remember how many hours.  It all depends how a ceremony is prepared, and I didn't stay until the end of the ceremony.  At one point I left before the end of the ceremony, so I cannot tell you how long it lasted. 
Q.	So where was the ceremony that you attended? 
A.	********************** at Kariyonga's parents' house. 
Q.	And was the wedding celebrated in house or somewhere else? 
A.	The ceremony took place in the courtyard of Kariyonga's parents' house. 
Q.	And was there a religious ceremony? 
A.	At the house?  You can't have religious ceremonies in people's houses, at least as far as I know. 
Q.	Was there a religious ceremony? 
A.	I told you that it was a dowry-bestowing ceremony.  I didn't say there was a wedding as such that day. 
Q.	On the *************** '04, last year, page 47 of the transcript, you said this:  "First of all, there was a civil marriage, and then, the religious ceremony of the marriage.  And it was necessary to go back to the groom's house, and that took a lot of time."  But you've forgotten your lines, haven't you? 
A.	I think that you have a problem with what I stated before one of the Trial Chamber's here.  Listen, to err is human, one can forget something. 
Q.	Let's move away from this dowry celebration of your friend or girlfriend whose name you don't recall.  The next time you tell us you saw André Rwamakuba was at Nayorinkwaya's house.  Remind us when that was, please?  I think you said September '92; is that correct? 
A.	I no longer remember the month.  I merely remember the year. 
Q.	Why did you tell us yesterday it was September? 
A.	What you are saying is not correct.  Perhaps you -- you -- perhaps the interpretation of what I said was incorrect. 
Q.	Right.  Well, tell us again what happened there.  You said you were (unintelligible) not a girl.  What -- you were then 20 again, weren't you, but what happened?  How did you come to see, on your evidence, Rwamakuba? 
A.	I told you that I saw him in Nyamirambo at Etienne Nayorinkwaya's house.  But before entering that house, he'd met Charles Kerinijabo, and it was between Nayorinkwaya's house and some banking houses.  He exchanged a few words with Charles Kerinijabo, he introduced himself, and when he entered Nayorinkwaya's house, he exchanged -- he had a conversation with that family, and I was in the courtyard behind the house. 
Q.	So you were in the courtyard behind the house, so how do you see him, Rwamakuba? 
A.	I told you the following:  When he came, he greeted Charles Kerinijabo.  I told you where he was when they were exchanging greetings and then he came into Nayorinkwaya's house.  I opened the door for him.  He sat down, and then I joined the others in the courtyard in the rear because it wasn't me who was supposed to converse with Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Well, are you in the courtyard or are you in the house when he arrives? 
A.	I have explained correctly.  When they were exchanging greetings with Kerinijabo, I was by the gate.  I opened it for him -- I opened the door for him.  And I called Nayorinkwaya's family to tell them someone had come -- I told them someone had come, and then I went and joined the others in the courtyard in the rear. 
Q.	Are you making this up? 
A.	Would -- why would you think that I invent everything, that I make everything up, Counsel?  What makes you think that?  I gave you my version of what happened.  I can't invent such a story in so little time.  I told you what occurred. 
Q.	Let's go back to your statement, and this is what you say about André Rwamakuba:  "I know 
	Dr. André Rwamakuba for I saw him driving his car many times."  How does that fit in? 
A.	There is no difference between what you have said and what I told you. 
Q.	When did you see him driving his car many times? 
A.	When he came to Nayorinkwaya's, he was driving his car.  When he came to Gikomero twice, he was driving his car.  For me, more than once is several times. 
Q.	So -- so that's your explanation for why that phrase is in your statement, is it?  You knew him because he'd been driving his car to these places, to the wedding and to the place in Kigali; is that -- is that what you are saying? 
A.	I have told you what I recall.  You are trying to tell me that what I'm telling you is incorrect.  Well, I don't know where we will meet, where we will come together. 
Q.	Kariyonga, the name in the context to which you mentioned the memory -- the wedding of the girl -- the dowry of the girl whose name you don't remember.  Kariyonga is dead, isn't he? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Are you sure you don't know? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Etienne Nayorinkwaya is dead, isn't he? 
A.	Yes, he is dead. 
Q.	So who is alive that we can go and check your story with in respect of either of those two incidents, of the wedding or the meeting in the house? 
A.	Kariyonga's family -- members of his family are still alive and there were other people who were present at this wedding ceremony. 
Q.	Can you name me one, please? 
A.	I can do so. 
Q.	Will you please do so.  
A.	Ngarambe, N-G-A-R-A-M-B-E. 
Q.	Is that the person whose name you mentioned in the context of the killings in Gikomero? 
A.	No, someone else. 
Q.	It's another Ngarambe, is it?  What's his first name, this one you are naming now? 
A.	It was someone else but I don't remember his name. 
Q.	I will just ask you this:  Does the name Jean-Marie Vanier Baganizi mean anything to you as a neighbour? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Let's come back to your statement.  "I know Dr. André Rwamakuba for I saw him driving his car many times," and the times you saw him driving the car, you've told us, was when he went to the wedding and when he went to the house in Kigali.  "I do not know" -- you say -- "the make, nor the colour of the car."  Is that correct? 
A.	You say that I saw him driving a car at the time of the wedding.  That is not correct.  As to the make and colour of the vehicle, I can forget something like that and then remember it later. 
Q.	"The last time I saw him I was able to see him closely."  And this is when he arrived on the 12th of April 1994.  Now, I will come to that date in a moment.  "The last time I saw him," is that right? 
A.	That is not correct because I corrected that after remembering other details. 
Q.	Because now you say you saw him when he came to go on to Kayanga, don't you?  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is what I told you. 
Q.	"He arrived in Gikomero secteur, the commune office of which was in a small secteur," that is the commune -- the secteur office, isn't it, that's there? 
A.	That is correct.  He came to the secteural office and not the communal office. 
Q.	"Which was in a small centre which bore the same name, Gikomero.  It served as a refuge to certain people, be they Hutu or Tutsi.  This happened on the 12th of April 1994 between 10:00 a.m. and 12 noon."  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, but don't dwell on the date because that is an approximation. 
Q.	Just so we are clear on this.  Did you see André Rwamakuba come to the centre before or after the massacre at the school? 
A.	I saw him after the massacre. 
Q.	And approximately how long after the massacre at the school? 
A.	I said that I saw him between the 10th and the 14th.  And I did say that the school massacre -- the massacre at the school occurred between the 8th and the 14th, to the best of my recollection. 
Q.	I will come back about this later, but just at this point, how many days after the massacre at the school did you see André Rwamakuba in Gikomero centre for the first time? 
A.	Counsel, I did give you explanations as -- in that regard.  I told you I do not remember the exact dates but it was four or five days after, but I didn't give any specific date. 
Q.	I understand you to be saying that André Rwamakuba came first to your centre some days -- you now say four or five days -- after the massacre at the school.  But in your statement, you say you saw him before the massacre at the school, don't you? 
A.	Have you read the statements after it was amended -- as amended?  
Q.	Well, you had lots of opportunity to amend it.  We'll come to that, but that's the big difference in your evidence today and your statement then, isn't it?  That's a big difference, don't you agree? 
A.	At the moment we are speaking together, I do not agree with you.  You must point out -- show me this great difference you are referring to and allow me to speak about it.  It's not sufficient to say that there is a big difference between what I am saying and what is stated in the statement. 
Q.	I will come to that in a moment.  Let's just go back to your knowledge of André Rwamakuba, and you have told us of these two previous meetings.  And we have read the lines, "I know Dr. Rwamakuba.  I saw him driving his car many times" et cetera.  But let's just see what you say.  You say he arrived on the 12th of April between 10:00 and 12 noon, but that's no longer right, obviously not.  Well, we'll come back to that.  Let me just go and see what you say about him.  You say -- and I'm reading from your statement now:  "I asked my husband who that man was" -- the second paragraph of the English about line 8 -- "I asked my husband who that man was.  He told me he was Dr. André Rwamakuba."  Just pausing there.  Why did you ask your husband who he was? 
A.	If I did not -- if I hadn't thought about the man I wouldn't have put the question to my husband.  So I put the question to my husband because I had just remembered that man. 
Q.	You then say, "I then told him -- that's my husband -- I then told him I'd seen the man several times."  Is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then you described Rwamakuba.  Can you describe him, by the way, today now, as you sit in the witness box?  I know it's a long time ago, but can you describe him?  How do you remember this man, Rwamakuba, the man you saw at the wedding, the man you saw in Kigali, the man you saw at Gikomero twice, how -- can you describe him to us? 
A.	The last time I saw him was in 1994.  Maybe he has changed, but I can try to describe him, to the best of my recollection, based on what I saw at the time. 
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Can you, please? 
A.	I do remember that he was not very tall, he was fat, may I say, but not very fat.  He was not obese.  As for his colour, he was somewhere between dark and light; fair skinned. 
Q.	This was a description you gave me on a previous occasion:  "He was not too light, not too dark; quite well built, but not too much; of average height, not very tall, not too short."  Do you agree with that description or are you now saying he was fat? 
A.	Why would you want me to change what I have already said, Counsel?  
Q.	You've added the word "fat" today, compared to what you'd said to me before on another occasion.  Are you saying this Rwamakuba you saw was -- was a little fat, or a bit fat?  What are you saying, please? 
A.	What I have said is that he was not very fat, but that he was not very thin, either.  He was between the two. 
Q.	Sorry, do you need some water or something?  
A.	No. 
Q.	All right?  Okay.  In your statement in English, you describe him as -- the word used is "stout" and in French is forte corpulence.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I hope those words have been suitably translated into Kinyarwanda, stout, forte corpulence.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would that be an accurate description of the man you saw or say you saw in Gikomero centre? 
A.	Counsel, I have just provided the same explanation to you.  I have told you that he was not thin and he was not very fat, which means that he could be between the two, somewhere between, that is between a thin and a fat person. 
Q.	Well, between thin and fat, is average.  Was he getting on to be fat or he was getting on to be thin or you're just saying he was average? 
A.	He was a well built man.  He was stout. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	He was a lanky person. 
Q.	All right.  Now, you go on to say, "The person my husband told me was Rwamakuba."  So you got the name from your husband.  That's right, isn't it, according to this statement? 
A.	A short while ago, you read an excerpt whereby I asked my husband who that man was and my husband said it was Rwamakuba.  Well, you may want to read on -- read my statement further, then you will see what I said subsequently. 
Q.	Well, I'm reading your statement and in a way I hope you can deal with:  "The person my husband told me was Rwamakuba was wearing a pair of trousers and a shirt with MRND party colours, that is, green and yellow."  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, could we effectively read what this witness said after she got an answer from her husband?  "He told me he was Dr. André Rwamakuba."  And then there is another sentence before what Counsel Hooper has just read.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I have read that.  I've put that to the witness.  It hasn't been avoided.
MS. FALL: 
No, there is a sentence which you haven't read.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I will read it again:  "I asked my husband who that man was.  He told me he was 
Dr. André Rwamakuba.  I then told him I'd seen the man several times.  The person my husband told me was Rwamakuba --" right -- "the person my husband told me was Rwamakuba was wearing a pair of trousers and a shirt with the MRND party colour, that is, green and yellow.  He was wearing a cap of the same colour with a hoe and a pruning knife called Urunana in Kinyarwanda.  Rwamakuba was stout, average height and fair in complexion".  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What do you say about your description of his wearing a pair of trousers and a shirt with the green and yellow of the MRND party colours, and a cap in the same colours with the symbols of the MRND, the hoe and the pruning knife on the cap?  Why did you tell the investigators that?  
A.	I provided those explanations to the investigators following a question which they had put to me on his attire.  And after reading my statement, I realised that the investigators had made a mistake and then I explained the mistake to them.  In fact, the colour -- or, rather, the trouser and the shirt were the right attire he was wearing but there was a mistake a far as the shirt -- the shirt is concerned.  As for the cap and the trouser -- this is the situation:  There was a mistake on the shirt, but the trouser and the cap were described correctly. 
Q.	Well, you just described him as wearing trousers, and most men do.  What's the problem with the shirt that you've described as MRND party colours, green and yellow, what you are saying about that, is that right or wrong?  
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	Well, can you help us, what are you saying he was wearing that day? 
A.	After reading through my statement and noting that mistake on his attire, I went on to explain, if my recollection is correct, that my recollection of his attire was as follows:  he was wearing a yellow shirt and a black pair of trousers. 
Q.	So what party colours is the yellow shirt?  Which party would that be? 
A.	No question was put to me about a political party.  You can read my statement for yourself.  I was asked to describe his attire, but I wasn't asked to say whether he belonged to any political party or not. 
Q.	You see, isn't the point here this:  That you dressed the man you said was André Rwamakuba in MRND party colours.  It was only later that you realised that he wasn't a member of that party; that's the point, isn't it? 
A.	No.  Nobody gave me that information.  And, by the way, I am not the one who dressed him up. 
Q.	So, you can deal with this fairly, let me just read it again.  In your statement it reads:  "The person my husband told me was Rwamakuba was wearing a pair of trousers and a shirt with the MRND party colours, that is green and yellow.  He was wearing a cap in the same colours with a hoe and a pruning knife called Urunana."  How did all that get in your statement unless you said it? 
A.	The issue is not his attire.  You see, even the MRND or MDR party members could wear colours of other parties as well because they had all become one and the same thing.  So I didn't change anything significant in my statement.  It is just that I noticed that there was a small mistake that was made by the investigators and I pointed that out. 
Q.	I ask you again:  Was he wearing MRND colours, and did you tell the investigators he was? 
A.	It is the cap he was wearing that had the MRND colours. 
Q.	So he was wearing a green and yellow cap.  Is that your evidence now? 
A.	One could see the insignia or the emblem of the MRND on the cap. 
Q.	And how far away were you from him? 
A.	Not too far away from him.  I think I have already provided the distance already yesterday, and I will repeat the answer I gave yesterday.  I was some 30 to 50 metres away.  So you can see that it is not such a great distance. 
Q.	You told us yesterday you were 40 to 50 metres away.  Is that close enough to see a little hoe and a symbol on a hat?  Were you close enough to see that? 
A.	Well, since you are versed in matters of investigation, you may want to try it yourself and you can ask someone to wear a cap or wear it yourself and you would see for yourself that I could -- I would be able to identify those aspects from that distance. 
Q.	But you put this cap on the man's head on that day in the centre.  And just so we are clear, the Urunana, the pruning knife and the hoe, those are MRND political symbols, are they not, they are the party symbols for the MRND, do you agree? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you.  But, Counsel, would you allow me put a question to you?  
Q.	I'd rather you don't. 
A.	No problem. 
Q.	Right.  I'm not being rude, but there it is.  Now, you see, I suggest you dressed, the man you falsely say is André Rwamakuba, up in MRND colours and then later on, some years later, you learnt you'd made a mistake, he couldn't be in MRND colours because he's an MDR man and their colours are black and red, aren't they, so you changed your evidence.  Having dressed him in colours, you had to undress him.  So let's see how well you do it.  Just bear with me for the next few minutes.  

You didn't change that detail in March -- when you had the opportunity -- of '02.  You didn't alter that detail on the 27th of May '03 when again you had an opportunity and when you confirm everything in your statement was correct, except for little points you changed which we'll come to.  You didn't change that evidence on the 13th of February '04, and you had another opportunity and made further corrections to your statement.  You don't change it until the 23rd of April last year when you start altering your statement radically.  And what you say then is this -- the document I got is this:  "GIN will testify that when she saw the Accused for the first time in April 1994, he was wearing black trousers, yellow shirt and a white cap."  Today you've forgotten about the white cap, you've left the MRND cap on his head.  You've forgotten your lines again, haven't you?  Where has the white cap gone?  Well, where has the white cap gone, may I ask? 
A.	You may want to look for this cap -- the same cap and if you were to acquire one for yourself you would realise that it is a white cap bearing the emblem we have just referred to -- the emblem you have just referred to. 
Q.	I should have finished it because it carries on:  "And not dressed in MRND colours, as described in her statement."  Would it be fair to say that you are a lady who gives different answers on different occasions; would that be fair? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  You say that I am someone who gives different answers on different occasions?  Well, I can say the same of you.  You say varying things on important matters, and you even contradict yourself.  I can give you an example if you want. 
Q.	Well, we all do.  But in your position, you see, you have to be fairly reliable.  Do you remember on the 17th of April -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, are you start on a new issue? 
MR. HOOPER: 
It's just one question.  I hope it's one question.  Excuse me.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	************** 2001, when you were giving evidence in the Kamuhanda case and when perhaps your attention and focus wasn't so much on André Rwamakuba, you were asked this question or questions, page 122 of the transcript of the *********: "Do you know a man called Dr. André Rwamakuba?  Answer:  "Yes."  "How do you know Dr. Rwamakuba?  Answer:  "The first time that I saw him, it was in front of our house."  "And when was that?"  "This was in 1994."  "In what month?"  "The month of April."  

I don't think you've got an answer to that though, have you, or have you? 
A.	Why do you think I don't have an answer?  I do have an explanation that I can provide. 
Q.	Please give it.  
A.	I was asked in court where I saw him during the war, and we were talking about the wartime and not about anything else or any other location.  
Q.	Well, that's not quite right, is it? 
A.	It is true.  That is the truth.  That is the truth as I know it, maybe it is not the truth as you know it.  
Q.	All right.  Well, I don't want to take up too much time, but I'm just going to read the previous page to you or some of it:  "Did you then" --  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, could we read the question that was put to the witness at that time when they talked about the first time she saw him and what time frame?  I'm referring the question of the ************* 1994 (sic).  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I don't know how helpful that is.  I have read the question but I will read now.  I have read the question.  I'm dealing, I hope, with this matter fairly and squarely.  I will, in fact, go back to the previous page to see the kind of context that these questions are being put.  
Mr. President, that's probably a few minutes.  Shall I do that now or is it inconvenient?  I know you have other matters.  Shall I do that after the luncheon adjournment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think, yeah, this is going to drag on?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we should do that, take the adjournment now.  

Madam Witness, I'll just remind you as I did yesterday, that you are still on -- giving evidence, even during the adjournment, and you should not discuss the case with anybody during this or any other adjournment.  
THE WITNESS: 
I have understood, Mr. President.  
(Court recessed at 1235H) 
(Pages 23 to 35 by Gifty C. Harding)






















(Court resumed at 1415H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.

Madam Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you, Mr. President, but not very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That may have been my fault.  Is it better now?  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you but there is some background noise in my headset. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that better?  
THE WITNESS:
 Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, your evidence will continue this afternoon and you are still on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you started your evidence yesterday.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, can I move to have the GIN tick list moved into evidence, if that is an appropriate phrase?  Can I have that admitted, Mr. Registrar?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted into evidence. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Next Defence exhibit number, Mr. Fry, please. 
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, D. 30.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
D. 30.  This has to be under seal -- and under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 30 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	If I can take up from where we left before the luncheon adjournment, I was about to read, and put in context the question that you were asked about your knowing -- if you knew Rwamakuba in the Kamuhanda case.  And the extract that I am reading is from the transcript for the *************** 2001 in the case of Kamuhanda, at page 121, starting at the 5th line of that page: 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I just check for a moment, is the English channel on channel 1? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it is.  I'm on channel 1. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Just a bit more noise in it than it was this morning, that is the problem.  It is working.  Thank you, very much. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So let me just read please, slowly, for the interpreters, who don't have this transcript in front of them, I apologise for that: 

"Did you then know a man called Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda?  Yes I knew him.  How did you know    Mr. Kamuhanda?  ************************************************************************************.  In addition, (By order of the Court this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal) "How long at that stage had you known Mr. Kamuhanda?  For three years.  How well did you know Mr. Kamuhanda?  I knew him well.  Did you spend much time with him in the three years that you knew him before April of 1994?  *****************************************************************************.  Had you spent any other time with him apart from that?" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, Counsel, the French interpreter says you should take it easy, you are going to fast. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, as you had indicated, the interpreters do not have a copy of the document. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Just give me one document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are reading too fast. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Give me just a moment.

I'm sorry, I don't have the French for this day.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please give the English if you have it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, are you reading from the transcript of a closed session?  

MR. HOOPER: 
It is not indicated as being a closed session, and normally it would have it on it.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I can provide the information.  Yes, it is a closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that was the impression that I also had that it was from a closed session.  That raises a question; can you read it in an open session?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, can I just review what it is that I am looking at here?  And it is not very long.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was already, I think, protected information concerning the relationship of the witness's husband to a named individual. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is information which has to be struck from the record and kept under seal. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I also mention that for the members of the public gallery, this is confidential information.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I see looking at it that there are no other confidential matters referred to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	"Had you spent any other time with him apart from that?  No, there was no other occasion.  Would you recognise Mr. Kamuhanda now?  Yes, I would recognise him.  Is he in this courtroom?  He is present in this room.  Would you please point out Mr. Kamuhanda to the Court?  He is sitting on the second row, and is the second person in this row.  Do you know a man called Rwamakuba?  Yes."  
MR. HOOPER: 
I will just go back a couple of lines and slow up.  I'm sorry, Mr. Interpreter.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	"Is he" -- I'm talking of Kamuhanda now, going back a few lines.  "Would you recognise Mr. Kamuhanda now?  Yes, I would recognise him.  Is he in this courtroom?  He is present in this room.  Would you please point out Mr. Kamuhanda to this Court?  He is sitting on the second row, and is the second person in this row.  Do you know a man called Rwamakuba?  Yes.  How do you know"--  

MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt Mr. Hooper, but I would like to point out that if he is reading a transcript he should read it as it is, because when he says Rwamakuba, we know that in Rwanda there are many people of that name.  But in this text, both in the French and in the English, it is Rwamakuba, Dr. Rwamakuba is what is indicated.  So, if he is going to read the transcripts, then he should read them as they are.  I think that is important, at least, for us. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I think I am reading this word for word, whether it is being translated word for word, I don't know.  Let me go back and repeat what I have just read.  "Would you please point out Mr. Kamuhanda to this Court?  He is sitting on the second row, and is the second person in this row.  Do you know a man called Dr. Rwamakuba?  Yes.  How do you know Dr. Rwamakuba?  The first time that I saw him, it was in front of our house.  And when was that?  This was in 1994.  In what month?  The month of April.  All right.  Did you ever see Dr. Rwamakuba with Mr. Kamuhanda?  No."
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.		So, there is no context of -- a particular context, Madam Witness, of the war or the rest of it.  And the sequence of questions are very similar, so let me just repeat them: "Question:  Did you then know a man called Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda?  Yes, I knew him."  When you were asked about Rwamakuba you were asked; "Do you know a man called Dr. Rwamakuba?  Yes."  When you were asked about Kamuhanda the question was; "How did you know Mr. Kamuhanda?"  And you go on to say, "We used to live in the same area" et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you give details.  

Exactly the same question is asked about Rwamakuba.  "Do you know a man called Rwamakuba?  Yes."  Here is the same question.  "How do you know Dr. Rwamakuba?"  And your answer is nothing about weddings, nothing about visits to houses.  "The first time that I saw him it was in front of our house, April 1994." 

And so would you agree, Madam Witness, that your evidence of the ************* 2001 in respect of Rwamakuba is remarkably different to your evidence about him today?  
A.	No, I don't agree with you because I don't see the difference. 
Q.	Did you know that André Rwamakuba was a minister in the government when he came to Gikomero in April 1994? 
A.	It is you who told me that.  I didn't know that before. 
Q.	And so nobody in Gikomero on either of the occasions when you saw him, on none of the occasions when you discussed him with your husband or other people, no one ever made mention that he was a minister in the government.  Is that right? 
A.	When I saw him, I did not ask anyone for this information, and no one gave it to me. 
Q.	Because it would have been exceptional, wouldn't it, for a minister of the government to visit a place as small and as relatively out of the way as Gikomero secteur?  It would be exceptional, wouldn't it? 
A.	There is nothing exceptional about that.  A minister may go where he wishes; even he could go where he wanted. 
Q.	When was the last minister that you can remember -- when did the last minister come to Gikomero secteur before April of 1994? 
A.	I didn't understand your question.  Would you be so kind as to repeat it for me, please?  
Q.	Can you remember any other minister visiting Gikomero secteur before April 1994? 
A.	No, I wasn't interested in that. 
Q.	When were the many times you saw Rwamakuba driving his car? 
A.	The first time was in Nyamirambo and he was driving his vehicle.  Then I saw him again in Gikomero, twice, driving his vehicle. 
Q.	You see, your statement refers to, "I know him for I saw him driving his car many times.  The last time I saw him I was able to see him closely and that was on the 12th of April," you say in your statement.  So it suggests that you had seen him driving his car many times before that.  But that is not the position you are saying now; is that right? 
A.	I have told you that I saw him on several occasions and that the last time was in Gikomero. 
Q.	Now, I would like to come, if we may, to the question of what date it was that you saw him the first time in Gikomero.  And the second of the date matters that I want to deal with this afternoon now, is the date of the school killings, the massacre at the school.  And perhaps it might be best and easiest if we start with the question of the date of the massacre at the school, to see if we can, between us, come to an agreement about that straight-forward issue, and in that way anchor ourselves with a certain and specific date.  Now, your date today as to when there were killings at the school is not a certain one, is it, it is between two dates?  In your evidence yesterday, you said you thought the school killings occurred between the 8th and the 12th of April.  Is that still your position?  
A.	I believe that you have the statement which contains that information.  But I think also that in that statement I said that I wasn't quite sure about the dates.  I only provided an estimate. 
Q.	The Kamuhanda case that was heard here, and concluded here in 2001 -- and concluded in 2003 with judgement, dealt almost exclusively with the massacre at the Protestant school in Gikomero.  In that case, the Prosecution case was that the Gikomero school massacre occurred in the early afternoon of the 12th of April.  In the judgement, which -- I hold part of the judgement in my hand now -- at paragraph 296, it reads that in its closing brief, the Defence submits that it does not dispute that there were massacres on the 12th of April '94 at the parish of Gikomero.

The Chamber found that the witness's testimony in that case corroborates the evidence of other witnesses with regard to the sequence of events at Gikomero parish compound on the                      12th of April 1994.  And at paragraph 466, the Chamber declared its finding that the Accused Kamuhanda arrived in a vehicle there on the afternoon of the 12th of April.  At paragraph 468, the Chamber recalls the testimony of the Defence witnesses of the 12th of April 1994.  The Chamber stated it further recalls that most of these witnesses testified that the attack of the 12th of April 1994 on the Gikomero parish compound began between 1:00 in the afternoon and 2 o'clock in the afternoon; and it was the Prosecution case that that was so.  About 34 witnesses testified in that case that that was so.

And for my part, I do not dispute the fact that the massacre of people, mainly Tutsis at the Gikomero Protestant parish occurred on the afternoon of the 12th of April.  So given all of that, Madam Witness, would you agree, and be content to accept, even though your own memory may not be -- now so many years afterwards -- as clear that, indeed, it was the afternoon of the 12th of April that the Gikomero Protestant parish massacre took place.  Would you be content to accept that?  
A.	If I were going to agree with that it would be because you say so.  Now, as far as I am concerned, when I testify I refer to the dates which come to mind.  And I did refer to the dates which I was able to recall.  So, do not insist on the time and dates of the killings as such.  What matters is that there was a massacre.  And I indicated those who were the perpetrators and at the origin of that massacre.  In fact, I do not quite remember the date and the time. 
Q.	I appreciate that, Madam Witness, but in order that we can move forward, would you be content to accept, given all that I have said and that the Chamber itself indicated and had as its finding that it was, indeed, the 12th of April that the massacre took place.  Would you be happy to proceed this afternoon on that basis, that it was, indeed, the 12th when that occurred?  
A.	Do you want me to confirm that this massacre took place in the afternoon?  Well, that would be for your own specific reasons if I were going to endorse your suggestion, and if I did so, I would be playing right into your game.  I simply stand by what I have said.  

And if those persons whom you have cited -- or have quoted are comfortable with that date and that time, well it is probably because they did conduct some investigations before coming to such a conclusion.  However, I stand by the date and the time which my memory allows me to recollect.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, just so that we are all assisted as best as we can, can I call on the Prosecutor to concede that it was the afternoon of the 12th of April that the Gikomero Protestant school massacre occurred.  And I invite the Prosecution to make that admission in this case. 
MS. FALL: 
Are you asking me to testify, Counsel Hooper?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. President, I'm inviting the Prosecution to save us all a lot of time and trouble by making an admission  consistent with that Chamber's finding, and with the Prosecution's own case in the case of Kamuhanda before this Tribunal. 

MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I agree that at the level of the Kamuhanda judgement, the date of 12th April was mentioned.  But I believe that the witness did say that the date was between the 10th and the 14th.  Therefore, I would wonder whether the 12th doesn't fall within that time frame of 10th to the 14th. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I take that as a no.  I'm asking -- inviting the Prosecution, again, to save us all a lot of time and trouble and to agree as an admission that it was the 12th of April that the massacre at the Gikomero school took place, consistent with their case in Kamuhanda, consistent with the judgement of the Chamber having heard all Protestant -- all their Prosecution witnesses, are the Prosecution disputing the fact that it was the 12th? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, your request has been noted; the Prosecutor's answer has been noted.  This is not a subject matter on which I feel I can make an order.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, let me just renew my request through you, Mr. President, to the Prosecution.  Are they disputing in this case that the massacre took place on a day other than the 12th of April?  And this is not a game.  It is a serious and significant feature of this case.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, it would seem to me that Counsel Hooper repeats matters over and over again.  He puts this question, and I answered, I said I was not challenging that date of the 12th.  But I also said that the witness answered that she was able to recall a time frame running from the 10th to the 14th.  And if we count from the 10th, the 11, 12th, 13th and 14th, the date of the 12th would be found right within that time frame.  I don't believe I have to answer that question any more, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  I merely made my invitation in what I hope was a spirit of active cooperation, and what I hope was to invite the Prosecution to assume a sensible position in what I thought was an uncontested fact. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, at present we are left with your answer that you really don't know exactly when the massacre took place.  It was within a span of about four days.  Can I take you to your statement, which was made at a time when your memory, of course, was so much fresher than it is today, seven years after you made this statement and 11 years after these terrible events.  In your statement in the second paragraph you describe the arrival of André Rwamakuba in the centre.  This happened on the 12th of April 1994, between 10 a.m. and 12 noon.  Do you accept the accuracy of that statement? 
A.	You have referred to a date and to a time frame, but you didn't say what happened.  What would you want me to agree to, Counsel?  
Q.	Do you accept that when you made your statement, and you stated that you saw André Rwamakuba on the 12th of April arriving at Gikomero secteur between 10:00 in the morning and 12 noon, do you accept that at the time you made that statement to the investigators and signed this statement, it was your honest recollection that that, indeed, was the time and date that you saw André Rwamakuba? 
A.	No.  I believe that in another statement, which you read, I asked for corrections to be made to my first statement.  So I believe that you would find that answer in that correction with respect to what you are asking me. 
Q.	So, what is your position on this date that is recorded in your signed statement?  Is it your position that at the time you made the statement you didn't say that to the investigators, or is it your evidence that with later recollection you decided that the gate -- the date that you gave them was wrong; which was it? 
A.	I believe you have already put a similar question to me over and over.  And I did concede to you that at the time of my statement, what I had said about Kamuhanda and Rwamakuba were taken down at the same time.  And the investigator, subsequently, decided to separate the two statements.  So I spoke about what I knew concerning Kamuhanda, and also what I knew about Rwamakuba.  I noticed that a mistake had been made on the date and I asked for a correction to be made.  
Q.	And so, as I understand your evidence, you are saying the date that appears in your statement for seeing Rwamakuba, the 12th of April, between 12 - 10:00 and 12 noon, that that was a mistake by the investigators; is that right? 
A.	I have provided a very clear explanation for replacing this date with another.  I do not quite understand your questions, and I don't know what you are driving at, Counsel.  The dates that I have mentioned are contained in my statement.  I can repeat the date, if you want me to, but I don't know what it is that you actually want me to do, Counsel. 
Q.	What I am seeking to focus on now is to establish the date on which the Gikomero school massacres occurred.  Now, in your statement, as we can see, and as you can concede, you appear to say, quite clearly, that André Rwamakuba came on the 12th, between 10:00 in the morning and 12:00.  And I want to take you now to a later part of your statement where having described what Rwamakuba got up to in the centre with the two young people and the young man on the motor bike, you say this: "After these incidents, Rwamakuba told the people they had just started the killings and that it was a good start.  I did not see Rwamakuba again, but the massacres intensified.  After André Rwamakuba left for Kigali, the Interahamwe militia and elements of the Presidential Guard arrived in the afternoon.  With the help of the population, they started killing the refugees.  More than 4,000 people were killed at the Gikomero Protestant school complex ************************."  

So after André Rwamakuba left, on a day that you have previously said was the 12th, you say the Interahamwe militia and elements of the Presidential Guard arrived, and with the help of the population, killed the refugees at the Gikomero Protestant school complex.  Is that correct? 
A.	I would like to remind you that when I gave that statement I was an adult, I was not a minor.  And I couldn't accuse André Rwamakuba of the same things as the other.  And I believe that it is the investigators who made a mistake.  Let me recall that I did correct my statement, and you are in possession of that document.  I am not accusing Rwamakuba of having taken part in the killings at the school.  I have accused him of the killings in Kayanga and at the centre, at the Gikomero centre.  
Q.	You see, there is a great consistency here, within your statement, that André Rwamakuba arrives on the 12th of April, between 10 and 12; that he does certain things; that he leaves; and then later, the same afternoon, Interahamwe, Presidential Guards, local people, committed the massacre at the school.  In which case, the massacre at the school would, indeed, be on the 12th.  And that is exactly the day which everyone has always said it was, and even you say it was in your statement.  So why are you changing your evidence in respect of the date of the massacre or, at least, being very less specific now than you were when you made this statement four years after the events; why the change?  
A.	You say that four years after the events on that day I told the truth, but you are saying that simply because you want to stand on that in defence of your client.  You have the minutes of my testimony in the Kamuhanda case.  You also have statements which I made and which I corrected, subsequently, in respect of Rwamakuba.  I have not changed my version of the facts, and I am here before the Court to explain my statement. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I believe that a short while ago Counsel Hooper asked me to assist him.  And maybe in order to avoid this lengthy debate on dates, maybe we can say that in respect of the killings at the school on the date provided by the witness, we can -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, Counsel went too fast and we didn't get the references to the dates. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreters didn't quite pick up everything, so if you could just -- they didn't pick up the references to the dates. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I was saying that even before her statement -- the transcripts in Kamuhanda would show that she made a statement on ***************** 2001.  Page 16, in French, the question was put to her about dates and she provided an answer.  At the hearing of ***************** 2001, in Kamuhanda, page 208, line 1, the witness also confirmed that answer.  And I believe that we could refer to those transcripts as well.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry, I didn't quite get the point.  Perhaps in re-examination that would be a matter that is more appropriately done now.  I wasn't sure what was being said, is it being conceded and agreed that it was the 12th?  I don't know -- was that the object?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, with your leave I can read the witness's answer to the question concerning the date that was put to her at the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think that would be appropriate.  
Mr. Hooper, what I understood was that counsel was giving you a reference. 
MR. HOOPER: 
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- in the witness's testimony in Kamuhanda where she made a confirmation statement about a date of that massacre at the Protestant school.  So she was giving you a reference to the transcript which may have assisted in establishing confirmation.  I think that is what happened. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry, I missed the page number.  Could you give me the page number, please?
MS. FALL: 
There are two documents; the first, the transcript of the ****************** 2001, page 16 in the French version.  And the second reference is transcript of the *************************** 2001, page 208, French version still.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  I think that was a matter for re-examination, it doesn't appear appropriate at this stage.  In the transcript of the ****************** the witness said that "The killings commenced between the 10th and the 14th at the primary school."  And in that -- that is the *********************************quote, at page 16 she said; "Between the 10th and the 13th."   

I'm not disputing that this witness has given many and various dates.  What I am putting to this witness is that she has changed her story.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In your evidence of the ************** 2001, at page 137 in the English transcript, you were asked this question: "Are you able to say" -- in respect to the massacres -- "when they started in Gikomero?"  Before I read the answer to you, can I have your answer today?  When do you say the massacres started in Gikomero?  
A.	Massacres began between the 10th and the 14th. 
Q.	The answer you gave on the 17th of April was consistent with that, but more specific.  Your answer was, "In Gikomero, the massacres started on the 12th."  Question:  "Of what month?"  Answer:  "April." 

So in ******* 2001 when asked about this, you were able to be specific that it was the 12th.  Can I ask you this: was the first killing or killings that was done in Gikomero secteur, were those the killings at the Protestant school? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So when the question is put to you, "Are you able to say when the massacres started in Gikomero?"  And your answer is "In Gikomero, the massacres started on the 12th of April,"  that would be a reference to the killings at the Gikomero school; is that correct? 
A.	I said that this happened between the 10th and the 14th, and I was referring to that massacre. 
Q.	The massacre at the Protestant school was the most terrible event that happened in your locality; is that right? 
A.	Do you wish to refer to the commune or the secteur as a whole?  I don't understand what you mean when you refer to margin or region. 
Q.	Well, let's split it up into two then.  First of all, would you agree that it was the most terrible, single event, in terms of killing, to occur in your secteur?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you agree it was the single most terrible event to occur in your commune, given the numbers that you tell us were killed there of 4,000 or so?  
A.	No. 
Q.	There was no greater killing ground than at the Protestant school, was there, at Gikomero commune?.  It was the largest of the massacres, was it not? 
A.	I have just answered your question.  I agree with your assertion regarding the secteur.  But not insofar as the commune is concerned, that is not where they had the most deaths in the commune. 
Q.	Well, where else you say there were greater deaths than at the Gikomero Protestant School? 
A.	In Gishyaka in the courtyard of the commune office, it seems that there were more deaths. 
Q.	I suggest that the deaths at the Gishyaka area of your commune amounted to several hundreds, it didn't reach 1,000.  That is right, isn't it? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Well, in any event, the Protestant school killings were a massive and terrible event, weren't they? 
A.	What else can be said about what happened?  We are referring to the place where over 4,000 people were massacred.  These were innocent people.  It cannot be described differently. 
Q.	We have a plan of Gikomero centre, our sketch B, at page 11.  And the site of this parish -- the site of this parish is, indeed, *****************************************.  That is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you have told us that before the killings at the parish there had been no other killing in Gikomero secteur.  That is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Where did you get that from?  That is not it.  
Q.	Well, you just gave that answer 12 questions ago.  Well, what do you say the position is? 
A.	You asked me where there were the most deaths in the secteur, and I told you that it was in the school.  However, I never said that that was the only place where deaths occurred. 
Q.	Well, maybe that got lost in translation.  I will put the question again to you.  In Gikomero secteur, before the killings took place at the school, there had been no other killings in your secteur.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	I answered that already.  I said that there were -- there had not been other killings before the massacre at the school. 
Q.	So, I'm going to continue to ask you questions against a background that it was, indeed, the 12th of April that the Gikomero school massacre took place.  That is my anchor date and you are uncertain about it, but that is the basis of my questioning.  When, in relation to the Protestant school, did you see André Rwamakuba in your current evidence?  I have asked you this before, but if you can tell me again, please.
A.	I have already told you that I saw them after the massacre at the school and not before the massacre.  
(Pages 36 to 47 by Donna M. Lewis)




























1515H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And I think you told us it was between two and five days after the school killings that you first saw him; is that right?  
A.	Yes, but it was an estimate.  
Q.	Well, do you want to give a different estimate or does two to five days remain your estimate?  
A.	I don't know what you are driving at.  I saw Rwamakuba after the school massacre.  As to the dates, one might make a mistake about dates.  I do not want the spotlight to focus on a single date; just know that it was some days after that massacre.  
Q.	And so as your best your recollection serves you, it wouldn't be a day after, would it?  
A.	Counsel, don't insist on the day.  I am telling you what I am saying based on what I remember.  You can't force me to remember things.  
Q.	Well, you have told us that it was two to five days afterwards.  So isn't it reasonable from that answer for me to say, well, Madam Witness, you are not suggesting it was the day after the massacre, for example.  What is wrong with that?  Do you want to change your estimate and say it was within one and five days?  It's your evidence we want to hear.  We just want to be as clear as we can what you are saying.  So what are you saying?  
A.	You want me to make it easy for you by agreeing with you, and giving up my own version of the facts?  
Q.	Just your evidence, please, and answer as clear as you can give.  
A.	I agree with you.  
Q.	Don't just agree with me to please me.  Are you changing your position from two to five days to one of one to five days?  
A.	No, you are saying that I am saying something I didn't say.  
Q.	Let me move on.  Can I come back to your statement?  You say now in evidence that Rwamakuba came after the Gikomero school terrible massacre.  In your statement you say of Rwamakuba; "At that time the killings had not started in our commune;" is that right or is that wrong?  
A.	Before I answer your question, do you accept -- do you accept all the statements that you have from me?  
Q.	I think I have made my position clear.  I believe you have changed your story to fit the facts as best as you can.  So I don't accept your account.  I am asking you about your statement:  "At that time, the killings had not started in our commune, that time being the arrival of Rwamakuba.  That is plainly not right, according to your evidence, is it?  So why is it in your statement? 
A.	I don't think we are making any progress here, if we dwell on this matter.  I have told you that when I made that statement, I talked about Rwamakuba and Kamuhanda at the same time and that a statement was brought back to me for signature after the Rwamakuba and Kamuhanda statements were separated, so I made corrections.  

I would like the Judges to point out to me the errors or contradictions that I made while indicating the answers that I gave when questions were put to me.  That is my answer.  
Q.	Well, the Judges don't have that function; that is my job and I am trying to do it with you.  
A.	I have given you an answer.  I have answered your questions, but you don't want my answers.  What is the problem?  
Q.	Well, I don't think you have answered my questions, but I am going to ask you another one any way.  The next sentence reads like this:  "I am sure it was in an attempt to give a green light that Rwamakuba came."  Let me read those two sentences together for you again.  "At that time, at the time Rwamakuba came, the killings had not started in our commune.  I am sure it was in an attempt to give a green light that Rwamakuba came."  Now, you tell us there were 4,000 dead lying 200 yards from that centre.  So what green light is it that André Rwamakuba is coming to give?  
A.	Let me tell you something.  I don't know whether Kamuhanda came to an understanding with Rwamakuba before coming.  Everyone went where they wished to launch the massacres.  That is what I wanted to explain to you.  
Q.	You described about how you followed all that was said and done by Rwamakuba at the door, so you were able to hear what was being said and see the things that you have described, and you say this:  "Rwamakuba came to sensitise people so that they could start the massacres.  After assembling some people upon arrival, he asked them why they hadn't started killing.  In fact, he said, "There are police and military reservists here who can help you.  Do you need any help?  Do you need anything else?  What is stopping you from starting the killings?"  How does that fit it with your evidence of all those dead, a stone's throw from where you lived?  How does that fit in with that?  
A.	What you have just read is in connection with what happened at the trading centre, not with what happened at the school.  Regarding the school massacre, I am accusing Kamuhanda for being responsible for it, not Rwamakuba.  Today, I am telling the Trial Chamber what Rwamakuba did at the trading centre, not at the school.  Rwamakuba did his work.  When he said what he said, he was well aware that he was doing his work.  
Q.	After the incident with the young men, your statement goes on to say this:  "After these incidents, Rwamakuba told the people, they had started the killings and that it was a good start; is that right?  Is that what he said? 
A.	Yes, he said that because these people had just done what he had ordered them to do.  
Q.	You told us yesterday that the bodies -- there were bodies everywhere, on the road, not just at the Gikomero school.  Wouldn't it have been obvious to André Rwamakuba that there had been a terrible massacre at that place?  How does your evidence fit in with that?  
A.	I would like to say that in regard to Kamuhanda and the alleged massacre at the school, you know the distance between the school and the centre, we are talking about a couple of 100 metres and Rwamakuba was 40 or 50 metres away from me.  The school is not near the road or the centre where Rwamakuba came.  The bodies were at the school not at the centre where Rwamakuba and the others came.  
Q.	So your explanation to explain your current evidence with the massacre already having taken place before Rwamakuba comes, is presumably that André Rwamakuba came to your secteur, addressed the people there and he didn't know that there had been this massive massacre 200 yards away, in that little country spot, is that your evidence?  
A.	I did not talk with Rwamakuba, so I could not have known whether or not he knew that a massacre had already occurred at the school.  Moreover, I told you that I did not know whether Rwamakuba had taken the school road, but he did, indeed, say what he said in front of the inhabitants who had massacred the people that we saw.  He said this before he left.  He knew fully well the objective that he sought when he said these words.  
Q.	Well, the people who were there, Nyarwaya, Rubanguka and various other people who participated in the killings at the school, you are telling me André Rwamakuba, then minister of the government, comes to that place and says those things and no one puts him in the picture, nobody says, well, minister, we have got 4,000 dead people around the corner, so what you say isn't quite right.  We are fulfilling our quota; we are killing people.  We have started the killing.  Are you suggesting that none of that in all common sense, was not said if your evidence is correct?  
A.	I don't agree with you.  I told you I didn't speak with Rwamakuba, first.  Second, whether or not they told him that the massacres had begun or not, or whether it was Rwamakuba or Kamuhanda, it was as if they were in competition in participating in the massacres.  In a way, it was a sort of race, everyone wanted to prove that he had taken part in the massacres.  
Q.	That's your answer, is it?  All right.  Let me move on, because your next sentence reads in this way:  "I didn't see Rwamakuba again, but the massacres intensified."  How does that fit in with 4,000 dead people 200 yards away?  
A.	You are focussing on the 4,000 dead that were 200 metres away.  I don't see the link with Rwamakuba, however.  I have told you that actually this statement says in the end, towards the end, that that is what I remembered and that if anything else came to mind, I would tell the investigators about it afterwards.  That is what I said.  
Q.	Your statement reads:  I didn't see Rwamakuba again, but the massacres intensified.  After Rwamakuba left Kigali, the Interahamwe militia and elements of the Presidential Guard arrived in the afternoon, and with the help of the population, they started killing the refugees.  More than 4,000 people were killed at the Gikomero Protestant school ***************************************.  Isn't it as plain as day, that you are telling the investigators that André Rwamakuba came before the killing at the school?  
A.	No, just for a moment, forget about the school massacre, will you?  And don't mention it in connection with the Rwamakuba trial.  I have changed my version of facts, okay.  Now, put questions to me regarding the massacre or massacres in which -- in connection with which I mention Rwamakuba, then we can come to an understanding.  However, if you insist on putting questions to me concerning Rwamakuba in relation to facts that concern Kamuhanda, then I am sorry, we can't come to agreement.  
Q.	But your stories don't add up, I suggest.  But let me ask you this:  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to take a short break now for 15 minutes and the session will resume thereafter.  
(Court recessed from 1537H to 1600H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, you can resume.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, after the Gikomero school massacre, when did the killings at the centre -- the trade centre start?  
A.	I believe I have already provided the approximate date, and I am sure you haven't forgotten them.  However, I will repeat.  I told you that it was between two to four days and that would be what I think, without any further specification.  
Q.	And that was as a result of Rwamakuba's appearance; is that correct?  
A.	What did you say follow Rwamakuba's arrival?  Well, I talked about the time when Rwamakuba arrived, but there is a distinction to be made between the time Rwamakuba arrived and the massacres that took place at the school.  
Q.	Just please listen to the question.  My first question was, when did the massacres at the centre start in relation to the massacres at the school, and you have answered that and you've said my estimate is two to four days after the massacres at the school, the massacres at the centre started.  That is what I understood you just said; is that correct, or you want to say something else?  
A.	That is what I said and have nothing else to add.  
Q.	And as I understand your evidence the massacres in the centre started following André Rwamakuba's arrival; is that right?  
A.	Where do you get that from Counsel?  When I talked about the killings in Ruhango, I am also talking about Rwamakuba's arrival.  The massacres took place, then Rwamakuba arrived later on.  So we need to distinguish between the Kurubango massacres and the massacres that took place at the school.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you are an intelligent woman.  Now, you do your best please this afternoon to help this Tribunal understand your evidence.  My question is, following on your answer that the massacres at the centre didn't start until two or four days after the massacres at the school, and I am asking you what triggered the massacres at the centre?  What started them, and I understood your evidence over several hours now, to be that it was Rwamakuba who started off the killings in the centre.  Have I understood you correctly or not?  
A.	You have understood me very well, because I said that it was Rwamakuba who ordered members of the population of that centre to kill people.  
Q.	Thank you.  So the first massacres in the centre were after the arrival of Rwamakuba; is that correct?  
A.	Even at this time that I am talking to you I can say that people were killed in the presence of Rwamakuba and he is the one who gave those orders for them to kill.  So I don't know what you are looking for, I have already given you this answer several times over. 
Q.	Can you answer the question, please.  I will repeat it once more.  The massacre in the trade centre started -- I say massacres -- the killings in the trade centre started after Rwamakuba's arrival; is that correct?  
A.	This is the answer I have given you, and I will repeat the answer again.  At the Gikomero trading centre, three persons were killed.  The certificates of two of the victims were destroyed.  The third person who came on a motorbike was also killed upon the orders of Rwamakuba and in his presence.  
Q.	And was that the start of the killings at the trade centre, yes or no?  
A.	When you talk about the starting or the beginning of the killings, what are you referring to, Counsel, I do not quite understand you.  Are you referring to the killings at the trading centre or in the entire secteur, I am not quite sure that I follow you very well.  What is indeed your question?  
Q.	Are you trying to answer my questions?  Are you really doing your best to answer my questions?  Let me put it again to you.  These killings at the school -- your evidence now is that that was nothing to do with Rwamakuba.  Your evidence now is that two to five days after the killings at the school Rwamakuba arrived and people -- the three people you have told us about were killed in his presence at the trade centre.  I have got all that right so far, have I not?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I am sorry, but I think we should refer to the transcript to determine whether the witness said that it was after the killings at the centre that Rwamakuba arrived.  I think the question has been put to her several times and she has answered, and maybe we need to refer to the transcripts.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Have I got it correct what you have said so far?  I will repeat it.  Killings at the school, not to do with Rwamakuba, two to five days later; Rwamakuba arrives, incites the people to kill; three people are killed.  And I am asking you, if that was the start of the killings in the trade centre, and you have told me, as I understand it, yes, it was, this was the start of the killings in the trade centre.  Have I got that right?  Have I understood your evidence properly?  
A.	You are mixing up things and repeating the same questions, so you cannot be satisfied with the answers that I give.  Now, let me remind you or let me recall that Rwamakuba ordered the killing of three persons.  Those persons were killed in his presence.  I have told you that Rwamakuba was not at the school.  I have told you what Rwamakuba said at the centre when he encouraged people to kill, and he said at the time that if they needed material, they should tell him so that he may provide the same.  That is how things unveiled or unfolded.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, before the three people were killed on the orders of Rwamakuba and in his presence, had anybody else been killed at the centre?  

THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not remember that anyone else was killed before those three persons were killed.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I go to your evidence in the case of Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda on the ****************** 2002, at page 139 in the English version.  Let me read out to you as fairly as possible and please listen with care as I am sure you will.  "Question:  Witness, you said that the killing started on 17th of April.  How do you know that the killings started on the 12th every April?  Answer:  The killings started at the school, there is a Protestant church, that's where the killers came and attacked those who sought refuge and we heard the gunfire."  "Question:  Did you actually see any of the killing take place or was it the firing that you heard from a distance?  Answer:  On that day, I wasn't witness to any killings, but the following days or the next day, yes."  

	You then say how you visited the site of the killings.  We touched on that yesterday.  

The president of the Chamber then intervened, and he said this:  "I just want to ask one or two questions in clarification.  The first question is:  She said that the killings started at the school and at the parish, that she didn't witness the actual killing at those places on the first day, but rather she personally witnessed the killing on the following day, is that the position?"  You said, "I was witness to the killings that occurred in the centre area *************, killings that occurred at the commercial centre **********************.  Judge Sekule:  That was on the next day, Witness:  Yes.  How did the witness -- how did she see them, can she explain?"  

Your answer is this:  "The commercial centre I am referring to can be ************************************************************************* and we could see the Interahamwe killing people  

Does she have any idea who was being killed, " asked the Judge?  And you said:  "Yes, I know them and you give a list of people who were killed."  
(Pages 48 to 53 by Sithembiso Moyo)






1615H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Later, in ************* of 2001, dealing with this, you're asked this question:  

"Did you at any time see people being actually killed or attacked in the village?"  And this is on page 9 of the **************, 2001.  I'll start again.  "Did you at any time see people being actually killed or attacked in the village?"  Your answer:  "Yes, I saw some people being taken to the centre where we lived for the purpose of killing them." 

"And how many days after the shooting at the school did you see that occur?"  "On that day, when they came back from the killings, they killed the survivors at the very place.  And even the next day and the following day, they continued to execute people at the trade centre where we lived." 

"Question:  "The people that you saw being killed at the trade area, how many people do you think approximately, did you see killed on those days?" 

"Question(sic):  "Well, on that day, when they came to begin the killings at the school, I would say that between 30 or 50 people were killed at the trade centre.  And among the people killed there were those that had been arrested on their way, and that were wounded and had just been finished up.  There were also people that were not wounded, but they were taken to that place and killed."  

Later you say, at page 21, on the same date, and in the same case:  "Well, the killings that took place at the commercial centre took several days, went on for several days.  But they started -- the killings started on the same day as the killings that took place at the school."

What's the truth?  Will you tell us, please, what the truth is? 
A.	When you began to read this document, you said that I said this or that.  Please keep the document with you.  Keep it in hand.  You said that one or several days after the massacre at the school, people were killed.  You will observe that I did not give the day.  
Q.	You most clearly gave the day as the day of the massacre itself, the day after that day, and the day after that day, and it continued.  
A.	You must read the first paragraph.  You must re-read it.  I said one or several days afterwards.  You have the document, you may continue to read it.  
Q.	I've read the relevant parts of that transcript into evidence.  It's there; it can be referred to.  I'm not going to waste my time doing it again.  You haven't told the same story twice, have you?  You change your story at will, from case to case and day to day and, it's forgetfulness, is it? 
A.	What you say is not correct.  You're allowing yourself to think for me.  If questions were put to me as you're putting them, you put one question to me ten times.  I think that the person who's going to read the transcript will think that I was actually changing my testimony, whereas it is because of you -- it is because you keep repeating questions.  And if I keep repeating questions like that -- my answers like that, then I might make a mistake.  
Q.	And, finally, on this element, given your answers in the Kamuhanda case to all those killings  -- 35 or 50 people, killings day by day in the trade centre, *****************************************, how does your evidence today that André Rwamakuba came to give the green light fit with any of that? 
A.	He came to start the massacres and raised the awareness.  The fact of coming to sensitise people to start massacres and the fact of coming to see or seeing people being killed is a different thing altogether.  Rwamakuba started to launch the massacres; people were killed in this place.  Where is the contradiction in that? 
Q.	Within two to five days of the Gikomero school massacre, the ground and earth of your trade centre must have been red with blood, given what you said in the Kamuhanda case.  That's right, isn't it, red with blood, given the numbers killed there? 
A.	Many people were killed at the school as well.  The assailants were intelligent.  They knew how to execute their victims.  The place was not drenched with blood.  In any case, whether there's blood or not, it changes nothing in my testimony.  I said that Rwamakuba came to launch the massacres at that place and blood is always the same colour, whether it is the victims of those who fell because of -- the victims who fell because of Rwamakuba or the victims who fell because of Kamuhanda.  Blood always has the same colour.  
Q.	You're a lady who has been deeply hurt by the loss of family in these killings, but has it led you to tell stories that are not accurate?
A.	Those members of my family who died were not killed at the centre.  And in my testimony, I have never referred to anyone -- any member of my family because I never -- I was not present when my -- the members of my family were being killed.  I am talking about the people who were killed and whose killing I witnessed.  
Q.	Now, just to go back to this matter.  When did you realise that the statement that had been written down by the investigators in 1998 was so different to what you wanted to say?  For example, that it said that André Rwamakuba had come before the school massacre.  When -- when did you first realise that that statement was so very different to what you remembered as happening? 
A.	You have the statements; you must have read them.  I no longer remember on what date I changed my statement.  All that depends on the date when the investigators came to see me, and I took advantage of their presence to change what needed to be changed.  You have the documents.  You can read the dates.  
Q.	Well, let's go through it, then.  First of all, though, what I suggest to you is this:  That when you first said that André Rwamakuba came on the 12th before the school massacres, you didn't know then that he was a minister and you didn't know then that on the 12th the government moved to Gitarama.  And, so, he had a very good account of where he was.  You found that out subsequently and you've changed your story to fit that fact or to avoid the difficulty it presented.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	That's your way of seeing it.  It's not necessarily my way.  Whether the government moved or not I did not know when it happened.  Even today, I was not aware of this.  Whether or not government moved, did not prevent Rwamakuba from coming from another region.  
Q.	And in the years after you made your statement, did anyone ever point out to you, anyone who came to see you and talk about your evidence, did anyone point out to you the difficulty that André Rwamakuba and the government had moved on the 12th?  Was that ever raised with you? 
A.	You're the first person to tell me, here.  
Q.	Right.  Can we just very briefly look at -- remind ourselves then, and perhaps you, you've asked me to do this.  The 27th of March, 2002 -- there may have been and undoubtedly were prior meetings with the investigators.  But you met two investigators on that day and there's no actual change in your -- in your statement and it's unclear whether they discussed it with you.  

On the 27th of May, 2003 at GIN 91, 92 and 93, which we've referred to this morning and which is the document that accompanies your confirmation at GIN 87, signed as you know by you, that the contents of your statement are true and correct.  That -- that you made certain changes, which I'm going to come to in a moment, that was plainly an opportunity for you to change your statement, make corrections, clarify your position.  And, if we look at our page 93, we'll see what you say.  

"One, she saw André Rwamakuba at the commune bureau" -- we understand secteur -- "of Gikomero between the 12th and the 20th of April and not the 12th exactly."  So that's one change you made.  Do you remember making that change? 
A.	Yes, I remember making that change.  
Q.	"André Rwamakuba" -- this is the second change you make -- "didn't follow the crowd when he ordered that the two young people be killed.  He stayed by his parked car in front of the bureau" -- the secteur office, as we know -- "some distance from the wood where the victims had been taken a distance of 70 to 100 metres."  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	No, I no longer remember.  
Q.	In fact, your evidence yesterday was different, wasn't it?  Your evidence was that he did go with the crowd; that he didn't stay by his car.  That you don't know if he went all the way to the point in the wood where they were killed.  So I'm not going to go into that, but there's a difference in your ev- -- do you agree that your evidence is different, by the way?  Because you say here, he stayed by his car.  It's not your evidence now, is it? 
A.	You think there is a difference; I don't agree with you.  I'd like to recall this for your benefit.  Even today, if we were to look at all the documents that you have drafted, we would certainly find errors there.  The investigators also make mistakes, whether it is the secteur office or the place where the vehicle was parked.  In my testimony, in my various statements, I have not said at any point that this vehicle was parked in front of the secteur office.  
Q.	Well, that is what it reads here.  
A.	That is what you have read.  It is entirely possible that that is what is written.  But you must understand that people make mistakes.  I'm saying that if you re-read the documents that you drafted yourself, you will find mistakes.  Even as you're reading now, you're reading those documents, you might make a mistake.  
Q.	Right.  I'm not going to refer any further to this document.  I've referred to it enough, I think, for my purposes, which is to point out that you had a clear opportunity there, to correct the very fundamental errors that exist in your statement; that you didn't do so.  In fact, you confirmed your statement to be wholly accurate and true, save for these changes.  Why didn't you alter your statement when you had that opportunity?  An opportunity with two investigators, Ms. Fall present, and an interpreter?  
A.	We discussed my statement.  I was reminded that I would come and give testimony before this 
	Trial Chamber, I should remind you of that.  I told them of the modifications that I wished to effect.  Those are the changes that I made.  If there are things that I was unable to change at that time, you will have realised this because on other occasions, I have been able to come back to these things that needed to be changed.  You cannot remember everything at the same time.  
Q.	Right.  Now, the next opportunity is the 13th of February, last year, 2004 when you were seen by one of the lawyers in the case, Holo Makwaia and also a Fidele Tijarni (phonetic), also present, Dior Fall and an interviewer.  And the record shows and I'll read out the notes of the -- made after the interview.  "The witness confirmed that she knew Dr. Rwamakuba, André, well and that she had seen him several times in Gikomero secteur."

Now, just dealing with that, obviously, the investigators and lawyers wanted to know how you knew André Rwamakuba.  Why did you make no mention of the wedding?  Why did you make no mention of the visit in Kigali? 
A.	Let me remind you of this.  People put questions differently.  Perhaps the question that was put to me referred to my knowledge of the accused during the events -- during the war.  So that depends on the context.  
Q.	Well, the note doesn't suggest that was the line of enquiry that that note reflects.  I suggest it reflects they wanted to know how you knew Rwamakuba and the answer they got from you then, as indeed you said in your statement, was that you'd seen him several times in Gikomero secteur.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that at this level this is pure speculation on the part of the -- of Mr. Hooper when he says that the question was put by the investigators.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What I'm suggesting, Madam Witness, is that it's a reasonable and compelling conclusion from the nature of the note that they've made.  You didn't mention anything about the wedding?  That came later, didn't it?  Because you hadn't thought about that then?  You hadn't made it up then, had you? 
A.	Well, you are taking it upon yourself to think upon my behalf and if I'm asked tomorrow how many times I have appeared in the Rwamakuba case, I would say twice.  Because once the seat of the hearing changed, but you may contradict me because you may say that I have come on several occasions, based on the fact that I did testify over a number of days.  That is the same thing that you are doing in terms of what you have said and the remarks that you have made.  
Q.	The second matter that is noted here is also of interest and I'll read it to you translated loosely in French.  The witness stated, the word is precise that the 12th of April 1994, **************************, which was a distance of 100 metres from the place where she saw André Rwamakuba in Gikomero centre tear up the identity cards of two young men and order them to be killed in a small wood situated a distance, some metres, from the centre.  Why were you able on the 27th -- oh, sorry, the 13th of February last year to specify that it was indeed of 12th of April that you saw that? 
A.	I have told you that it is difficult to recall dates.  I must have said that it was around the 12th, but I have never tried to avoid mentioning dates in my testimony.  Now, you have talked about tearing identity cards in what you have read, but what I -- I referred to was certificates and not identity cards.  So you see, you too can be mistaken and that proves the point that to err is human.  
Q.	No, what it shows, Madam, is that you don't tell the same story on two occasions, do you?  You tell different stories on different occasions.  
A.	No.  There is no contradiction.  As far as the dates are concerned, I would simply ask that you did not belabor that point because it's difficult to remember dates.  One can only give an approximate date and right from the beginning I have been consistent.  I haven't changed anything as far as dates are concerned.  I have always spoken in dates using approximations, and I have never provided specific dates.  That is what I have said and I stand by what I have said.  
Q.	Well, just on that.  The point is you'd stated it was the 12th in your statement, and again, I suggest it's a reasonable and compelling inference to conclude from the nature of note here, that the investigators and lawyers were asking you to clarify the date, and you did, precise is the word in French that's used.  And what you precise was the 12th of April.  Not the 10th to the 14th, or the 8th to the 12th, or the 10th to the 20th.  The 12th.  And that was last year.  So you did specify the date, didn't you? 
A.	Well, granted, Counsel.  However, the date of the 12th falls between the 10th and the 14th.  So there is no major difference which would warrant that you belabor that detail as far as dates are concerned.  
Q.	And the 12th is the day of the Gikomero school massacre.  
A.	Well, that is your position, Counsel, but as far as I'm concerned, I have not provided any specific date.  Now, even if you insist and you continue to insist that I provide a specific date, I have told you that it is difficult for me to give a specific date and that is why I have given a time frame between two dates.  I cannot be that specific as to the specific date because I do not recollect the specific date.  
Q.	And this was the second time that the investigators came with the lawyers in the case to see you.  And you didn't change your statement, did you, about the order of events, of Rwamakuba coming to give the green light and the killings at the school happening afterwards?  You didn't change that at all, did you? 
A.	That was because I could not or I did not remember everything.  And it was also because of the question which was put to me.  I didn't do it consciously or deliberately.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm wondering whether this matter has been sufficiently explored in the Chamber --  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, it has.  Right. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And finally and briefly, the 23rd of April, 2004, we get the changes where you say that you believe you saw Rwamakuba between the 6th and the 20th of April, which is a very wide period, indeed, isn't it, almost two weeks?  I'm not going to seek a comment from you, Madam.  And you then, at paragraph 6 say, that you'll testify that you saw Rwamakuba after the killings at the school.  And we get a new date now, the school killings between the 10th and the 15th.  And then, we have you taking off the MRND clothes, as we know, and putting on different clothes and a white cap.  We have you mentioning the wedding and Nayorinkwaya's visit for the first time.  And, finally, for the very first time, we have you making an allegation that you saw him en route to the killings at the Kayanga health centre.  

So let me turn briefly, I hope, to the last and final chapter in your account.  I suppose, before I do so, I'm duty bound to take up a bit of time in respect of what actually happened, according to your evidence.  When you gave evidence in May of last year, you told the Chamber that you could see and hear everything that was going on when those two young people were being confronted by Rwamakuba, because you were 10 metres away from them.  

Now, you've changed that again, haven't you, to 40 to 50 metres away, at a much greater distance.  Do you remember telling the Chamber that you were only 10 metres away?  In fact, you demonstrate it by saying that it was the distance from where you sat to the interpreter's booth.  Do you remember doing that? 
A.	I would like to remind you that, once again, we were approximating.  I did not know that the Judge was going to put that question to me and my estimate was a simple estimate; that is what it was.  It was not a specific distance.  Furthermore, when one estimates a distance, one does not have the opportunity to measure the distance.  
Q.	The point is you put yourself very close so you could hear what was going on -- in your evidence.  And, I notice that when you gave -- saw the investigator in February of last year, in fact, the distance was even further, as I've just read to you, 100 metres -- ten times that distance.  

See, may I suggest this to you, that if you had truly witnessed something like that, you'd have a picture in your mind, and you wouldn't be changing your evidence from 10 metres to 100 metres, would you? 
(Pages 54 to 60 by Jean Baigent)




































1645H
THE WITNESS: 
I talked about 100 metres in reference to the secteur.  You must be mistaken, Counsel, otherwise, the person who took down the notes must be mistaken.  I was asked to indicate the distance ***************************, and then I was also asked to mention the distance between Rwamakuba and myself.  I believe that you have pictures of the site.  Maybe you went to make those pictures or your colleague must have done so, and you would agree with me that it is not such a great distance.  Now, when it comes to approximating distances in metres, I think that should be acceptable with some margin of error -- some allowable margin of error.  Whatever the case, it was a rather short distance.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, you did more than estimate it the last time you gave evidence, you specified the distance from the witness box to the interpreters' booth, pretty accurately, 10 metres.  And yet, when you are seeing the investigators you're saying it's 100 metres, and when you are giving your evidence here it's 50 metres.  I don't think I need take you up with this -- take this point up with you further. 

The other matter is this, that when you were seeing -- as you've just seen -- heard in May of 2003, you told the investigators, because this is their note, that André Rwamakuba stayed by his car that was parked in front of the secteur office.  And, indeed, your evidence yesterday was that the car, you didn't see it the first time because it was parked at the secteur office.  The secteur is *****************************, and completely out of sight.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I have already explained all that.  I even gave the distance in metres, that is, the distance between *****************************.  If you look at my testimony very clearly -- very carefully, I talked about the second time when the man on the motorbike was taken away to be killed.  It is at that point that I said that Rwamakuba did not go with that group which went to kill the young man on the motorbike. 
Q.	And just coming back to the secteur office, even in your statement you say, "After the gory task," that is, the two young people who were killed, "the crowd came back to the front of the secteur office."  That's right, isn't it, *********************, is it? 
A.	No, *****************. 
Q.	If we look at my map, and I'm not going to trouble you with it, you know the area, the secteur office to get to it from your home -- well, first of all, it's not visible at all ****************; is that correct, yes or no, please? 
A.	**************************************************************************** and for that reason one could not see the secteur office.  
Q.	And to get to the secteur office from your home, which we can see is marked on our sketch B, and I'm not going to trouble you with, but for points of reference, it's B5, you have ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.  Is that right? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Can I have passed to you a photograph, please.  I don't have copies of it.  Two photographs.  
MR. HOOPER:
Okay, show the Prosecution first.  They have been given the opportunity to look at all the photographs, but I don't think they've troubled themselves yet.  And can those photographs please be shown to the Judges, please, at this stage.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And I'll ask you to identify them, but one shows the back of the secteur office and the second photograph is a view taken from the steps of the secteur office towards the centre, the road that leads to the centre.  
MR. HOOPER:
I can specify it on our plan.  Well, let's see -- have the witness recognise the photograph.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you, first of all, see a photograph showing the secteur office of Gikomero secteur? 
A.	My problem is that I cannot assert that this is, indeed, the Gikomero secteur office because the secteurs in Gikomero are built in a similar manner.  And the name is not visible, at least, on the building that is on the picture.  So I am not in a position to say for sure and with certainty that this is the Gikomero secteur office. 
Q.	That's very helpful.  

We have a photograph at page 18, photo 9, perhaps you can be briefly shown that, taken from the Prosecution's bundle.  It shows the front of the office.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can that be shown to the witness, please?  I've got my own copy here.  I just want her to have a look at the top photograph.  In fact, she can look at several others, I think here.  Yes.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you recognise that as the secteur office or do you have a problem with that one too? 
A.	I do recognise this as a secteur office, but I do not know which secteur. 
Q.	Well, the Prosecution, I'm sure, can confirm -- excuse me, madam. 
A.	Now, I can see the name Gikomero, that -- 
Q.	I'm sure the Prosecution can confirm that's the Gikomero secteur office because that's their photograph.  And I can assure, madam, as I took the other photograph, that's the back of the secteur office.  So would you be content to accept that those photographs show the secteur office at Gikomero secteur? 
A.	I do have some doubts.  I have explained to you at length that this shot of -- or should I say this shot is not of interest to our proceedings here because it would have been better to have the picture showing the name of this secteur.  On your picture, on this picture you have just given me, I do not see the name of that secteur office. 
Q.	Well, we are not trying to trick you.  Look at the other picture there.  As you've lived there for so many years, look at the other picture.  Now, would you agree that's a view from the secteur office, down towards the trade centre, or do you have a difficulty with that? 
A.	I do not have any problems with the picture below, the lower picture.  One or two things can lead me to the conclusion that this is indeed the trade centre. 
Q.	So, from that picture, with the children in it looking down that path or little roadway, we can see the kind of distance it is before you get to the point where you turn left, and then you'd walk into the trade centre up and to your home.  Now I won't get more specific than that.  If you look at the book again, the photographs, Madam Witness, and if you look at the second page of photographs, you see a view there taken *************, looking down the row of houses towards the trade centre.  And we can see how distant that would be.  Tell me this:  Where is the wood? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Where is the little wood that those poor people were taken to be killed? 
A.	I can show you the place if we use the photograph below the one depicting the secteur office, if you will. 
Q.	That would be helpful.  I don't have it myself, but everyone else does, so you just take everyone else through that and I'll catch up in a moment.  Is the little wood shown in that photograph?  Has the photograph got a number, first of all?  Can you see a number below the photograph? 
A.	I see B3 on page 18 -- P. 3 on page 18. 
Q.	All right.  
A.	This is photograph number 10, Gikomero centre, from B3 on page 18. 
Q.	All right.  And where is the wood there, please? 
A.	I can see that on the photograph that was shown to me before, I said that the wood was hidden, but you can see where there is a small object that looks like metal.  The wood is downhill from these various things that you can see here, these things that look like pieces of metal that have been stuck into the ground. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I'm wondering if I could have my book back so I could see where we are on it.  Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can that one photograph be exhibited appropriately, D whatever, the photograph of -- the shot taken from the secteur which is being acknowledged by the witness. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I do not know whether this photograph has been shown to the witness beforehand and that she had identified it.  Perhaps this is the photograph of the secteur office, but it seems to me that the witness has not yet identified this photograph.  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, I'm sorry, you are mistaken, Madam Prosecutor, she was -- I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I think the witness had identified this that she had no trouble with this as showing the scene that it represented.  But perhaps we can show it to her and see if she wants to change that.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I told Defence counsel that I did not recognise this photograph.  I recognised photograph number 10 in the book of photographs because there were two things on the photograph that enabled me to identify it, and I told him that I was in some doubt as to the other photograph.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I hear what you say, but I think the transcript may reveal the contrary, but I don't take it any further.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When you say that there is a small wood, un petit forêt -- I'm sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought the witness had said that she could not identify photo number 9 because of the name of the secteur was not visible, but she accepted and recognised photo number 10.  I think that's what her testimony was.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I understood her to dispute whether this photograph was a photograph of her secteur office -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that was photograph number 9.  
MR. HOOPER: 
-- then she --  yeah -- no, it's unnumbered.  It's an unnumbered photograph.  It's come from the Defence.  It hasn't been seen before but the other photograph she was shown, which is -- she may have it.  She may have -- if the witness could just hold it up so that we could all see.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Could you just hold up that photograph for a moment so we can see it?
MR. HOOPER:
-- was a photograph that was taken from the steps of the Gikomero secteur office, pointing back from the secteur office steps to position, I think, D5, which, again, was a Defence photograph.  I understood her to say she didn't have a trouble -- any trouble with that photograph, the second one.  I was watching her from here and she seems to accept it.  But if this is a problem, let's move on because I'm within reach, I think, of concluding her evidence today.  And I have asked her if she can indicate where the wood is and she's indicated that it's past some metal pieces.  And I will just ask the witness this, if I may:  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When you say a wood, do you mean a banana plantation? 
A.	You asked me where the wood was on the photograph that is in the book.  I did not talk about the photograph that you gave to me.  I told you where these people were, quite close to a dipping tank, and I told you that the clump of trees was below the structures, the metallic looking structures, but I did not speak of the photograph that you showed me. 
Q.	Thank you.  Photograph 10, let me ask you this:  The little wood that lies down the hill a bit that you described, are those -- is that a banana plantation or is it a wood of different -- of different trees to bananas or plantains?  What do you mean by little wood? 
A.	I don't follow you.  I've told you about a clump of trees to which the victims were led.  I do not know what wood you are referring.  You have the photograph, I don't. 
Q.	What kind of trees, do you know, these clump of trees?  Do you know what kind of trees they are or not? 
A.	It was eucalyptus. 
Q.	Can you see these two photographs, please, a further two photographs.  Do you see the dipping tank in those photographs? 
A.	Yes, I can. 
Q.	Can you see the direction in which the little wood is?  It may not be shown in the photographs, but can you see the direction that it lies? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And how far down the slope out of sight of the photograph is the wood, the little wood? 
A.	You did that deliberately, but I think that from the dipping tank, you -- it's about 10 metres away. 
Q.	Well, there is no sign of any wood there, is there?  Are you sure there is a wood just there? 
A.	It's not really a small wood, actually; it is really a forest which goes right down to the valley. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm going to ask to have those photographs exhibited.  
BY. MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I go to the Kayanga health centre, Madam Witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper (overlapping microphones) 
THE WITNESS: 
What photographs do you want to look at?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to do anything about those photographs or they are just en passant?  

MR. HOOPER: 
No, en passant because as I understand the wood is out of sight, but in that direction.  Well, I suppose perhaps if there is a later point of reference, as there might be, perhaps those two photographs could be exhibited as showing the direction in which the wood lies.  In which case can they both be exhibited as Defence exhibits with an appropriate number, please.

1715H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar.  May I have a look at the photographs?  
MR. FRY:
D. 31, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I have a look at the photographs again, please? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall.
MS. FALL:
We have no objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  

Mr. Registrar, do they both come under one exhibit number or --  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we would prefer two exhibit numbers, D. 31 and D. 32. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.
(Exhibit No. D. 31 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. 32 admitted)
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In Gikomero secteur when were you living there, were there people there who were good, honest and truthful people amongst the population? 
A.	Yes, everybody has his own conscience, but there were people who I thought were people of integrity. 
Q.	Do you know -- can you give us any names of anyone who perhaps saw what you saw of               André Rwamakuba? 
A.	When you put this question to me before, I gave you those names. 
Q.	What names were those? 
A.	I told you about Drocella Mukayiranga. 
Q.	Let's pause there.  She is dead, isn't she?
A.	Yes, she is. 
Q.	Could you give me the names of people who are alive? 
A.	Yes, these people are in detention, however. 
Q.	Honest, good, truthful people, even if they are in detention, who can you suggest? 
A.	In my view, if a person is accused of genocide and this person is in prison, it is difficult for me to trust such a person.  However, if you wish I shall give you these names because these are the only people I know who witnessed these events.  
Q.	Are they going to be the usual suspects, the names you gave us before, Ngiruwosanga, Ngarambe, Kabanda?  I think I can probably give you your list.  Let me move on to something else.

You saw André Rwamakuba a second time, you told us.  "A few days went by, I would say two to five days elapsed."  That is right, isn't it?  
A.	Would you be so kind as to repeat your question. 
Q.	After he came on the day that you have told us about the first time, he came again, this time on his way to Kayanga, and that was two or five days after the first time.  And the first time was two or five days after, you say, the massacre at the school.  So, between four and ten days after the massacre at the school he came again on the way to Kayanga.  That is right, isn't it, on your evidence? 
A.	You are referring to several events, and that confuses me.  I said that after two or -- within two or five days -- two to five days after the massacre at the school, he passed by there on his way to Kayanga, two or five days later. 
Q.	And we know in your statement that you had said that when Rwamakuba had left the first time, you hadn't seen him again.  But here is another big difference, isn't there, between what you said in your statement and what you are saying now.  Tell me this, why didn't you tell anyone before April of last year, on the several opportunities that you had to correct your statement, why didn't you tell anyone about his coming again and going to the Kayanga health centre?  Why did it take you six years before you provided that information? 
A.	There are two different reasons for that.  When I finished giving my statement, the statement you are reading, I promised to add further information if such information came to mind.  Afterwards, when I wanted to add things, I was in some doubt as to events of -- to which I had not been a witness, an eyewitness.  So I asked the Prosecutor, and the Prosecutor said to me, if someone told you something and you think it is important, you can say it.  That is why I added some things. 
Q.	But why does your statement say, "I didn't see him again."? 
A.	I understand clearly why you are focusing on that.  But all you need do is go on and read my statement to the bottom to see how I ended it, see what I said in my statement.  I remember saying that if I had something else to add, I would add it.  That is what I remember.  And when I gave my statement I told them what I have just told you and that is what I wish to recall. 
Q.	I want you to look at this list, please, which is going to be passed up to you, which is a document that you wrote on a previous occasion, and which is under seal.  To the Court, "I would like to pray the Court to ask someone to write it down for me, I do not wish my writing to appear on any document in this court."  But looking at that document, can you confirm that that is a list that you wrote out and represents the names of people in respect of which you have given information in respect of, "The killings at the Kayanga health centre."  And when you were asked to provide a list of those people, you were kind -- the question was, "If possible, can you complete the list of those persons in respect to whom you have provided a statement concerning the Kayanga health centre killings?"  You produced that document and that list of names.  It is page 28 of the transcript of the 13th of May 2004, pages 29 and 28 refer to that.  Can you confirm that that was the list that was compiled of your dictation?  
A.	The question that was put to me, at least, the one that you have referred to, was not the question that was put to me.  That is not it. 
Q.	Well, that is what the transcript shows.  That is the list you produced.  Well, let me approach it in a different way:  Do the names that appear on that list in front of you, are those the names of people in respect to whom you have provided information with respect to the Kayanga health centre killings; yes or no, please? 
A.	I remember that I was asked whether I had provided information about certain people. 
Q.	In the context of their participation in the killings at the Kayanga health centre; yes or no? 
A.	No, I was asked about some people in connection with the genocide, so, I gave that list.  That is what I remember. 
Q.	Well, I will come back to that tomorrow because I see the time, and I may be able to deal with it briefly tomorrow.  Obviously, you had all of those opportunities before the 23rd of April last year to mention the Kayanga health centre, you hadn't.  I was a little unclear -- I was a little unclear of your evidence -- excuse me, in respect to the Kayanga health centre as to what had happened in Gikomero secteur trade centre immediately preceding it.  Now, first of all, I understand André Rwamakuba arrives and that is in a white saloon car; is that correct, according to you? 
A.	Yesterday, I remember that we talked about the colour and brand or the make of the vehicle, and yet you are still putting questions about that.  I have gone on to say, and I still say that he came in a white vehicle --  or I said also that I didn't remember the colour, but that doesn't change anything.  But I would like to remind you that you are reading my statement and there are changes that I made to what I said.  And I am here before this Trial Chamber to repeat what I said.  
Q.	Well, if you are feeling like I am feeling, I suspect you are probably quite tired and weary after a long day in Court having to put up with all of my questions, and you are probably not the only one.  And I'm not very long off, but enough off, I think, not to press on this evening? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we all agree that this is an appropriate time to call the adjournment.

Madam Witness, we are going to take the adjournment now.  Your testimony will continue tomorrow morning.  And as I have reminded you on each adjournment, I do, again, that you should not discuss the case with anybody while your testimony is continuing.

Just one housekeeping matter, I have just been informed that we will be using this courtroom, Trial Chamber II until the end of next week -- at least, until the end of next week.  So we will be resuming in this courtroom tomorrow and during the course of next week.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And our hours tomorrow, are we up to Friday yet?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
It is not Thursday, it is Friday tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you tempting me to say we'll sit until 5:30?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I would be the most, if I'm not already, unpopular person in the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we normally expect to sit at half day.  And we thought a half day on Friday would end at 12:00.  Do you anticipate that we will be able to start another witness?  Ms. Fall, do you have any idea -- are you going to be lengthy in your examination if Mr. Hooper finishes within the first half hour?  Would we be able to start another witness tomorrow?  We expect to sit until 12 noon. 
MS. FALL: 
Quite so, Mr. Witness -- Mr. President.  I would like to thank Mr. Hooper for extending his cross-examination till now, because if he hadn't done so he would have had an advantage over me because I am totally exhausted.  

The witness is already here, Mr. President.  We actually thought we would start with the next witness today.  So tomorrow, if we finish early we should be able to put the witness on the stand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  We will take the adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
