MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 27th of September 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No.  ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Good morning, Ms. Hounkpatin.  How is Mr. Ngirumpatse doing?

Good morning, Mr. President.  Yes, I was going to confirm this to you, Mr. President.  Mr. Ngirumpatse is present in court this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I had actually asked how he was doing.  I saw him.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
He's a little better.  He has met doctor -- he has a meeting with Dr. Epée at 10:30 in order to check on the pressure which has -- which had gone up considerably at the time we had adjourned last week. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.

LÉONIDAS MUREMBYA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Murembya.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	We are going to continue and conclude your examination-in-chief this morning.  I wish to remind you quickly of the rules of the game in respect of your testimony.  Since we are both speaking French, we are going to have a break at the end of my question to you so that the interpreters are able to conclude my question, and then you will answer after that short pause that you will have marked, and I also will make the same effort so that we don't have an overlap -- an overlap.  
A.	I understand you.  
Q.	Thank you.  

Thursday we broke off as we were talking about Ngirumpatse's return to his home after he had accompanied Wycliff to the home of his parents.  This morning I would like us to move and consider -- well, the first question I'm going to put to you is:  For how long -- how many days did you remain in Mr. Ngirumpatse's house?  
A.	I think we stayed there up until the 10th of April.  It was on the 10th of April that we left his home in order to go into the centre of town.  
Q.	For what reason did you leave on the 10th of April?  
A.	I believe the security situation came -- became somewhat precarious.  Also the telephone line had been cut off, so we didn't have any contact with the outside world.  So we were told to leave.  I was not the one taking decisions; we were told to leave.  
Q.	To the best of your recollection, would you be able to indicate to us how you left that house?  By what means?  Did you leave alone, were you in a group; that's the first point.  
A.	We were in a convoy with the gendarmes, I believe, and everyone left together.  So everyone who was in the house who had a vehicle joined the convoy, and we left together up to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  
Q.	When you say "everyone", do you mean all the families which had sought refuge in that home?  Did you all leave in a single convoy accompanied by gendarmes; is that what you mean to say?  
A.	Yes, madam.  
Q.	Let's go back specifically to yourself.  Into which vehicle did you enter, and with whom?  
A.	We left in a Pajero vehicle, I believe it's a Japanese make, and I was with the -- the members of -- all the members of the family except Mathieu.  I believe he had already left.  But when I say "everyone", I mean Mathieu's little girl, the boy who was a Ghanaian friend living with us, there was Monique, Mathieu's sister-in-law, and her little child was an infant.  I no longer remember what happened to Frédéric; I don't know whether he left together with us or whether he left with his friends from another family.  
Q.	Witness, can you please tell us whether the Pajero into which you entered was a low vehicle or whether it was somewhat raised?  Because one Prosecution witness came and said to this Court that the vehicle was a low vehicle.  Can you say anything about it, and confirm or deny whether it was the same description which corresponds to the Pajero?  
A.	This depends on what the other witness refers to as "low", because Pajero is higher than the vehicles that bring me here.  So I don't know what this is referred to in French, but it is a four-by-four vehicle, which should be somewhat high.  So it is the same type of vehicle that brings us here.  So it is indeed much higher off the ground.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I would like to ask Mr. Issa to help me with a document which we have tendered into evidence.  If my memory serves me right, I believe it's D. NG94. 

Can Mr. Issa please bring out this document, which is a photograph. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can counsel please speak into the microphone.  She's very far away from it.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
It's a picture of a Pajero.  D. NG94 -- 97, I beg your pardon. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects counsel.  

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Nine-seven.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin, the interpreters have requested that you go a bit closer to the microphone.  They're not hearing you very well.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I do apologise.  

Mr. Issa, can you please show this document to the parties and to the witness.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Murembya, does this vehicle look like the vehicle on -- into which you entered on the 10th of April? 
A.	Yes, madam. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you left Mr. Ngirumpatse's home, you said quickly a moment ago that you went to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  Is that indeed correct?  
A.	Yes, madam. 
Q.	Did you remain at that hotel, the Hôtel des Diplomates?  
A.	Yes, because it was in the afternoon, towards evening, and the security in the middle of town was uncertain, or was unknown, so all those who were at the Diplomates remained there that night. 
Q.	What happened the next day?  
A.	The following day, after Mathieu got to know that we could move about in the centre of town, we went to go and seek lodgings at Eden Garden, a restaurant belonging to Mrs. Rose, Madam Rose.  
Q.	Could you please inform the Chamber about those with whom you went to Eden Garden?  
A.	There was myself, the Ghanaian friend, Frank.  There was Monique and her child.  And I think towards evening Monique's two children, the older ones, joined us.  And Delphine was also there.  
Q.	Did the security situation at Eden Garden prove to, in fact, be satisfactory?  
A.	No, not quite.  I remember that the telephone was working at Eden Garden, so I took the opportunity to call my friend in the United States.  And as I was speaking to her, a bullet hit the front of the counter, and I had to tell her, because there was also shooting around, I told her that, "Shooting has begun and I'm going to seek refuge."  So we did not speak for ten days because -- because we had to evacuate the location because the security situation had become untenable.  
Q.	Did you spend one or two nights at Eden Garden, or -- 
A.	I think it was only one night, the 11th.  So the first night of the 10th was spent at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  We spent the day of the 11th and the night of the 11th at Eden Garden.  On the 12th, towards 11 in the morning, or at around noon, we saw Rose and Mathieu come to take us.  They said, "We have to leave.  We believe that Kigali town doesn't have security."  So it was decided that everyone was to go to Gitarama.  
Q.	Can you please tell the Court in which vehicle Rose and Mathieu came in order to fetch you from Eden Garden.  In which vehicle did you leave Kigali town?  
A.	The same Pajero which had brought us from the home to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  Let me say that there was also, in the boot of the vehicle, all their personal belongings.  Their clothing and -- they were in suitcases in the boot of the Pajero.  
Q.	All the people who had sought refuge at Eden Garden, were they able to all enter the Pajero and come out of town?  
A.	Yes, everyone was in there.  We made an effort.  The young -- I believe myself and Monique's son, we went into the trunk.  So we sat in the back of the car, together with the suitcases.  And I believe Frank, who was used to driving that vehicle -- because it's a vehicle which is -- not just anyone can drive because it is somewhat high off the ground, so it was Frank who was used to driving that vehicle so he was at the wheel, and Mathieu was sitting by his side, and Rose and -- so it was Rose, Delphine, Monique, and the young boy, and I believe Monique's daughter were on the seats.  But myself and the young boy sat back in the trunk of the vehicle.  
Q.	At any given point in time did your vehicle join any convoy?  
A.	No, I don't think so, because I think the convoy had already left.  So we tried to join it but I think it had already left.  So we left alone from Kigali to Gitarama.  
Q.	On your way did you come upon any roadblocks?  
A.	I believe I saw a roadblock quite close by the Nyabarongo river.  It was a roadblock which was being manned by soldiers.  
Q.	To the best of your recollection, can you please tell the Chamber how you went across that roadblock?  Was it a complicated issue, was it easy, or -- or what?  Can you please tell us what happened?  
A.	It was not very difficult, but we needed to be careful because we did not know who was manning the roadblock, so we came close to it and we saw that they were soldiers of the former Rwandan army.  So Mathieu told them that we were part of the convoy and that we had been somewhat delayed because he needed to come to fetch us.  So the soldiers knew Mathieu because he was a well-known political figure, he was always on television, and so they let us go through.  
Q.	To the best of your recollection also, did Mathieu get down from the vehicle in order to congratulate anyone, especially Interahamwe, at that roadblock?  
A.	Mathieu did not come out of the vehicle.  He did not need to get out of the vehicle because as soon as the soldiers saw the vehicle arrive, they came to see what was in the vehicle.  So they came.  When they came to the window they saw that it was Mathieu, and he said, "We are in the convoy."  And they left us.  

I don't really remember -- there were soldiers, yes, I saw them, and there were many people who wanted to go to the other side of the river, so there were children, there were women, and even many peasants who were waiting to go across.  Because when everyone saw that vehicles were going towards Gitarama, they must have said to themselves that things were not going well, and people began to want to go in that direction. 
Q.	So you realised that there was a crowd of people who were also fleeing towards Gitarama; is that what you're trying to explain to the Chamber?  
A.	Yes, madam.  I saw -- particularly those who had vehicles, because we were not the only ones at the roadblock.  There were other vehicles there.  We had to wait somewhat for the other private vehicles to move on, civilians who were fleeing and were leaving together with members of the government.  There were people on foot, peasants all around who was also waiting to cross to the other side of the river.  
Q.	Mathieu -- before I ask you that question, were there any Interahamwe among the people who were leaving?  
A.	Quite frankly, that's a very difficult question for me because I have no idea, and I don't know how to make a distinction between Interahamwe and the youths of the local inhabitants, ordinary citizens.  Because there was no -- no particular distinction.  I don't know how to answer you.  
Q.	Maybe I'm repeating myself, but can you confirm to the Chamber that at no time did Mathieu come out of the vehicle to congratulate anyone, including any persons that you aren't able to qualify as Interahamwe?  
A.	Yes, I confirm that he remained in the vehicle, he never left the vehicle.  Rather, a soldier came to talk to us because when the vehicle arrived at the roadblock, someone would come and look into the vehicle to see if there were things which were suspect -- well, I don't know what they were looking for.  But when he came -- when they came and they saw Mathieu, Mathieu told them that he was part of a vehicle (sic) of people from government which had already left, so he didn't spend two or three minutes in that place.  
Q.	Thank you.  I want us to go back a little to one question.  You had left Ngirumpatse's home on the 10th of April to go to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  On your way did you notice any dead bodies scattered about on the road as you went to Kigali town?  
A.	Maybe from the home to the centre of town.  I don't remember whether we saw any dead bodies because the convoy was going quite fast, and then we wouldn't have time to see.  And then people -- we were afraid that people were going to shoot at us.  So I think it was rather when we were leaving Kigali to go to Gitarama that I saw dead bodies in the Muhima neighbourhood.  There were -- yes, indeed, there were dead bodies and there were bodies which had even been burned.  It was not any -- a nice thing to see.  But, again, because of the security issue, we were going quite fast in order to be able to leave town, and I did see dead bodies this time around, yes.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Murembya; you have answered my second question on the other part of the trip that you made.  

So you arrive in Gitarama.  What time would it have been, if your memory can help you there?  
A.	I believe we left Kigali at around noon, and it's only an hour or an hour and a half to get to Gitarama.  So it would have been towards the beginning of the afternoon.  
Q.	How were you welcomed in Gitarama?  How were things organised logistically in Gitarama?  
A.	There was a training centre, an educational training centre located there, and the government relocated there.  Because it was a school there were dormitories, and that is where the families of government members were staying.  And the members of government had a separate quarters which -- which used to be the quarters for the teachers of the school. 
Q.	How long did you stay in Gitarama?  
A.	We got to Gitarama on the 12th.  I stayed on for two days, I believe, because I went -- I left on the 14th, I believe.  I have no clear recollection of the dates, but it must have been the 14th.  There was a convoy, a government delegation that was going to Bujumbura for the burial of President Ndadaye, President Ndadaye -- was it not Ndadaye?  
Q.	Well, he died well before that.  
A.	Ntaryamira.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
It was President Ntaryamira.  So I left with that convoy to Bujumbura on the 14th.
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Are you able to tell the Chamber what happened to your own parents during this difficult period?  
A.	I'm sure this is now going to stir emotions.  But based on what was recounted to me by survivors from my family, apparently there was the RPF troops that pitched camp on the hill opposite my hill on the Byumba commune.  But my commune is on the border -- on the Byumba border.  And the RPF troops were there, stationed there.  And they were interacting with the local population.  And apparently some young Tutsi from the village went to join the troops.  

On the -- then they told me -- on the 6th they told me that they did not know what was happening, because the 6th was -- they were in the village and they did not know what was happening.  It was not until the 8th/9th, that the RPF troops started advancing towards Kigali on foot.  

Along their way they went to the villages to look for educated persons.  I don't know if you recall the story of the killings -- or, the killing of a Belgian -- I don't know if you have a recollection of the Shagasha killings; the Belgian journalist wrote on this.  Shagasha is a small educational centre which is located about a kilometre or two from my own house.  And apparently the RPF troops called the people for -- together for distribution of food and medicine, and when the people got to Shagasha the RPF troops came, took the young persons.  First they told them that, "You are young and you have to come here and do the distribution of food and medicine."  And they took all the young persons and tied their hands behind their backs and killed them, all the young persons there.  This is something I read about when I was in the United States.  
Well, obviously I started getting scared, because my younger brothers were young and I believed they were part of the killings.  But apparently -- and there again, based on what was recounted to me by some members of my family, a Tutsi family who were our neighbours sent their daughter to tell my parents, my family, that they know that the RPF troops were going to start advancing, so they should go.  

So they -- the Tutsi family came to warn my family, and that gave them the time to flee.  And apparently -- my mother also told me that when she left she met another Tutsi sitting by the road and wielding a machete, and he called my mother, told her that, "Look, we know you, so you have to leave very quickly."  

But apparently my father did not want to leave.  He said, "Well, there's nothing -- I have nothing to be -- there's nothing against me, so I'm staying."  But I think towards the end he left, because people continued telling him that, "You should not stay back, the situation is not safe for educated persons, so you have to leave."  So he left.  He joined the family at Rulindo in my grandfather's compound.  

A few weeks later, the RPF troops had arrived in that region.  That is when the entire Hutu population took refuge in Zaire.  My father told the others, my mother, that she has to take the children and leave with the others to Zaire.  There were other persons from the hill who had also taken refuge in my grandparents' region.  So they left together towards Zaire.  

I think my father said he was going to go back to the village.  He said, "I'm going to stay back, but I'll join you later."  But apparently he went back to the village.  One of my younger sisters, the youngest of the family, when she got to the camp in Zaire she couldn't bear the situation so she decided to come back to Rwanda.  She came back, went to the village, and found that my father had been beaten, seriously beaten.  And there was nobody to care for him.  And since luckily my sister had come back, she took care of him, she -- he -- he started getting better.  And the soldiers came back for him, took him somewhere, and my sister never saw him again.  

After that my younger sister could no longer live in the village, so she left for Kigali.  I think the government allowed children who proved that they were in school to go back to school, so she went back to school.  And somebody took my father -- my family's property.  So currently it's someone else who is living in my family -- my family's property.  
Q.	Witness, one last question on Mathieu.  Knowing your uncle as you do, do you think he would have decided to leave Rwanda, given the circumstances that we know?  
A.	I don't know if I really understand your question.  I think the only reason why he decided to get involved in politics -- that is one thing I didn't approve of, but he told me that politics is like an investment.  You take a risk:  If it works out, it takes you somewhere; if it doesn't, it works against you.  I think he loved Rwanda so much, and I think that is why he went into politics.  
Q.	Thank you.  In the lengthy account that you gave about your family, I would like to have a clarification.  Your younger brothers, were they involved in the killings, or were they victims of the killings?  
A.	Those who are familiar with the dynamics of the war in Rwanda will know that there's no doubt that in -- the people from Byumba and the neighbouring areas were killed by RPF troops.  I think the country's very open.  If you go to my village and ask people, they will tell you that there were no killings in my village.  It was rather the RPF, because the RPF was stationed on the opposite hill and they started killing.  Things started going bad when they heard that the war had started in Kigali, they started killing.  And even the young Tutsis of the village joined them.  

Because my brothers told me that they had -- they were growing crops and it was time to harvest, they had come to Rulindo to harvest their crops, and the young Hutus who had fled towards Rulindo were coming back in group to harvest their crop and go back.  And when they got there, they were harassed by the young persons who were there so they had to hide during the night.  

And I believe that later on the killings -- the RPF killings of Byumba and my village, that some institution like the UN would render justice.  Otherwise those who were killed would not have known justice. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Murembya.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I am done with my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Miss Hounkpatin.  

Mr. Sow, do you have any questions?  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President; good morning, Your Honours; good morning, everybody.  

Mr. President, I have a few questions, which would take me approximately ten minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, please.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, let me introduce myself.  My name is Félix Sow, counsel for Édouard Karemera, who is another Accused in this case.  
You did say that on the 7th April 1994, some families came to take refuge in Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's house.  Do you confirm that?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I confirm that.  
Q.	Among those families you mentioned Édouard Karemera, Shingiro as well.  Do you confirm that?  
A.	Yes, Karemera was there, and Shingiro was there as well.  I think Karemera was with his wife and an elderly woman.  I assumed that it was either his mother or his mother-in-law.  
Q.	Now, when they took refuge there, did they come with a lot of luggage?  How did they get there?  
A.	I really don't recall.  I don't recall any longer if they came in a car or on foot.  But I saw them all the same.  At one point in time, as I said earlier on, I was the elder -- eldest in the family.  And since Mathieu was involved in other issues, getting information on the prevailing situation, I was the manager, so to speak, of the family, ensuring that people could eat.  So I did not follow -- I did not focus on the details of people arriving.  So I just assumed that anyone who is admitted into Mathieu's house should be a friend.  So if that person is able to get that far, then I have to take care of him.  

So I think it was in the evening, towards the evening that I saw Karemera, but I can't recall how he came to the house.  
Q.	For those families who took refuge in Ngirumpatse's house, what was the general environment, the general atmosphere?  In other words, how were the people at the time?  Were they relaxed, were they apprehensive?  What was the general atmosphere?  
A.	At the outset it was not very -- people were not very sure.  We did not know what was happening, so in the beginning people would come, they would sit and wait.  It was when we started getting news of the killings -- it was when the young Frédéric came with news of killings that people started understanding what was going on in town, and, as I said, the recall Wycliff's reaction when he saw his parents.  And when he came back and recounted to his wife what had happened, I saw Wycliff's wife, and that is when it dawned on me that people -- people had started understanding what was going on outside.  Our telephone was disconnected, and we said that the situation -- the security situation was becoming untenable in Kicukiro, so it was time to leave.  
Q.	When you leave Mathieu's house, did you do so precipitously or did you have time to organise your departure?  
A.	No, each decision was precipitated.  Mathieu heard that the government was taking refuge at Hôtel des Diplomates, and it has to be a safe place, so everybody was leaving.  I left all my belongings, my clothes in the house, all my clothes.  I left only with what I was wearing.  There was no time to take anything; we just had to go.  

So we left precipitously.  Some persons -- some people in the house had vehicles.  The trader that I made reference to, Ephrem, had a big vehicle, so he was able to take his entire family.  And some other persons that I no longer recall.  So some gave a lift to others in their vehicles.  But our family was large, so we left with one vehicle.  And that is why we could not take more than one vehicle, because the convoy was saying that we had to leave and we had to leave now.  
Q.	Since you left in such a precipitous manner, am I to understand that you were afraid for your lives and your security in general?  
A.	Yes, that was the general feeling.  Because we didn't know where the bullets were coming from, where the shootings were coming from.  They were shooting everywhere.  The fact that I cannot -- I won't say that I was as scared as my neighbours because there was some level of protection, we were nonetheless afraid, we were in a convoy and if anyone saw us we were visible, we were quite visible as a target.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I am done with this witness, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I was following Mr. Murembya's testimony, as well as the transcripts.  And I wish that an error -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And Ms. -- can the counsel speak into the microphone.  She is so far I cannot hear. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, the interpreters have lost you again.  You are speaking too far from the microphone.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
As always.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I would like this error -- this phonetic error be corrected.  The word "lift" appears in the transcript as "lists".  9:51:30.  That is the -- what I wanted to bring to your notice, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I am sure the official transcript will reflect that, because you...

Mr. Witness, you now have to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and you will have to answer questions put to you by Ms. Wilson.  
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  
MS. WILSON: 
Good morning, everyone.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	My name is Maria Wilson, and I am one of the Prosecutors in this matter.  

Mr. Witness, thank you for being here this morning.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	You said that Mr. Ngirumpatse was your uncle.  Correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Was he your mother's brother or your father's brother?  
A.	My father.  He is the younger brother of my father.  
Q.	And when you returned to Rwanda in February of 1994, you chose to stay at his home; that's what you said in your evidence, yes?  
A.	Yes, they invited me to stay with them and I accepted the invitation, yes.  
Q.	I'm trying to understand when you actually got to know your uncle.  You indicated in your testimony that you really got to know him after graduating.  And you said when he returned, because he was serving as an ambassador abroad, you became friends.  When exactly did Mathieu return, and when did you start to become friends with him?  
A.	I think there is a wrong interpretation of the words I used.  I knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse well before.  First of all, my parents used to speak about him, and whenever he came on holiday -- he used to come on holiday once or twice a year, and he would come home for some time to speak -- to chat with his brothers.  So we knew who he was.  But we did not have the opportunity to speak together with his family.  

When I mentioned my studies, I was referring to secondary education.  When I was in secondary, I used to see him only when he was on holiday.  When I finished secondary school and went to the university, that is when he came back to Rwanda, and this was around 1982/83/84, thereabouts.  When he came back, that is when I actually started visiting his family, because he came back with his entire family, and that is when started -- I get -- I started getting to know my cousins.  They started getting involved in business, particularly in the field of restaurants.  
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, thank you very much for your response.  I will appreciate if you would just answer the -- my question succinctly, yeah?  

In your direct, you indicated that Mathieu would come to visit the home maybe once or twice a year, but you or the other children were not around at the time; is that not so?  
A.	Yes, I confirm that.  
Q.	And -- and you might have heard a lot about your uncle, of course he's part of your family.  But you, as a person, you only started to develop a relationship with him later in life; is that not so, as an adult?  
A.	Yes, that is true.  Adult, that means after secondary school.  
Q.	Now -- can you give us approximately what year that was, after secondary school?  
A.	Yes, I've already said that.  You're asking me many questions at the same time, and I need to answer all your questions.  I did say that in '82/83, when I was completing secondary school, going to the university, that is when I started having close relationship with Mr. Mathieu, my uncle.  I think that is short and concise.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  The reason why I asked you this is simply because in your direct you said it was only after you -- you got your -- received -- obtained your degree, after you graduated that you got to know him.  That's why I'm asking you that question.  Do you still maintain that it was after '82/83 that you started to develop a relationship with your uncle?  
A.	I don't know how I can say more than I have said.  It was in 1982/83.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  And you also said Mathieu, your uncle, was the most educated and the richest member of the family.  That's correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that all members of the family would bring their problems with them, yes?  

You can't nod, sorry, it has to be recorded.  Can you indicate by answering?  
A.	Listen, I understand English and I understand French.  I can understand you, and I'm waiting for the interpreter to interpret for me.  So when I'm nodding it's because I'm following the interpreter and I'm listening to what you're saying.  

So I no longer recall the question.  But -- 
Q.	Thank you, I will repeat it.  Sorry about that.  
A.	Okay.  
Q.	You said that Mathieu was the most educated and the richest member of the family.  Is that true?  
A.	Yes, that is true.  
Q.	And most of the family members used to bring their problems to him.  
A.	If you are an African, I think you should be able to understand that.  It is quite normal. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, I'm not questioning you.  I'm just asking you the question again.  So don't be defensive, yeah.  

And you said, "We used to ask him for money."  
A.	Please wait.  I must answer your previous question before -- before I answer this one.  So I'm not on the defensive, but if you are asking me questions which are obvious, it's not easy to answer in a polite manner.  

So Mathieu was the most educated, the richest, and he had the widest network.  Therefore he was -- well, everybody brought their problems to him.  And if my aunt was unwell, she would go to him in order to obtain medication.  If I was going to school -- this was before I went to university because at university I had a scholarship.  But in secondary school, if he came on holiday and I didn't have any -- I don't know how to say this in French.  If I didn't have my school fees which is required in Rwanda, I would go to him to ask for money.  If my father was unable to pay, I would go to Mathieu to ask him for money, yes.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  So you feel a sense of gratitude towards Mathieu for all that he has done for you, don't you?  
A.	Obviously I love my uncle, yes.  
Q.	During the period you were studying in Michigan, that's between December of 1990 and February of 1994, did you keep in touch with your uncle, the Accused?  
A.	Yes, I remained in touch, but the cost of remaining in touch between Rwanda and the United States is quite high, so I cannot say -- well, if I made phone calls it would be for five to ten minutes, and this would be for me to ask questions about what's happening to members of my family.  So, yes, we remained in touch.  And that is what I can say as a definition, yes.  
Q.	When you returned to Rwanda in February 1994, it was primarily to conduct research and investigations for your PhD; is that not true?  
A.	Yes, ma'am.  
Q.	And this must have been a fairly busy period for you, between February and April?  
A.	Yes, ma'am.  
Q.	You said you had to travel all around the country collecting data.  Correct?  
A.	Yes, madam.  
Q.	And your activities during that time would have also included meeting on a regular basis with your professor for academic discussions; is that not true?  
A.	Yes, madam.  
Q.	You also had to liaise with your colleagues on a regular basis.  
A.	Yes, madam.  
Q.	You said that you were housed in the agricultural unit during that time.  Is that the office that you operated out of during those two months or so?  
A.	Yes, madam, it was the office of a project which was housed at the ministry of agriculture, which was funded by the USAID, and it was located behind the Meridien hotel.  
Q.	And what was your hours of work when -- during that period of research?  
A.	Since I was a researcher I wasn't obligated to be there at 8 in the morning, but I would try and be there as early as possible, between 8 and 8:30, and right up to 5 p.m.  But sometimes I would stay back because I had things to do in respect of my research.  So I went to work depending on the work that I had to do. 
Q.	So normally you would leave Mathieu's home around 8 or so in the morning, and return just sometime after 5 o'clock; is that not so, from what you've just said?  
A.	Yes, it's about that, but we had the directive or instructions not to remain outside too late in the night because the security situation was not sure.  So one had to be back home whilst it was still light, yes.  Before nightfall.  
Q.	So it would be true to say you would not know -- you would not have known what was taking place in your absence at Mathieu's home whilst you were at work?  
A.	Yes, that is true.  During the day I wouldn't know what was happening there, no.  
Q.	And if your uncle was visited by any politician, you would not have known -- it follows, you would not have known if he was visited by any politician or a member of the Interahamwe?  
A.	Yes, I've already said that, and since we are working on theory, what I can say is that Mathieu's family members were open to the extended family.  So if you base yourself on that theory, it is true that I would leave to go and work -- 
Q.	Excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Witness, we're not working on any theory.  I am just simply asking you what you know and what you do not know.  So thank you for that response, but it was not in response to my question.  

Now, you said you went to Eden Garden.  How often would you go to Eden Garden, having regard to the length of your work day?  
A.	I was a member of the family, so I would go there as frequently as I wished.  So if at noon I needed to go and take my meals there I would go there.  If, in the morning, before I went to work I wanted to have breakfast I could go there.  So this means that I was at Eden Garden quite frequently.  I don't know how -- as a person who was working, I couldn't be there all the time, but I was there very frequently, yes. 
Q.	Can you -- can you give me an idea of how frequently you were there?  
A.	Once again, as I was saying a moment ago, it wasn't -- it wasn't somewhere where I went to go and sleep, or to go and chat with people.  Well, where I would go to chat, because that was a place where many young people came to socialise.  But if I was in the field with my investigations I wouldn't be there.  But if it was during the weekend, for instance, I would be there, and sometimes we would go there and we would even go to help out in the restaurant.

1015H 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	So it was more likely that you'd go there on a weekend? 
A.	Not necessarily.  Of course, the weekend is the time when I didn't have too much work.  Yes.  

But during the week, if I was in Kigali, this would be the place where I would go to eat or I would maybe take somebody there if Delphine wanted to go to the house and I had the vehicle and there was no one else there.  So I would be doing these little chores of somebody who was a member of the family.  So I would go there quite frequently.  Yes. 
Q.	And having regard to the research you had to do all over the country, how often would you be in Kigali during those two months? 
A.	I think that my research was done mostly in March.  The first fortnight of March is when I really went outside to carry out my research.  But from mid-February to March, I was working with people who were going to help me out, the enumerators.  And I also was speaking to my professor in order to fine-tune the questionnaire.  

So the second part of February was spent in Kigali.  And the first half of March, that was when I really went outside Kigali, and I came back towards the second part of March in order, this time around, to clean up the data that I had collected and to feed them into the computer. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Okay.  Can we look at the 6th of April now.  Were you still working on your thesis on that day, on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	On the 6th of April, I had finished the collection.  It was, in fact, the day that I had just finished collecting all my data and -- into the computer.  It was a small laptop at the time.  And I had finished this with the assistance of my workmates, collecting the data and putting it into the computer.  

So I was ready to leave, because my flight was supposed to be for the Thursday (sic) on Sabena.  So I left my computer in the office because I was of the view that the following day I was going to come back to say goodbye to my workmates.  So I had finished my investigations or my research. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  What time did you return from -- from work that day?  What time did you return home on the 6th of April 1994, to Mathieu's home? 
A.	I believe -- I'm trying to reconstruct in my memory what happened on that day.  I believe I finished at noon, finished my work, my research work, and I took friends who had helped me to a bar in order to celebrate and to thank them -- thank them from what -- for what they had done for me.  So we socialised for that time.  

And I believe I arrived at Mathieu's home -- first of all, I went to Eden Garden for some family business, and then I went back to Mathieu's home at around six in the evening. 
Q.	And remind me again which members of the family were at home when you got there at six.  
A.	I no longer recall.  I cannot tell you about that.  I no longer recall.  
Q.	You no longer recall who was at home on the 6th of April when you returned home? 
A.	Well, you are saying at the very moment when I arrived at the house or later on in the evening?  Because there is a difference there. 
Q.	What time did you return home from work? 
A.	At 6 p.m. 
Q.	And who was at Mathieu's home when you got home at that time? 
A.	Once again, it's a difficult question.  It's difficult to remember who was there.  It's -- it's difficult to remember who's at home every time you arrive.  I'm sure that the housemaid was there.  

I'm trying to remember because this is a difficult question.  Every day I wasn't going to remember who -- what was happening in Mathieu's house.  So I come home.  That's all. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I agree that you will not be able to recall what happened every day at Mathieu's home.  But don't you think 6th of April is similar to, like, September, the 11th?  I mean, it was a significant day in the lives of Rwandans.  Would you not say that? 
A.	I think maybe I don't answer -- understand the question you're asking me.  Because you said, when I arrived at 1800 hours at Mathieu's house, who was there.  And I said to you that as a family member I wasn't going to -- going to begin to count who is there and who is not there when I arrive at home.  

You are a child; you go to the home; and you go and take your shower and feel at home.  So people are behind the house.  There are others in the house.  I don't know.  

So if you're asking me what was happening after the end of the evening of the 6th, I remember that because people came -- began to come to the house.  There I would be able to tell you.  Because you are telling me, "You get to the house, and did you begin to count who was there?"  That is not -- even -- even in my home, I don't do that. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm not asking you to count anyone.  Was Mathieu at home when you got there at 6 o'clock? 
A.	That is more specific.  I don't think he was there.  But he arrived just a little bit after, because we had these instructions for family members to be back home before nightfall.  So everybody needed to be at home before -- before nightfall.  

So I think that, given the time of 6 p.m., everyone started to come back home.  And as I have said, I arrived home; I went into my room; I took my shower and -- to prepare myself for dinner.  So that was it. 
Q.	Yes.  Okay.  You said that -- and was Mathieu's wife at home when you got there at 6 o'clock, or you can't remember?  We'll just move on if you can't remember.  
A.	I really don't remember who was at home. 
Q.	That's fine.  That's fine.  Okay.  Now, you said that you were all outside when you saw a huge fireball.  When you say outside, where exactly were you all, and who is "we" that you're referring to? 
A.	It was mostly the children, because, we children, we would be outside.  And when I say outside, it would be within the yard, because the house had a fence, an enclosure.  And we would go into the yard, and the children would be playing.  I was talking to Delphine.  So sometimes Mathieu or Rose would join us to talk about what had happened in the day. 
Q.	Sorry.  I'm -- 
A.	So that's where we were. 
Q.	I'm talking about on that particular evening, on the 6th of April when you saw the fireball.  So not what -- not what would normally happen.  I want to know who was outside when you saw the fireball.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes.  I understand.  I understand.  I think it was Delphine, myself, and Frank.  And I believe -- I believe Mathieu had just joined us.  So I think that Rose was inside.  I no longer recall very well. 
Q.	You keep referring to yourself as a child.  How old were you in '94? 
A.	I was a child in comparison to Mathieu.  But this was in 1994.  Let me -- 31 years old. 
Q.	And where -- you saw the huge fireball.  In what direction did you see that? 
A.	In the direction of the airport, which was to the south of the house.  I believe the south, south-east. 
Q.	And when you saw the fireball, you said that Mathieu picked up his phone and called around.  Where -- where was the phone that he was calling from?  Where was it located?  Was it in the living room?  In the kitchen?  Where was the phone he used to call around? 
A.	I think there was a telephone in the sitting room and another in the bedroom.  But -- but, again, he made many phone calls.  And I no longer recall how he made them.  But I know there was a telephone in the sitting room and another in one of the bedrooms. 
Q.	Were you in close proximity to him when he was making those calls? 
A.	No, not really.  As a child I wasn't going to be listening to -- to the calls he was making.  But when he had important information, he would come and inform us of what he'd heard. 
Q.	And what important information did he inform you of?  Because you keep referring to yourself as the eldest there.  So what important information did Mathieu inform you of on the night of the 6th? 
A.	I think that, at around 9 p.m., that's when he said that it would seem that the president's plane had been shot down and that's what we had seen as the fireball.  Because up until then we had thought that maybe it was a war which was beginning or -- we didn't really know what it was.  So he said the fire was that -- it would seem that it was the president's plane that had been shot down.  There you are.
Q.	Did your uncle tell you who gave him that information? 
A.	No.  No.  We didn't need to know. 
Q.	Did your uncle tell you who he called?  He made many calls.  Did he tell you who he was calling? 
A.	No.  And, once again, it wasn't necessary for him to tell us who he was calling. 
Q.	Did Mathieu receive any calls that night? 
A.	I don't think so during that night.  But the following night telephone calls came from people and even from journalists from outside who were calling.  So -- well -- but, once again, it's a little bit difficult to know everything that was happening in the house.  But I do remember that the following day there were many phone calls, including phone calls from foreign journalists.  Yes. 
Q.	But it's not every day your president's plane is shot down.  Were you curious to find out as much as possible about what was happening that night? 
A.	Yes.  Yes.  I was curious, and I trusted my uncle to provide us with the adequate information that he came by from these telephone calls.  And as you have said, since it was a situation which was unusual, we needed to follow certain procedures -- well, the child does not go and pick up the telephone at 
	three or four in the night (sic) to go and speak to friends.  But this is a person who was the head of family, and he needed to talk with people who were managing the affairs that were ongoing. 
Q.	Did Mathieu continue to receive telephone calls throughout that night? 
A.	You mean the night of the 7th?  
Q.	The 6th.  We're still on the night of the 6th.  
A.	The night of the 6th, I told you that I did not know those who were calling.  It was, rather, Mathieu who was calling outside to find out what was happening.  

But when we got to know that the president's plane had been shot down, we realised that it was serious, because the president was dead.  Well, we knew that -- we didn't know that he was dead, but at least we knew that his plane had been shot down.  And they said we needed to observe security measures, switch off the lights, go to bed -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Mr. Witness, my question was, did Mathieu continue to receive telephone calls throughout the night of the 6th of April? 
A.	Either you want me to say things that you believe in, or you are not listening to me.  I'm saying that on the night of the 6th what I saw was Mathieu making calls outside, not calls from the outside coming to Mathieu.  

Now, when he learnt that the plane had been shot down, he said, "Okay.  Security measures".  And we went into security mode.  
Q.	Mathieu -- Mathieu -- 
A.	Well, the rest you cannot ask me. 
Q.	Mathieu took control of the situation that night.  That's what you're saying? 
A.	What situation?  The family situation?  
Q.	You just explained to us you got instructions what to do.  Yes.  
A.	Of the family?  Yes.  Well, as head of the family, he said, "You have to go into security.  I've heard that the presidential plane has been shot down.  We don't know what is going to happen.  I want all of you to take security measures."  Yes. 
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, I'm just being reminded about the time.  I wonder if this is a convenient point. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Yes, it is. 
MS. WILSON:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much -- how much more time do you anticipate that you would need to complete the cross-examination?  
MS. WILSON:
Maybe 30 to 40 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you.  
MS. WILSON:
Please don't hold me to it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1036H to 1106H) 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness.  
A.	Yes, madam. 
Q.	Do you know what -- what time did you go to bed on the night of the 8th -- on the -- on the 6th -- sorry -- 6th of April? 
A.	I think it was around 9 p.m. 
Q.	Did Mr. Ngirumpatse leave his house on the night of the 6th of April? 
A.	No, absolutely not.  I remember that. 
Q.	You said you went to bed at 9 p.m.  Could it be possible that he left the house after you went to bed? 
A.	The dogs -- there was a dog -- there was a bird which made noise when someone left.  I believe that would have woken me up.  So I don't think so.  And then my room was close to the bedroom of the parents.  So I would have heard. 
Q.	But you cannot be absolutely sure, because you said you went to bed at 9 p.m.; right? 
A.	I wasn't sleeping with them -- that is true -- if that is what you mean by that. 
Q.	When you went to bed at 9 p.m., just before going to bed, where was Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	He was there in the house.  And I'm sure that everyone was preparing for bed.  That's including Mathieu and Rose.  So we were preparing, and he was also there preparing to go to bed, like everyone else. 
Q.	Do you know if Mr. Ngirumpatse received any call from Mr. Bagosora that evening? 
A.	As I have told you, I don't know the conversations that Mathieu had with the outside world.  What was of interest to me was he came to tell us, "This is what I have just learnt."  

I wasn't monitoring whom he was receiving calls from or who he was calling.  I was there waiting for the news he was to give us.  So I cannot confirm that, and I do not know. 
Q.	Do you -- you said you know someone by the name of Édouard Karemera.  Yes? 
A.	Yes.  And he came to the house at that time, just like everybody.  Yes.  I know him. 
Q.	I will deal with what time Mr. Karemera came after.  But do you know his wife as well, 
	Brigitte Niyonsaba? 
A.	When I say I know him, it's not a personal or family knowledge that I have of him.  I knew him because he was one of the politicians that were well known in Rwanda.  I had not met him before he had come to the house on the 7th.  

So I don't know his wife.  I knew that he was with a woman and an older woman, but I did not know him at all.  I don't know his family. 
Q.	Okay.  Do you know what position Mr. Karemera occupied in the -- you said you knew him in politics.  Do you know what position he occupied? 
A.	Not at the time, not on the 6th.  I know that sometime before, but maybe a year or two earlier, he had been a secretary to the party, because I was still in Rwanda -- quite frankly, when I left for the United States, politics was not of great interest to me.  I'm not very interested in politics even today.  

So I know that he -- I believe he had been secretary to the political party of the president at a certain moment in time.  And that's when I got to know of that name.  After that, when he came to Mathieu's house on the 6th, I don't know what position he was holding, not at all. 
Q.	Do you know what position your uncle held in 1994, what political position? 
A.	Well, I knew that he was amongst the highest ranking officials of the party.  I don't know -- well, things had really changed a great deal, and I don't know whether the president of the republic was still the president or chairman of the party.  

I don't -- I didn't know whether my uncle was a secretary of the party.  So I was confused.  I didn't really know exactly what his position was, but I knew that he was among the high-ranking officials of the party. 
Q.	And this was your uncle who you knew very well, but you didn't know what position he occupied in the party.  Which party did he belong to? 
A.	No.  I knew he was a member of the president's party, the MRND.  And I knew that he was among the highest ranking officials, but as for the title or designation, maybe -- well, with your questions maybe I need to understand exactly what you're seeking, because I thought you were asking me about the title he held.  So I cannot tell you whether he was secretary general, whether he was the chairman or president, because as I've told you and I'm repeating it again, I'm not interested in politics and I was no longer interested in politics.  So you must understand me. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you for that.  We have testimony in this trial that on the 6th of April 1994 Mrs. -- Karemera's wife, who is called Brigitte Niyonsaba, she testified, and she acknowledged a statement, a prior statement, she made to the Belgian authorities in which she stated that Rose Ngirumpatse told her that Mathieu had gone out on the night of the 6th of April.  What do you have to say about that? 
A.	I'm not going to -- speculation.  If the lady said that, you have to go and ask her, bring her here to -- so she can confirm that.  I didn't see Mathieu leave, and I didn't have any discussion with Rose in that regard.  So I have no speculation in that respect.  

If I had been the one to confirm that -- I think you need to ask them about their version of the truth.  I didn't see that happen. 
Q.	This is not speculation.  This is testimony from Mrs. Karemera about what she gleaned and learnt from Ms. -- Mrs. Ngirumpatse.  So I'm just asking you:  How would you comment on that? 
A.	Maybe it's not speculation for you.  But for me it is speculation, because I have told you right from the outset that I didn't see Mathieu leave on the 6th of April.  So if there's someone who stated that, that is not my opinion. 
Q.	You have no reason to believe that Rose Ngirumpatse would lie to Mrs. Karerera (sic), do you? 
A.	I have no reason either to believe that Rose would have said that.  So, once again, you are asking me to speculate on Rose's situation.  And I don't know -- I don't know what answer you want from me to that question. 
Q.	After retiring to bed on the 6th, which you say it was around 9 p.m., when next did you see Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	In the morning we woke up at sunrise.  This was around 6:30, 7.  Everyone was there.  So I saw him again at around 6:30, 7.  Yes. 
Q.	And the same members of the household who were present the evening before, they were there on the morning of the 7th? 
A.	Yes, madam. 
Q.	You mentioned someone by the name of Monique.  Monique was the sister of Rose Ngirumpatse, wasn't she? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	When did Monique arrive at Mr. Ngirumpatse's home? 
A.	Just a little after I arrived.  So that would have been about 6:30 p.m. or thereabouts. 
Q.	And that would be on the 6th of April?  Was it? 
A.	Yes.  And she told us that she had had a dispute -- family dispute with her husband.  And since the Mathieu family were like her parents, she had sought refuge at their home, because she had had a disagreement with her husband. 
Q.	So you're saying that she arrived at Mr. Ngirumpatse's home prior to the plane being shot down or prior to your knowledge of the president's death? 
A.	Yes.  That is true. 
Q.	And did she come alone or -- you said she came with a -- with a child or two.  Can you clarify that for me.  Who did she come with? 
A.	Not by (sic) two children but by a small boy who was less than one year old, because she was feeding the child.  And the two children I mentioned, they were taken up later when we got to Eden Garden on the 12th of April.  

So when she arrived at our home, in the home of Mathieu, she was with a small baby of a few months old.  And the other children, I imagine, had remained with -- in fact, I'm sure, because we went to fetch them from the home of their parents. 
Q.	Can you repeat that again.  Who went to fetch them at the home of the parents? 
A.	I don't have details in that regard.  But I believe Monique left.  So when we reached Eden Garden towards the evening, Monique left either with Rose -- because I was inside, and she came back with the children.  So she went to go and fetch her children.  And apparently, the father had been killed.  So the children were at their home alone.  So she brought them and brought them -- she took them and brought them to Eden Garden. 
Q.	Okay.  Who took the children from their homes to bring them to Eden Garden? 
A.	Once again, you are asking me for things for which I don't have details.  What I said about Eden Garden is this:  Eden Garden had two levels.  There was one where the restaurant was and the lower ground, underground, where there was a nightclub and there was a store in which agricultural produce was placed.  

So what I recall is that at a given point in time Monique told us that she has to go and fetch her children to see what had happened to her family.  She came back, and I don't know whether she had left alone, whether she had been given gendarmes to accompany her, whether someone else, like Rose or someone else, left with her.  All I know is that afterwards I saw the two children she had brought and they began to tell us what happened -- had happened to their father. 
Q.	Where did Monique live in relation to Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I think that Monique -- well, once again, even though I was Mathieu's nephew, we were not necessarily close to one another.  But I believe that her house was on the opposite side from Mathieu's house.  So it would take approximately -- I don't know.  Maybe it was 10 kilometres or so.  So Eden Garden was in the middle of the two houses, which were in opposite directions. 
Q.	Was that the first time you saw Monique at Mathieu's house during the period that you were there? 
A.	No.  Monique was like a child of that house.  So she would come.  And if she didn't come to the home, because maybe that was a bit far, we would meet at Eden Garden.  So I had seen her before that.  Yes. 
Q.	What was the name of Monique's husband? 
A.	Oh, my goodness.  I think it was Vic -- Victoire -- Vic -- Victor.  But -- yeah.  I think -- I think it was Victor. 
Q.	Had Victor been to -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Victoire (sic). 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Had Victor been to Mathieu's home during the period that you were there? 
A.	In the home?  I don't remember.  But at Eden Garden, yes. 
Q.	Because you indicated in your direct that Mathieu had members of the extended family at his home on a regular basis.  Was Victor one of those persons who came to his home on a regular basis, like Monique, her hus -- his -- his wife? 
A.	Yes.  He was part of the extended family.  But yes. 
Q.	That's not the question I asked.  If he came to Ngirumpatse's home during the period that you were there.  
A.	I said that I saw Victor quite frequently at Eden Garden and that he was also part of the family.  I no longer recall whether I had seen Victor at the very home, and even Monique -- I no longer recall that I had seen her at the home.  I recall that I only saw her at the home on the 6th when she came there.  

But I do remember that she had seen -- I had seen her at Eden Garden because that was -- that was mid -- midway.  But I think I would have seen her more frequently at Eden Garden rather than at the home.  That is what I mean. 
Q.	And you would have seen Monique more than you would have seen Victor.  In fact, you only saw Victor at Eden Garden, according to your evidence.  
A.	Not necessarily.  I saw Monique because she came to the home on -- on the 6th.  But prior to that it was at Eden Garden.  So I would see that I -- I would say that I would see them in the same way.  

But Monique was the -- was Rose's younger sister, so it was quite normal that she would come to visit her older sister much more frequently than her husband would.  So yes.  She came to Eden Garden much more frequently than her husband did.  Yes. 
Q.	What was the relationship like between Mr. Ngirumpatse and Victor? 
A.	I would say, you know, the same way as a father-in-law and a son-in-law.  But, once again, please don't make me make analyses that I had not done at that time.  So I would see them.  They would talk as he spoke to me.  So for me I didn't have any reason for making any analysis in respect of anything whatsoever.  Father, son, son-in-law, father-in-law, that's all I could say. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you're not aware of what the relationship is like, it's okay to say that you're not.  
A.	What I mean is, I saw them speak.  When Victor was at Eden Garden, he would come and he would sit and we would speak. 
Q.	What -- 
A.	On that basis I don't know. 
Q.	What ethnicity was Victor? 
A.	I really don't know.  But I think that many people thought he was a Tutsi.  But I don't know.  But that is the tragedy of Rwanda.  It is difficult to know.  Unless you had known the person for generations, it is difficult to tell who is a Tutsi, who is a Hutu.  I don't know. 
Q.	Do you know what political party Victor belonged to? 
A.	I'm not aware.  I don't know.  It's outside my knowledge. 
Q.	Do you know the circumstances under which Victor was killed? 
A.	From what his children said, he was killed by soldiers.  But they did not specify what types of soldiers.  
Q.	And -- and do you know where he was killed? 
A.	Once again, I would rely on the children's account.  It appears he was killed in his house.  So in front of the two children. 
Q.	Do you know someone by the name of Georges Twagiramuhoza, the brother of Rose? 
A.	Oh, yes.  Georges.  I know Georges.  But there, again, to know -- because I have a feeling that you are interpreting my words differently from what I intend.  What I mean is, I used to see Georges as members of the extended family who would visit Mathieu.  I have seen Georges, but we were not friends, first of all, because he was older than me.  I did not know him previously.  I know him. 
Q.	Georges was married to someone by the name of Jeanne who was also called Mama Rouby.  Do you know her? 
A.	Quite honestly, I don't know that.  I don't even know what happened to Georges until recently when I sought to know if he is there.  And I think they told me that Georges was killed during the war.  

So I know he was Rose's brother.  I know his name.  But I don't know him that much to the point of knowing his wife and children.  No. 
Q.	And coming back to Victor, what -- from what you heard, what date was he killed? 
A.	I don't know.  Because the children's account -- well, first of all, the boy, who was the older one, the subsequent days, he was so shocked he could no longer speak.  They only talked about how they saw people come, what they did to their parents, and I don't know the dates or day. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, Georges's wife was interviewed by the OTP on the 20th of August 1998.  And I'd just like to briefly put to you what she said for your comment in her statement.  Is that okay?  

She said, "The morning after the President Habyarimana's death, on the 7th of April 1994, Mathieu" -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I'm sorry, My Colleague.  I do not have that statement.  Is it possible for us to have it?  This was not disclosed to us, unless I have forgotten. 
MS. WILSON:
It was not, in fact, disclosed.  It's just a proposition I would like to put to the witness.  I do not know if you -- if you do want to have statements, I do have copies.  I don't intend to put it into evidence or anything. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I think that even though you do not intend to move that document into evidence that the rules require that you disclose documents that you intend to use during your cross-examination to me.  That's an important document.  

So respect of the rules demand that you disclose that to me.  I don't know what you mean that because you're not moving the document into -- onto the records and, therefore, you don't have to disclose it to me.  

Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have tried to require the practice of disclosure of the documents intended to be used during cross-examination -- 
MS. WILSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- at the commencement of your cross-examination.  And we think it's -- it's reasonable that the other party should be able to follow your line of questioning more effectively when that takes place.  So we would recommend that you pass the documents.  
MS. WILSON:
Very well, Mr. President. 

With the assistance of Mr. Issa. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I'm now coming back to your decision.  I realise that this document was in the custody of my colleague.  And I -- professionally, I do not think that it is proper to proceed the way he (sic) did.  And I'd like to point out that this is not the first time she's proceeding in this manner.  

And if we have to work in harmony and in peace, then she ought to respect the fundamental rules.  I would not have been saying this if I did not realise that she had the copies.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MS. WILSON:
I apologise to my learned friend.  I did have them with me.  And because of when I started, I did not pass them over to you.  

I am looking at page 4 of the English statement. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not have a copy.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And, Your Honour, the interpreters as well, please. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your version it's at -- towards the top of page 4.  There's a red mark next to it.  And in the English version, it's the last paragraph, beginning "The morning after President Habyarimana's death".  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's not the document we have. 
MS. WILSON:
Oh, I'm sorry. 
(Pages 16 to 27 by Tanya West)




















1145H 
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, I have passed up two copies, but instead of reading it I would just like to paraphrase it. Rather than reading from the document, I would just give the substance of what was stated there. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Has everybody now got the same documents?  
MS. WILSON:
I don't know if my colleagues can indicate whether they have got the same documents. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, My Learned Friend, we have the document in French.  And my client's reaction is to point out that the woman whose testimony you want to confront this witness with I -- had divorced much earlier and she was not the -- the wife.  She was not Georges's wife, so I do not see the relevance. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mrs. -- you can't provide information to the witness at this stage.  That's a matter which should emerge from the questioning of the witness, if it's accurate. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness, do you see the relevant portion where it begins:  "The morning after 
	President Habyarimana's death on 7th of April 1994, Mathieu's brother-in-law was killed by the militiamen.  He lived in his house with his children, who were spared.  The children were immediately picked up by Mathieu a few days before that.  I'm not sure of the exact date.  Victor's wife, Monique, left their marital home and went to live with her sister, Mathieu's wife.  Victor was not on good terms with Mathieu.  Mathieu reproached him for belonging to a party which was opposed to the MRND.  I suspected Mathieu was behind Victor's murder, and the reason for my suspicion is the sudden departure of Victor's wife, the fact that Victor's house was attacked on the first day of the genocide, and especially the militiamen who normally did not spare anyone, did not kill his children that day.  In my view, they must have received instructions to that effect."  

Can you kindly comment to what was stated there. 
A.	First of all, I do not know this woman.  I have never seen her, never met her.  That is my first reaction, because, as I was saying, I did not know even Georges that well, much less the wife and children, or not at all.  So I do not know this woman, but beyond that what surprises me is she speaks as if she was -- she was present.  I was with Monique, I saw her come to the house shouting -- crying. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness. 

THE WITNESS:
He (sic) was telling us -- and that was not the first time   And Victoire -- or Victor -- he and -- she and Victoire -- and Victor -- or Victor used to fight a lot. 

It was an unfortunate coincidence that when she came to the house I had left my ticket at -- and passport at Sabena.  That was not my initial intention.  But what surprises me, and the certainty in what this woman is saying, as if she observed Mathieu going to pick the children.  What I do not know is -- as I said earlier, I don't know who accompanied Monique to go and fetch the children.  Monique went to fetch the children, just like everyone would, and brought them to Eden Garden.  So as far as I'm concerned this paragraph is speculative and I do not want to waste my time trying to analyse words said by somebody.  I do not know who is in Rwanda, not knowing under what conditions she gave the statement.  I do not know.  That's my opinion. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

But you agree that Jeanne Bazubagira was part of Mathieu's extended family, was she not? 
A.	Who is Jeanne Bazubagira?  
Q.	Mama Rouby, the same statement you just read. 
A.	And what was your question again, because I seem to be lost?  
Q.	The person who gave that statement was the wife of Rose's brother; is that not so, Georges?  
A.	Counsel, either you're following my testimony or you're not.  I told you that I saw Georges, but I don't know him.  I saw him and I was told "This is Rose's brother."  I never saw the wife.  Never saw her.  So don't ask me the same question three or four times. 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Georges was a member of Rose's family.  Rose -- Georges was her brother.  You spoke about -- you're the one who spoke about extended family. 
A.	Yes, but that does not mean that I know everybody. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Well, that's your answer.  But normally one would expect if Mathieu knows the extended family, he would know Georges's wife. 

We will move on. 
A.	May I react to that?  Counsel is trying to confuse my ideas.  I did not say that I knew Georges and his family.  I said that as a witness I did not know Georges.  Well, I saw him.  I knew him as Rose's brother, but we did not know each other in any particular manner, or friendly manner.  Given the fact that I was not part of Mathieu's nucleus family, I was a -- a nephew, so honestly I never saw his wife.  Even if he were in this courtroom, I would not be able to point her out because I never saw her. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 

We move on.  On the 7th of April 1994, you said several persons came to the home of Mathieu.  Around what time did they become -- did they begin coming to his home? 
A.	I think that was around late afternoon.  And that continued through the night.  I no longer recollect the times, but I'm sure that the Shingiro family came late afternoon, and after that people started coming in. 

Most of the time I did not see them arrive.  I was in -- inside, and I only saw them when they were already inside. 

But if your question was when they started coming, I think the answer is in the afternoon of the 7th. 
Q.	Did Mathieu leave his home any time during the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	No.  I don't know.  The 7th, maybe not.  I know that at some point in time when we were in 
	Mathieu's house from the 6th to the 10th, I know that at some point the gendarme came for Mathieu.  That was when I was asking him where he was going and he was telling me that according to the constitution he has to go and put in place a transitional government because the president was not there.  So they had to set up a government. 

I don't remember if that was the 7th or the 8th, but I know it was during that period that we were in the house.  He did -- he went and that is what he told me. 
Q.	Please remind me, when did you leave Mathieu's home for Hôtel des Diplomates? 
A.	It was towards the end of the day of the 10th April. 
Q.	Now, between the 6th and the 10th of April, how many times did Mathieu leave his home?  That's before going to Hôtel des Diplomates.  
A.	Once before the 10th.  I recall that because he told me that that was when he was going to meet the other politicians for them to set up a provisional government.  And that he came home.  And then again on the 10th he left once again.  And that was when someone came with a convoy and said everyone has to leave towards the centre, because the security situation around that place was becoming precarious. 

So I think we joined Mathieu at the Diplomates.  But once again, I don't have clear recollections of that. 
Q.	So you said once before the 10th he left for a meeting.  Can you tell us how he -- how he became aware of that meeting. 
A.	I think because the telephone had been disconnected it is the gendarmes who came for him.  That is my recollection. 
Q.	What were you doing whilst all of this was happening, because were you aware of everything that was going on in the house, or were you preoccupied with some activity?  
A.	As I said earlier on, I was managing the house because there were a lot of people in the house.  So we needed somebody to take care of the minor details to ensure that people eat, people are able to take a shower, and so on and so forth.  But that did not mean that I could not see.  That is why I am saying that when I saw the gendarme arrive to take Mathieu, he wore his suit and I started wondering what was happening, because up until that point no one could go out of the house without we knowing what was happening. 
Q.	There's evidence in this court that Mathieu attended a meeting on the 7th as well as the 8th of April.  That means he had to have left the house on those two occasions.  What do you have to say about that? 
A.	You said the 7th and 8th?  
Q.	Yes. 
A.	I recall only once when he -- when he went out.  It may have been the 7th or 8th.  My recollection is that he went out once.  It may have been on that occasion when I spoke to him, but I cannot remember any other -- I cannot remember him going out on any other occasion.  

The other one was when he left on the 10th, I believe, and that is when a convoy was sent to us, for all of us, to leave to the Diplomates. 
Q.	And do you recall when Frédéric arrived at the Mathieu's -- at Mathieu's house? 
A.	The very moment he came to the house, no, but I saw him in the evening because he was sitting in a corner, was not talking to anyone, and it was a new face.  As I said earlier, there were more than 
	20 persons in the house and it was a small house with a certain number of rooms.  So I saw Frédéric at night sitting in the corner and I was wondering who this little boy was.  Well, he was in such -- so little -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I really would like you to keep your answers short.  I just wanted to know if you knew exactly when he came.  Now, you saw him in the evening, the evening of what day? 
A.	I do not know the exact time at which he arrived at home.  If that is a brief answer that you wish, if I do not know the exact hour.  
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness, I wanted to know what date.  Was it the 7th that he arrived, the evening of the 7th? 
A.	I'm trying to remember all the events, because you see how things happened quickly one after the other.  Yes, it was the 7th -- I think people began to come on the 7th.  So it's either on the evening of the 7th or the 8th, one of those two days. 
Q.	And can you tell us under what circumstances he came to be there.  You saw -- did you see who brought him to the house, or how he came to be there? 
A.	I don't know.  That's what I was trying to tell you earlier.  But if you want us to go like -- go about it like this, I would say I don't know, I don't know the conditions under which he came into the house. 
Q.	Are you aware of -- if a call was received by Justin Mugenzi at -- did a call come from Justin? 
A.	No.  I don't know. 
Q.	Okay.  Let's -- let's hear about this convoy.  You said on the 10th Mathieu left in a convoy.  Yes?  
A.	Yes.  There are gendarmes who came to take him, like they did the first time, and he left with them, yes. 
Q.	How many -- did he leave alone or who -- who else formed part of that convoy? 
A.	I think that he was alone.  I think he was alone. 
Q.	And what vehicle did he leave in on the 10th? 
A.	No, I no longer remember that.  I remember the vehicle that took me.  But I don't know which vehicle he left in, no. 
Q.	Was Mathieu the owner of a black Mercedes? 
A.	Yes.  He had a black Mercedes, yes. 
Q.	On the date all the occupants of this house left, what vehicle did you leave in? 
A.	Everyone went in the Pajero.  So we went off in the Pajero, and it was the only vehicle which left from the house. 
Q.	But you cannot remember what kind of vehicle Mathieu left in when you said a convoy came for him? 
A.	No.  But I know that it was a vehicle that belonged to the gendarmes who had come to fetch him.  So he didn't take his own vehicle, because the two -- of course he had the Pajero and he had a Peugeot which belonged to the state, an official car.  And he had his Mercedes, and there was another smaller Mercedes which was there.  So all these vehicles were there at the time when we left the home.  So we left the vehicles there and we left in the Pajero. 
Q.	And approximately how many people left in that Pajero? 
A.	Yes.  It was members of our family, so Monique and her little boy, Rose, Frank, Delphine and myself, yes. 
Q.	And what about Monica (sic)? 
A.	I've already mentioned her, Monique and her little son. 
Q.	Now, sometime as you were leaving your home to go to Hôtel des Diplomates, did you observe any roadblocks? 
A.	No, I don't think that we were able to see any roadblocks from the house to the centre of town.  But can I go back a little to the preceding question about how many people were in the vehicle, because I no longer recall whether we also had Frédéric or whether Frédéric had left with the Shingiros.  So that was a clarification I wanted to make. 
Q.	Yes.  So you left with, according to you, with one vehicle to Hôtel des Diplomates, and when you were leaving Kigali did the same people who entered that vehicle to go to the hotel leave to go to Gitarama? 
A.	Yes.  I no longer recall whether Frédéric was in the Pajero as we left the house to go to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  If he had been there he was taken and we were apparently told that it was taken back to the Belgian embassy.  And when we left the restaurant to go to Gitarama, we had not only Mathieu this time around in the vehicle, because when we left the home he was not in the vehicle.  But now he's in the vehicle and we had two other children of Monique who had joined -- joined us.  So there were more members of the family who were in the Pajero this time around when we left for Gitarama. 
Q.	When was the first time you observed dead bodies around Kigali? 
A.	It was when we were leaving the restaurant to go towards Gitarama that I, personally, saw dead bodies in the Muhima neighbourhood by the roadside. 
Q.	Were they women and children, or men? 
A.	It's a little bit difficult to say, because in the vehicle we were going fast.  Unless one can see the clothing which could identify the body as a woman, or the size of the cadaver to tell one that it was a child, but it was very difficult to say.  But I know that some of the dead bodies had been burned and so it was not very difficult -- it was not very easy to see -- to tell what it was.  But it was -- it was not a fantastic sight, I can assure you that. 
Q.	And how many roadblocks did you encounter when you were leaving Kigali to go to Gitarama? 
A.	The roadblock that I remember is the one on the Nyabarongo river, which is between Gitarama and Kigali.  So it is really the only roadblock that I remember. 
Q.	Was there a roadblock just outside of Mathieu's house? 
A.	No, I didn't see it. 
Q.	Did you see any dead bodies outside of Mathieu's house? 
A.	If you say just outside the house, no.  But I went to go and see Frédéric's parents.  Yes, I went to see them in his house.  And, indeed, his parents had been killed, yes.  But not outside Mathieu's house, no. 
Q.	And at the -- you said you only saw one roadblock.  At that roadblock, who manned that?  You said there were soldiers manning that roadblock. 
A.	Yes.  The roadblock at the Nyabarongo river, yes, it was manned by soldiers. 
Q.	Did you see civilians manning that roadblock as well? 
A.	As I have said earlier, there were people with bags, children, women, peasants who were walking towards Gitarama.  There were peasants there who were waiting to cross the river, yes. 
Q.	And do you agree that around the time you left Kigali for Gitarama, there were many people driving and leaving Kigali as well? 
A.	Yes.  And even at the roadblock there were other vehicles which were waiting to pass through the roadblock to go towards Gitarama, yes. 
Q.	So the traffic was not moving very fast as you got towards that roadblock, was it? 
A.	I would say yes, because one needed to stop.  When you see a roadblock you needed to stop.  You had to go very slowly so that you could get to know what was happening at the roadblock.  So, yes, that traffic was somewhat slow, yes. 
Q.	And you said that the persons at the roadblock, they spoke to Mathieu? 
A.	Yes.  What I said is that -- first of all, there were vehicles in front of us, and every time a vehicle would go to the roadblock there would be a soldier who would come to speak to the passengers.  I don't know what he wanted to know, but there was a soldier who would come to speak to the passengers.  Then they would leave.  But, indeed, there was a soldier who came to see us and he asked us where we were going.  So when Mathieu -- so when he came, Mathieu said he was the one and the soldier seemed to recognise him -- recognise him.  And he said that we are a part of the government convoy and we were delayed somewhat.  And the soldier said "that's okay", and so he let us go through. 
Q.	Do you know somewhere called ETO, located near to Mathieu's house? 
A.	Yes.  I know ETO.  It was referred to as ETO, the École technique officielle.  Yes, it was approximately 2 kilometres from Mathieu's home, yes. 
Q.	Whilst at Mathieu's home, did you become aware of several thousand persons, primarily Tutsis, being killed at the ETO by militiamen, by soldiers and members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  When I was at Mathieu's home, no.  But I saw that in a film, a documentary, which was made later.  I think it was two years ago, that's when I really got to know that there were killings at the ETO.  But before that I didn't know that. 
Q.	So no one in the household told you about such killings whilst you were there? 
A.	No, not to my knowledge, no.  No one spoke to me of that, no. 
Q.	When did you become aware of the extent of the massacre in Rwanda in the -- during the month of April?
A.	Quite frankly, it was when I had gone back to the United States and when I began to see images on television, because before that in those few days, that week -- those weeks in which I was -- that week in which I was in Rwanda I saw dead bodies as we were going to Gitarama.  But as for the other stories, I got to know about them when I went back to the United States.  So it was afterwards when I arrived in the United States that I began to see images of bodies in the river and all that. 
Q.	And did you become aware of the large numbers of persons killed were Tutsis? 
A.	Yes.  Well, unless you take it that I cannot read.  I know that all the newspapers spoke of the numbers.  I know at a given point in time it reached 800,000.  Yes, I -- it was a large number. 
Q.	And you -- you said you don't know much about -- you didn't know much about politics and you still don't know much about politics; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Madam.  I try to avoid politics as much as I can. 
Q.	And you said about on two or three occasions in your evidence you -- you didn't know about the Interahamwe, you never heard about it? 
A.	No, no.  You are putting words in my mouth, because what I said is that when I arrived in Rwanda, all political parties had youth wings, young militiamen.  And I had heard mention of the Interahamwe.  Even ordinary people would refer to the MRND as the party of the Interahamwe.  So it's not possible -- to quote my professor of political sciences when I was in school, it was said that if you're not interested in politics, politics will be interested in you.  So it is not possible -- it was not possible to live in Rwanda at that time and not have at least some idea of what was happening, especially if one were an intellectual.  So I said that I wasn't involved in politics, I didn't practice politics.  But this doesn't mean that I don't read, that I don't listen to the news on CNN.  And I follow all that.  And I have the right to vote, so I do vote.  So I cannot say that I -- well, to clarify matters, I don't have any political ambition.  There you are. 
Q.	Thank you so much, Mr. Witness, for your last answer. 
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, Mr. Witness, these are my questions for the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Wilson. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, do you have any redirect?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President.  But I'll be very brief in that. 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during your stay at Mathieu's house from February 1994 to April 1994, was Mathieu involved in any professional activity? 
A.	Yes.  I believe, as I have said, he was one of the high-ranking officials of the president's party, the MRND.  I knew about that. 
Q.	You have just defined the political activity, but apart from the political activity, there was also the professional activity.  Did he exercise any profession? 
A.	Yes, I know that he was also a private lawyer and I recall that he represented even a company -- a European company which wanted to have a contract signed in the area of telecommunications in Rwanda.  Yes, I know he was a private lawyer, apart from his political life. 
Q.	As a private lawyer, did he have his professional offices in his house? 
A.	No, I don't think so.  As I have said earlier, Mathieu had his professional life, and family life, and they were separate.  The only reason that I know, is that he spoke about it.  He said that he was going to welcome the representative -- representative of that company at the airport.  And I remember I was at the airport because I was jogging and I saw the representative there at the airport. 
Q.	Very well.  Did Mr. Ngirumpatse go to his place of work every day, and did you observe that rhythm?  If that is the case, please describe it to the Chamber.
A.	Yes, we would leave approximately at the same time.  Sometimes he would even leave before I had the permission to use his vehicle for -- for my project.  He would give me a lift to work.  So we would leave more or less at the same time, yes. 
Q.	On 6th April, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse go to his place of work? 
A.	Yes, he went.  And I'm sure that he came back after me, once again before nightfall.  So, yes, he went to work like everyone -- like he did every day, yes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I'm done. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms Hounkpatin. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes.  And the normal request is the permission for Mr. Murembya to meet his uncle at the end of the morning session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. 

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony before the Tribunal.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  But you're now excused and you are free to leave.  The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate the request made by counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I notice that we have a few minutes remaining before the lunch break and I wondering if I could address the Court on a matter for -- since it's unlikely we'll be able to start with another witness in the short time. 

I received the judgement -- excuse me, the interlocutory decision of the Appeals Chamber this morning, and I've already discussed it with the Defence, so they have received it, and I assume that the Court as well has -- has reviewed the decision.  And I would like to go back to a discussion we had informally last week and request that the Chamber issue a scheduling order specifying clear deadlines by which the Defence teams would submit a new list of witnesses or a list of additional witnesses if they plan to call any of Joseph Nzirorera's witnesses or suggest additional witnesses to deal with the allegations against them in the indictment.  I would hope that we could do that within the next ten days or so.  

And I would also request the Court to set up another informal meeting of the parties, or a 
status conference where we could discuss planning issues for the duration of the trial, and if we could do that before the end of this session, which ends on Thursday.  So that's my request. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, indeed we have seen the decision from the Appeals Chamber.  I don't know whether your coordinator, Mr. Constant, had conveyed to you the discussions that we had, because we did some of it in writing. 
We have indicated the various possible scenarios, given the contents of the decision, whether it comes out, and on the basis of the decision -- rendering of the decision that we are expecting in respect of Rule 94 bis.  But we are not proceeding with the same speed as the Prosecutor and I do believe that it is necessary that we do speak about these issues. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, since we are also dealing with any other business, as mentioned by the Prosecutor, he mentioned the issue concerning our Witness LA mentioned in the email of 22nd September.  At the end of the day we wish to have this Witness LA, but we also learned on the same day a little bit before the email from Mr. Webster that Witness Ruzibiza died on the 
	22nd of September. 

Before his death, he left instructions with the investigate -- investigating magistrate.  That he mentioned specifically Witness LA under conditions which show us that, more than ever, before the hearing of Witness LA is necessary.  And we are coming to ask the Chamber to order the disclosure of some of the proceedings.  And in the investigation procedure, which was done with Witness Ruzibiza before his death -- his death, and which may have an impact on the testimony of Witness LA, contrary to what was being said by Mr. Webster on LA, it is much more important that witness -- given the fact that Ruzibiza died a few minutes before Mr. Webster sent us this email, it is -- it is very important that we hear Witness LA. 

Thank you. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I have just heard Mr. Webster say that he discussed with the Defence.  Maybe I'm not included in that Defence, because I don't remember having once again discussed with him on the decision coming from the Appeals Chamber.  What I did, rather, is to approach my client on Saturday so that I can discuss somewhat with him, but as you well know, given the perennial problem of interpretation, we found it more useful and necessary -- professional to have the translation in French.  

This is why this morning I filed the form asking for urgent translation of that ruling so that we can be fully aware of its contents and any consequence -- consequences arising therefrom.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, you are aware of the efforts that we have been making towards moving towards a scheduling order.  From the responses from Defence, it seems that they are not ready as yet.  But it is certainly important that this is concluded during the course of this week.  And we will have our coordinator liaise with everybody to select the earliest date when we could have meaningful discussions leading towards the scheduling process. 

We take the luncheon break now.

(Court resumed at 1403H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, good afternoon, Your Honours.  Maybe I would anticipate somewhat, Mr. President -- and I apologise for the absence of Chantal Hounkpatin, the appearances have somewhat changed and this afternoon she has asked me to apologise on her behalf to the Court for her absence.  In her stead, Mr. President, I will be leading Witness MCE in chief.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will assist you to do that.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
(Declaration made by François-Xavier Byuma in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

You will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you, firstly, by Counsel Weyl who represents Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
FRANÇOIS-XAVIER BYUMA,
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon.  
Q.	Witness, before we begin your examination-in-chief, let me make some routine suggestions to you.  But before that, I would like to ask you to tell the Court whether you would prefer to testify anonymously under the pseudonym MCE or whether you would prefer to testify in your true name and with your identity known to the public?  
A.	I would like to testify under my true name and with my identity known to the public.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I revert to the Bench, and respectfully apply for the witness to be authorised to testify under his own name subsequent to a previous authorisation by the Trial Chamber granting protective measures to this witness.  I therefore apply that the measure be rescinded and the witness authorised to testify in his own name.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, have you ever testified before in this Tribunal -- in any other case in this Tribunal? 
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
THE WITNESS:
This is the first time, Mr. President, that I'm testifying here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We rescind the order for protective measures that we've made on behalf of this witness.  

Mr. Registrar, you can pull the curtains.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I would like to ask you to tell the Court what your names are.  And please spell out your names and then please, in the course of your testimony, whenever you use a proper noun that is unknown to the Trial Chamber, please kindly spell it out as well.  

So I would like to ask you now to tell the Court your full names.  
A.	My names are Byuma, François-Xavier:  B-Y-U-M-A for Byuma, François-Xavier.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Byuma.  I hope that I will be able to refer to you as Mr. Byuma throughout our examination-in-chief.  Now, Mr. Byuma -- 
A.	Present.
Q.	-- what is your current address and what is your place of residence, if one may say so? 
A.	My current situation is that I am a detainee.  I am a prisoner at the Kigali central prison in the 
Republic of Rwanda.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, you have before you a document.  Please kindly read through it carefully and cross-check the information therein.  If there are any mistakes, please kindly correct them.  If you do not notice any mistakes, I would ask you to date this document as 27 September 2010 and to sign it -- to sign it.  
A.	The place of birth is incorrect; it's the former Nyakabanda.  So there's a correction to be made at that level, which I have done.  
Q.	You can make that correction yourself on the document.  Maybe, I think, there is also a mistake as to your current address, but I leave it to you to tell the Court.  
A.	My occupation in 1994 is also incorrect, because at the time I was head of the division for twinning and NGOs.  The ministry referred to on the document is correct.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Issa, please, would you kindly show the corrected document to the Bench and to the parties.  And I would also apply for the document to be admitted as D. NG125 -- exhibit -- if Mr. Issa agrees.  
MR. MJUI:
The exhibit number is correct.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG125 admitted)
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Thank you, Mr. Issa.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness -- or, rather, Mr. Byuma, before we proceed for real with your examination-in-chief, let me make two recommendations to you:  First, both of us use the French language and my questions and your answers are being interpreted and recorded by the court reporters.  To enable the court reporters and the interpreters to do their job properly, you may want to observe a pause between my question and your answer.  And I'll do my best on my part to observe a pause as well, but the interpreters know that I am not a man of great discipline in this area.  

Then, secondly, I want to tell you that, in order to facilitate the work in the courtroom, we also need 
to speak slowly because if we speak too fast it will not be easy for your testimony and my questions to be properly interpreted.  

I also ask you to kindly spell out any proper nouns you may use.  And if we do forget, I'll remind you so that you may write down those names and then spell them out easily for the benefit of the Court.  

Now, Mr. Byuma, I'd like to ask you to tell the Court in -- in broad strokes what your educational background is and to give the Court an idea of who the witness before the Court is.  So give the Court an idea of your educational and professional backgrounds.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  In the area of education I spent two years at the National University of Rwanda in the Faculty of Arts -- or letters.  And I read French, history and geography from 1974 to 1976 -- '74, '75, '76.  
Q.	What certificate did you obtain? 
A.	Unfortunately, I was not able to obtain a certificate because I dropped out of school for two years. 
I was subsequently hired to serve as a civil servant, that is, after two years of university studies.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, what about your professional background?  And, once again, as briefly as possible, but providing meaningful information that can enable the Court to understand what your career has been from the time you left school up until the '90s.  
A.	After my university studies I was hired as a state civil servant and assigned to a training centre in Nyakabanda commune as it was known then.  Three months after, I was transferred to the ministry, which was then known as the ministry of social affairs and community development.  When I got to that ministry, I was appointed inspector of the social development centres as they were then known, which later on became communal development and training -- and ongoing training centres, otherwise known as CCDFP.  In my capacity as inspector of those centres, I had to conduct monitoring and evaluation by visiting the centres on the ground and assessing the impact of their work in relation to the development of our country. 

Then in 1982, I was transferred from the ministry of social affairs and community development to the ministry of the interior and communal development.  In that ministry I was promoted to the rank of head of the bureau for external financing, and then head of the division for twinning and NGOs.  I held that position, which involved promotion of relations and decentralised collaboration, that is, linking our communes and our cities with other cities in foreign countries, a process known as twinning.  

That is the position I occupied till 1995.  So up until 1990, I was in charge of -- or, rather, I was 
the head of the division for twinning and NGOs.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Byuma.  That gives us a picture of your background up until 1995.  We will revisit that picture, but am I to understand from your testimony so far that, while you were at the ministry of the interior, you were in active service even during the transition from a one-party system to a multiparty system? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you please tell the Court or remind the Court -- I -- I am sure that you can do so by yourself -- can you remind the Court at what time the transition occurred from the one-party system to a 
multiparty system? 
A.	The transition from a one-party system to a multiparty system in Rwanda took place in the -- in the year 1991.  And as you all may know, the recent history of Rwanda -- this was after the RPF attack and also after the La Baule meeting, which took place in France, where heads of state had recommended a change from state parties to multiparty politics.  It was in the '90s, therefore, that Rwanda moved towards multiparty politics by introducing a law authorising the creation of new political parties.  

Before that time, there was a single-state party in place in Rwanda known as the MRND.  
Counsel, I hope I have answered your question.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, indeed, you have answered the question.  Now, let me ask you this:  With the advent of the multiparty system, did you join a political party and, if you did, did you -- were you involved in any political activities within a party that was not the MRND? 
A.	With the proliferation of parties, I was more engaged in civil societies and activism in human rights, even if -- even though I was a civil servant.  And, that since 1987, I was a member of an association for the protection of rights of writers because I'm a writer myself.  It's called Ibarwa, and that is I-B-A-R-W-A.  

In 1998 (sic) as well, I had been a founding member of an association for the protection of -- the protection of -- assistance and protect -- assistance and protection of children, Turengere Abana, T-I-R-A-N-G-E-R-A-A-B-A-N-A (sic).  It is an association -- an activity that took a lot of my time.  

And then -- and above all in 1991, I was a founding member of an association that was very active in the promotion and protection of human rights and it was known as LIPRODHOR.  LIPRODHOR is L-I-P-R-O-D-H-O-R.  It is an acronym for the Rwandan -- the Rwandan league for the promotion and defence of human rights.  As a human rights activist I figured that I ought to be neutral, and for that reason during the multiparty -- during the multiparty era, I didn't want to join any political party.  But there were people who contacted me asking me to join their parties, but I preferred to be neutral.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Byuma.  Mr. Byuma, you made reference to the Turengere Abana association.  Are you able to give us some details on the objectives of that association?  
A.	The objective of the Turengere Abana association was to promote and protect children in general and, above all, to take care of children who are in distress.  As I said earlier, this is an association that we established in 1988.  A year later, it was officially recognised by the Rwandan government and that was in March 1989.  

This association intervened extensively, particularly when the war started in the northern part of the country, when children fled from the combat zone -- particularly children who were studying in secondary schools in the south and central parts of the country.  These children were receiving funds for their internship from funds -- they received funding from our association.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, was this association established on the basis of ethnic discrimination? 
A.	No.  Our association, Turengere Abana, was not established on an ethnic basis.  It was an association that rallied together intellectuals, artists, musicians and social workers.  So we accepted everybody who wanted to be a member, but more specifically, those who were artists, intellectuals, as I said, and those who were filled with the goodwill to help children.  

In that association, as far as ethnicity was concerned, we realised that even in the governing board, even without consciously doing so, all the major ethnic groups of Rwanda -- that is, the Hutus, the Tutsis -- were represented in the governing board.  In that board -- for example, out of the 
five members, there were two Hutus and three Tutsis.  The president was Hutu; the two vice-presidents were Tutsi; the secretary general was Tutsi.  And I was the treasurer and I'm a Hutu, and the 
deputy treasurer was a Tutsi.  I'm talking about these ethnic groups, but that was really not our concern.  We just went through elections and elected the officials of our association.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, you told us a while ago that the association was recognised by the Rwandan government.  The -- I believe the association filed its statutes? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Was that filed by the founding members of the association? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Are you able to give us some idea about the founding members that you can remember?  
A.	Let me begin with the president.  The president of the association was Mr. Ngirumpatse, who is with us here.  Besides being the founding president of the association, I recall that when he was elected, he was the one that was contacted by the UNICEF, if I recollect correctly, to assist with the establishment of that association, following the recommendations of a symposium that was held in Dakar before 
1988 -- I believe it must have been a year earlier.  

And, I think, in that symposium, it was recommended that each African country should establish an association that should take care of children; an association which rallies together artists, musicians, intellectuals and social workers.  It was in that context that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse was contacted by the UNICEF.  And then he invited us to a meeting of a con -- a constituent meeting to establish this forum for taking care of children by artists and Rwandan intellectuals.  

At that time, Mathieu, the founding president of the association who was working in the 
president's office -- but a few years on, I think he was transferred to the Rwandan -- the 
Rwandan embassy in Germany.  A few months later, he was appointed the managing director of an insurance company called SONARWA, S-O-N-A-R-W-A.  So he was appointed managing director of that state corporation.  I believe he was contacted because he was a renowned artist -- a renowned musician known at the national level who used to compose hymns and also ordinary everyday music.  

I could also talk about the two vice-presidents.  They were university lecturers in the Faculty of Arts, which was located in the northern part of the country.  These were Mr. Muswahili, Paulin; unfortunately, he died, and Professor Gamariel Mbonimana.  So one was the vice -- the first vice-president and the other the second vice-president.  
(Pages 39 to 44 by Jean Baigent)

1445H 
THE WITNESS: (continued)
The secretary general was also a lecturer at the Université nationale du Rwanda.  His name was Professor Laurent Nkusi. 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me allow you to spell those names.  
A.	Thank you.  I made reference to the first vice president.  His name was M-I-S-A-W -- let me start all over again.  M-I-S-W-A-H-I-L-I (sic).  His first name was Paulin.  The second vice-president was 
	Mr. Gamariel Mbonimana, M-B-O-N-I-M-A-N-A, Gamariel Mbonimana.  The secretary general was Mr. Laurent Nkusi.  Nkusi is N-K-I-S -- N-K-E-S-I (sic).  All three were lecturers at the 
	Université nationale du Rwanda.  

The fourth person -- the fourth person was Mrs. Murebwayire, Agnès.  And, yes, she was a journalist working with Radio Rwanda.  Murebwayire is M-U-R-E-B-W-A-Y-I-R-E, Murebwayire, Agnès.  

And the fifth person was myself, Byuma, François-Xavier.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, maybe at this stage -- 
MR. WEYL: 
We have been able to lay hands on a photocopy of the gazette of 15th February 1989.  That is our exhibit number 13.  Maybe with the agreement of the Bench and the parties, Mr. Issa can hand this document to you, document 13 of this bundle of documents.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, please go through that document.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, what -- what date is it?  
MR. WEYL: 
Maybe Mr. Byuma could tell us the date which is on the upper --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone overlapping)...because I thought of it myself and I was wondering what was its relationship to the case.  I was trying to direct your thinking to that issue. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, to answer your question -- and maybe things will become clearer as I proceed with my examination of Mr. Byuma.  I would like to have this document admitted onto the records because -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, I have suggested to you that we're concerned about the relevance of the document.  Kindly give us an explanation, please.  

MR. WEYL: 
Very well, Mr. President.  Without wanting to indicate to the witness the answers that I want to elicit from him, I think the statute that indicates the exact -- the establishment of an association that would last until 1990 and which was established on the basis of multi-ethnicity and whose president was Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, would definitely be relevant to the Chamber to demonstrate the consistent conduct of the Accused. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, I don't know if he's looking at a different document.  The document I see here is a document from the UN on the 6th of March 2009; what does it have to do with this case?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I don't think we are on the same end page.  I requested for document numbered 13 to be handed to the witness, which is a photocopy of the gazette of 15 February 1989, pages that we did not get.  Maybe that is where the misunderstanding comes from.  

For now, I'm on that document. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping)...argumentative.  You should just simply address the question I'd asked you, which you should've responded to a long time ago.  Because the first question I asked you was what was the date of the document at which you're looking at.  I'm not sure you haven't answered me until just now. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I really want to apologise for what I consider to be a misunderstanding.  I do not -- and I'm often criticised for this -- I do not want my indications to appear to be leading questions, and that is why I did not want to give the date.  The document is number 13.  

I wanted the witness to tell the Court the date, so that I'm not accused of a leading question.  

I'm very sorry about this misunderstanding.  But I wanted the witness to tell us what this document, numbered 13, dated 15th March 1989, pages 319-325 -- 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel.

This is a document which is the official approval of the status of -- of the statute of the association -- the association Turengere Abana, which is an association for the promotion and protection of the rights of children.  

The gazette in which it was published is journal number 4 of 15th January 1989.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Byuma.  May I now request you to look at the last paper, which is page 325, and tell me if what you see there corresponds or reflects what you said a while ago regarding the -- the backgrounds of the various founding members? 
A.	Even if -- even though at the establishment of our association we were not concerned about the ethnicity of each member, since it has come to -- to that, I will tell you that Ngirumpatse, who is 
	number 1 -- I believe everybody can read the document when I mention the names.  

Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, you know is a Hutu; Muswahili, Paulin, was a Hutu; Mbonimana, Gamariel, was a Tutsi; Mfizi, Christophe, a Hutu; Nkusi, Laurent, a Tutsi; Byuma, François, a Hutu; Mukayisenga, Gisèle, I don't know.  

But what I see is that all the ethnic groups were represented, and even all the regions of the country were represented.

My observation is that all these names that appear here -- all those who appear here are artists.  For example, Mathieu was a musician.  Paulin a musician.  Gamariel was a musician.  Mfizi, Christophe was a writer, but he was also the director of the radio station -- radio and information board of Rwanda.  Laurent was a lecturer at the national university.  I was considered as a writer -- as an author.  
Sylver (phonetic) was a social worker.  

There were also civil servants, journalists.  Nzamaleya (phonetic), François, that you see here, was a development worker.  Nyemazi, Primien, was a Tutsi.  And he was the -- a director in the ministry of the interior.  Mukakayombya was a social worker.  Murebwayire, Agnès, was a Tutsi who worked at the Radio Rwanda.  Dunia Birusha, I think was a writer.  Uwamungu, John, was a Tutsi, a member of our association, which was known as the association of Rwanda.  Sebukangaga --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we don't have the document so we're just pronouncing the names phonetically.
THE WITNESS:
Unfortunately, we do not have the identity card, so we know they come from all the ethnic groups. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Byuma.

Was Mathieu Ngirumpatse an honourary president or was he an active president of the association? 
A.	No, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse was a responsible man.  He was an active president.  And although he was a very busy man, he was president of our association, but he was also a senior figure of authority in our country at the national level.  He was a director at the presidency of the republic.  Then he later became appointed general manager of a major insurance company.  

But whenever it came to matters of the association, chairing statutory meetings of our association, for example, all meetings of the governing board, which were held on a quarterly basis, as well as general assembly meetings on an annual basis, he was always present.  

Furthermore, he is the one who worked with the permanent secretary general of the association, Berckmans, Jean (sic), who unfortunately was killed during the genocide.  So they worked together, namely, working with that permanent secretary as well as the office secretary who typed all the materials.  And whenever Mathieu had time he would stop by to see how the association was functioning.

So the answer to your question is that Mr. Matayo -- well, Mathieu -- I keep saying Matayo because that is the way we referred to him.  

In any event, Mr. Mathieu was a responsible man who gave some of his time to monitor the work of Turengere Abana association which he chaired. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Byuma.

Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse remain in that position of president of the association till 1994?  And did he continue to work for the association in that capacity? 
A.	Mr. Mathieu remained in the office in principle until 1994.  But, quite honestly, I must tell you that with the advent of the multiparty politics and, more specifically, with the outbreak of the war and the genocide in 1994, we were disconnected from each other.  It was not easy to contact each other.  It was difficult to travel.  It was difficult to communicate with others.  

So the activities of our civilian -- or civil association slowed down significantly because of the unrest that obtained across the country. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, a few more questions on the activities of the association before 1994.  We may revisit this point from another angle, but for now I would simply like to ask you to tell the Court whether the goals of the association, the activities of the association, the services of the association, were they designed and provided along ethnic lines? 
A.	No, not at all.  The activities of the association were geared towards awareness building, sensitisation, promotion of children in Rwanda without any manner of discrimination whatsoever.  Even when it came to providing assistance to children in distress or children in difficult circumstances who were in secondary schools, we did not consider ethnic or regional backgrounds.  

The point I am making, therefore, is that there was no discrimination on the part of the association.  I'm also saying that the chairman of our association acted according to his conscience when he dealt with all people, all parents and all children who came to see him.  They did not come to see him because they belonged to one ethnic group or to another.  They simply came seeking help, seeking assistance.  And this is what was provided when we still had the requisite resources.  And at that time we provided such assistance without any discrimination whatsoever. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, in his behaviour in the association, on the board and in his relationship with the 
	permanent secretary, did Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse show any behaviour that revealed any 
	ethnic inclinations? 
A.	No, no, not at all, not at all.  You see, I have already told you that the -- the permanent secretary of the association was also a musician.  He was a member of the Kigali choir.  I'm sure that you know how to spell Kigali, K-I-G-A-L-I.  Mathieu was the chairman of the Kigali choir and Jean-Berckmans the permanent secretary of the association.  Turagurahabana (phonetic) was also a Tutsi and member of that choir and he did not have any problems whatsoever with his boss.  

They worked close to my office.  They had an office which had been made available to them by the ministry of internal affairs and nobody ever complained about Mathieu's behaviour.

And I may say that there really was never any indication of discrimination in his behaviour.  I never heard anyone talk about it.  Neither Mr. Rwakabayiza, nor the lady who was his secretary and who worked for the association.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Byuma.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to move that this document be moved into evidence as D. NZ126 (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
     (Exhibit No. D. NG126 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you just give us spelling assistance for the last couple of names that were referred to. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. Byuma, maybe you are in the best position to provide the spellings. 
THE WITNESS:
Rwakabayiza is spelt R-W-A-K-A-B-A-Y-I-Z-A.  Rwakabayiza.  

What was the other name, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The permanent secretary of the association, Jean Baptist something. 
THE WITNESS:
The permanent secretary was Jean-Berckmans Rwakabayiza, and I have just spelt out the name Rwakabayiza. 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, the president has sort of brought up, in my mind, a follow-up question.  Can you tell us what happened to Mr. Nkusi as far as you know? 
A.	Mr. Nkusi, who was the general secretary of our association, that is, Turengere Abana, after the genocide he joined the government.  He became a member of the government and was a minister of government, in the RPF government.  Today he is a lecturer at UNATC, the university of Kibungo.  Kibungo is spelt K-I-B-O -- B-U-N-G-O.  K-I-B-U-N-G-O for Kibungo.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Byuma.  
A.	I thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, my question might be somewhat incongruent, but do you remember what happened in Rwanda on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Can you tell us what happened on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Well, on the 6th of April 1994 the presidential plane crashed and aboard that plane were the 
	president of the republic of Rwanda, Mr. Juvénal Habyarimana, he was accompanied by the president of Burundi.  

And it was after the plane was brought down -- after the crash that the next day -- might I say, even that very night, killings began ending up in a genocide.

1515H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, where were you on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	On 6 April 1994 I was at home -- at my home in Biryogo secteur -- Biryogo is spelt B-I-R-Y-O-G-O -- in Nyarugenge commune, as it was then known.  Nyarugenge is N-Y-A-R-U-G-E-N-G-E.  I was at home -- at my home.  I did not hear the crash, but it was the next day that I heard from the other neighbourhood in our city -- I heard some gunshots.  And obviously, very early in the morning the radio had announced that the head of state had been killed. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, in the days following the 6th of April 1994, did you remain at your home, or did you at any time travel out of your home? 
A.	In the days following the genocide -- or, rather, the days following the 6th of April, I was in town.  I remained in the city, but I did not go to work, because there was a communiqué over Radio Rwanda asking all people to remain in their homes and to wait for subsequent directives from the authorities.  That is how I remained in my home.  I remained at home like other civil servants. 

Then as the days unfolded, fighting resumed in Kigali town, particularly to the east of the city.  Personally -- well, I had two children, and those two children had gone on holidays to their grandmother's in another préfecture of our country.  Unfortunately, I was told that their grandmother had fled and abandoned the children with her neighbour and had asked that I be informed accordingly over the national radio, and the announcement was made over the national station of Radio Rwanda.  That is how I did everything possible to go fetch my children and bring them back to Kigali. 

So when I got to Butare, I learnt that the grandmother had unfortunately been killed because she was Tutsi.  Upon bringing the children back home, I decided in early May to flee to the east of the country as well.  So I first went to my area in the former Gitarama préfecture.  G-I-T-A-R-A-M-A for Gitarama.  Then I went to Nyakabanda commune.  I believe you have the spelling of Nyakabanda already in the document.  I wrote that down.  

And so people were fleeing from the fighting.  And when they got very close to my home, I also decided to flee to Kibuye -- K-I-B-U-Y-E for Kibuye -- to the area which was under French control and known as the zone turquoise.  That area was guarded by French troops, and that is where I sought refuge and remained with my family until August 1994, at which time I was able to return from that area to Kigali with the assistance of UNAMIR.  And, as you know, UNAMIR was the body -- the United Nations' body that replaced the French in Rwanda.  

So when I returned to Kigali in August, I went back to the ministry of the interior and communal development to work and once again took up the position of head of the service in charge of cleaning and NGOs. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, is it, therefore, your testimony that after the RPF took power you did not leave Rwanda but that you returned to your office normally in Kigali; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I did not want to leave Rwanda.  Well, in fact, I didn't hold anything against myself.  I was not afraid of returning to Kigali town, and that is why I answered the call from the minister of the public service who called upon all civil servants to return to their offices.  It is within that framework that I returned to work at the ministry of the interior and communal development, of course, under the RPF government. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, a short while ago I told you that we will be revisiting this point.  You have now described to the Court your professional background in the ministry of the interior up until 1995.  Now, tell us what happened in 1995.  
A.	In 1995 I asked for a leave of absence from the minister of the public service with a view to going to work elsewhere, but since March 1995 -- since March 1995 I worked as the permanent secretary of LIPRODHOR, which I mentioned a short while ago.  From that time I worked as a human rights activist within the association known as LIPRODHOR, and I was the founding member of that association, as I mentioned, in 1991.  

Working with the association was an opportunity for me to participate in the rebuilding or reconstruction of my country, which had been devastated by the war and the genocide.  It was also an honour and a privilege and an opportunity for me to teach human rights in Rwanda or to the Rwandan people.  Part of my work with the association was to design promotion and education programmes for the people in the area of human rights.  

All of this was happening in a post-war, post-genocide era where human rights were being violated.  And so we had to conduct investigations into these violations of human rights with a view to making recommendations to the competent authorities for action that would address those types of problems. 

For example, people at that time were returning from exile and would encounter such problems as taking possession, once again, of their houses and their pieces of land, and also having access to fair and equitable justice. 

You may want to know that at that time there was much talk of arbitrary arrests, mainly of persons who were presumed to have participated in the genocide.  So our association, LIPRODHOR, was involved in conducting a number of investigations, and that was my job. 

So we talked about the findings of our investigations with the competent authorities, namely, those in charge of justice in Rwanda:  The minister of justice, the state prosecutor, and other competent authorities.  It was during that time that we conducted investigations into the perpetrators or authors of the 1994 genocide, and this was done under the umbrella of CLADHO -- CLADHO, C-L-A-D-H-O -- a union of associations, the idea being to assist the Rwandan justice system to properly identify the perpetrators of the genocide. 

Apart from that I had also set up -- and I already told you that I am a writer.  I had written up plays, and I had them performed or staged with the assistance of the High Commissioner for Human Rights who was working in Rwanda, that is, the UN High Commissioner to Rwanda for Human Rights. 

That work kept me busy till 1999, when in November of that year I left LIPRODHOR to commit myself to the service of children.  It is at that time that I revived the Turengere Abana association and served as its president.  So from the year 2000 I was the president of Turengere Abana until the time of my arrest on the 13th of May 2007. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, from 1995 to 2007 you continued to be a human right activist; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, throughout that entire period, from 1995 to 2007, did you at any time -- or were you at any time whatsoever incriminated for having been involved in the genocide that took place prior to the victory of the RPF? 
A.	No. 
MR. WEYL:
Now, Mr. President, maybe -- before I go into the second half of my examination-in-chief -- this might just be the right time to break, and I am halfway through my examination-in-chief.  I believe that this might be a good time to break.  I am in your hands, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  We can take the adjournment now. 

Mr. Witness, I should advise you at this time, as we go into our adjournment overnight, that during this or any other adjournment while you are a witness you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  You understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1530H)
