EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Rutaganda.
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	We've placed in front of you a personal information sheet.  Can you tell us if that's accurate.
A.	It is accurate. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'd ask that that be admitted as D. NZ767. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ767 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, were you second vice-president of the national committee of Interahamwe of MRND?  
A.	Yes.  I was the second vice-president of the provisional MRND. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us approximately when it was that you were first contacted about joining the organisation that later became known as Interahamwe of MRND.
A.	It was around the month of November 1991. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber the circumstances under which you first learned about this organisation.
A.	I can say that at the time when I was contacted, the issue was the organisation whatsoever.  But to attend meetings to reflect which were ongoing, I was approached by one Ruhumuliza, Phénéas, who was a friend of mine.  As a matter of fact, we were natives from the same region.  So he invited me to attend meetings which were being held at that time almost every -- on every Wednesday. 
Q.	At that time were you yourself a member of the MRND in the multiparty system? 
A.	Yes.  At that time I had already chosen to become a member of the MRND. 
Q.	And what was your occupation at that time? 
A.	I was a businessman. 
Q.	And what kind of business did you do? 
A.	I was involved in importation, mainly importation in connection with agro -- agri products mainly, although I could also import other things, but that was my main import.  We also had activities in connection with construction for example.  That is what I did. 
Q.	And were you doing that in Kigali or in some other location? 
A.	As a matter of fact, we used a family company which we had set up, and that company had its headquarters in Butare where I lived and worked before being transferred to Kigali.  Our main business was in Kigali, but we also had other business concerns, especially in Butare.  And we could set up other issues, but the main activity was found -- business was found in Kigali. 
Q.	And what region were you a native of? 
A.	I am a native of the Masango commune in the Gitarama commune -- in the Gitarama préfecture.  Of course, I'm giving the names of that epoch, the region which, compared to other regions, was considered to be the centre of the country.  That is where I come from. 
Q.	And did your father hold positions within the government? 
A.	Not within the government. 
Q.	What positions did he hold during the time that you were growing up? 
A.	My father had various offices.  For example, if I can give a brief overview of his CV, he was the resident representative, that is, prior to the independence in East African countries.  At that time the embassy was located in Kampala.  And after he returned home, he was appointed préfet, first of all, in Kibuye.  And after that he was transferred to Cyangugu.  

After Cyangugu, still in his capacity as préfet -- after Cyangugu, he went to Butare where he was transferred.  And after Butare, he was appointed ambassador to Germany.  There was a coup d'état.  He was compelled to return home.  He waited and got appointed bourgmestre of Masango up to 1993 when he retired. 
Q.	Now, this person who contacted you about what was later to become the Interahamwe -- his name was Phénéas Ruhumiliza -- how did you know him? 
A.	Phénéas Ruhumiliza was a friend.  He had been a friend for very long.  We were in the same secondary school, and subsequently we continued to be in touch with each other.  We paid each other visits and assisted each other, and he was also a businessman just like myself.  So you would understand that there was some business contacts, relationship, between the two of us.   
Q.	Where was that first meeting held that you attended? 
A.	The meeting held at the place known as Technoserve.  It had Technoserve on it, but it was a building that had many other businesses in it, and that is where the meeting took place. 
Q.	And is that a building that was owned by Védaste Rubangura?
A.	Yes, indeed.  That is the building. 
Q.	Now, turning your attention to the first meeting, can you tell us who were the others who were present?  
A.	I am in no position to give you a complete list of the people who attended, but I would like to tell the Chamber that on the whole you had parastatal company managers, bank managers.  I would now say high-ranking civil servants.  And I wonder if I'm going too fast with respect to your question, but you had a certain number of cadres who represented the MRND and who wanted to get together to seek solutions for problems which they were facing. 
Q.	Approximately how many people were there at that first meeting that you attended? 
A.	I believe we could put it at about 15 to 20 people. 
Q.	And can you give us the names of as many as you remember.
A.	For instance, you had Murenzi, Désiré; Kigufi, Thomas; Bizimungu.  You had Mr. Robert Kajuga and others.  I really can't recall the entire list, but you had Phénéas.  You had Dieudonné.  There were so many people. 
Q.	And when you say Bizimungu, we've had many Bizimungus in our trial team.  Can you tell us the other name.
A.	Cyrille Bizimungu is the one I'm referring to.  Cyrille. 
Q.	And who was leading the meeting -- leading the discussion at the meeting? 
A.	Murenzi, Désiré was the one. 
Q.	And what was his job? 
A.	He was the general manager of PETRORWANDA company. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us, as best you can recall, what was said at that first meeting.
A.	During that meeting, the issue was to sensitise people, at least those who were in that room, to see ways and means for people -- of how people were going to approach the situation -- deal with the situation at party level.  As a matter of fact, people had taken the habit of receiving habits -- the habit of receiving instructions from the president of the former MRND.  And with the advent of multipartyism, they still tended to wait for decisions to come from the hierarchy; whereas, the other parties were being -- were drafting strategies to become competitive on the multiparty stage.  The MRND wasn't doing anything.

And those members who indeed were senior-ranking officials in their positions decided that people had to meet and elaborate a strategy by themselves, a strategy which they had to submit to the party for assessment and consideration.

On the whole, that was the goal.  And they felt that they had to set up a think tank group to make suggestions. 
Q.	Now, did you attend other meetings after that first one? 
A.	Yes.  I had the opportunity of attending subsequent meetings, particularly on the Wednesday following.  And we noticed that we absolutely had to organise ourselves and that it was not as a matter of just going there, putting in place a temporary structure.  And this was due to the fact that mouth-to-ear communication had caused an important -- a considerable rise in the numbers. 
Q.	And can you tell us, how long after the first meeting you attended were some officers selected for this group? 
A.	What I can say is that it was virtually at the third meeting which I attended, and it was during that meeting that we designated the group that was subsequently to become the provisional committee in charge of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And who was selected as president of that committee? 
A.	Kajuga, Robert. 
Q.	And who was Robert Kajuga? 
A.	Robert Kajuga was a native of I think Rukara commune in Kibungo, and he was working in SORIMEX, the company owned by his elder brother, and he was living in Kigali.  I don't know whether I should give any further details. 
Q.	So he was a businessman?
A.	He was in business, but he was not basically or intrinsically a businessman to the best of my knowledge. 
Q.	And what was his ethnicity? 
A.	It was only later that we got to know that he was Tutsi. 
Q.	Did that make any difference to you? 
A.	For me that was not an important consideration because if we took that in mind as a criteria, we would have imposed it at the beginning when he was being nominated.  That was not the concern at the time.  At least from what I witnessed personally, that was not the main concern of those within the party, knowing that this person comes from here, this person is of this ethnic group.  That was not the main concern at the time. 
Q.	Were there several Tutsis who were members of MRND? 
A.	Yes.  There were many, and there even were some who participated in funding the party. 
Q.	Now, you told us that Désiré Murenzi had organised -- had led the meeting that you attended.  Why didn't he become the president? 
A.	I can't tell you why, but the fact is at the time the committee was being put in place, the 
	national provisional committee of Interahamwe for the country, I personally -- I expressed the wish not to be part of it because I felt that there was -- the tendency was things were going to take my time entirely.  

And we were sent out of the hall, and we went to wait outside.  And when we returned, they virtually proclaimed the list of persons who they felt were going to be in charge of coordination or the organisation of the structure that was being put in place.  And that was how, when we came back into the hall, the list of five members of the national committee for Interahamwe was read. 
Q.	Who was the first vice-president? 
A.	Ruhumiliza, Phénéas. 
Q.	And who was treasurer? 
A.	Dieudonné Niyitegeka. 
Q.	And who was Dieudonné Niyitegeka?  What kind of business did he do, and where was he from?
A.	He came from the Butare préfecture, and Dieudonné worked for Interface Panalpina, and he was an accountant in Kigali. 
Q.	And who was the secretary? 
A.	Mbarushimana, Eugène. 
Q.	And where was he from, and what was his occupation? 
A.	Eugène hailed from Gisenyi.  He worked within a company known as Rwandex, and he was also in accounting, financing, in that discipline. 
Q.	And what was your understanding of what this organisation that you had now been elected 
	second vice-president for was going to do? 
A.	The goal -- now, this was a cell -- a think tank.  I think it was a positive initiative in the sense that this group was supposed to sit down, conceive or come up with strategies that were supposed to foster the party which I belonged to. 
Q.	Did there come a time when the officers had a meeting with President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes.  We met President Habyarimana on two occasions.  The first time was after the committee was put in place.  One week after its election, he called us, and we went and met him in the village.  And his concern was to get us to explain exactly what our aims were, our objectives were, and how we thought we were going to execute the task assigned to us.   

And the second time we met him was when he was going to announce to us that he had a project, some work to give -- to the work -- to the group, the committee, to the Interahamwe and that he wanted to share with them new year wishes, and on the new year occasion, he had this opportunity to meet us.  This was the two times that we had the opportunity of meeting him. 
Q.	So taking them one at a time, in your first meeting, approximately when did that take place? 
A.	I can fix that approximately, in terms of time, towards the end of November, November ending, early December.
Q.	1991; correct? 
A.	Yes.  1991. 
Q.	And can you tell us then, at that time who was the president of the MRND? 
A.	At that time the president was still Habyarimana.  He was president of MRND. 
Q.	And when you met President Habyarimana, can you tell us, as best you can recall, what was said at that first meeting?  
A.	As I said earlier on, it was a matter of sharing our objectives, getting him to know exactly what we wanted to achieve with the creation of that organisation.  Because as a matter of fact, some people felt that what we were putting in place was -- and in fact, there were even rumours that we were set on creating our own party on the sidelines and that we were the hard wing of the party because we were not happy about the way the party was behaving after multiparty was ushered in.  

And so we went there, we introduced ourselves, we explained our objectives to him, and he was satisfied.  And he wished us good luck in what we were supposed to do.  And in fact, he saw in us initiative that was going to improve things, improve the welfare and the leadership of the party. 
Q.	After your first meeting with President Habyarimana, did there come a time when some other people were added as counsellors to the national committee of Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  As a matter of fact, after that meeting, the need arose to put in place groups of other persons who were going to back us and support us, not only because we needed them, because the structure had grown in importance and the committee was not able to handle things single-handedly.

Secondly, the observations were made to the effect that all members of the committee were from the centre, south and centre.  And so to put in some balance, to make some greater representativity, it was decided that it would be extended, and we decided that presidents of committees were going to be created because -- well, committees in quotes because these did not exist prior to that moment. 
Q.	And who were the individuals who were designated to be presidents of these committees or counsellors to the committee? 
A.	There were six in number:  Bernard Maniragaba.  There was Serugendo, Joseph; Sebanetsi -- I cannot recall his first name.  There was Kanimba, Alphonse.  There was Mudahinyuka, Jean-Marie Vianney and Ephrem Nkezabera. 
Q.	And turning to Bernard Maniragaba, what was his occupation and where was he from? 
A.	Bernard Maniragaba -- well, I don't know exactly how to say this to you.  I don't know exactly what he was doing at that time, but he was based in Kigali.  That's where he lived.  I got to know him in Kigali when he was a referee.  He was a native of Ruhengeri I believe. 
Q.	And your referring to him being a referee -- do you mean of football? 
A.	No.  A basketball referee. 
Q.	And what about Joseph Serugendo?  Where was he from and what was his occupation? 
A.	Joseph Serugendo worked at Radio Rwanda as a technician, and I -- if I'm not mistaken, he also was a native of -- well, maybe between Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.  I don't know exactly which. 
Q.	Okay.  And Mr. Sebanetsi -- where was he from, and what was his occupation? 
A.	I believe Sebanetsi was -- well, he had a personal business, a business of his own.  He was a native of Gisenyi, just as Serugendo, the same thing, between Gisenyi and Ruhengeri. 
Q.	And Alphonse Kanimba -- where was he from and what was his occupation? 
A.	Kanimba hailed from Kigali.  He had his own business. 
Q.	And what about Jean-Marie Vianney Mudahinyuka?  Where was he from, and what was his occupation? 
A.	Mudahinyuka, Jean-Marie Vianney, came from Masango commune, and he was a businessman.  He owned a garage. 
Q.	Was he a particularly good friend of yours? 
A.	Yes.  He was more than a friend.  He was like a brother to me. 
Q.	And what was his nickname? 
A.	His nickname was Zuzu. 
Q.	And Ephrem Nkezabera -- what was his occupation, and where was he from? 
A.	Nkezabera was a banker, and he was from Gisenyi. 
Q.	Do you know whether or not any members of the national committee or these people who became counsellors to the committee had parents who were of Tutsi ethnicity? 
A.	Yes, I know.  Particularly Kanimba acknowledged that he was Tutsi.  Zuzu, Mudahinyuka, 
	Jean-Marie Vianney had relatives.  His mother was Tutsi.  It's difficult to do a list of everybody.  But globally, if you look at all five, the five -- 

I have a problem with my headset.

If globally you look at all five in addition to the six, you would realise that most of these persons were mixed blood as we say today, either from their parents -- for instance, Phénéas -- his mother was Tutsi.  Dieudonné was married to Tutsi women.  I don't know.  I didn't do an inventory on that issue, but as I told you initially, it was not a concern that we had in mind at that time. 
Q.	And did this group that was being formed have any objective of exterminating or attacking Tutsi? 
A.	I think -- well, that may be a paradoxical question because I told you that our president was Tutsi.  I do not know then how this group would have us go to exterminate Tutsis beginning with the president who was leading the group.  So in other words, we never had that objective.  We never even had the intention of hurting whosoever, if not the one that you asked me. 
Q.	Now, returning to the second time that you met President Habyarimana, can you tell us who was present from the Interahamwe committee at that meeting.
A.	There was a committee of five plus those who had been appointed as advisers or counsellors. 
Q.	And did Désiré Murenzi attend the second meeting? 
A.	Yes, he did.  He attended the first meeting.  He attended the second meeting. 
Q.	And can you tell us what was discussed at the second meeting with President Habyarimana.
A.	The second meeting with President Habyarimana had to do with giving him a progress report.  And in addition, he, as I told you -- he wanted to inform us that he had decided to attend a small celebration -- a small party to celebrate the new year or the end of the year. 
Q.	Was anything else discussed at that second meeting? 
A.	No, not really. 
Q.	And was, in fact, some party held that the president attended for Interahamwe -- in which the Interahamwe also attended? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can you take it over, please, Counsel, asks the Kinyarwanda booth.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What was this party that you're referring to?  Did that take place?  And if so, where and when?
A.	Well, it happened this way:  We arrived.  We invited the various groups that were in the secteurs.  And they all came over to Technoserve location because behind this building there was a wide space and we organised the party there.  They drank, they enjoyed themselves, and we explained to them that that was also a gift from the president of the party. 
Q.	Approximately when did that take place? 
A.	Of course at the end of the year. 
Q.	Now, how did the name "Interahamwe" come to be given to this group? 
A.	When we realised that we had to organise the structure because there were lots of people who were attending, the recommendation was made that people should return to their various secteurs and organise themselves and that prior to doing that we had to set up that organisation as I said before.  So questions were raised in our Wednesday meetings with respect to the name which we had to give to our organisation. 

	So some people started to say they were going to call it Kigali choc.  They were going to call it this and that, made various proposals.  So we took an appointment for the next Wednesday for everyone to return home and reflect on a likely name to be given and that, when we met again, we were going to decide on what name we were to adopt.  

And the next morning -- and this was still in the month of November -- the following Wednesday lots of proposals were made with respect to the name.  But ultimately we chose Interahamwe.  In order to distinguish from the other Interahamwe from the cooperative groupings which had the same appellation, we had to call it "Interahamwe za MRND" meaning which belongs to the MRND. 
Q.	And what does the word "Interahamwe" mean? 
A.	The word "Interahamwe" means people who have the same goal and progress in the same direction with the same convictions. 
Q.	Does it mean those who attack together? 
A.	No, not at all.  Because as a matter of fact, the word "Interahamwe" was borrowed from the song -- from the musical group at the time of independence which indeed was expressing their wish that we should absolutely attain independence against the monarchy because we were supported by the people known as the "Interahamwe".  So it was a word that was borrowed from these singers in the '60s.  And we really were looking towards this role as unfettered support to the party by people who were determined to support it.  Otherwise, there was no connotation of attacks of -- any possible connotation of hurting anyone at all. 
Q.	Prior to the formation of the Interahamwe, had other parties formed youth wings? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  The Interahamwe was set up as a last resort.  As a matter of fact, the other parties had already set up their own youth wings. 
Q.	And what was the name of the youth wing of the MDR party?
A.	It was Inkuba. 
Q.	What does that mean? 
A.	It means lightning. 
Q.	And what about the PL party?  Did they have a youth wing?
A.	Yes.  They had a youth wing known as JL. 
Q.	And the PSD party -- did they have a youth wing? 
A.	Yes.  The PSD also had its youth wing known as Abakombozi. 
Q.	And what does that word mean? 
A.	It was a Swahili word.  I believe it means liberators. 
Q.	Now, at the beginning of 1992, was there an event in Kigali known as ville morte? 
A.	Yes.  Indeed in late 1991 a government was set up, and the government was challenged by the opposition, that is to say, the Nsanzimana government.  So they made demonstrations and caused a lot of damage, significant damage, in Kigali.  And that is that period -- that is the period which was described as ville morte or ghost town. 
Q.	And the government that had been set up, the government of Nsanzimana -- did that include members of the other parties, or was that only for MRND? 
A.	I believe that it included the PDC party. 
Q.	And were the other parties protesting that they were not included in this government and demanding to be included? 
A.	As far as they were concerned, the idea -- it was out of the question to have a prime minister such as Nsanzimana.  As a matter of fact, they wanted to be in that position and reach an agreement with the MRND and then set up a transitional government.  I believe that they also wanted to participate more significantly.  And when they realised that Nsanzimana had set up a government which included the PDC, they were -- they did not agree, and so they protested vehemently. 
Q.	Now, as the beginning of 1992 arrived, what were the activities of the Interahamwe? 
A.	They didn't have any other activity apart from participating or attending party meetings.  As part of political activity, I can't see what else they could have done in terms of activities. 
Q.	How often did the committee meet during early 1992? 
A.	We continued with the Wednesday meetings, but as people had been sent back to their own secteurs, we didn't have a reason for meeting unless a problem arose.  And at that time the president summoned us and we would meet in a given place without having necessarily to go to Technoserve. 
Q.	Did the number of people who were involved in the Interahamwe expand in early 1992? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  With this mouth-to-ear communication and mobilisation at secteur level, we noticed that a number of members and the MRND seemed to take centre stage; whereas, it had been driven away from the podium.  So we noticed that people began to manifest themselves whereas they didn't do so before.

I believe that it must have been in early January 1992 -- that is our first demonstration -- during which the Interahamwe attended, and they came out with billboards.  People now became aware of the existence of the organisation.  And so people started to become members again and to show the fact that they were members of the party. 
Q.	Do you know a person named Akhmed Babanyunkiza? 
A.	I don't. 
Q.	Mr. Babanyunkiza testified in this trial that he attended three meetings of the MRND in 
	February of 1992 at which members of the Interahamwe committee attended on consecutive Wednesdays at the Rubenguro building, and he said that the meetings involved displays of axes that the Interahamwe could use to attack Tutsis and songs about extermination of Tutsis.  

First of all, did you ever attend any such meetings? 
A.	Let me say forthwith that such meetings did not hold.  They didn't hold because, on the one hand, as I said before, there was no reason for us to meet.  And secondly, on the other hand, we could not have conducted anti-Tutsi campaign meetings, and I don't know whatever -- what else he said.  Whereas, within our own party you had Tutsi.  It was practically impossible. 
Q.	Mr. Babanyunkiza also testified that in order to join the Interahamwe you had to have military training.  Is that true?
A.	That's completely false.  You have to start with myself.  I was never trained, and I was the 
	second vice-president.  I believe that that is part of the strategy to try to blame a group of people.  Rather, to become an Interahamwe, you had to be a member of the MRND.  That was the criteria.  That was all.  Secondly, you ought to have been determined to demonstrate your will to ensure the propaganda of the party, and that is the framework within which the Interahamwe acted all through the period when they existed.

1015H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was there ever a time when membership cards were issued to Interahamwe? 
A.	At some point in time, I must admit that just with respect to organisation and structuring of the organisation we felt it useful to introduce membership cards. 
Q.	How many of these membership cards were issued? 
A.	I would put it at about a thousand, about 1,000 cards were distributed.  But subsequently, we noticed that it was causing problems with regard to figures because we were unable to tell who was an -- who was an Interahamwe and who wasn't an Interahamwe, and so we stopped it. 
Q.	And who signed the membership cards on behalf of the Interahamwe? 
A.	We decided that the cards would be signed by Kajuga, Robert and by delegation the two vice-presidents -- presidents.
Q.	And did you yourself have a membership card? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	And who signed that? 
A.	It must have been Ruhumuliza, Phénéas or maybe Kajuga. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the registry could show Exhibit P. 1 to the witness.  And I apologise for not notifying him in advance.  But I think it would be better if I could show this to the witness.  So if he could have P. 1. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, directing your attention to what's been placed in front of you as Exhibit P. 1, do you recognise that? 
A.	It's my card.  It is a card of -- 
Q.	And who signed it? 
A.	I noticed that the person who signed it must have been the flip side of this one.  But according to what I have here, my card was signed by Kajuga, Robert, the president who signed my card.  So I apologise for the mix-up.  But you cannot see his signature here. 
Q.	Do you have the -- a copy of the flip side of that card with you? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'd ask that that be also added to Exhibit P. 1.  We can make a copy at the break.  But I think it would be good to have the complete card, front and back. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, I think we already have them in evidence.  There are A -- 1A and 1B, I believe.  1A is the back, and 1B is the front.  So if you bring out all four parts of Exhibit 1, I think we'll have everything.  And there's also the MRND card.  But I believe it's 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  I think we have the back now.  Do you see the signature there? 
A.	Yes, I do.  It's Robert Kajuga's signature. 
Q.	Now, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse sign any MRN -- sign any Interahamwe membership cards that you know of? 
A.	No.  And he didn't have the capacity to do so. 
Q.	In late 1991, early 1992, what was Mathieu Ngirumpatse's position with MRND? 
A.	I believe that at that time he was the president of the PVK. 
Q.	So he was president of the MRND within the préfecture of Kigali; is that correct? 
A.	Yes indeed. 
Q.	And what role did Mathieu Ngirumpatse have with the creation of the Interahamwe, if any? 
A.	The setting up of the MRND or?  
Q.	Excuse me.  The creation of the Interahamwe.  I'm sorry.  
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse had no role to play in the setting up of the Interahamwe za MRND. 
Q.	And did the members of the committee have any contact with Mathieu Ngirumpatse during the period of 1991 and early 1992? 
A.	I don't -- I am unaware of it. 
Q.	Now, were there any clashes in early 1992 between members of the Interahamwe and the members of other parties? 
A.	Early '92, no.  Rather, contacts -- or clashes started around May 1992. 
Q.	Now, in March 1992 there were some clashes or killings in Bugesera region of Rwanda.  Did the Interahamwe have anything to do with those as far as you know? 
A.	As far as I am aware, the Interahamwe za MRND had no part to play in the Bugesera clashes.  As a matter of fact, we were still being set up.  We were trying to see how the structure could be set up.  

And secondly, there was one expert, Nsanzuwera, who came and testified in my trial.  And he was unable to establish the role which the Interahamwe could have played there, except for the fact that these events were attributed to a group of people who, under manipulation, were going to soil in the name of the MR and -- MRND and break the Habyarimana regime by doing that.  Otherwise, the MR -- Interahamwe za MRND played no real role and did not participate in the Bugesera events. 
Q.	Prior to those events in Bugesera, did you ever hear any discussion by anyone connected with the Interahamwe about going to Bugesera to do anything? 
A.	I never heard anything of -- of -- of -- of the sort. 
Q.	Now, this organisation that had been formed, was it limited to Kigali town, or was it also extending throughout Rwanda? 
A.	The Interahamwe za MRND organisation was still located in Kigali.  After the April 1992 congress after which it issued a recommendation from the MRND party with the view of being set up -- spread out at national level -- it was from then that some individuals, some -- some political leaders returned to their regions and set up some -- some cells here and there.  

But those cells were in no hierarchal relationship with the national provisional Interahamwe committee.  And this was mainly in Kigali.  And I would like to add that this was not in the whole of Kigali, because there were some parts which were the strongholds of other parties and where they could not have set up the Interahamwe za MD -- MRND. 
Q.	So now with respect to that decision that was taken at the congress in April 1992, any Interahamwe groups that were formed outside of Kigali city, to whom did they report? 
A.	When you talk about reporting, it implies that they have a certain number of activities they had to carry out.  But that was not the case.  

But the situation was such that if people organised themselves and decided that we handed -- wanted to start up a local Interahamwe means that they wanted to attend meetings and manage those meetings.  That was the activities of the Interahamwe.  

People shouldn't continue thinking that we had any other activities we had to carry out and which we had to report.  What was set up at a specific area depended on it -- or depended on the authority of the party that had set them up there. 
Q.	Did the national committee of the Interahamwe, of which you were second vice-president, have any authority over the people in the other préfectures who called themselves Interahamwe? 
A.	I explained earlier on that we did not have any hierarchal relationship with these groups.  They were totally independent.  And even right there at Kigali, when we went to the secteurs, they were still independent.  And they acted independently at their own convenience and as they deemed fit.  

So the relations between those that were close to us, that is, within Kigali, were simply based on contacts, calls, appeals.  We could request to a group in -- for a particular secteur.  And they would tell us, "No.  We are not available to help you.  We are going to attend this or that other meeting."  And so there was no control or constraint of hierarchy -- between hierarchy and these local branches or cells of the Interahamwe. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We think it's about time.  

We take our 15-minute recess right now, Mr. Witness.
(Court recessed from 1032H to 1104H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry.  Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, Mr. Édouard Karemera has gone to see the doctor and isn't back yet.  And I cannot see how we would carry on.  Thank you.  We -- we may continue in spite of his absence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Rutaganda, we were talking about -- the congress of April 1992 had a decision that had been taken to have Interahamwe in the préfectures.  Also at that congress was a new national secretary of the MRND elected? 
A.	It was Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Who had been the secretary general before that? 
A.	Édouard Karemera. 
Q.	And did Édouard Karemera have anything to do with the founding of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  Karemera had nothing to do with the founding of the Interahamwe za MRND. 
Q.	And did the national committee of the MRND have any contact with Édouard Karemera, to your knowledge, during the time that he was the national secretary? 
A.	As far as I am aware, no. 
Q.	Now, turning first to Gisenyi préfecture, do you know a person by the name of Bernard Munyagishari? 
A.	Yes, I do.  I know Bernard Munyagishari, first, as a referee, a football referee.  Then subsequently, I got to know him as a -- a president elect for Interahamwe local -- local Interahamwe in Gisenyi. 
Q.	And do you know how it came about that he was affiliated with the Interahamwe in Gisenyi? 
A.	There were rallies in Gisenyi, inaugural -- inaugural rallies at the préfecture level.  I went there.  And I learnt that during the reception Kajuga, alongside Ephrem and Dieudonné, attended a reception during which he was appointed as someone who could represent the Interahamwe at local level. 
Q.	Approximately when was that? 
A.	I no longer recall precisely, but it must have been in 1992. 
Q.	Now, turning to Ruhengeri préfecture, was there ever any person designated to be president of Interahamwe in Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	There is no other préfecture where officials were appointed at préfectoral level.  More specifically, in Ruhengeri, I -- I don't know that there wasn't.
Q.	We've had testimony from a witness named HH -- or with a pseudonym of HH who said that a man named Esdras Baheza, a trader from Mukingo commune, was designated to be president of Interahamwe for Ruhengeri préfecture; is that true? 
A.	That's completely wrong. 
Q.	And this witness testified that Joseph Setiba was at some stage elected president of Kigali-rural -- the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural préfecture and that you were present at his election; is that true? 
A.	That is also untrue.  Setiba was never the president of Interahamwe at Kigali-rural préfecture. 
Q.	Now, were there Interahamwe members outside of Kigali city? 
A.	A while ago I told you that you had some cells that were set up independently of the officials of the party and the available resources they had.  But I would like to say that the Interahamwe za MRND were more present in Kigali, more in Kigali than elsewhere in the country. 
Q.	Now, you talked about the committee being a provisional one.  Can you explain what you mean by that. 
A.	The crux of the matter is that, at the time when that committee was set up, it was a committee which was a prospective committee, because people felt that there was need for better organisation in the future.  As a matter of fact, as we had not been elected, we had put up a transitional committee that could set up the true structures of the organisation.  

And it remained that way.  In the minds of everyone the idea was that we were there to ensure that transition in view of becoming a more structured and more officially recognised organisation.  That was the goal of the committee. 
Q.	And did that ever take place?  Were there ever elections and a permanent committee elected? 
A.	There was no elected committee.  Firstly, when we kicked up this activity, the -- it was a think tank, and the think tank became a massive and less structured organisation, pulling people from right and left.  

Now, you need to understand that the people who were elected -- rather, designated, were not designate -- designated to manage this second structure that came up.  So the existing committee had to take, I would say, the baby to guide it and try to set up a final structure.  But the insecurity, the threat, the prevailing situation did not allow a congress -- a constituent congress to be set up in view of -- a constituent congress to be held in view of setting up the -- the structures indeed. 
Q.	And did the project of extending the structure to all of the préfectures ever -- was that ever realised? 
A.	The project was never realised.  It was the wish of the congress and everyone, because the -- the advantages of the Interahamwe or the MRND could be seen, but it was never implemented in practice. 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe ever have a statute? 
A.	No, we didn't have a statute. 
Q.	Was there ever any discussion about having a statute? 
A.	We didn't discuss it because it was a draft project which would -- had to be set up when we had decided when to organise the congress.  It was part of the factors which we had to deal with in detail if this congress was held -- during the preparations of this congress if the congress was to be held. 
Q.	The MRND statute contained some rules concerning affiliate organisations.  Was the Interahamwe ever officially affiliated with the MRND? 
A.	There was no formal affiliation of the Interahamwe za MRND to the MRND party.  What I would like to say is that the organisation existed de facto dependent on the MRND party which recognised it in its April 1992 congress. 
Q.	Was there any discussion whether or not a formal affiliation of the Interahamwe by the MRND should be made? 
A.	We had not yet reached that stage in our discussions, but clearly, the Interahamwe za MRND -- first of all, they couldn't have existed out of the MRND party -- party.  So it was clear that when they all -- I know that they were going to organise themselves and draft an affiliation statute or -- to be integrated directly into the party. 
Q.	Now, returning to April 1992, also in that month was a coalition government formed in Rwanda? 
A.	I believe it was the Nsengiyaremye government. 
Q.	And from which political party was Prime Minister Dismas Nsengiyaremye? 
A.	Nsengiyaremye was from the MDR. 
Q.	Now, during this period was a phenomenon known as kubohoza practised? 
A.	Yes, indeed the phenomenon of the -- kubohoza was practised.  And the action comprised -- as the terms stated it means to -- to free someone from a place where they had been tethered and to take them somewhere.  So the idea at the time was that the people who were in the MRND were tied, that they were bound.  

These sort of groups that were -- claimed to be in the opposition, initiated action which was accompanied by criminal acts, destructions, and disruptions which I talked to you about a while ago.  It had an impact on the behaviour of the people as a whole and in prolonging this situation.  And it was very negative to -- to the behaviour of the people up till 1994. 
Q.	Now, was this kubohoza practised against officials, such as bourgmestres? 
A.	Yes.  In some locations some bourgmestres were compelled to leave their office because of that kubohoza practice.  And they were forced to -- to leave because they could not carry out their duties; whereas, there were people who were physically against them.  

This was not only with respect to authorities but also with regard to infrastructure which had been set up by the -- the old -- old MRND, especially the coffee farms, anti-erosion ditches.  They were dis -- demolished.  It was really frightful, because I was personally a victim to it. 
Q.	Now, directing your attention to the -- late May 1992, the weekend of -- Pentecostal weekend, did you attend a MRND rally that weekend? 
A.	Yes.  I attended that meeting.  It was actually a demonstration that led to the prime minister's office.  And it was -- it ended with a form of rally in the -- around the roundabout which was close to that area. 
Q.	Now, where did the people gather at first for the demonstration before going to that roundabout? 
A.	They met at the main roundabout in Kigali city.  Then they started to move towards Kiyovu.  Then they took a -- took a road to towards the Hôtel Méridien past the CND, and then they went up to the prime minister's office, ultimate -- ultimately meeting at the roundabout in front of the prime minister's office. 
Q.	And did you yourself follow that route? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	We've had testimony from a Prosecution witness named Jean-Bosco Twahirwa who said that people were chanting about exterminating Tutsis and singing songs, tubatsembatsembe; is that true? 
A.	That is untrue.  It was not possible considering the composition of the group of people who were demonstrated.  He couldn't have sang those types of songs. 
Q.	Were some speeches made at the roundabout in front of the prime minister's office that day? 
A.	Yes, indeed there were speeches made. 
Q.	Do you remember who the speakers were? 
A.	There were many speakers.  Ngirumpatse, Mathieu made his speech.  Ministers who were present came, but they also made -- sent a message across.  Kajuga also spoke.  The party president at préfectoral level, Jean Habyarimana, also took the floor.  But those are all the people I remember. 
Q.	And did any of the speakers make any reference to attacks against Tutsi or exterminating Tutsi? 
A.	I was there, and I did not hear any speaker talk about attacks against Tutsis or extermination.  

As I was saying a while ago, the composition, the manner in which people were, that was not a preoccupation.  There couldn't have been that sort of manner of talking before that crowd, preaching hatred, especially as we were along with many Tutsis and many Tutsis had demonstrated with us. 
Q.	Were there some clashes after that rally on that day? 
A.	As a matter of fact, on that day -- that day people from the opposition had organised to hold their own rally at Nyamirambo.  And as far as I'm concerned, it was a talk of war to demonstrate that they were present in spite of the prevailing situation.  

At the time when we were returning, we learnt that they no longer wanted that group of the opposition, so they had decided to exclude the people of the MRND from the city of Kigali.  And that is how we talked to the members who were there, warned them to be careful, to return home quietly, and avoid any provocation, to remain serene and return home.  And that is the message that we sent across.  

But apparently, when they were returning home, the people from Nyamirambo met the people from the Nyamirambo rally.  So -- so we had to manage traffic between the two groups.  But there was no physical clashes noted. 
Q.	Now, was there any violence to property during that weekend or during that day, to your knowledge? 
A.	As far as I'm aware, no. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time in 1992 when you attended a rally in the préfecture of Gitarama at a place called Byimana? 
A.	Yes, I attended.  It is Byimana.  Yes.  I attended that meeting.  Byimana is a locality after Gitarama.  You get a commune known as Mukingi, and that is where that meeting was held, and I attended it. 
Q.	And on your way back from that meeting, did you encounter any problems? 
A.	Yes.  We encountered some problems when we were returning to Kigali.  Because, when we arrived at Musambira, we noticed that people had mounted roadblocks across the road and were forced to stop.  They attacked us.  Fortunately, the other group with which we were was behind us and arrived.  You had some clashes, and we finally reached an understanding and carried on our route -- our journey without too much difficulty. 
Q.	And was this aggression against you on account of your MRND membership or for some other reason? 
A.	Yes.  As a matter of fact, it was the result of the practice of kubohoza.  There was intolerance, people -- MRND people, the PSD, and the FDC coalition did not accept, did not tolerate that someone from the MRND would freely come and organise or manage a rally in what they claim to be their stronghold, which was Gitarama and south of the centre.  And when they saw us was going there, they decided to organise and block us when we were returning. 
Q.	Now, approximately when was that then that took place? 
A.	Let me say between July and August 1992. 
Q.	And during that period of, let's say, from April 1992 on, were there other instances of clashes between the youth of -- or members of other parties and the youth or members of MRND? 
A.	As a matter of fact, the clashes -- I would place it around 1992, maybe early 1993, essentially because that is when the kubohoza practice was really hot.  

There are many cases.  You can list all of them.  But you had cases every time that went to rallies.  On returning, you would face problems.  And the MRND members were forced to defend themselves or to go through the gates by force.  Yes.  You had -- there were clashes. 
Q.	Now, during 1992 were there bandits or military deserters or other such people who joined Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't know any of them.  What I can say is that, if the main goal of the Interahamwe za MRND was to target elections that were to be held, our prime objective was to have the highest number of possible members.  But to claim that you had bandits or deserters who -- who joined or became members, I didn't notice that phenomenon personally. 
Q.	You described the people who had formed the Interahamwe, and collectively, they appeared to be a group of businessmen or educated individuals.  Did the composition of the Interahamwe change as the Interahamwe expanded over time? 
A.	As I told you a while ago, there was a transition from a think tank to a little structured organisation comprising many people.  And it is indeed that loss in the fundamental goal is the reason why that -- those intellectuals who were the founders of that organisation were suddenly in the back roles.  So you no longer have think tank meetings, as was the case in a meeting -- as it was in the beginning.  And those who remained are the people who had the duty to lead this to a congress which was supposed to take care of that structure.  

Yes.  There was a change.  There was a change from the situation of -- before the congress and the congress -- and then the congress of April 1992, and then after the congress, there was an evolution. 
Q.	And during the period after the congress, for example, who was it that was taking the initiative to organise people in different secteurs of Kigali to come out and join a demonstration or take some action as Interahamwe?  Who was doing that job? 
A.	I didn't quite get your question.  Against the Interahamwe?  
Q.	No.  I mean, my question is:  After April 1992, when the Interahamwe wanted to have a manifestation or some kind of demonstration or action, who organised that in the secteurs of Kigali? 
A.	The secteur had their own committees, their local committees.  And so it would be the local committee that would organise demonstrations at the secteur level.  But when it was at national or 
	préfectoral level, then we were the ones who would organise it in collaboration with the party. 
Q.	And what was the relationship between those who were in charge of the Interahamwe at secteur levels and the national committee of Interahamwe? 
A.	They were party members like everyone else.  And the relationship between the provisional 
	national committee and the secteur committees is that the committee could call on its local committees for the success of a given rally or demonstration, and it was incumbent -- incumbent upon the secteurs to decide whether they wanted to attend it or not.  But there was no hierarchal obligation towards the national committee. 
Q.	And how were the leaders of the Interahamwe at the level of secteurs chosen? 
A.	They met and at their local areas elected their representatives. 
Q.	So did the national committee of the Interahamwe appoint anyone to be in charge of the Interahamwe at level of secteurs? 
A.	I know that in some areas Kajuga went there to attend, to support the elections.  But I would like to let you know that the fact that someone was appointed or was setting up, no.  The committee had no role to play in choosing the president at secteur levels.  

They were sent to their areas.  We told them, "Go in there and organise yourselves."  And that is how they got together and elected their committees, that -- the committees that represented them. 
Q.	And after the congress of 1992, what was the relationship between the national committee of the MRND and the MRND executive, meaning President Habyarimana and Mathieu Ngirumpatse as secretary general? 
A.	The relationship remained the same; that is, there was no particular duty that was allotted the Interahamwe za MRND with respect to the party leadership.  What happened was that, when there was a problem or people had to react to a situation we were faced with, then we would meet and react.  There was no special action saying this -- you had this relationship, these activities which we had to carry out. 
Q.	Was there ever any occasion when the national committee signed letters to be sent to other individuals, such as Prime Minister Designate Faustin Twagiramungu? 
A.	Not for Twagiramungu.  But we had opportunities where -- occasions where we were forced to react, as you said a few minutes ago.  We had to react in face of certain situations.  We would sit down, write a letter, and either show that we were in agreement or denounce situations which were being sort of stuck on us, particularly Bugesera, when we were about to be saddled with any responsibility or any other activities in which the Interahamwe had played no role and yet were being accused of.
Q.	And did Mr. Ngirumpatse play any role in the drafting or initiating any letters that were sent by the Interahamwe national committee? 
A.	I did not know any letter which Ngirumpatse could have instigated.  Each time a problem arose, I repeat, President Kajuga would convene us, we would meet and decide about what to do thereto.  And there were -- it involved options, either carry out manifestation, a protest march or write letters or a letter to those concerned.  

But I never saw Ngirumpatse participate or initiate any action of that sort.  Rather, and much to the contrary, whenever we finished drafting any letter, that was when we went to inform him about it.  

And if we had decided about a manifestation or -- that's when we would go and inform him that's what we have decided.  So it was the reverse order.  We would go to inform him and inform the bureau about what we were -- that which we were doing so that we do not come across as a party within the party. 
Q.	Now, I want to direct your attention to a rally which took place on the 15th of November 1992 in Ruhengeri and which President Habyarimana attended.  Did you attend that rally? 
A.	Yes, I did attend that meeting -- that rally. 
Q.	And did other members of the national committee of Interahamwe attend? 
A.	Yes.  Kajuga was in attendance.  It was -- it is him that I remember right here and now.  This was a very, very popular meeting.  This was a highly attended meeting.  But -- and so it's difficult to say everybody was there.  Since -- I cannot say that every member was there.  But Kajuga was there.  I was there.  I think Phénéas as well was present. 
Q.	Did Interahamwe from Kigali attend that meeting? 
A.	Yes.  There were buses that drove in from Kigali.  They were -- these buses were loaded with persons who went to attend this meeting. 
Q.	And was that normal for national rallies of the MRND to have Interahamwe from Kigali bused to the locations of the rally? 
A.	It was perfectly normal.  And by the way, one of the aims or objectives we had within the Interahamwe za MRND was to animate meetings.  And so by assigning ourselves such duty -- in fact, it was not only from Kigali that these persons came.  People could move from Kibungo, and others would come from Gitarama.  

And whenever there was a meeting, particularly nationwide, a national meeting that was taking place within the préfecture, all -- all the members within the nation were invited.  And they would go there to animate the meeting and carry out the sensitisation to show to the region that -- or show the -- the -- the region what -- how strong the party was and also -- this was also to invite people to join the party.  That was part of the objective.  

So there was nothing abnormal about this.  In fact, it was only proper that the Interahamwe should move from one location to the other, and even other members of parties would move from one place to the other to attend regional meetings of the kind. 
Q.	Did President Habyarimana in his speech in Ruhengeri refer to the Interahamwe?  And if so, what did he say about them? 
A.	To begin with, I must tell you that President Habyarimana himself considered -- considered himself as a z'urubyiruko, friend of the youths.  And he was proud to see the youth mobilised within this party.  And he had made it clear, even before this meeting, that the Interahamwe organisation and the approach having been taken by this wing was going to be primordial in the electoral campaign that was upcoming.  

So he was there.  He talked to them about the Interahamwe.  He told them how proud he was about the manner in which they behaved themselves.  And he even envisaged providing some support, material support, to their activities. 
Q.	It's been said that President Habyarimana said that he was going to descend with his Interahamwe.  What did you interpret that to mean? 
A.	As for me, the way I read the position or the stance taken by President Habyarimana was that in Rwanda when it was said that the court or the tribunal was going to descend, it was going to do -- go on the ground.  It was to go on a fact-finding mission to look at the facts to be judged.  

And so it was the same thing for him.  And he was saying that he was going to go down with -- go with the Interahamwe for the campaign.  So descending, going down, this fact-finding mission was going 
to -- was supposed to mean he was going to get in contact with the population.  Unfortunately, this was poorly interpreted.  
And, first of all, this was the first meeting that he attended, the Ruhengeri meeting.  It was the first time he was appearing in public in a MRND meeting.  And so it was his duty to explain to the populace what exactly he intended to do during the electional -- electoral campaign.  

And that is why he was saying, "I will help you to get the necessary clothing and after which we will go down to meet the people.  We will go to meet the farmers.  And we will go down to the people rather than just stay at the helm or stay at the level of the préfecture." 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Did he say anything that led you to believe that the he wanted the Interahamwe to attack individuals who were Tutsi or members of other parties physically? 
A.	Never.  He never said any such thing.  There was no insinuation of any such thing.  And I believe that you had the records of his speech, the transcripts -- transcripts of his -- of his speech.  I don't think that he could have seen such a complex and a populated gathering (sic).  I did not hear any such thing from his mouth. 
Q.	Now, in August of 1992, some accords had been signed at Arusha.  Did President Habyarimana make any reference to the Arusha Accords that you heard?  And if so, what did you understand him to mean? 
A.	My opinion on the Arusha agreements was that we -- we always believed in the peace agreements.  Each one told himself, "Everything needs to be done for us to achieve peace," regardless of what it was going to cost.  We had been through a very, very bad experience, seeing one million people at the doors of Kigali starving and who were wandering in the city begging.  

And we told ourselves, "Is it -- if it is possible for these persons to go back to their property, to go back to where they belong, it would only be fine."  And so I was only -- very, very welcome so far as a 
peace agreement was concerned. 
Q.	What did you understand to be the MRND's position on the Arusha Accords? 
A.	What I just said was the global position within the MRND.  We had accepted to trade some posts, ministerial posts.  And we accepted that the RPF should come in and that the country should be at peace.  And so there was nothing that we were not going to accept, just in -- in case we were going to get peace in return, looking at the years of war, looking at the band -- growing banditry that had hit the country, the crime wave that was on the rise, the terrorism that was difficult to describe.  So within the party at least, the feeling that I -- I -- I felt which transpired was that whatever, at any cost, peace should be restored.  And so we were on the side of peace, we were advocating peace, and so we were on the side of the peace agreements.

And personally, even to give you an example, I believed in the agreements.  Personally, on the 6th of April, I was building a house.  I was buying paint to complete the house under construction in Nyamirambo.  And so if I -- I was not nursing this conviction that peace was on its way, I wouldn't have been spending those -- that -- that amount of money for a futile purpose. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time when the Interahamwe organised some kind of fund-raising event at the Rebero hotel? 
A.	At one time there was this sort of fund-raising.  And the aim was to obtain the funds to have constituent assembly of the MRND za -- of the Interahamwe za MRND.  And so I think it was -- this took place at the beginning of 1993. 
Q.	And who organised that meeting? 
A.	Mainly, it was Kajuga, but I must say that it was under the auspices of the national temporal committee of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Did you attend? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	And what happened at that meeting? 
A.	As a matter of fact, we organised something close to a reception where we invited persons and 
	where -- during which we took the floor.  We explained the problems we were facing.  We explained the structural problems that we were grappling with, after which we asked the people whether they could contribute financially to address those issues. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm waiting for the interpreter to turn off his microphone.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And were -- did people pledge some money and equipment? 
A.	Yes.  There were pledges to that effect.  People would rise and say, "Well, I promise to give you this or that", particularly public address system.  Others pledged sums of money.  But after that I don't know what happened. 
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera attend that meeting? 
A.	I did not see Nzirorera at that meeting. 
Q.	And what was the money to be used for? 
A.	The money was to be used in organising the constituent congress of the Interahamwe za MRND. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the interpreter could shut off his mike.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, who was the treasurer of the Interahamwe committee at that time? 
A.	He was known as Niyitegeka, Dieudonné. 
Q.	And after that meeting did there come a time when the treasurer was not receiving all of the money that was being raised by the Interahamwe? 
A.	I do not think that there was any moment when Niyitegeka was no longer treasurer until when we left the country in 1994. 
Q.	Did it come to the attention of the committee that there was some problem in connection with persons turning over funds to the treasurer? 
A.	No.  Apart from the person who resigned, we did not know about any such -- if someone made a promise and said that later that he could not do anything about it, he certainly just backed down.  There's nothing you can do.  The follow-up of -- as regards to those who paid up their pledges is not clear.  

But I know that the public address system which was promised was provided because I could see it from time to time on vehicles.  But as for the pledges, financial pledges, I did not do any follow-up to know exactly who paid up and who did not pay up.

1200H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	We've had testimony in this trial from an individual known as Witness G that there was a parallel committee of the Interahamwe, apart from the national committee, and that some individuals took it upon themselves to raise funds and not turn over those funds to the committee.  Do you know anything about that? 
A.	What I would say is, rather, that this is a feeling that maybe grew -- developed with time because there came a moment when people went seeking help from some personalities.  And, when the committee got there to collect some contributions they were told, "Well, this person has already been here and this is the receipt and so we are not going to do redundancy here; we cannot contribute twice."  And that was what in a -- in one way or other got people to think that there was a parallel committee.  But there was no parallel committee to the best of my knowledge until when we left the country in July 1994.  And until that date, the committee was the same and acted as such.  There was no 
parallel committee within the Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	Now, during the period after the rally in Ruhengeri in November 1992, continuing through the first half of 1993, did there continue to be clashes between members of political parties? 
A.	Clashes, yes.  There were some clashes, but these -- these dropped in intensity as time went on.  
Q.	And what was the nature of these clashes?  Was it between members of political parties or was it between Hutus and Tutsis? 
A.	These were clashes between political parties and their members.  I talked to you about the lack of tolerance between -- among these parties, and, in addition, there were other clashes that had to do with rivalries between competitors, between political parties.  

For example, in one location you'd find a kind of -- two or three political parties, and if you brought your flag and you were not among the two or three that was already there, it was going to be pulled down.  And such activities would normally degenerate into confrontations or clashes that were rather useless.  But that was what happened because nobody in the main -- those in the opposition never accepted the presence of the MRND, in particular, wherever they considered as their turf or their stronghold. 
Q.	Now, from the beginning of the formation of the MRND as a part of the multiparty system until the 
RPF attack in February 1993, did you attend rallies of the MRND outside of Kigali? 
A.	Meetings, yes.  I attended a number of meetings which held beyond or outside Kigali.  
Q.	Can you give us an estimate of approximately how many national-level meetings you held -- you attended outside of Kigali up until February 1993?  
A.	The limitation of the date is a bit of concern to me.  I remember I was -- Kibungo.  I attended a meeting in Kibungo; in Ruhengeri, of course, as I said a while ago; in Gisenyi as well; Gitarama rally; 
Cyangugu rally and Kigali rally.  
Q.	And at any of those meetings did you ever hear any speakers calling for the extermination of Tutsis? 
A.	Never did any speaker make such a call for the extermination of the Tutsi, and I told you so a while ago.  It was an impossible thing to do considering the composition of the people who were in attendance at that meeting.  
Q.	Now, do you know of any national-level rallies were held outside of Kigali after the RPF attack of February 1993? 
A.	All those meetings I talked to you were national meetings but which were held at préfectoral level.  Now, if I were to come back to the preceding question, I believe you have to allocate -- to lend some sense of dignity to the authorities who were at the head of the country at that time.  You need to be crazy to stand in front of a crowd and state -- and tell them to kill Tutsis.  

I -- in my view, it is a really racial accusation in nature.  You can't say -- and, such a 
high-ranking authority, a president of a party can stand in front of a crowd and call on them to exterminate another part of that people in front of him.  I think we owe those authorities some respect and dignity.  
Q.	Now, to your knowledge was there ever a rally in Kibuye at the Gatwaro stadium of the MRND in June of 1993? 
A.	I was not in Kibuye myself, but I know that there was a meeting that held at the Gatwaro stadium. 
Q.	Did you know when that meeting was held? 
A.	I no longer recall.  
Q.	And what about in Gisenyi?  It's been said that there was an MRND meeting at national level in October of 1993; is that correct? 
A.	I no longer recall that type of meeting.  The -- the meeting, which was held in Gisenyi, as I -- and I also said it is when Munyagishari was appointed, and it must have been in 1992, that was the inaugural rally of the party in Gisenyi, that's the one I attended.  But the one of 1993 I no longer recall.  I didn't attend it.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And do you know whether or not the situation after the RPF attacked in 
February of 1993 allowed for the holding of MRND national-level meetings outside of Kigali? 
A.	It is true that the situation had become complex.  The security situation was complex, but I don't see this opinion you want me to give.  I can't say why a meeting would not -- a rally would not have been organised in the day subsequent to that, maybe as the RPF had not -- had not arrived yet.  The intensity of meetings, it must be said, had reduced because people were scared of being attacked by other opposition parties.  That's -- that's what I can say.  
Q.	Now, directing your attention to July of 1993, was another congress of the MRND held at that time? 
A.	Yes, there was an extraordinary MRND congress which I attended.  
Q.	And do you know who was elected at that congress? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse was elected as president of the party and Édouard Karemera was elected vice-president.  Joseph Nzirorera was national secretary.  You also had Kabagema who was elected vice-president.  
Q.	Did you know Joseph Nzirorera before July 1993? 
A.	Yes, I had known him.  But under the African system, if you were to ask a Rwandan if he knew 
such-and-such a person, the Rwandan would say they knew them even if they just saw them (inaudible) or, if there was -- if it was just an acquaintance.  The question is if they know each other personally, that's another thing.  But I knew him in his capacity as a minister and as an authority.  
Q.	Did you have any contact with him prior to July 1993? 
A.	Yes.  Once I attended a mar -- a wedding of his sister-in-law.  I had been directly invited by a friend.  I saw him and I greeted him.  That's all.  
Q.	Prior to his election as secretary general of the MRND, did Joseph Nzirorera have anything to do with the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  And I am categorical about that because I never saw him, I never met him, I never sat down for any form of meeting, no.  
Q.	Do you know whether or not there was an Interahamwe organisation in Mukingo commune in Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	I don't know any organisation of that sort in the Mukingo commune.  
Q.	Now, also in July of 1993 there was a congress of the MDR held and a split in the MDR seemed to become apparent at that time.  Did that change anything with respect to the relationship between the Interahamwe and the other political parties? 
A.	I can't tell you if it changed anything, but the situation of the MRND party somehow brought together those who claimed to be republicans, those people who claim to want to have a continuation of the republic, so there was some form of closeness in the ideas.  But to say that you have the MRND people who had moved over -- crossed the gap to the MDR, I don't know any of those.  
Q.	But did any faction of the MDR become less an opposition to MRND and did that -- and was there any reduction in the intensity of the clashes between the parties as a result of the split in the MDR party? 
A.	As a matter of fact, it's by the force of things that maybe people realized.  Firstly, Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye had been disavowed by people whom he had appointed -- who appointed him to prime -- as prime minister, and people began to understand that the best option was not to force people to become members of their parties and that they had to accept the plurality of ideas.  So they kind of stepped back.  And as their members and their stronghold, which they had set up -- and their stronghold, I believe that this was more instrumental in reducing confrontations between the parties because under no circumstances, as I am aware, was there a formal attack from the MR -- MRND against the opposition people.  It was, rather, the contrary.  

With regard to the kubohoza practice, the MRND was always found it -- always found itself in a situation of self-defence.  
Q.	Now, we have had evidence of a rally at Nyamirambo stadium on the 23rd of October 1993 at which Froduald Karamira made a speech about Hutu Power.  Did you attend that rally? 
A.	I did not attend that rally.  
Q.	To your knowledge was that rally organised by MRND or Interahamwe? 
A.	The rally had been organised by the -- the MRND in particular, but, rather, of the MDC (sic).  I cannot say whether it was the Interahamwe or the MRND.  If it was the MRND which had organised it, then we would have been invited and would've attended.  So my answer is no, it wasn't the MRND that organised that meeting, it was rather a rally organised by the other group, FDC, to be more specific.  
Q.	And can you tell us what you mean by FDC? 
A.	FDC was the democratic force for change.  It was an alliance of parties which claimed to be in opposition and with the RPF.  As a matter of fact, we talked about the demonstration of the 27th or 28th of -- of the Pentecost weekend.  As a matter of fact, during that demonstration, while we were doing the demonstration, without knowing this -- this FDC party were meeting in Brussels -- were -- were meeting in Brussels to set up a joint strategy to combat the Habyarimana regime and his party, the MRND.  And that is how it was founded in around June 1992, and they were acting under the auspices of the group known as the FDC.  
Q.	Now, did you attend a rally in January of 1994 at Nyamirambo stadium at which Justin Mugenzi spoke? 
A.	Yes, I attended that meeting.  I was present. 
Q.	And was that meeting organised by the MRND? 
A.	Yes, it was.  The rally was organised by the MRND party.  
Q.	And did anyone call for the extermination of the Tutsi at that rally? 
A.	No one made any call against the Tutsis.  Rather, what I noticed is that there was some form of preparation (sic) of the heart.  People were tired because of the war, the prevailing situation, and the feeling was that everything should have been done for the RPF to join.  That is the atmosphere I felt -- what I felt at that meeting.  
Q.	Now, at the end of the December 1993, had the battalion of RPF soldiers come to Kigali and been housed at the CND? 
A.	Yes, the RPF battalion was located at the CND.  Yes.  
Q.	We've had evidence that on the 5th of January 1994, President Habyarimana was sworn in at the CND.  Did the Interahamwe organise any demonstrations in connection with the swearing-in of the 
transitional government on the 5th of January 1994? 
A.	Yes.  I would say that had nothing to do with the Interahamwe za MRND.  I would rather say it was part of the party and I was one of the -- a member of one of the important organ -- bodies of the MRND.  We didn't have any problem in the MRND.  All the members had been elected.  The ministers had been designated to represent the party and the president was about to take the oath of office.  So I cannot see how we could have organised a demonstration against the decision of the party.  The MRND had no problem whatsoever with regard to the setting up of the transitional institution to which the -- which had to include the RPF.  So there was no demonstration, be it on the 5th with regard to the setting -- the setting up of the broad-based transitional government.  
Q.	We've also had evidence that a few days later on the 8th of January 1994, some Interahamwe attempted to block the movement of persons who were believed to be attending some kind of 
swearing-in function.  Do you have any knowledge about that? 
A.	I was not aware.  Of course, I heard about it, I learnt about it that -- that we did not take part in that demonstration.  And it was of no interest for us to take part in that demonstration.  As I said a while ago, why would -- would we call people to go and demonstrate, whereas our -- your team is being set up, is sitting, and is waiting to be sworn in?  And the proof is that the parliamentarians or the authorities who were supposed to swear in were already there at the time when they were called.  But on the 8th, there was no demonstration organised by the Interahamwe za MRND.  I'm talking about the 8th of January 1994.  
Q.	Did the Interahamwe to your knowledge ever compile a list of Tutsis? 
A.	Never.  Never.  Never did we compile a list of Tutsis.  
Q.	Did the Interahamwe ever have a plan to kill Belgian soldiers? 
A.	The Interahamwe -- the Interahamwe never nurtured even the idea of hurting the Blue Helmets from Belgium.  
Q.	Do you know a person named Jean-Pierre or Abubakar Turatsinze?  
A.	Yes, I knew him as an acquaintance.  
Q.	What was his connection to the MRND or the Interahamwe? 
A.	First, with respect to the MRND, Turatsinze was a -- was a driver.  He -- a messenger, which is what I saw when I went to the headquarters of the party; it was somebody to whom you could give a message and who could be asked to go to a given secteur to inform people that the next day there was going to be a demonstration or a rally.  It was -- it was somebody who could be confided a duty as a messenger.  

That's what I used to see.  And in the M -- with regard to the Interahamwe, there was no direct role he could have played with respect to the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe.  He was available, if, for example, the president of the party wanted to meet one of the members of our committee, he could have sent him to come and tell you what the -- the information.  That is sort of the relationship that we had with Turatsinze.  
Q.	Was he ever the president of the Interahamwe for the secteur of Kigali? 
A.	I do not -- I'm unaware of Turatsinze having become the president of Interahamwe in Kigali.  
Q.	We've had evidence that in January 1994, Mr. Turatsinze told UNAMIR that the Interahamwe had been trained to kill a thousand Tutsis in 20 minutes and had a plan to kill the Belgian soldiers.  Is that true? 
A.	Firstly, that is untrue.  Secondly, what I would say is that that is one of the factors that proved the militia's manipulation that was created around the Interahamwe za MRND.  If you look closely, you'd realise that when he was staying -- saying that he was no longer within the organisation of the party, it would have been difficult for him to be aware of confidential information regarding the party, whereas he was no longer in it.  

What I can say, however, is that even the person who took him to UNAMIR ultimately disavowed him.  Even General Dallaire himself ultimately reached a conclusion that that person was not credible enough to provide information.  So this story is about killing machines in a timed manner, be it training that he claimed -- because up to this moment there's no confirmation as to that.  It doesn't hold water.  
Q.	Are you aware of any conflict between Turatsinze and Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, at some point in time we sought information to understand -- to know where Turatsinze was.  I, indeed, was trying to locate him because there was some information I wanted to get from him.  I was told that he was no longer at the MRND headquarters and that the new national secretary had had it with him and that he did not accept his modus operandi and that he had asked him to leave.  And so you can see the conflict is at that level of incompetence or lack of loyalty towards the new administrative team.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take our luncheon recess at this time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I think it's approaching 12:30.  We take our luncheon recess now until 2 o'clock.
(Court recessed from 1228H to 1409H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, before we resume, I have to remind everybody of what we all should know on the issue of 
cell phones.  Cell phones should be turned off during the entirety of our proceedings.  It was dramatised this morning where we had a bit of a disturbance in our microphones.  So I'd just like to put that on the record once more.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, just before resuming with the witness, I want to ask -- I'll alert you that tomorrow morning, before we resume, I would like to ask the Chamber to admit five Rule 92 bis statements, which were certified and submitted to the Trial Chamber in a submission of Rule 92 bis certified statements on the 14th of December 2009.  

It seems as though it's slipped through the cracks, that it's never been -- no exhibit numbers have ever been ordered to be given to those five statements.  So what I would like you to do is, perhaps you can have your staff retrieve that filing today and then tomorrow morning when I move to ask you to give admission of -- give exhibit numbers to those five statements, you can deal with it at that time.  I'm giving you some homework.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a more detailed reference to the application?  

MR. ROBINSON:
Well, the document was filed on the 14th of December 2009.  It's entitled, "Submission of Rule 92 bis certified statements from December 19 -- from December 2009".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Rutaganda, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us whether or not there was any military training of Interahamwe prior to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Well, as far as I know, I was not aware of such training provided to the Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	We've had testimony from Witness T that he received some kind of firearms training in the building of -- in the Kabuga building in Kigali where the MRND had its offices.  Do you know anything about that? 
A.	No, I don't know anything about that.  In fact, those type of statements are part of statements crafted around MRND personalities with a view to offend them.  If he stated that he was trained or that he was aware of training at that location, that surprises me, on the one hand, because if any clandestine training were to be organised it would not be conducted in the Kabuga building.  

Secondly, maybe they should have started by training the leaders of the Interahamwe who would then train others.  So I don't know.  I have never experienced that.  I never took part in any such training, and that is why it is my testimony that there was no such training.  
Q.	We've also had testimony from other witnesses who have said that they learned about training of Interahamwe at some military camps outside of Kigali, such as Gabiro and Gako camps.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	I know that it has been said around the place that such things did happen.  But as for the first case, I never participated.  I was not involved in any training for Interahamwe and I do not know how or why the Interahamwe committee would have considered training those people.  
Q.	Now, did there come a time when you learnt that some weapons had been distributed to the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  At some point I learnt that.  Yes, I did learn -- I was aware of that, yes.  
Q.	How did you become aware of that and when? 
A.	Sometime after the murder of Gatabazi and Bucyana, the president of the party, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, called us to his office.  We met him in his private office, and the issue was to determine how to organise ourselves to protect ourselves against such murders that had become popular.  

I do remember that I put the question myself as to how we could counter those attacks, given that the attackers were armed, and that even if people had tried to conduct rounds in their various neighbourhoods and taken any other measures, the others were armed.  And that is the point at which it was determined that a number of guns will be used for that purpose and made available for that purpose.  
Q.	And can you tell us who was present at that meeting.  
A.	The minister of defence was present.  There was also the minister of the interior.  It was a small meeting and it was convened by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  The other persons in attendance were members of the national provisional Interahamwe committee:  Kajuga, Robert; Phénéas; myself; Dieudonné, and I think that -- that is it.  
Q.	And who was the minister of defence at that time? 
A.	Bizimana, Augustin.  
Q.	And who was the minister of interior? 
A.	Munyazesa, Faustin.  
Q.	And during this meeting, can you tell us exactly who said what about distribution of arms.  
A.	Well, the meeting didn't last long.  The chairman of the party presented the situation to us -- the prevailing situation and expressed their concerns; namely, that people were being murdered, and we were certain that we were not the ones who had conducted or carried out those assassinations or killings.  So the idea was that people of the MRND would be targeted for assassination and the impression would be given that it was being done by those who had initially been attacked.  

So we needed to find ways and means of providing protection for members of the MRND by assessing the situation in the evenings and at night, because that is when the attacks took place, so that we should not fall into that trap.  That was said by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

Then I put my question.  And when I did, the minister of defence told us that we had been provided the necessary material.  In those words.  He didn't talk about guns.  He simply said that the necessary material -- in those words -- had been given for us to be able to counter those attackers.  And he told us to contact Kajuga, Robert, and that is where the meeting ended.  We left and everything was in Robert's hands to determine what was going to be done, where he had placed it, and what he had done with it and all else.  
Q.	Now, when you heard the minister of defence say that the material had already been provided to Robert Kajuga, was that a surprise to you? 
A.	Yes, it was surprising that we be informed of that acquisition simply because we had been convened to that meeting.  So we blamed Kajuga for this.  We asked him why such material had been handed to him and he had not informed anybody.  He did not call us together to determine how the material would be distributed or not distributed, or put to any other purpose.  So he apologised and said that he had intended to do so.  But we simply became aware of this situation, whereas we had been convened to a meeting to discuss ways and means of moving forward. 
Q.	And then what steps did you take after that meeting to get an explanation from Kajuga? 
A.	What we did, in fact, was to ask him to tell us -- to show us the material, and he gave us a number of appointments which he did not respect.  On that very afternoon he failed to honour the appointment.  
In the evening at night he gave us appointments at the hotel where he lodged or at his home.  And at the end of the day we realised that he was playing games with us and that is how things happened.  
We never saw that material that had been mentioned.  

Later on, through rumour and from other sources, we learnt that he had sold that material to a rebel movement in Burundi in collaboration with Turatsinze.  
Q.	And did you seek any information from Turatsinze when you learnt about this situation in late February after the death of Gatabazi? 
A.	In our quest to locate the material, we went to Turatsinze's at some point to try to contact him, because we had learnt that he was also involved in receiving the material.  But he was not there.  He had disappeared and we were not able to see him.  And so we could not get any explanation from him because we didn't see him.  
Q.	And when you say "we" were searching for Kajuga or "we" were searching for Turatsinze, who are you speaking about besides yourself? 
A.	Yeah, I'm referring to Kajuga, Phénéas, Dieudonné.  We worked together in a team, those of us who were present at the meeting.  So when we went to contact Turatsinze on this matter, we all went together.  
Q.	Even Kajuga? 
A.	Kajuga -- well, he was not with us.  We had lost track of him.  He had made promises to us which he did not keep.  So, somehow, we wanted to cross-check the information we had received to the effect that he had been working with Turatsinze.  When Kajuga met us, it was simply to give us another appointment either in the evening or in the afternoon, until such a point as we became fed up.  
Q.	And so am I understanding you correctly that the people who were trying to get the explanation about this material from Kajuga and from Turatsinze was yourself, Phénéas and Dieudonné? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And what was your understanding of the purpose that these weapons were to be used for? 
A.	As a matter of fact, the use of these weapons had to do with the intervention of Ngirumpatse when he called us to his office and he put the security situation to us, that which was prevalent at the time.  And he asked us to study a strategy and the possibility of ensuring the security, particularly of persons that were targeted and who were senior-ranking officials of our party because, from an analysis of the situation, their turn was very, very close, their turn to be killed.  
Q.	Was it your understanding that the weapons were to be used to exterminate Tutsis? 
A.	When -- when -- when you talk about Tutsis, now, that -- that bothers me very much and I must say this.  You -- you cannot plan to kill Tutsis and entrust the same equipment into the hands of the same Tutsis.  Yet Turatsinze himself was a Tutsi.  Kajuga himself was Tutsi.  We never sat down -- and even before we received this equipment, we did not sit down to say we're going to receive this equipment to attack this or that person at all.  It is out of the question to think that this equipment was meant for the extermination of Tutsis.  

I said it very, very clearly here before that this equipment, as was pointed out to us by the 
minister of defence -- and, by the way, it looks like Kajuga even explained to us that this was the remainder of some equipment that had been used after a war -- the recovery war -- that some were -- were even ill-equipped, they were not complete, there were no loaders.  And it (sic) was not supposed to really tell us all that.  But the equipment was not meant for any action to attack the population.  
It was -- as we were told, it was meant for the protection of leaders of the party.  
Q.	Were you aware of any plan to exterminate Tutsis? 
A.	That plan never existed, and with good reason, because, on the basis of the Rwandan society and on the basis of the administrative structure of government, military -- the military, and even relations -- the individual relations, it was impossible to put up a plan to eliminate Tutsis and keep it as a secret.  That was impossible.  As for me, I never got to know about any such plan to exterminate the Tutsis.  
Q.	Were you ever a member of a joint criminal enterprise who had as its object the extermination of Tutsis? 
A.	I was never a member of a joint criminal enterprise to eliminate Tutsis.  
Q.	I want to now turn your attention to the 6th of April 1994.  Can you tell us what happened to you that evening?  
A.	Well, that's a long story but -- well, what happened was this:  I was on my return from Kigali where I had dropped some friends with whom we had shared a drink in the evening, and then I was stopped on the way at a roadblock and led to a location close to the Kimihurura roundabout.  And there were many people there.  We were maltreated.  We were asked to lie down on the ground.  

There was an exchange of gunfire between the CND -- the CND and the republican guards that was close to that roundabout.  But finally towards midnight -- or midnight, 1 a.m., a vehicle drove in and pointed its headlights on the group where we were lying down, and there was a captain who recognised the friend with whom I was.  He called for him.  And at the same time he saw me, he also called me.  And this captain had done law in university and so he knew us.  And he asked me, "But what are you doing here?"  I just stood, said, "Well, look, I'm obeying orders."  And he gave instructions to the warrant officer who was in charge to ask him to allow us to leave.  

At the same time he asked me whether I could recognise any persons that were there.  And I identified a certain Norbert Muhaturukundo, and I also identified another person who was the director of finance or the director of taxation at the ministry of finance.  I knew him since our university days.  And they -- he was asked to -- to rise, but it was just us that were allowed to leave immediately.  From there, and even before leaving, I asked the captain, "What -- what's happening?  Why are people treated in this manner?"  And he said, "Look, don't ask too many questions.  Just tell us exactly where do you live."  
I said, "I live on the other side.  I need to go past the CND."  And he told me, "No, no, no, no, no.  Please, don't go past the CND.  Go backwards and go round." 

Now, this was around 3 a.m. that I finally got my contact -- the -- the keys -- the contact keys for my car because they had been withdrawn from me.  And after that we walked towards the car, which had been abandoned about -- a few kilometres away since we went on foot.  We went back, got the car, and used the Gikondo road towards Kicukiro.  Before we got to SONATUBE, Kicukiro, we went across another roadblock which was very, very, very fierce.  We were asked to alight from the vehicle, as before.  We were searched and they were saying, "Well, you killed him.  We will kill others."  

And I was asking, "But who did you kill?  Who -- who was killed?"  And until then, we were not yet aware of the fact that there had been something.  We knew that something serious had happened, but exactly what, we did not know.  And after that, we went all the way home and we got home around 
5 a.m., and it was my wife who informed me that the president's plane had been shot down.  
Q.	Now, who were the persons that stopped and detained you at the first roadblock on the 6th of April?  Was it -- was it military authorities, gendarmes, Presidential Guards, RPF?  Who was it? 
A.	In fact, when we were stopped on that road, normally there was public lighting, but on that day the lighting was not on.  It was either not put on or it had broken down.  Initially, we did not know exactly who had stopped us because -- and since it was close to the CND, we even had some suspicions that it was the RPF that had come out of the CND and that it was the end for us.  

But later on when this warrant officer who was going up and down, who was going round in circles, who was lamenting and saying, "It is you people who have held meetings to destroy the country", we then understood that this was soldiers -- these were soldiers from the government.  And since this was close to the republican guard camp -- and I understood that it was from there.  And there were shots from the CND, and there was also fire -- gunfire in retaliation towards the CND.

1435H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And in Gikondo, the roadblock that you encountered there, who were the people manning that roadblock? 
A.	That was obvious.  It was gendarmes who were manning that roadblock. 
Q.	So you arrived at your house on the 7th at around 5 a.m. and you were informed by your wife that President Habyarimana had been killed.  Can you tell us now what you did on the 7th of April? 
A.	On the 7th of April about just simultaneously there was a communiqué published forbidding everybody from going out of his or her house.  And so I was not an exception to this order.  My friend and 
myself -- my friend who had not been able to go to his own house since his house was located in a rather dangerous area, given the circumstances that were prevailing, we felt that later on when it would be daylight he would go home.  

And so we stayed there, and I even recall that I even had to lend him a pair of trousers to wear.  And I didn't leave my home -- we didn't leave our home.  We spent the entire day just waiting to see that which was going to happen. 
Q.	Now, we have had testimony from a witness named -- with a pseudonym of UB who says that he saw you in Kigali town on the 7th of April and that you were distributing weapons.  Is that true? 
A.	That's absolutely false.  I got to my home at 5 a.m.  I didn't budge from there.  I stayed indoors, like everybody.  It's a lie. 
Q.	Now, on the 7th of April did you have any contact by telephone with any other members of the 
	national committee of Interahamwe? 
A.	I had no such contact with the national committee of Interahamwes.  No.  No.  I had no contact. 
Q.	And what about with the national executive committee of the MRND, particularly Mr. Ngirumpatse, Karemera or Nzirorera?  Did you have any contact with them on the 7th of April? 
A.	I had no contact with them.  I stayed indoors.  I did not move.  I did not call anybody whosoever.  And nobody also called me. 
Q.	Can you tell us what you did on the 8th of April? 
A.	The day after the 7th was the 8th.  In the morning we agreed between myself and my friend, my colleague, that it was necessary for us to go out and look around, because there was experience that people could isolate themselves or just stay indoors and not know that the people in the environment had fled and that -- and the fighters of the RPF may have been able to come to arrest us right there.  

So we decided to go out of the house.  And when we went out just to walk along the streets, just to take note of the situation that was prevailing, we saw -- or I saw two corpses of neighbours that were on the ground and covered with grass.  I dared not go much closer, but that is what I saw.  

And in the meantime, even before we went back home, we met another neighbour who told us that there was some work of clearing being done at the gendarmerie and that we were supposed to go and participate in that task, that everybody was supposed to go and work in this umuganda.  

And so we went to the brigade, the gendarmerie brigade, to not only participate in the work but also to enquire about the situation and to know exactly what was happening.  We told ourselves maybe there may be much more than what we learned from down there, what (inaudible).  We were doubting.  We were in uncertainty.  

And so when we got there we tried -- we began also working, but as we were working we were talking with people and that's where we learnt from people as we questioned -- that we learnt that on the evening of the 7th, some people had been killed, particularly the family of the elder brother of Kajuga, Robert.  The neighbour who was a trader whom I mentioned to you, his name was also mentioned, and that there were also people who had fled.

After which, while we were working, the RPF began firing at us.  But unfortunately -- or, fortunately, the bullets that got to us did not hit us.  They just fell like stones because they were far, far away.  And we felt that they had gone to look for reinforcement and that they were going to do us harm, and next time we realised that the umuganda was to be dispersed.  

And I went back home, and I realised that with what had happened the day before, I needed to evacuate at least my family, because we had a child of a few months.  And I told myself I would not be able to flee or run with that baby.  And so I took the mother, I took the other younger children, and I led them to Hôtel Rebero l'Horizon, because I told myself, since the RPF attacks were from the CND, from the moment when they get to the point where they go past the stadium getting to Kicukiro, would have had time to meet at Hôtel Rebero and to take them again much further to safety.  

And on my return, when I got back I packed my car, and we went out, still with my friend, to go out and know what was happening on the (inaudible) side that was to the south of Kicukiro.  

And on my way out I met the Bengalese soldiers who asked us where was my wife, because apparently they -- she helped them sometimes to give them provisions, and so they asked the questions.  And I told them, "Well, no, I went and hid them.  I went and put all the family in hiding."  

And they asked me, "And where did you take them to?"  I said, "I took them to Hôtel Rebero."  And they said, "Oh, if you can, please take them out of there as fast as possible because this -- there is no guarantee of safety in that place.  There is no security there.  And there may even be RPF people around Rebero."

This was night.  There was nothing I could do about it.  I could not sleep.  It was only in the morning that I went and got them back and brought them to the house.  
Q.	Now, during the 8th of April did you have any contact with members of the Interahamwe committee? 
A.	No.  I had no contact with anybody.  I was occupied.  We did this work, this community labour, as I said, and I was busy trying to evacuate the family.  And nobody called me, and neither did I call anybody. 
Q.	We've had testimony from Witness HH at this trial that on the morning of the 8th of April you and 
Robert Kajuga and some others went to the bar of Joseph Setiba in Gitikinyoni to tell him to start exterminating Tutsis, and you had with you a letter from Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Is that true? 
A.	That's not true.  In your question there are a number of elements.  First of all, Kajuga could not have been at Gitikinyoni.  That is in the first place.  Secondly, to have a letter from Mathieu, that's not true.  That's false, because if he had sent us to find Setiba he certainly would have given us a verbal instruction.  

Now, a letter to present to Setiba, well, that is rather ridiculous.  But globally I must say this is all part of the manipulation, the framing, the lies that are fomented, that are put together to run down MRND senior-ranking officials. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us what you did on the 9th of April? 
A.	I began by saying or telling you that I took my family back home.  And when I got home my neighbours, neighbours with whom I lived, and domestic staff told me that my father had called and said that if I -- whenever I arrived I should call him.  So I called him, and he told me that there was the family of a cousin of mine which had virtually been exterminated and that I was supposed to do all I could to get them buried.  This was the request of my uncle, who had talked to my father, saying that I should do everything to get them buried.  

And, of course, I told him this was rather difficult for me.  I could not move from where I was at Kicukiro all the way to Kacyiru.  It was difficult.  First of all, some fighting was going on in Kacyiru.  I had no money to take me there.  But I said, "Well, I promise, I'll give you my word, I'll do the best I can."  

And immediately after, I called one of the persons whom I had driven to town on the night of the 6th.  I called this person, and I asked him -- I told him where he could find a little truck that was in our garage in our home in a compound in Amgar and where he could find money.  

So I gave him the mission.  I entrusted him the task of looking for coffins but also finding (inaudible) who were actually to help him evacuate the corpses from Kacyiru and take them to an area known as Muhima, which was much closer and which the fighting was less intense and where the danger was not so bad.  And that's how we got to the point of burying them.  

And when I obtained the authorisation to go about, I went and joined them.  I went and got this authorisation to drive around from the conseiller.  And he refused.  And he said, "While we are doing our work, you are hindering us from continuing to do our work.  Please come back and see us tomorrow."  

When I got back home to call my correspondent -- that's the person of whom I talked to you about -- the telephone line had been cut.  There was no longer a telephone line.

And so the next day I got up -- and we are now on the 10th -- I rose from bed, and I went to the conseillers, who got me to wait until 12 and past 12.  And from there I was given an authorisation to go about.  

And I took my friend and (inaudible) and we left, using roads which were less dangerous, proceeding through Gikondo -- Gikondo to roundabout, then going down to Muhima to another family friend's house, and where we had took some corpses.  And I still found them again loading the corpses, certainly -- certainly because the coffins were not enough in number.  They had to put, maybe, sometimes two corpses into one coffin.  

And all these were loaded onto the little truck, and with a lot of difficulty we crossed the road onto the road which is going up towards the roundabout from the Avenue of Justice all the way to 
Amgar -- Amgar where we were supposed to take my sister because I wanted to invite her to help us to organise the ceremonies of funerals of our loved ones.  

We waited and waited and until -- because I felt that she was the one that was delaying us.  But this was because the coffins were being searched, because there were rumours that coffins were being used to transport ammunition for some RPF soldiers that had gone ahead.  

When I rose, I went to see what the situation was because I was at the back.  And finally they gave us the possibility of continuing.  And thereafter we continued on our way towards Nyamirambo, and at Nyamirambo I met people at the roadblock -- and, well, this is a long story, you know.

When we got to the cemetery -- and this is the cemetery which was -- Butamwa it was being called at the time.  And normally the graves were dug just halfway.  And so when you got there and you chose the area which you wanted, there is -- only there and then that the -- the proprietor would ask -- would appear for him to indicate the amount of money necessary.  
But since it was not just one person concerned, we all had to go there.  And I went to a home that was very close to borrow equipment.  And I was told, "No, no, no.  You cannot get this equipment to do the digging.  You must hire it."  And I said, "But how much?"  And I was told 2,500.  Well, I did not have any change, and so I gave 5,000.  

And I went back, and we began digging and completing the digging of the tombs by ourselves.  
I myself -- I went down into the graves and dug, only to realise that it was impossible to complete the digging of five tombs on that afternoon.  And so we were done only with two tombs.  And we decided to bury the corpses which we had and to do a sketch of the location.  And we agreed that after the war we would come back -- we would come back to do the burial per se.  

It was the evening.  We could see smoke all over.  We could see Kicukiro.  There was fighting.  And from there we left, and we went back, since we had to go past the town and go to Kicukiro, where it got towards 7 o'clock, 7 o'clock past. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, on these activities, during the 9th and the 10th of April, you have now described your activities for both of those days.  Did you have any contact with any member of the national committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  I had no contact.  All along, all through this period, I never had any contact with whosoever either at the bureau of the chief or contact with the head of the MRND or the provisional committee.  
Q.	Now, we've had testimony from Witness HH that on the 9th and the 10th of April at the Diplomates hotel members of the Interahamwe received arms and that you were present during the distribution of those arms.  Is that true? 
A.	I -- well, to begin with, that's a lie.  I must say that. And secondly, I never participated in any meeting at Hôtel Diplomates concerning the distribution of weapons.  
Q.	Now, it's also known that on the 10th of April and perhaps continuing on to the 11th, members of the Interahamwe national committee were convened at the Diplomates hotel and sent around to various secteurs to try to get people to stop the killing.  Did anybody contact you to join them on that mission? 
A.	Nobody contacted me.  And, by the way, I even learnt that only later when I was in detention.  I was detained, and that is when I began reading some documents, and I saw that Dieudonné -- no, rather, Ephrem and Bernard had been to see Dieudonné and that Dieudonné Niyitegeka had asked them where exactly Mr. Georges was.  And they said, "No, he's there in the bush very close to Kicukiro.  We will go on without him."  

And when they asked, "Who is Kajuga?  Where is Kajuga?"  They said, "We don't know where Kajuga is, but we are compelled to do the work that we are doing."  And, "What of Phénéas Ruhumuliza?"  They said, "Well, not at all.  We don't know."

And so the suggestion was that neither the president, Kajuga, nor the first vice-president nor the second were present, were among the delegation which went around in the secteur, (inaudible) an operation which I only got to know better about much later.  
Q.	Now, turning to Monday, the 11th of April 1994, can you tell us what you did on that day? 
A.	On the 11th April, very early in the morning -- and because of what had happened to me on Sunday, these activities that have to do with burial and funerals, I did not sleep well.  And so in the morning towards 5 a.m., my neighbour called me -- and my neighbour called me -- he's still alive, 
Rucekeri, Innocent -- he told me that he had climbed on his wall.  

And we spoke to each other because we were living -- he lived just behind my plot.  And he told me that the RPF had already arrived our locality, our neighbourhood, and that it is only necessary that we be evacuated.  

And I said that "How can I do that when I don't have enough --"  "Well," he told me, "whatever it would cost you, please leave."  And I asked, "But who gave you this information?"  And he told me it was from the watchman.  The night watchman had seen a line of individuals carrying equipment or material or weapons and they were going through our neighbourhood.  

And that was true because there was a child of a certain Nduhungirehe who was also my neighbour.  When they heard people passing, two boys went out.  And one, the first one who came out, was stabbed and he fell inside.  And his brother ran, jumped over the fence and told the story to others.  

So I asked him the question.  And why did I ask the question?  It was because they had arrived and there was no place where they were going to live.  

Now, the experience which we had gotten from the refugees of Remera, it was that when they got to a neighbourhood they would occupy the house of an accomplice so that at a certain moment in time they can move into higher gear, into action.  And we told ourselves that certainly he must have entered that house and that it was necessary -- there was need to be very, very careful.  

And so I told myself, "Well, I will take my family.  I will take those I can take and take them at least to Kigali.  And I was going to come back to get some personal effects. 
(Pages 38 to 43 by Claudette Ask)





1500H
THE WITNESS (continued):
	But nobody, from all those who were among with me -- nobody wanted to stay behind, and so we were compelled to get to board my 505 and -- Peugeot -- and we were compelled to get into that bus, about 14 or 15 of us, and we left and went as far as Kigali at a friend's home where I had to talk to them.  And I had to come back to pick up my personal belongings.  When we got there, my friend -- a friend who -- whom we wanted to ask for help, we found him packing his things and looting them.  He also was about to flee, and I told him, "Please give me the keys of the cupboards.  We will do the best we can."  And I don't have -- well, I cannot continue.  I said, "Well that's fine."  And he said, "Well, just look for some place."  And he -- on my return he came trembling, and he said:  "No, no, no, no, no.  Leave. Leave.  You must leave here.  You too must leave.  We must leave."
MR. NIMY: 
I am sorry, Mr. President.  I have the impression that the recorders have difficulties following because the witness is going rather fast.  Can he go much more slowly just to facilitate the task of these ladies.  

So, Witness, you are going too fast.  
THE WITNESS:  
I am very sorry.  I told myself that they were following, and if they were not following, they would have maybe pointed that out to me and they would have asked me to slow down. 

Can I proceed? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please. 
THE WITNESS:
So what I was saying is that our friend at whose home I was supposed to leave my family in Kigali, in Kiyovu neighbourhood, left to fetch some fuel.  But upon his return, he was trembling because he had obtained information that it had become absolutely necessary to evacuate the city.  He convinced me that we should leave although I did not have enough fuel.  So he said, "We must leave, and if we run into any difficulties on the way, I will take the children and their mother and you will take care of yourself."  But in any event, we had to evacuate the city.  It is at that point that we decided to leave the city -- to evacuate the city. 

When we got to the Kabuga building, in front of that building we ran into some problems.  But most of the people there knew me because they were from my place of origin, and they said, "Let the women proceed, but the men must go back."  Men were not authorised because any man who left the capital at that time was considered to have abandoned the people.  So we tried to convince them, and I told him -- I told them myself that we were simply taking our families to Ruyenzi, at least as far as Ruyenzi, which was some 8 or 10 kilometres away from Kigali.  And in so doing, we would have assisted them in going through more complicated areas and then let them to proceed.  So finally they said, "No.  We know your wife.  She knows how to drive and let her drive."  And I asked them, if she were driving, who would take care of the baby.  So we had those types of discussions, at the end of which they let us to proceed and we went on to Ruyenzi.  And in Ruyenzi I was lucky to get some fuel because there were some filling stations in that area.  So I filled my tanks, and I bought two jerrycans of fuel, and we continued to Gitarama, and then we went our separate ways.  That is, the family of my friend went their way to Kibuye, and we -- we were headed for Masango.  So we went right to Masango, arriving there in the evening. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, I want to ask you some questions about the roadblocks that you encountered, starting even from the 8th of April in Kigali.  Who was manning those roadblocks? 
A.	In the capital in Kigali and from what I saw, you see, I went out the first time to Rebero to drop off my family, and the main roads of the city had roadblocks that were manned by soldiers.  But in other areas there were some civilians, particularly in Kicukiro towards the ascent to Nyanza.  And there were other roadblocks which were manned by a mixed group of civilians and soldiers.  And what was specific was that the lifting of the roadblock itself was done by civilians at such a -- mixed manned roadblocks.  And there is a particular roadblock which was in front of Amgar which was manned by soldiers because this is a main road leading to Radio Rwanda and to downtown Kigali, and it was a -- a major intersection in terms of security, and that roadblock was manned by soldiers. 
Q.	And who had given the order to civilians to man roadblocks? 
A.	My assumption is that it was the local administrative authorities who gave the orders. 
Q.	Did some people man roadblocks without receiving any orders?  Were there unofficial roadblocks that you saw? 
A.	Yes, there were unofficial roadblocks which were set up by individuals who organised themselves.  You know that during the war chaos was obtaining, and it was not possible to control everything.  That is how one could see properly organised roadblocks with people rotating from 6 a.m. to a certain time with a -- a list of persons manning that roadblock and also the names of the leaders of the roadblock.  So those were the types of roadblocks that were set up by the administrative authorities and by -- by the military to ensure security.  But it also happened that there were certain roadblocks that were set up haphazardly by people who didn't have any other objective then that of looting and plundering in an unofficial manner. 
Q.	Did you encounter Interahamwe at any of the roadblocks in Kigali? 
A.	I did not distinctively notice the presence of Interahamwe at roadblocks.  That does not mean and I do not intend to say that when roadblocks were set up by the Interahamwe for the population the Interahamwe refused to go there.  What I'm saying is that they did not object to participating in the actions undertaken by the population.  Clearly they must have been involved in actions by the population that were ordered by the administrative authorities.  I am not in a position to tell you that people went to man the roadblocks in their capacity as MRND - za MRND.  What I'm saying is that they went to the roadblocks in the same capacity as other members of the population with a view to manning those roadblocks for the purposes for which they were set up. 
Q.	Is there a difference between the term "Interahamwe" as it applied to people before the 6th of April and the term "Interahamwe" as it applied to people after the 6th of April?
A.	Yes.  Clearly there is a difference.  When one talks about the Interahamwe za MRND, one is referring to members of the MRND.  But when the word "Interahamwe" is used as such, in that case reference is simply being made to people, to inhabitants, members of the population who rose against the invasion of the RPF to check the advancing of the RPF.  These would be the members of the population who were involved in the management or manning of those roadblocks.  And that is the way "Interahamwe" should be understood.  From the evidence before the Tribunal, even from the Prosecutor's position, I think that distinction is clear.  What I am saying is that the Interahamwe za MRND were - well, some of them were part of what became referred to as the Interahamwe after the 6th of April. 
Q.	To your knowledge, did any of the leaders of the MRND -- Mr. Ngirumpatse, Karemera or
	Nzirorera -- give any orders or instructions to MRND members to either man or create roadblocks? 
A.	The steering committee of the party did not give any instructions to the Interahamwe za MRND, not only for them but even for all officials of the party.  When we spoke to -- when one spoke to members of the population, one felt that they were absent.  That they were involved in something else other than providing guidance for their members, whether it be in terms of what you have just referred to, namely, that anybody would have showed up to say that we should do this and that.  No, we did not have any direct interaction except through communiqués and announcements over radio. 
Q.	Did you see any dead bodies in the area of roadblocks? 
A.	The first time I went out, as I told you, was on Friday the 8th.  But then when I returned to town on Sunday the 10th, I saw dead bodies strewn along the road but not specifically at any given point.  So one could go by a dead body along the road at some roadblocks.  I know, for example, that at the Amgar roadblock I did not see any dead bodies. 
Q.	Were you aware that in this period from the 7th through the 11th of April 1994 people were being killed because of being suspected as RPF accomplices or Tutsis? 
A.	As far as I am concerned and from what I observed, during that period, yes, there were a number of murders, some killings had taken place, because we had learnt about people who had been killed, who had died.  But from my observation -- and it is my opinion that during that period Tutsis -- in fact, no one was being tracked down because they were Tutsi.  And the proof of that is in the fact that all the Tutsis or Hutus who felt threatened had opportunity to flee and to seek refuge in hotels, in parishes, in hospitals and what have you.  So I think that the issue was rather one of targeted assassinations. 
Q.	Or was it safe for a Tutsi to walk up to a roadblock in Kigali between the 7th and 11th of April, produce his identity card showing that he was Tutsi? 
A.	Not only for Tutsis.  You see, in my opinion, the Rwandan conflict was much more complex than people think.  When I learnt that President Habyarimana had been killed, I became immediately frightened because I did not know whether one or the other of the conflicting parties in place would target me.  There are some historical facts that we have not had opportunity to delve into here.  

	There were regional conflicts, the north pitted against the south and the south having absolutely rallied behind the majority, the RPF, to avenge those who had been killed in the coup d'état of 1973.  So the people in the north did not trust those from the south.  There was the war by the RPF, and one did not know whether one would be classified as belonging to the RPF or not.  

	And a -- if Habyarimana had been killed by the RPF, as it had done, then there were such conflicts in place.  There were internal conflicts within parties and between various groups, and that could also have been the reason for one to be killed by any of those parties.  There were conflicts arising from the economic situation because people may have wanted to get rid of you because you had some economic strength and what have you.  

	So when the RPF reignited hostilities and President Habyarimana was killed everybody was frightened.  And by the way, I think this is the reason for which it became difficult to find a replacement for him, because people felt that if they took up the position, would the other party accept them.  Would the -- would they survive the ethnic or political conflict.  

	And that is what led the country into that period of uncertainty.  It was not only about Tutsis.  It was about everybody.  Why did I take my family to Rebero?  Why did I not take them directly to Masango?  It is because I was not sure that I would be able to go through.  I could have shown up and identified myself but then would be -- identify myself to somebody with whom I would be in conflict and who would have killed me.

	So yes, Tutsis, some of them who were initially deemed to be pro-RPF because they expressed those opinions, I cannot say that it was easy for them to go through roadblocks.  But I think the same applied for everybody. 
Q.	And we know that many people were killed in Kigali between the 7th and 11th of April.  Why? 
A.	I don't know how I can explain these things to you, and I don't know how I can answer your question.  But I think that there was a connotation given to those people as having assassinated Habyarimana. And some persons, whom I do not know even up to this day, acted and killed other persons. 
Q.	But were these members of the population who were killing other people -- were they doing that on someone's orders? 
A.	No.  I am not aware of any orders that were given for members of the population to engage in killing each other.  I am not aware of any such orders. 
Q.	And so then what was the reason why they were killing each other?  Was it a spontaneous anger or fear from the death of the president? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Now, there has been a lot of leading all during the course of this direct-examination, but it's getting to a point that it's really unacceptable now. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I can rephrase my question, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	What was the reason why people were killing each other in Kigali between the 7th and 11th of April?
MR. WEBSTER:
Even that question is objectionable.  I mean how can this witness give a reason for why all of the killings were going on in Kigali?  Now you asked the question at least two or three times already, and there was no answer.  I didn't object the first time, but I think at the third time around it's time to move on to something else. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, that's a different objection then, and it's not leading.  It's -- I guess the objection is asked and not answered.  But perhaps you can indulge me to allow the witness to answer it. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I hadn't answered the question yet.  I haven't answered the -- I hadn't answered the question yet.  I was simply going to say that if I offered any answer, it would have been to -- a matter of my own observations and my opinion.  I did not conduct any investigations.  I did not go to ask those killers why they had killed their neighbours.  But the possible explanation is that there was fear.  There was fear, some kind of fear, on the one hand, those who did not accept the fact that President Habyarimana was killed.  Then there were those who were of the opinion that if President Habyarimana has been killed, then we might be next in line; therefore, we must act preemptively.

	So I'm trying to understand how people behaved at that time in the face of their anger, their fear.  And particularly, given that throughout the war people had lived together, they had been together and there came a time when Tutsis wanted to demonstrate that the Hutu power had disappeared because the RPF had come.  They did not make too much noise about it, but it -- it was being said, and so many people believed that the time for the Hutu to be in power had come because it wasn't acceptable yet that the RPF was engaged in the war.  My opinion is that it was a spontaneous reaction arising from anger and fear at the same time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, for the record, we overrule your objection. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Now, we've had --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much longer do you think you have in chief?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think I will finish by the mid-morning -- by the luncheon break tomorrow morning.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	There has been testimony by Witness HH that you recovered weapons that had been stored at the MRND headquarters immediately after the death of the president and obtained those weapons for yourself and others.  Is that true? 
A.	I do not know when they claim or at what time they claim that I recovered those weapons.  After the
	6th of April I never went back to the MRND headquarters. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us how long you remained in Gitarama. 
A.	We arrived in Masango on Monday the 11th in the evening.  I looked for accommodation for my family and for those with whom we had come.  The next day -- you see, our family house did not have enough room.  So we went to a place known as Karambi, which is close to Masango commune where my
	junior brother had an unfinished house.  That is where we stayed.

	And as I said, it was an unfinished house.  There was no toilet.  There were no showers.  There was nothing.  So I decided myself to finish the house to make it more comfortable for the children and for my family.  So that was on the 12th.  So I made contact with those who were going to finish the construction work on the house and also to acquire the necessary building materials.

	On the 13th we started the work on the house, and it's at that time that I learnt that the looting of stores in Kigali had begun and that the first targeted shops were those selling clothing and beer.  So I understood that if I had -- if I didn't do anything, they would loot my own shop because I used to sell Carlsberg and Tuborg.  And the main stock of my imported products was in Amgar.  And I, therefore, felt that they were going to vandalise or loot that stock in Amgar.  

	That is why I decided to go back on the 14th, to try and look at ways and means of evacuating my products or -- or merchandise.  At the same time my mother and sister were said to have disappeared, and I needed to -- to locate them.  I also had to go to Kicukiro to recover some of my personal effects which I didn't take along with me on the first occasion.  And that is how I got to return to Kigali on the 14th. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, perhaps we could pick up that topic tomorrow morning then. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will take the adjournment now. 

Mr. Witness, as I'm sure you know, during this or any adjournment, you should not discuss the case with anybody, or your testimony. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President -- I am sorry, Mr. President.  I would like to provide some information to the Trial Chamber and make a request at the same time.  

Mr. Édouard Karemera has told me that for family reasons he will be absent from court tomorrow afternoon, on Wednesday and on Thursday.  He has given me authority to represent him under those circumstances, and I would like to ask if the Court has any difficulty with that request.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Sow, we have been informed by the -- by CMS of the background, and we grant our permission. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will take the adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1530H)
