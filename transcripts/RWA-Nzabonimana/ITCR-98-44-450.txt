P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, 11th of May 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

The appearances are the same. 

Now, Mr. Nimy, yesterday you gave us to understand that your -- you had two witnesses in the aircraft, as you spoke yesterday, and that you'd be ready -- ready to proceed this morning.  What's your position?  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Indeed, as I told you yesterday, there were two witnesses who were boarding the plane.  One of them has arrived.  He (sic) arrived very late at night at about 10 p.m., 11 p.m.  And another one will be arriving this afternoon.  

The first witness who arrived -- and this can be confirmed by WVSS -- that witness arrived under deplorable conditions.  He (sic) arrived at the airport.  All his luggage was seized.  He has been asked to pay considerable sums of money.  The witness has practically nothing on herself, just a few private personal effects, the kind of personal effects that a woman would have.  So this woman has absolutely nothing on her that can enable her to -- to appear clean before you in respect for your Court.  

This morning on the basis of a note that the registry forwarded -- forwarded to you, a note from the lead counsel -- we in that note are requesting you to allow the witness to testify under better psychological, personal conditions and, of course, after going through what is usually done here, namely, preparing the witness.  And that is what I am requesting of you this morning.  

It is up to you to make an assessment, not only from a technical, practical point of view but even from a human point of view.  Like for all witnesses who appeared here, the Prosecution witnesses, for example, they appeared here under normal conditions, under normal psychological conditions.  This is all I can tell you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, I can assure you that we made enquiries before we came into court.  And now I've heard your scandalous remarks concerning the WVSS assistance that they gave to you, I'm wondering if I should call WVSS to give evidence as to what really happened.  

When did you first see this witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
A long time ago, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  When have you seen this witness since the witness's arrival in Arusha?  
MR. NIMY: 
We have not yet seen her.  She arrived at 11 p.m. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Precisely.  Precisely.  And yet you choose to make these scandalous remarks without knowing what the truth is.  

WVSS approached us and told us that you had not yet seen the witness and had no opportunity to prep the witness, and they requested that we allow you until this afternoon to start communicating -- to --
to -- to -- to call this witness as -- in evidence.  And yet to hear this nonsense from you this morning in court. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I am sorry.  What I'm telling you is information I have from WVSS this morning.  WVSS came here this morning at the bench.  The representative of that unit came here and spoke for length -- spoke at length with my assistant, the assistant sitting to my right, and the assistant informed me of the content of their discussions.  And it is that -- is what they discussed that I am telling you about.  It is the same witness protection section that spoke to you and that this morning, before you came into the courtroom, gave me information. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, I won't go further and call WVSS to give testimony here this morning.  Be careful with what you are saying.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like to repeat what I said.  WVSS -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I advise you not to do that because now you will create a completely different issue than the one that we needed to address this morning.  So think carefully whether you want to raise another issue.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I have presented the situation of our witnesses since the arrival of our first witness.  And that is in answer to your question.  And what I'm telling you is based on the information we received.  I cannot tell you any more than that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let me tell you the information that we have.  WVSS informed us that one witness arrived last night late and that you have not seen that witness to prep the witness for appearance in court up to now, that another witness is due to arrive at 2 o'clock this afternoon, and a third witness is due to arrive at 
7 o'clock tonight.  Our trial coordinator informed us that he spoke with you and that you informed him that all three witnesses were short, that one could be heard this afternoon and two tomorrow morning.  

He also spoke with the Prosecutor, who told him that the cross-examination of all three witnesses were short and their testimony could be completed if he -- started sitting this afternoon and their testimony would be completed by midday tomorrow, which should allow Mr. Ngirumpatse to travel to Nairobi for medical attention, as has been arranged by the medical services of the Tribunal.  Now, that's what I expected to hear something from you about instead of this scandalmongering.  

Now, is it your application that you be permitted to call one witness this afternoon and two tomorrow morning?  And could you identify the witnesses for the record. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, allow me to tell you that the summary you have just given is exactly the subject of the motion or application where -- we were about to bring before you.  There is no difference.  In fact, it was since yesterday that we submitted these proposals to you.  

But I wanted to add just one more point, thinking that I have the duty to bring to your attention the general climate or atmosphere which accompanies the arrival of this witness.  That's all.  And it is at that point that you interrupted me and you thought that it was scandalous.  

I do not know whether it is the English translation, but in French the word "scandalous" has a certain, specific meaning.  Perhaps you did not say that in English.  

I simply wanted to tell you what -- in fact, what you have said is exactly the subject of our request we -- our application which we brought since yesterday.  The lead counsel sent the motion to you, and it reflects what I was going to tell you this morning.  We agree on the substance. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you. 
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have anything to say?  
MR. SENDZE:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, everybody.  We don't object to the arrangements -- or the application made by the Defence in respect of the witness to be called this afternoon and two to be called tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Nimy, could you identify the record -- the names of the -- the -- the witnesses who are to be called this afternoon.  If they are protected, then you use a pseudonym.  If not, you use their names. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, we have three witnesses.  We have Uwase, U-W-A-S-E.  We have Kalisa, Flora.  K-A-L-I-S-A, Flora.  We have Innocent Twagiramungu, T-W-A-G-I-R-A-M-U-N-G-U. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will resume at 2 o'clock, and we will hear the witness identified as Uwase.  

We take our adjournment. 
MR. NIMY: 
Uwase.
