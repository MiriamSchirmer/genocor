MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 23rd of February 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al., Case No. ICTR-00-98-44-T. 

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

The appearances are the same.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Good morning, Your Honours.
FRANÇOIS KARERA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. N'DOW: 
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Karera.  We'll continue from where we left yesterday.

Can we begin by agreeing on some issues, however short-lived this agreement may be, Mr. Witness.
Now, Mr. Karera, can we agree, can we not, that hundreds of Tutsi refugees who sought protection and refuge at Ntarama church and Ntarama school were on 14th, 15th, and 16th April attacked and massacred?  Can we agree on that? 
A.	I understood your question.  You're talking about Ntarama.  I don't know that place, and I've never been there.  Even prior to the events, I never had been to Ntarama.  I know that Ntarama is located in 
	Kanazi sous-préfecture, and I got that piece of information from the Tribunal here, and I saw the name Ntarama in documents.  That's all I know about Ntarama. 
Q.	What I'm asking is, Witness, are you not aware of the massacres of hundreds of Tutsis who sought refuge and protection at the Ntarama church on or about the 15th of April 1994?  Are you aware of this?  That's my question.
A.	I cannot testify with respect to those events.  When you testify, you talk about events we had witnessed.  I got this information in the same manner as you did, and you have just said it to me again.  And you added something to the piece of information that I have.  But I need to specify and insist on the fact that I was not an eyewitness of those events. 
Q.	But you knew about those events, didn't you?  That's my question, Witness.
A.	Let's reach an understanding on what it means to know something.  We need to agree on the facts on which we are testifying.  If we are in agreement on that, it will be a good thing.  You, indeed, speak about Ntarama; yet you never have been there.  You talk about what happened in Ntarama; whereas, you were not a witness of the events.  

So you are not different from me as far as Ntarama is concerned.  You are talking about a piece of information which you received, but you were not an eyewitness of those events.  I wasn't an eyewitness either. 
Q.	What I'm asking you, Witness, is a simple question.  Do you know about the killing of Tutsis at Ntarama?  Yes or no?  And I will not move until you answer this question. 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecutor, I am a teacher.  When you say yes, it could mean no.  When you say, "yeah", it could mean no.  You have to qualify that "yeah".  I know the Ntarama events as well as you do.  You read what was found in the documents, and you can't testify with respect to those events because you were not an eyewitness.  So neither can I testify about those events because I was not an eyewitness.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...that you knew.  Now we move on to the next question.  Now, can we also agree that there were attacks on Tutsis in Kigali-ville and Kigali-rural préfectures as early as the 
	8th of April 1994?  Can we agree on that, Witness?
A.	We are before the Judges, and you are a legal expert.  You need to make a distinction.  I mean, what do you mean by "attack"?  "Attack" is made up of assailants who plan an attack.  Can you talk about an attack -- a given attack to me which was conducted at that location?  There wasn't any. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my role here is to ask you questions.  And you are here to answer questions.  Did these massacres take place as early as the 8th of April 1994?  That's my question.
A.	There were killings on both sides, but I do not agree with your qualifying it as "massacres".  Some people were killed; others defended themselves.  But you had killings, but I cannot talk about attacks.  
Q.	We can agree, Witness, can we not, that these attacks, these killings, were led, perpetrated, by civilian local authorities -- namely, bourgmestres, conseillers, military leaders, and soldiers under their command? Can we agree on that?  We have evidence of this in your trial.  Can we agree on that, Witness?  
A.	No.  I don't agree with what you say.  The soldiers were at the war front, and they were fighting because they had been attacked.  You have a soldier behind you, Mr. Nsanzimfura, who can explain that to you.  Secondly, some authorities had fled, and others wanted to set up government bodies which they could not attack.  
Q.	And, Witness --
A.	Those authorities got together to -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, would you kindly advise counsel to wait for the Kinyarwanda interpreter to complete the interpreting before putting another question to the witness.  
MR. N'DOW: 
I'm sorry about that.  I thought the witness had finished with the answer.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, you recall the testimonies -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the last question was not properly interpreted.  Maybe counsel wants to take up from there, from the last question that he put to the witness.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Maybe Your Honours can remind me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Move on.  Move on.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you recall the testimonies of Defence witnesses you called in your trial, Witnesses NKZ and Witness ZIH.  These were persons you called as witnesses in your trial, weren't they?
A.	I remember those witnesses.  They said nothing bad. 
Q.	What they did say, Witness, is that these attacks took place.  They were one of the attackers at the Ntarama church, at the Ntarama school, on the 14th, 15th, and 16th April.  And they were acting under the instructions of local authorities, conseillers, soldiers, military leaders, even the army commander of Ntarama.  What do you say to this?  Do you agree with their testimonies, or do you not? 
A.	They never said that.  Would you be so kind as to read the transcript to me.  Let us start with Ntarama.  There is no -- there are no military barracks in Ntarama.  There never was.  So a witness couldn't have stated that.  Secondly, they said the following:  They went to Ntarama, they heard that there had been an attack, and they found soldiers there who had come to rescue people who had been attacked, and those soldiers had come from Gako.  Those witnesses confirmed the fact that I wasn't present.  You need to accept what they said.  They said that I did not go to Ntarama. 
Q.	Witness, Witness, they agreed that you did not go to Ntarama.  That's what they testified.  But what they did say is that these attacks were led by soldiers, and I will bring that to you.
A.	May I have a copy, please.  You are -- you can read it, but do give me a copy, please.  
Q.	Witness, I'll get you the copy of what the witnesses say, but what I can tell you is that during your cross-examination prosecuting counsel, Mr. Charles Phillips, did ask you about what these witnesses have said.

And I can read -- I can read the transcripts, and this is on page 4 of the transcripts of Wednesday, the 23rd of August.  And this is Mr. Charles Phillips, prosecuting counsel, questioning you.  And it starts at page 4, line 30 of the transcripts.

It says, "Now, sir, ZIH also told us that we have it from at least two witnesses called in support of your case that a man called Thaddee Sebuhindo, who was conseiller in a secteur within 
Kanzenze commune, had been the one responsible for recruiting some of the attackers."

And you were asked whether you recalled Witness ZIH testifying to that effect.  And your response in line 32, was, "Yes, I do."

So here you are agreeing to having heard Defence Witness ZIH agreeing or testifying to the fact that the attacks that they launched were ordered by Mr. Thaddee Sebuhindo, the conseiller.  And what do you say to that, Witness?  You agreed, didn't you?
A.	That statement was made by that witness, but that Sebuhindo did not have a chance to contradict it.  You talked about Phillips.  Let's talk about the subsequent pleadings.  The Prosecutor stated that they had conducted a field trip.  And the question as to where the place of the attacks was he couldn't say.  He stated that the Prosecutor had visited the location alongside his colleagues on several occasions.  

He stated that what we said was true but that the witnesses had lied.  But ZIH stated that he was part of the attack.  He talked about that Sebuhindo, but that Sebuhindo was not given the chance to defend himself.  Yes.  I agree he said it.  He said that, but I have to insist on what I said before.  

I heard that those attacks took place in the same manner as you did.  But you can't prove that I was present.  But you can't claim that I am the person who conducted those attacks and that that Sebuhindo was not one -- Sebuhindo had not been ordered to carry on the attacks.  
Q.	No.  What I said, Witness, was that your witness testified that Conseiller Thaddee Sebuhindo and another conseiller, Kambali, all testified -- all actually were responsible for recruiting some of the attackers at the Ntarama church.  They said that.  

Do you agree with them that there were these two conseillers who actually led the attacks at Ntarama?  A simple yes or no.  Do you agree with what your witnesses said?
A.	What I am saying is that that witness had been imprisoned because of that, and he talked about his defence.  But the person who says that it is such a person who had ordered him to attack never talked about the witness in -- never called a witness in my testimony.  If I accuse you of having been in Rwanda whereas you were not there and you do not have a chance to defend yourself, that is a problem.

Those people who were accused of having attacked were in prison because of their crime.  But Sebuhindo, who is said to have ordered the attack, was never imprisoned because of that.  It is true that those witnesses said what they said in order to defend themselves.  But the important thing was that we knew who had attacked Ntarama, and those very assailants said that I was not there.

The important thing is not those who said it but those who came and stated that I was not there.  And that is why I had them appear as witnesses.  Now, if you accept that, then you also have to accept that I was not on the premises during the attack.  
Q.	Okay.  Now let's move on to page 5 of the said transcript.  
A.	That was the important thing in their statement. 
Q.	Now let's look at line 3, Mr. Phillips again asking you, "Do you recall Witness IH telling us in cross-examination about how he had come across the bourgmestre of Kanzenze commune on the 7th April, the day after the president's death, and how following that encounter with the bourgmestre who was surrounded by gendarme attacks in the communes, in various parts of the communes thereafter?"  

So this actually you were asked, do you recall your witness, ZIH, talking to us about those things?  And your answer is yes.
A.	I don't remember that.  You said ZIH?  Let me ask you the following questions:  Am I concerned by what he said?  Is that of any relevance?  Is his testimony of any relevance to me?  Is it of any concern to me?  I believe that his testimony is of interest only to the person who made it.  I remember that he said it, but how does that concern me?  That only is binding -- only is binding on the witness who made that testimony. 
Q.	And he said that soldiers, gendarmes, were involved in those attacks, didn't he? 
A.	What I will tell you is he lied. 
Q.	Your own witness lied? 
A.	I told you what the soldiers were doing at that time. 
Q.	Your witness --
A.	No.  I didn't say that they lied.  I called them so that they'll be - they'll be -- to be asked whether I was present during the attack.  Was I there?  No.  That is the reason why I had them appear, because I knew that they had participated in the attack, and that is the question.  The question is not what they did at those premises. 
Q.	So what they said about being led by local authorities and assisted by gendarmes -- is that true or false? 
A.	I have already told you that I was not at that location, and this business is only of concern to the witness.  Those witnesses -- they said those things in their defence, namely, that they had been ordered by others to attack.  However, the main purpose of their testimony was to assert before the Court that Mr. Karera, yours truly, was not present at the location.  So please don't ask me any questions about what they did at that location. 
Q.	And you were asked at line 13 -- at line 9 of the cross-examination, beginning with, "Sir, in your capacity as the sous-préfet, technical-social, did you receive any reports between the 8th of April and the end of that month concerning the attacks on Tutsi civilians in the Kanzenze area or anywhere else?" 

You said, "I did not receive any report."  You were asked, Witness, during the course of this cross-examination -- and if you want, I can point that to you -- you were asked whether any of your 
	co- or fellow sous-préfets received any security reports.  And you said yes, they did.  Am I right?
A.	What you say is correct.  I was in charge of technical and social affairs, but I could not receive security reports, and that is in line with what I said previously.  Secondly, you mentioned sous-préfets.  Do you think that they received any reports, any such reports?  It was only the sous-préfet of Kanzenze who was entitled to receive such a report, and it is possible that he may have received that report.  But the sous-préfet of Kigali in charge of administrative and legal affairs could also have received a 
	security report.  And those are the persons who could confirm whether they did or did not receive the said reports.

The sub-prefect for social and economic affairs was not one who was likely to receive such a report, and that is the case. 
Q.	And, Witness, did you not say that one of those sous-préfets did tell you that he received a report? 
A.	No.  I never said that.  I have never asserted that I met a sous-préfet.  I did not meet any sous-préfet on the 8th.  The only sous-préfet I met is the sous-préfet of Rushashi where my office was set up when I was appointed préfet.  You need to read your documents carefully. 
Q.	And, Witness, he told you that he received a report, didn't he?
A.	Yes.  The sous-préfet of Rushashi talked to me about it after I was appointed sous-préfet in the same area.  The name of that sous-préfet is Juvénal Sezikeye. 
Q.	So it was known that Tutsis who sought refuge at the Ntarama church, Ntarama school, were attacked and massacred.  And that was what that report said, isn't it?
A.	Let me tell you that you are woefully mistaken.  Ntarama is in Kanazi sous-préfet -- sous-préfecture rather.  And many people are mistaken about this.  Rushashi is in the north of Kigali, and the two officials whom you referred to never met.  

Rushashi sous-préfecture is made up of three communes -- Musasa, Mutare, and Rushashi.  Now, the sous-préfet only received a report on those three communes.  He could not have received a report concerning another sous-préfecture because Ntarama is located in a sous-préfecture other than Rushashi sous-préfecture.  So I would like to refer you to the map of Kigali as need be so that you -- well, I will not stop.  Please, don't let people believe that these two locations are close to one another.

Well, let me proceed.  I can even provide a map for the Court so that we can all see where Rushashi sous-préfecture is located and where Ntarama is located.  If the Judges were to allow, I would be able to find such a map and make it available to the Court. 
Q.	Witness, you don't need to do that.  Can we move on to something else.
A.	Are you, therefore, saying that you agree with my testimony, namely, that Rushashi sous-préfecture is different from Ntarama?  Well, we have Rushashi, we have Shyorongi, and then we have PVK and then Kanombe.  And further on you have the Kanazi sous-préfecture.  And so those sous-préfectures -- the two sous-préfectures are so far away from each other.  
Q.	Witness, you've answered my question.  And just to summarise, you agree that you received reports of Tutsis being killed or you knew about reports.  Yes or no?  Don't go in circles, please.  
A.	I saw a report that was submitted to the sub-préfet of Rushashi sub-préfecture.  I did not read or see -- I did not see the report on the entire Kigali préfecture.   Furthermore, no Tutsi was killed in Rushashi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We move on to something else.

Mr. Witness, do you remember an interview you had with the New York Times correspondent 
Jane Perlez while you were a refugee in the DRC?  This interview took place on the 15th of August 1994.  Do you recall the interview? 
A.	The interview is in evidence before this Tribunal.  Witnesses who were journalists were supposed to appear to testify about that interview, but they never appeared.  Defence filed a motion for that press excerpt to be thrown out.  The Prosecutor replied, but the motion was dismissed.

During my defence, a question was raised as to whether it was possible to revisit that interview.  The Prosecutor wanted to find out whether such an interview had ever taken place, and my answer was that the newspaper was mistaken.  They saw me, of course.  But they -- Nyilimanzi and someone else who was working at the radio put questions to me.  But this press clipping, I must say, was not admitted as an exhibit.

It was subsequently decided that press or press clippings could not be tendered as exhibits.  We required that the soundbites be tendered in connection to that, and this never happened.  So you cannot refer to an exhibit which was dismissed by the Trial Chamber. 
Q.	But we can agree that this was admitted as an exhibit in your trial.  Can we agree on that?  It was P. 52.  
A.	Please read carefully, please.  It was noted that I had seen the interview, but I did not acknowledge it.  And reference is made to this point even in the judgement.  You see, all documents that are tendered are not admitted into evidence as exhibits. 
Q.	Issa will bring the document to you.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, this is on page 30 of my bundle.  It starts with page 29, 30 of my bundle of documents.  And it goes all the way to 32. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, looking at the second paragraph of that interview, did you not tell the journalist that 
	"Tutsis are originally bad."  "They are murderers.  The Tutsi have given the white people their daughters.  Physically they are weak.  Look at their arms and their legs.  No Tutsi can build.  They are too weak.  They just command.  The others work."

Did you not say that to the American journalist of the New York Times?  
A.	Please do not revisit this document because this document was not admitted by the Court.  When the journalist came to meet me, I was at Ndeze's house who is Tutsi.  You cannot make such a statement in a Tutsi's house.  You see, the content of these press clippings was discussed in court.  And I want you to note that this aspect was not taken into account in my judgement.  

Please let me give you a lead.  Look for Ndeze, and you would realise that he is Tutsi.  I was received in the king of Rutshuru's house, and I am a native of Nyabugogo, and he said that he knew my area and, therefore, agreed to host me.

So one cannot make such a statement in the house of a Tutsi while one is in the house of a Tutsi. 
Q.	But you agree that you were interviewed by the American journalist.  Do you agree to that?
A.	No.  I have never acknowledged that.  I have told you the person who was interviewed.  I -- my picture was simply taken because I was present at that place.  Now, if somebody comes here and makes photographs of people present and produces the same in the document, are we supposed to acknowledge that we were part of that exercise?  
Q.	So, Witness, it is your testimony that this interview did not take place.  Is that what you want Your Honours to believe? 
A.	This matter has been dealt with in another trial before this Tribunal, and the Trial Chamber did not grant any value to this matter.  Why do you want to revive this matter before another Trial Chamber which is involved in trying other accused persons?  All you have to do is to read my judgement, and you will find out that I was not convicted on that count or for those facts. 
Q.	So what I'm asking you you haven't answered, Witness.  Did this interview take place or did it not?
A.	I never granted such an interview.  The interview was granted by those who granted it, but I was present when the interview was conducted. 
Q.	So the interview did take place, and it was tape recorded.
A.	Can you please produce that recording. 
Q.	You agreed to that at your trial, that it was tape recorded.
A.	No, not at all.  Please produce that recording.  That has always been my position.  Produce the recording. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, at the same interview, you went on to say that Tutsis deserve to die.  And I ask you this question, Witness:  Did Tutsis who were massacred in 1994 deserve to die? 
A.	Did I say that?  Do you know that when I was fleeing into exile I had a Tutsi child with me?  Do you know that I was hosted by Tutsis?  Another question for you, maybe a little long, but you don't know me.  I said at the beginning of my testimony that I had lived with Tutsis; that we got married to 
	Tutsi women and they married Hutu wives as well.  And I testified that I had Tutsi nephews who should not have been killed.  There are people here who know me very well.  My relatives were killed.  What do you want me to tell you?

You see, according to you, I really stood up in front of Tutsis and asserted that Tutsis had to be killed?  Not a single Tutsi has testified on such a fact except for this journalist who has fabricated this information.  In Rwanda you may want to know that some journalists were bought or were given money to carry out RPF propaganda.  I am not sure that they can be -- they can do that today. 
Q.	Witness, my question was calling for a yes or no.  Now let's go on and hear what this journalist reported in the New York Times.  
MR. N'DOW: 
We go to page 31, Your Honours.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	And I read what the journalist reported:  "If the reasons are just, the massacres are justified."  You said that  emphatically, pushing your arm in the air to make the point as you have been doing while giving testimony here.

"In war," it goes on, "you don't consider the consequences.  You consider the causes."  For this reason you were not worried that the United Nations were setting up a tribunal.  Those are your remarks, that "If the reasons were just, the massacres were justified."  So you are justifying the massacres of Tutsis for this American journalist.  Yes or no?
A.	I want, first of all, to thank you.  I thank you for the first sentence you read out.  You said that you were going to read out what the journalists had written.  This was not written by Karera.  It was written by the journalists, and I thank you immensely for reading out to me what the journalists had written.  I am not the author of that document. 
Q.	Why would the journalists lie for you?
A.	Well, well, well, where did those attacks come from at the beginning of the war?  The attackers were supported by some countries.  They wanted to tarnish the image of the authorities in power in Rwanda.  Now I have a question for you.  Where did the RPF get its weapons from?  Who carried out 
	RPF propaganda?  It was journalists, the same journalists. 
Q.	And, Mr. Karera, the same interview was actually reproduced by the Guardian newspaper in an article on the 24th of October.  And the Guardian quoted a description of you by the African Rights as 
	"a person who never hid his commitment to the extremist political agenda, now his support for Interahamwe."  These were what were in the Guardian newspaper article.  Do you agree to that?
A.	Have you read in any newspaper that I met the journalist of the Guardian?   Did those journalists not simply regurgitate what they heard elsewhere?  Well, that is your evidence, that there are journalists who were trying to do some propaganda by reporting on events they had not witnessed. 
Q.	Let's look at the Radio Rwanda transcript we discussed yesterday.  You were saying that these were the journalist's words, but in this Radio Rwanda transcript we have your words.  And let's look at it.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, this is at page 38 of the Kinyarwanda version of the transcripts which I showed to the witness yesterday.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	And if you look, Witness -- 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, this is on page 38 of the English version of my transcripts of my bundle, my bundle of documents.  And for the benefit of French speakers, the French version is on page 61.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you can see page 38, which is the Kinyarwanda version.  Can you see that of the interview you had with Jean-Marie Vianney Kabengera.  Can you see that?  Under the subheading -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- in small numbers 15.1.

Now, let's look at what you said.  "Some of the listeners are young and have never had to bear the spitefulness of the Inyenzi.  Those who went to school have heard about it in their history classes but have not experienced it."   

You went on to the next page under the subheading 16.8 -- can you go to 16.8, subheading 16.8, the third sentence of the second paragraph.  You're still talking about the Inyenzis, and you said you know their tricks, how they would gain the friendship of any intellectual who might have a happy future and give them their daughter in marriage so she could eliminate her in-laws.

Witness, it is obvious that these remarks you were making -- you were making them against Tutsis, weren't you?   
A.	The words that I used are accurate.  You have read only a small sentence here and there.  Please read all the sentences.  Rather than consider the entire idea, you are reading only small excerpts.  But if you were to look at 15.1, Karera was talking about the history of Rwanda, a history which can be cross-checked, a history which is properly recorded.  

And I am lucky because you know "Inyenzi" does not mean Tutsi, and that is written in this document.  The Inyenzi were an army.  Attacks took place in Rucuncu.  That is correct.  Mbonyunutwa was defeated.  That is correct.  But you didn't mention that to the Judges.

Now, if you were to investigate further, you would find out that these assertions are correct.  Secondly, when you talk about manoeuvres or manipulations by the Tutsis, yes, there were infiltrations.  Infiltrators came into the city.  They came into the ministries and into other areas, and there is evidence of that.  That again is the truth.

Now, Mr. Prosecutor, do you not acknowledge that Kigali was infiltrated by infiltrators?  
Q.	You said you meant that the Inyenzis were the soldiers.  But it is obvious from this that you were talking about civilians.  You weren't talking about soldiers marrying Hutu intellectuals.  You were talking about soldiers, were you, and giving them children?  You're talking about Tutsi women.  You were talking about Tutsi women, not soldiers.
A.	Do you believe that the Inyenzis did not include Tutsi women?  There were also women in the Rwandan army, even here in Tanzania.  What about your country?  Are there no women in the army?  In our country all genders have access to the army. 
Q.	And those marrying Hutus?
A.	Soldiers get married, don't they?  
Q.	Let's move on.  Then you went on to say, Witness, in your usual style, "They have a honey tongue.  They pretend to be smartest, but all of us who have studied will know that they weren't at the head of the class."  Then you went on.  

And the next thing is you said they behaved gently like lambs while they were actually wolves.  You were echoing the same things you said to the American journalist, or the same things were echoed to the American journalist describing the Tutsis as weak.  And here you are doing the same thing,
"They behaved gently like lambs when they were actually wolves."  You were not referring to soldiers, were you?  It's obvious you were referring to civilians.  What do you say to that, Witness?
A.	My answer is as follows:  Read the next paragraph.  Do you mean that Tutsis don't lie?  You disagree with me that they lie?  Tell me if you disagree.  I'll give you examples, several examples.  If you tell me that you do not agree that Tutsis are liars, then I will give you many examples to prove the point. 
Q.	So that shows your view on the Tutsis.  They are liars.  And they, therefore, deserve to die.  They are traitors, and, therefore, they deserve to die.  That's your view of the Tutsis, isn't it?
A.	Now, I believe you want us to go back to the history of Rwanda.  Give us the time, and then we are going to talk about the history of Rwanda, and I know it.  I was part of the history of Rwanda, and I have lectured history.  Let us begin with the Rucuncu events.  What happened?  What happened in Rucuncu?  Could you tell -- give me an answer?  If you know what happened in Rucuncu, tell me the answer.  If the Judges so allow, we are going to talk about it in depth.  Give me that chance.  Otherwise, accept what I have told you.  
Q.	That they are liars, isn't it, Witness?  Witness, we move on.
A.	Yes.  They are liars.  Yes.  That is true.  At the time when I started my testimony, I told you that I was a native of Nyabugogo.  I am a Nyabugogo native.  And I believe that what that means was explained.  I also explained the Imitsindo.  At the royal court everything that was done was to lie.  Life at the court was based on lies telling. 
Q.	So, Witness, it is then reasonable to believe that you would have been part of any conspiracy, any criminal enterprise, to eliminate the Tutsis, isn't it? 
A.	No.  Do you mind if I tell you the names of my nephews who are in Kigali so that you can call them?  I can give you an example.  Call, for example, the minister -- the current minister of foreign affairs, the sister of Lando, and ask her if she knows Karera.  I'll just give you her name.  You can check.  Ask him this simple question.  
Q.	So you mean the Tutsis here -- you calling them liars, they'll be happy? 
A.	Oh, come on.  We have talked about it.  We've discussed it.  I lived with Tutsis.  Even if you were to bring them here, we are going to discuss.  We are going to talk about it.  You even have poetry stating that they are liars, and those poems are taught in schools.  

When people talk about les Tutsi during the war, they said, "I killed this man" -- "this one, and I killed that one."  And they say so by lying.  But those Tutsis believe that if they lie, then they are going to be more honoured.  They lie in public. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And, Witness, as a public figure, a public authority, you participated, encouraged, and did nothing, therefore, to punish the massacres of Tutsi civilians in your préfecture.  Is that correct then? 
A.	That is not true.  You gave me this document, and I am lucky to have it.  As a matter of fact, it is a miracle to be able to look at this document -- I mean, rather, refer to this document where there is a list of people whom the Inkotanyi had given.  It's a document by Mazimpaka.  My name had been mentioned because they wanted me to be a member of the PL party, their party.  And I turned down the offer.  And so they put me on the list, and that is why I fled.

Come on.  You are getting yourself worked up for nothing.  I told you that there is somebody behind you.  Ask him questions.  He's from the Prosecution office.  He's on your side.  Ask himself if I am Nyabugogo, one.  Did Karera live with the Tutsis, two.  And thirdly, did he have Tutsi friends with whom he shared drinks.  Who were his friends?  Ask Nsanzimfura.  He'll tell you.  Come on.  Don't work yourself up.

I am not talking about the accused.  Maybe you think that they are on my side.  I talked to you about the example of somebody who's in the Prosecution office.  Ask him questions about me.  He's going to answer you, and I am not going to bring you more witnesses.  Give him the freedom of telling him whatever he wants to say.

Mr. Nsanzimfura, I give you the chance to talk about me.  Say it freely.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, that's fine.

Mr. Witness, you testified in this trial that the MRND was the party of peace and unity.
A.	I insist.  It is the only party which was -- which was accepted.  I gave you the names of 
	well-known Tutsis who were members of the MRND party.  I knew the Kigali city very well.  
	As a matter of fact, I can talk to you about people who are in Kigali as we speak.  Give me an example of another party that did the sort of work that the MRND did.  
Q.	Witness, would it surprise you to know that in this trial we have a document signed by the 
	president of the MRND in which he's expressing his disquiet at the recruitment of Tutsis in the 
	Rwandan armed forces and the need to arm civilians and secretly train civilian youths?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I'm referring to Exhibit P. 27.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Would a party representing peace and unity and calling for the military -- the civilians to be armed and trained be called a party representing peace and unity?
A.	Could you give me the name of the MRND president you're talking about.  Then I will answer you.  Is it the prefect at préfectoral, communal, or national level?  Mr. Prosecutor, could you be more specific. 
Q.	This was the national president of the MRND who is no other than Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  We have a document here which he has signed calling for the army of civilians and them being secretly trained.  We have that.  Do you dispute that? 
A.	I told you from the onset of my testimony that I know Mathieu Ngirumpatse very well.  And I also said that he was a poet.  Give me that document.  And if he stated that, ask me questions.  I, who knows him, would explain to the Chamber what he meant because I know him very well.  Show me the document, let me read it, and I will explain to the Chamber what he meant.  
Q.	P. 27.
A.	Let me add that he is here.  He is present, and I cannot replace him.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Mr. Issa, I did give you all these documents when I started my cross.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	This is Exhibit P. 27.  He signed it, and it's in French.  The original is in French.  And if I could read for you, Witness, the first page beginning with "The idea of a nation no longer exists."  
A.	No.  I don't agree.  I've seen that part.  Don't let me read part of the document.  Read from the beginning.  Read from the first paragraph which is very well written.  Read the entire letter, Mr. Prosecutor.  Don't choose only one word.  
Q.	I'll move on.  And in the next page, Witness, he said, "In my opinion, the young must be trained urgently, secretly of course."  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President -- 
MR. N'DOW: 
I knew this was coming.  Your Honours, this is the last line of my questions.  Mr. Weyl is on his feet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to note that we are one hour fifteen minutes after the redirect contrary to what was said yesterday.  And I don't understand why when Mr. N'dow, upon receiving an answer from a witness, does not listen to him.  The witness asked if they could start by the introduction to the letter.  Is that a problem with Mr. N'dow?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I think the witness has answered my question.  I am satisfied with his answer.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, you said that that is calling for civilians to be secretly trained.  Is that calling for unity?  Is that for calling peace?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, my aim is not to disrupt the exchanges.  I believe my counterpart, Counsel Weyl, was very instrumental.  The Prosecution cannot continue to ask questions to the witness on fragments of phrases in this letter.  

I believe that, as far as I'm concerned, the Prosecution has nothing to lose in reading the entire letter and then, based on the entirety of the letter, questions can be put regarding specific paragraphs.  I believe that this is fair.  He can't carry on interviewing -- questioning the witnesses on snippets.  We would just be going around in circles. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Mr. President, in response to Mr. Nimy, Your Honours, the beauty of the system is that we have provisions for examination.  If he wants to clarify these matters with the witness or ask him to read the whole document, he can.  But I was satisfied with the answer.  And secondly, Your Honour, this document is in evidence.  So the question should be answered.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Would calling for the army -- for the civilians to be secretly trained be calling for unity?  
(Pages 1 to 15 by Kelly Surina)





























1015H 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Witness, the -- the entire document is in evidence and we have access to it.  You -- you may be able to answer the witness's question -- I mean the question put to you.  And if you think that reference to another section of the letter would assist your answer, you are at liberty to do that. 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honours, I -- I just set eyes on this document.  Can I be given the time to read the entire document and then I would be in a position to answer the question in a satisfactory manner?  I don't know this document.  I don't know this letter.  I need time to read and understand it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you may do that. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I have a suggestion.  Perhaps maybe the witness can read this during the 
morning break and come up with my answer.  Because that would be the last -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy -- Mr. Nimy.
MR. N'DOW: 
I'm just trying to assist the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  It's not going to take you more than two minutes to read the document. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Thank you, Your Honours. 
THE WITNESS:
I am done with reading the letter.  Mr. Prosecutor, you can now ask me your question. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I repeat:  Would the president of a party representing peace and unity be calling for civilians to be trained secretly and armed?  That was my question.  
A.	I just read this letter and its contents refer to unity.  It talks of peace and the defence of Rwanda.  It also says that civilians have to be trained and that it has to be done in secret. 

Which army anywhere in the world -- he is talking about all countries, or in the -- or in 
the United States -- which country, which army in the world does not train its army in secret?  Tell me, call young people -- young -- young people and train them in secret.  And any army that is worthy of the name acts in that manner. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I think you have misrepresented what Mr. Ngirumpatse said.  He said civilians to be trained, not the army. 
A.	In my view, I believe it is very urgent to train youth, young people, secretly, of course.  Where is the word civilian?  Did you see the word civilian here?  They talk about young people. 

What we are talking about is to train young people into the army.  You cannot -- and -- and as soldiers, you train civilians.  Then they become soldiers.  Soldiers train civilians.  Then they become soldiers. 
Q.	Witness, in the last paragraph, the second sentence says, "The reasons advanced for not arming civilians are misleading and we are likely to pay dearly for such typical career-soldier attitude."  So he is calling for the arming of civilians.  And he continues that these civilian youths should be secretly trained.  Is he calling -- calling for the arming of soldiers here?  He is very clear here.  
A.	I didn't see that in this document.  Do you have a letter which is different from the -- mine, the one that was handed to me?  In any event, I can't see it in this document in French. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, it starts with the paragraph beginning with, "Le bureau politique."  That's the last paragraph.  Have you seen that?  Have you seen the second sentence -- or the third sentence beginning, "The reasons advanced for not calling civilians are misleading" -- "For not arming civilians are misleading and we are likely to pay very dearly for such a typical career-soldier attitude".  He is not calling for the arming of soldiers.  He is calling for the arming of civilians.  And that's why he continued to say that civilian youths should be train secretly.  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  But read further up.  "Also requested the constitution of civilian defence groups amongst internally displaced people."  Where did these displaced people come from?  Why are you not talking about these displaced people?  Who could have protected the displaced persons where they were?  Tell the Chamber.  Who could have protected them?  And what he is saying is true. 
MR. N'DOW:	
	Your Honours, that completes my cross-examination of this witness.  I have a few documents to tender into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's take the redirect first.  

Mr. Nimy, is there any redirect evidence -- examination of this witness? 
MR. NIMY: 
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. N'dow, what are the documents you wish to tender?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I believe that the Chamber will not be surprised -- will obviously not be surprised that I have redirect, considering the interest that Mr. N'dow showed with respect to the witness's explanations regarding Mr. Ngirumpatse's letter.  So I would like to be given a chance to conduct a redirect, especially with -- with respect to that letter. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, we agree that there have been issues affecting your client and we give you leave to conduct the re-examination you have applied for. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, considering the fact that it is 10:30, maybe we can take the morn -- mid-morning break and -- and then I will carry out my redirect immediately after the mid-morning break.  Otherwise, I believe that we are going to be caught short by time and that you'd have to interrupt me during 
	the redirect.  If you grant me leave, then maybe we can break for the mid -- take the mid-morning break and I would carry on with the redirect after the mid-morning break. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much time do you anticipate being? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Mr. N'dow chose a path in leading to -- to take Mr. Karera -- Karera to focus on a line.  It is a three-page letter which you have to discuss to do.  It is likely that I use between 20 minutes to 
	half an hour.  And the Chamber is fully aware that I have been always very judicious in my use of time.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Right, Mr. Weyl.  We have already granted leave and so we take the mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1100H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  You may continue. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  And I would forthwith state to the Chamber, in order to reassure it, since during the break I had time to think, I'm not going to spend much time on my cross-examination.  I would just ask a few questions to put things in perspective -- in perspective.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	The first thing I would like to say is that there was an erroneous statement by Mr. N'dow.  I would like to ask Mr. Witness to read the top, on top of the first page, the date at the top of the first page.  
A.	On the first page I can see that you can see the date of the 14th of February 1993. 
Q.	So as far as you are aware, and with reference to what Mr. N'dow said, was the 
	14th of February 1993 - was Mr. Ngirumpatse the president of the MRND on that date? 
A.	No.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- did you say 1993?  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not chairman of the MRND.  Rather, he was a chairman of the MRND at the level of Kigali-ville.  But he was not the MRND chairman at national level.  He only became chairman on the 5th of July 1993. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for having rectified that first incorrection.  

I would furthermore like you to tell the Chamber if you remember what happened on the 
8th of February 1993, that is, six days before that letter was written.  
A.	What date did you state, Counsel? 
Q.	The 8th of February 1993, a few days before this letter was drafted.  
A.	Many events happened, but I believe that the most salient event is that the RPF started hostilities again, and almost reached Kigali city.  That is the event that I remember.  But it is likely that many other events occurred.  But that is the most salient event, as far as I'm concerned. 
Q.	Witness, thank you.  

Would I be mistaken if I were to put it to you that that letter was, therefore, written in the specific context of the attack that the RPF was conducting on Rwanda? 
A.	I read the entire letter and I -- and I read it carefully.  I had requested the Prosecutor to read 
	the beginning of the letter.  The entire letter is dealing only about war, the entire letter.  I wonder if 
	the Prosecutor is going to be able to deal with it subsequently.  I am satisfied with this letter.  This is what an authority ought to have written during a war. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would also like to refer you to page number 2, paragraph 2.  You would read there confirmation -- the confirmation of what you just told the Chamber.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse is referring against whom the war is being fought.  Are we in agreement? 
A.	Yes, we are.  That's correct. 
Q.	Witness, thank you.  So there is no ambiguity in this letter with respect to the fact that 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse envisages a reaction against the war and against the RPF.  
A.	As a matter of fact, that is the reason why I stated that any patriotic authority during war can only write a letter in which what Mathieu wrote was found.  He even states the places where the RPF was found.  

As a matter of fact, I seize this opportunity to thank Mathieu Ngirumpatse because he spoke about the
Inyenzi issues, the Inyenzi infiltrations.  I would like to call upon the Prosecution to read these letters to understand what the goals of RPF were. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

At the bottom of that second page and at the top of the following page, isn't it true that 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse is talk -- is mentioning his concerns with regard to the fragilisation of the army and its inability to resist RPF incursions? 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I think I now have to object to these sort of questions.  Mr. Weyl is feeding the witness the answers.  I know he is cross-examining, but the way he is doing it is he is not giving the witness any opportunity but to respond in the way that he wants.  And I think that's not proper. 

MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, let me proceed in another manner.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	And when at the top of page 3, you read that in doing this in this manner he is working on behalf of the RPF.  He is working -- setting up an army against the attack.  This attack --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
I am sorry.  The interpreter was unable to follow counsel, who is making references in the 
French document.  I am unable to find the references in the English.
THE WITNESS:  
This part of the letter is very good because it talks about the truth. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, the interpreters were unable to follow what part of the letter you were referring to.  So could you put the question again, please. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So let me repeat:  Page 3, at the top of the page, "He knows that in so doing he is working in favour of the RPF setting up an -- an army that is concealed and which is not interested in the defence of the regions that were attacked".  

What is your analysis of these sentences, Witness? 
A.	To a person like me who knows the country and who knows where there were hostilities, I who know the people who support the RPF, these phrases are appropriate. 

The thing is you don't know the names of people.  The person who is mentioned here, Sabakunzi, who was Sabakunzi?  Was he not a soldier?  That is the reason why Mathieu was saying that.  

Sabakunzi is on the first page where the following is stated, that prior -- long before him, Sabakunzi had sent -
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness stopped.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Mr. President, we are almost done. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	In the middle of page 3, after the number of sentences where the Prosecution stopped, we can read -- we know that it is the initial plan to conquer Burundi.
A.	Sorry.
Q.	Maybe you could read where -- where -- as from, "We know it was the initial plan."  Let me read.  "We know that the initial plan is to conquer Rwanda, Burundi and eastern Zaire, which is under way."  In these sentences Mathieu Ngirumpatse continues to refer to the war situation against which Rwanda has to resist; is that -- isn't that correct?  
A.	That is correct.  Rather, I would say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is a prophet.  Now you can see what is happening presently in eastern Zaire.  You can see how the war got into Burundi.  Can the Prosecutor not agree that this is the truth?  
Q.	The sentence immediately after, could you kindly read it, please.  
A.	Only the participation of the entire population can lead to a solution.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When Mathieu Ngirumpatse writes that the entire population -- in your view, was he making a distinction within the Rwandan population or was he envisaging the need for the 
	Rwandan people in its entirety to stand up against the RPF? 
A.	For every patriot who loves the citizens of his country, that's the only thing that could have been said.  
Mathieu Ngirumpatse asked all Rwandans, Hutus, Tutsis and even, let's say, women.  So he was calling all these people to stand up to defend the country.  

You could not have made -- you might not have had to go to the war front but you would be an intelligence officer.  That is patriotism.  That is what can be considered as love on the Rwandan people in respect -- without discrimination. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I don't have any further questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 

Mr. Karera, this concludes your testimony.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work, and you are now excused. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to ask you to grant me leave to say something as a -- to express my gratitude, 
	Mr. President.  Simply little points.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  The registrar had indicated that you were going to make that request already.  You may proceed.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

The President of the ICTR and Presiding Judge of this Trial Chamber, I would like to thank the entire Bench.  You do so with intelligence and wisdom and a sense of calm.  I would like to thank you. 
Secondly, I, François Karera, am -- I know the city of Kigali and the préfecture of Kigali, as I'm a native of that region.  I have occupied various offices in Kigali.  I have been in positions of authority there, and I know all the segments of the population in that city, Hutus, Tutsis and foreigners.  I also know political parties which conducted their activities in Kigali.  No witness can dare to lie if I am there because that witness would review -- would have to review their lies.  

Thirdly, I would like to thank the Prosecutor for the various questions put to me to know my own truth. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you don't know me.  Everybody who knew me knows my truth.  Nsanzimfura, who assisted you, knows me.  I know that he works here in the Tribunal.  Otherwise, he would have been a Defence witness. 

The blood pact is forever.  You know it, Mr. Prosecutor.  You are asking me questions about people who have been accused of committing crimes in Kigali and around -- and in the city of Kigali as individuals and generally -- and in general.  I spoke the truth.  What has not been said here is not relevant.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

I thank people who listened to me, because I testified in public.  I would like to pray you, Mr. President, to grant me pray -- leave to say hello to the Accused.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The registrar will make the arrangements for your request to be granted.
(Witness excused) 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, as I indicated earlier, I would like to enter into evidence some -- some of the documents I used during my cross-examination of the witness. 

Your Honours, the one that I would like to seek admission is the letter dated the 24th of August.  It's on page 1.  It is dated the 24th of August 1993 and was a letter designating Mr. Karera as 
préfet ad interim. 

Then I would also like to seek the admission of the letter dated the 21st of October 1993: Invitation to Attend Security Council Meeting.  And then I would also like to seek admission of document number 2, which is:  Note à Son Excellence Monsieur le Président sur la visite en commune de Shyorongi. 

And then, Your Honours, I would like to seek the admission of document number 7, which are 
pages 29 to 32 of my bundle of documents. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Let's -- let's deal with the first two documents. 
MR. N'DOW:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And I assume there is no objection to those, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. N'DOW: 
I have consulted with Mr. Nimy and he has no objections to the -- to those ones that I have mentioned.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. N'DOW: 
His only objection is the one that I'm just talking about, which is the New York Times newspaper of the 15th of August 1993. 
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.  

I discussed with Counsel for the Prosecution with respect to those documents.  And I would like to draw the attention of the Chamber to the fact that the first document, the letter of the 24th of August 1993, which -- in which Karera is appointed as préfet, the witness did not acknowledge that document.  He did not acknowledge the relevance.  He actually contested it.  He challenged it, challenged the fact that that letter could have designated -- appointed -- appointed him as préfet and he did not acknowledge that letter. 

So I wonder what are the grounds for it to be tendered or admitted into evidence, as the witness did not acknowledge it. 

And if I am allowed to carry on with the next document which the Prosecutor has just referred to, it is indeed a review from the New York Times.  The New York Times is indeed -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't understand you, Mr. Nimy.  It was not accurate that you agreed that you had no objection to documents, the first two documents you mentioned. 
MR. NIMY: 
No.  No, it's not correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you object to both of them or only one?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, indeed, I am objecting that the letter of the 24th of August 1993 be admitted.  I'm also objecting that the -- the document of the New York Times, which the witness did not recognise -- acknowledge. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are not dealing with the New York Times yet.  You object to the admission of only one of them.  That's a letter of the 24th of August.  Do I understand you properly?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	And your ground is that the witness did not recognise the document. 
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.
          (Pages 16 to 24 by Mark Mac Artain)

























1130H
 MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. N'dow, the problem we are having is that the documents in your bundle -- we do not consider that the English translation of the document, document 1, accurately reflects what's in the original 
French document in 1A.  So if we are going to admit this document, it would have to be only 1A and not document 1.  

Mr. Nimy, are you with us on this issue?  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I see your point.  If you were to admit it, actually you would admit 1, document 1, which is in English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  What we are saying, that document 1 is not a proper translation of the French original, which is 1A.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I referred to document page 1 of my bundle when I cross-examined the witness, and that's the letter designating him as préfet ad interim.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What we are noticing, Mr. N'dow, that this one purports to be an English translation of the original document, which is 1A, which is in French.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I have just discovered that 1A is not the French translation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, which is the original. 
MR. N'DOW:
1A is not the original document, Your Honour.  I have the original, and I can bring it to court.  What we have is the English translation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The English translation of what?  
MR. N'DOW:
Of the original French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, where is that document, please?  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, it's not in my bundle.  Maybe it was the way that we compiled -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a document in your bundle --

MR. N'DOW:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- which is dated the 24th of August, has the same date, the same reference number, and much of the same information as the English translation --
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, Your Honour.  Actually --
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- signed by Côme Bizimungu, and it has the official seal. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I've just read it.  It's the same document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not properly translated.  
MR. N'DOW:
If Your Honours can assist me because, as far as I could see, it's the translation of the document because it's talking about the 24th.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Now, you now admit that the document in your bundle is the original of the English translation of this one.
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. N'dow, one obvious example -- there are a number of issues.  Look at the second paragraph, for example.  Look at the French version.  The time of the ceremony is stated in the French version.  Where is that in the English translation?  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, you are right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not a proper translation. 
MR. N'DOW:
It's not.  I agree.  So what I would seek to tender, Your Honours, is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And there are other inaccuracies as well. 
MR. N'DOW:
Admitted, Your Honour.  I'm not the one who did the translation.  This was done by the -- I think the translation department.  But I have to check.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you sure?
MR. N'DOW:
I have to check.  I have to confirm. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, why do you say it then, if you're not sure?  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, the lower left-hand corner of it says that.  It gives you the K number.  It's K036766.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. N'dow, we don't think the translation should be entered.  As we said earlier, it is obviously incorrect.  And there is a (inaudible) on the word ad interim which we consider the English translation does not correctly reflect what the French says.  
MR. N'DOW:
As Your Honours please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are suggesting that only the French original be admitted, and this was the issue which the witness addressed. 
MR. N'DOW:
This was the issue that the witness addressed, yes.  But you would admit the French original.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The French original document only.  
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

And, Your Honours -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We also admit the second letter that you requested.  
MR. N'DOW:
Which is the 21st of October.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. N'DOW:
And now the Radio Rwanda transcript, which I have used -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  Was the third document the Radio Rwanda transcript?  
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What page is that?  
MR. N'DOW:
The Kinyarwanda version starts from page 33, and it includes the English and the French, so all sorts of documents -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the document that you had referred to just a little while ago as your third document?  
MR. N'DOW:
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you're abandoning that one.
MR. N'DOW:
No, I'm moving on, because he's objecting to that one.  So I said I should just proceed, and if he has any objections to the remaining of the documents, then we can deal with it all at once.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm confused.  You are postponing your application with regard to the document?  
MR. N'DOW:
What I'm just doing, Your Honour, is to list the documents that I want to be admitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I thought we had just indicated that we will afford you to go through them one by one so we could admit them.  There seem to be some documents which are not controversial, and we think that there are one or two which might be controversial.  
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document number 3, which you referred to, we think is a document that is likely to be controversial.  
MR. N'DOW:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And so we just wanted to separate it from the documents which are not controversial.  
MR. N'DOW:
Yes.  That's why I'm moving on now to the next one, number 2, which Mr. Nimy has actually indicated to me that he has an objection to its admission.  So we just wanted to separate that, and then I will deal with the other documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're saying that the other documents are not controversial.  

MR. N'DOW:
I went to Mr. Nimy, to be honest, Your Honour, and I told him, "These are the documents that I wish to be tendered to be admitted."  And he said, "We have no objections, apart from the letter -- apart from the New York Times."  I have been there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  

Mr. Nimy, is that your position?  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, we can adopt a better methodology whereby each document is reviewed, and then I would state on each of the documents whether there is an objection or not, that is, the documents which are being tendered for admission.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, why waste time?  The majority of these documents are not controversial.  We understand that there is a point at issue with regard to the New York Times issue.  But what are the points with regard to the other documents?  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, you have raised an issue of time, and for that reason I withdraw my comment on the methodology, because it would, indeed, have a bearing on time.  I, therefore, would like to state to the Court that I am objecting only to the document dealing with the New York Times excerpt.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, without wanting to add to the concerns of methodology, I would like to say that there are three different teams present in the courtroom.  And when Mr. N'dow states that he has contacted only one of the three teams, I must state that it has often -- should I say too often been the case that the Prosecutor has sought only to contact one team and not the others.  

We are here in a joint trial, and I would like the record to show that we also object to the admission of the document that Mr. Nimy has just referred to.  And I would be silent on any comments that I may have made relating to previous documents which we think are -- would have needed some discussion prior to admission.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. N'dow, why do you submit the document should be admitted, the New York Times excerpt should be admitted?  
MR. N'DOW:
You mean the New York Times -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The New York Times, yeah.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't know how it came about, who wrote it or -- 
MR. N'DOW:
This document actually, Your Honours, was admitted in Mr. Karera's trial.  It was an exhibit, and it was P. 52.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that a sufficient reason for us admitting it?  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honour, we discussed -- I discussed with this witness, and I sought his comments about the document.  And his comments, Your Honours, make this document of relevance.  It's just a question of weight, Your Honour, and that is a matter that you will decide ultimately.  

Now the issue is about its admissibility.  It was put to Mr. Karera to solicit his comments, and he's commented on the document.  And now, Your Honours, the evidentiary standards have been met.  There is no question about its authenticity. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Then this document should be admitted for the truth of its contents?  
MR. N'DOW:
The document, Your Honours, should be admitted for the truth of its content, as well as to impeach Mr. Karera.  It is a matter of how much weight you will ultimately attach to the document.  But at this stage the indicia of admissibility have been established, Your Honour, and I think it should be admitted for that.  

I have sought Mr. Karera's comments, we discussed it extensively, and it is of relevance, and it is only a matter of weight, which you will ultimately decide.

Your Honours, those are my submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, this document under Rule 89(C) cannot be produced because the witness challenged the very root of the document.  He even said that it was fake and did not recognise the document.  The witness objected to the manipulation of the document, particularly in respect of the correlation of the photograph as well as the comments that were appended to the photograph.  The document, therefore, is no longer relevant.  And in terms of probative value, the witness's testimony clearly points to the fact that the document has no probative value under Rule 89.  For these reasons the document should simply be dismissed, Mr. President.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rule 89(C).  Correction from the interpreters.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, perhaps I can offer a few comments to clarify matters.  

The document was discussed in the judgement, the trial judgement of Karera, as the witness himself acknowledged.  And the discussion is at paragraphs 516 and 529.  And contrary to the witness's assertion, the document was, in fact, admitted in evidence and never withdrawn from evidence, and that is fully explained at paragraph 529.  

What appears to have happened is that initially the Prosecution sought to admit it under Rule 92 bis as a motion, as a written motion, and that was rejected.  But when Mr. Karera was cross-examined by the Prosecution, the article was again put to him and the Court admitted it at that stage.  

Now, there are other paragraphs in the Trial Chamber judgement where the Chamber does not give the article any weight, but that's the assessment of the Chamber that tried him in his own case.  Perhaps this Chamber can admit it and will give it more weight than it was given in his own judgement.  

But what I would offer to the Court is that the substance of the witness's responses, as it developed through the cross-examination, brings out some of the very issues that were raised in the article.  So maybe in that context the article may be more probative in this trial than it was in his original trial.  But on the issue of admissibility, I think we have crossed that threshold.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. N'dow, we think that we have already made a decision on a similar issue when GF was giving testimony and we denied the admission of interview.  

In this instance the witness has denied that he made the statements, and there is no evidence concerning how the interview was conducted.  There's nothing to contradict his testimony.  And we don't think that the publication is sufficiently reliable for us to accept it in evidence.  

Now, you can give it -- it can have an IP number.  I think that's the strongest that this article can be at this stage.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I am most obliged.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We admit all the other documents, and we ask the registrar just to indicate the exhibit numbers and 
IP numbers, please. 
MR. N'DOW:
The last one was the trial transcripts of the witness in his case.  I just want to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which ones?  
MR. N'DOW:
Of Mr. Karera's testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which transcripts are you referring to?  
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. Karera's testimony in his case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. N'dow, didn't you put specific portions of it to him?  
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, I did, Your Honour.  And I will refer you to pages 23 -- I will be referring to pages 4, 5, 6, 7, 
pages 33 to 44.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. MJUI:
Your Honours, the exhibit numbers will be provided maybe this afternoon after registry and the Prosecutor arranging their documents so that to avoid the confusion.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.   

Mr. Nimy, is your next witness available?  
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President.  That will be Witness W45.
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you testify, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the Prosecutor will now assist you to do that.  
MR. MJUI:
Sorry.  I'm not a prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, I apologise profusely.  I meant the registrar.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The profusely, we will take that personally.  
(Declaration made by Witness 45 in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy?  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to indicate that this is a protected witness.  We had sought protected measures for this witness.  And I would apply for a brief closed session during which the witness will explain to you why he is seeking protective measures.  The reasons he will put forth are likely to reveal his identity if we were to proceed in open session.  That is why I am applying for a closed session, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, when was notice about this application filed?  
MR. NIMY:
If I recall properly, it was the day before yesterday or maybe yesterday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a point, you see.  We have said repeatedly that the application for protective measures should be made in advance.  Particular philosophies of Defence counsel should not prevent the witnesses from applying for and getting the protection that they require at the earliest stage.  And it interferes with our process when we have to now deal with this in open court.  These are matters that should be dealt with before we come in to court.  

So I'd be grateful, if further witnesses require protection, that applications are presented in the proper time.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  We also have the same concerns, and we do take these points into consideration.  But you may want to understand that our contacts with our witnesses are not always very easy, and so it is when the witnesses arrive in Arusha that we find out what the real situation is, whether they would require protective measures or not.  So, Mr. President, we actually do agree with what you have said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because we also recall statements that have been made from that position by your lead counsel on his philosophy on witness protection, and that's why I made the remarks I made.  But if the witness requires protection, they ought to get it and the application should be made in a timely 
fashion.

Now, for the benefit of the public, this witness has an application to be made to the Court which needs to be done in private, and we are going into closed session for that purpose.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 35 to 38] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, we are now in open session.  I would like to remind you that during all the questions I'm going to ask you take care so that you do not provide in your answers information likely to reveal your identity.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, that's clear. 
Q.	Witness, where were you on the 6th of April 1994?
A.	On the 6th of April 1994 I was at *********************************.  
Q.	Where had you come from before getting to ***************************? 
A.	As I told the Chamber earlier, in April 1994 I was working for the **************.  And on the 
4th of April 1994 a worker in the bank of Kigali in Cyangugu invited the senior staff of the ********** factory to his wedding, which was to be organised in Kigali.  The Chinese, who were in charge of -- who were running the factory, gave us a van, and it had to -- which was to take us to Kigali.  

As I was a mere ********** and I did not have -- I was not granted permission, I applied for three days' leave, and I went there.  And I also wanted to meet my parents, and Cyangugu was far from my native area.  I had not been able to be granted leave to visit my family.  So I went to that wedding on the 4th, and even on the 4th I went to ********** residence in ************** while waiting to run the other errands I had already talked to you about the following day.  That is how I was found at ***************** on the 6th.  
Q.	Who else, apart from yourself, Witness, was in ******************** when you arrived there? 
A.	On the evening of the 4th at the time when I arrived, I -- at *************** he wasn't there.  I arrived around 4 p.m., and he only arrived home late in the night.  His spouse and his six children were there with orphans who lived in his home.  He also had domestic servants and his three bodyguards.  Those are the people I remember.  

However, this was the 4th already.  On the following day, on the 5th, I went and carried on with my business, and on the 6th the same people were still at ********************.  As it was a period of war, you didn't have many people who were moving about.  So I was at ***************** ********************* ****************************************************************************************************************  

I hope I answered your question.  
Q.	You did, perfectly so.  Thank you.  And then what did you do after you heard about the death of the -- of President Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994?
A.	We were sitting in the living room.  We heard the sound of gunfire -- rather, explosions.  And subsequently Nzirorera told us that the president had just been assassinated.  We were very scared because we were opposite a barrack, a military barracks, military barracks of the RPF. 
Q.	So what did you do? 
A.	As I was visiting that family, I did nothing special.  We were not able to get to bed.  ********** continued to talk on the phone with his friends and -- until daybreak when we noticed the arrival of an escort at 
6 a.m. in the morning to take us away from ******************.  It was around 6:30 a.m. that we left that ***********  The escort drove us to the city centre in Kiyovu to a soldier's home, a soldier known as ************
Q.	Witness, if I understand you, the escort arrived around 6 a.m. in the morning; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, that's what I just said.  The escort arrived at around 6 a.m. 
Q.	And so you left, as you stated, to the city centre in Kiyovu at the soldier's house, ******************.  Is that what I heard? 
A.	Yes, to *********************.  Actually I had forgotten his rank.  
Q.	Very well.  What time did you arrive his house? 
A.	Considering the fact that his residence was not too far from ***************************, it is true we had to go through a few roadblocks, and we arrived his house around 7 a.m. 
Q.	Very well.  And when you arrived ************************ residence, what happened? 
A.	After we arrived ******************** house, we were worn out.  I believe that I went to bed.  And a few moments later *************** came out.  I remained at *****************  We were given food to eat and something to drink.  I didn't do anything special.  After having eaten and had to drink, I went to bed. 
Q.	Witness, I'm trying to understand you very well.  So you arrived ****************** house.  You remained in ****************************, and *************** left.  Is that what I understood? 
A.	Yes.  He didn't stay at ***************** for long.  He left, and I can't tell you where he went to.  That's what I just said. 
Q.	Very well.  Yes, Witness.  But I just want to make sure.  And what time was that? 
A.	We arrived ******************* around 7 a.m., and ********** left a few minutes after.  I didn't have a watch to time him but -- before he left, but he didn't stay there for long. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  As far as you are aware, did Nzirorera have a house next to the 
German embassy? 
A.	I don't know that house as being one of the houses that belonged to Nzirorera. 
Q.	Very well.  And how long did you spend at ************************************? 
A.	My group and I stayed at Setako's house until the 12th of April 1994.  And since bombs continued to be fired, Nzirorera felt that we had to leave that location for a more secure place.  On the 12th we left the city of Kigali. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And apart from yourself, who else lived at **********************************? 
A.	Counsel, what time are you talking about?  Would you be so kind as to repeat that question again.  Do you want to know about the people who lived at ************************** on the 12th when we left his residence?  Or what time exactly are you referring to?  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  I will tell you specifically what time.  It is -- when you arrived at ******************** house on the 4th of April until the 12th, who was at ****************?  Who lived in *******************?  No, sorry.  When you arrived at ******************** on the 7th of April, from the 7th of April until the 
12th of April, who was living in ******************************  That is my question.
A.	Very well.  Now I follow.

We arrived at ******************* on the 7th of April 1994 in the morning.  And, as I stated before, there ****************************************************************************************** who were living in his home, you also had ******************.  There was another young man known as *************, who was ****************************. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, when you -- at the time when you left ****************************, who was with you to accompany you? 
A.	When we left ******************** on the 12th, we left with everyone who was leaving ***************** except for *********  But in our group -- but one ****************** joined us.  He was *********************.  We left *************************** in four vehicles. 
Q.	Witness, we are going to get there.  Let us go step by step.  We will get there.
A.	Now, to sum up, when we left ******************** on the 12th, I was the one -- you had ***********, his *************************************************************************************************************** ********************************************************************************************************* 
*****************************************************************************************************************.  
Q.	So, Witness, let me understand you.  I want to get you clearly.  When you leave Setako's house, you have four children of Nzirorera's who will not be with you in the convoy; is that it? 
A.	Yes.  Those children, the oldest of them -- you had his two children in addition to one of the orphans who lived in his house.  So we left with a group of young children which comprised four children.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NIMY:
Now I have my glasses, Mr. President.  I can clearly see it is 12:30.  Maybe it is time for the break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We agree.  We take our luncheon recess now.
(Court recessed at 1230H)
(Pages 39 to 41 by Claudette Ask)









(Court resumed at 1413H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Nimy, you can continue now. 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Yes.  Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we will carry on.  And may I remind you that when we parted company we were discussing the moment you were about to leave *********************  And among those who lived at that home, including yourself, those of you were part of the convoy -- there were three children of Nteziryayo (sic) who were not going to accompany you because they had left the day before; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I think that Nteziryayo -- I'm not sure. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I said "Nzirorera".  Nzirorera is three syllables.  Nteziryayo is four syllables. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  It was a mistake from the English booth. 
MR. NIMY: 
I meant "Nzirorera". 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Three children of Nzirorera were not part of your convoy because they had left the day before with somebody else, with another family; is that correct, Witness? 
A.	That's correct.  But we need to add that -- another child, another orphan, who lived there at Nzirorera, and so there were three kids of Nzirorera plus another child, a fourth, who was an orphan who lived there at Nzirorera's.  All four children had left the night before -- or the day before. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Now, let's get back to the convoy.  And how was your convoy?  Who made up your convoy? 
A.	When ***********************************, the convoy comprised four vehicles.  Leading the convoy was a military vehicle who was supposed to clear the way and facilitate crossing the roadblocks.  After that vehicle was a four-wheel Mercedes-Benz, which was driven by Nzirorera.  And with him in that vehicle, were his wife, the wife of Setako, and the children who had not left the day before, as well as the soldier who was his bodyguard.  

*************** the third vehicle, which was a *****************, and **************** ***************************  his wife, his children, and a daughter of Setako.  

As for the last vehicle that brought up the rear, it was driven by David Biramahire, the son of Nyirimanzi, and which was transporting some belongings of ********, as well as the other children of **********, and a soldier who was also part of Nzirorera's close protection team.  That was the team. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What was the capacity of the vehicles that you just mentioned, according to you? 
A.	Well, you can do the calculations.  I did not count the soldiers who were on board the -- the army vehicle, but there must have been around four of them.  As for the vehicle that Nzirorera was driving, the four-wheel drive, this was a vehicle that could take ten persons sitting.  

*************************************************************************************************************** **********************************  

And after the vehicle which I was con -- con -- was driving, there was a little Daihatsu truck.  And you had people in the back.  This vehicle was supposed -- should have been carrying about 20 people.  I cannot recall with accuracy all the number of persons who were found in these various vehicles.  And what I am telling you here is what I can still remember. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I would like you to tell the Trial Chamber, more particularly, who were you with in the vehicle? 
A.	Mr. President, concerning the vehicle which I was driving -- this was the ***********************, black in colour.  I was at the steering wheel, and by me was *****************.  In the back were the wife of ************** and the children.  I believe I have answered a question, Counsel. 
Q.	Yes.  But I would revisit that issue for a particular detail.  So when you were ****************************** *******, about what time was it? 
A.	I -- I'm not able to give you the exact moment at which we left ******************  You would understand that this took place a long time ago.  But it must have been between 12 noon and 1 p.m. 
Q.	Okay.  I will now come back to your vehicle.  Who was driving that vehicle?  It was yourself; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, I was driving. 
Q.	And the passenger who was -- the passengers who were with you, who did you say they were?  Can you remind me, please.  
A.	By my side was ******************************. 
Q.	Did you know him before you had to drive him in your vehicle on that day? 
A.	No.  We did not know ourselves before then.  But we chatted during the trip.  And we introduced ourselves one to the other.  Apart from that we did not know each other before the day on which we travelled together. 
Q.	Very good.  Mr. Witness, do you know Mr. David Hakizimana?
A.	Did you say David Hakizimana?  He is from where? 

You know, many Rwandans bear the same name.  If you give me further information, I may be able to answer.  Where does he hail from, Counsel?  
Q.	I don't know whether it's -- you're referring to a David whom I know but -- well, Mr. Witness, I will give you further information.  David Hakizimana was son of Batera.  
A.	Yes.  That ************.  We certainly were at the ******************.  And in -- as a matter of fact, when we were alluding to that David, we would really say, David, son of Batera******** him very well, and he *****************************************. 
Q.	You said you know him very well, you said.  
A.	Yes, I know him.  I even know ***********.  I even know the commercial centre where his -- his father ran his business. 
Q.	And was -- was he part of your convoy on that 12th of April? 
A.	When we were leaving, I did not see him.  I knew him well.  And had he been present, I certainly would have seen him.  But from the moment we left and until we got to Ruhengeri, I never saw him. 
Q.	Yes.  Mr. Witness, you just did well by sharing this information, because I was about to ask whether, as you left, you did not see him and whether during the trip -- somewhere along the trip, did he join you?  Did he get on board -- so at one point or other as you travelled?  
A.	I said that I knew him and that, had he been part of our convoy, I certainly would have noticed.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, when you were leaving and set out on the road, did -- did Nzirorera carry any equipment or apparatus for a -- for communication? 
A.	When we were leaving Gishushu, we took nothing.  And from our departure from **********************, I did not notice anything on Nzirorera, and, in all honesty, he had nothing when we left Setako's residence. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you notice roadblocks along your way? 
A.	Yes.  There were many roadblocks.  And at our departure from ******************, we ran into the first roadblock.  And they also were on the road going down towards Muhima.  I do not know very well the neighbourhoods of Kigali, but there were many, many roadblocks until Nyabarongo.  
Q.	And just how did you go past those roadblocks? 
A.	When I talked to you about the membership of our convoys, I talked to you about a military vehicle which was leading the convoy.  And it was the soldiers in this military truck who negotiated and ensured that we went through the roadblocks at each point. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I'm asking you to talk to me about a specific roadblock, a specific roadblock at Nyabugogo.  Did you go past that roadblock as well? 
A.	Yes.  We went past that roadblock because the road leading to Gitarama goes past Nyabugogo. 
Q.	And, once again, my question is:  How did you negotiate crossing either of these roadblocks each time? 
A.	We crossed this roadblock in the same manner as which we -- in which we crossed the other roadblocks.  And as a matter of fact, we were in a hurry.  There were shells falling all over, and we could not take the risk of wasting time at any point of the trip.  And so we went across each roadblock as soon as possible.  And there were many vehicles.  And, in addition, you had these shells that were being fired at us.  And it was as if we never really stopped at any of the roadblocks. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I take it that there were people at the Nyabugogo roadblock; is that correct? 
A.	All the roadblocks were manned by people.  The Nyabugogo roadblock, therefore, was obviously manned by people.  

I do recall that we went through that roadblock very quickly.  And I cannot offer you any details.  We went through it just like we had gone through the other roadblocks.  And I was in the middle of the convoy, which means that by the time we got there the roadblock was already opened.  And so I did not have time to observe or to see all that which could be found around the said roadblock. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, your vehicle was right behind Nzirorera's vehicle; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Did Nzirorera talk to or speak to the persons who were at the Nyabugogo roadblock? 
A.	Counsel, I told you that we did not stop.  With the shells dropping, no one would have taken the risk of stopping at the roadblock.  In fact, it would have amounted to suicide. 
Q.	Very well.  What about the military escort that was at the head of the convoy?  Did it continue with the convoy or with you right through to Ruhengeri? 
A.	We did not continue with the escort up to Ruhengeri.  They turned around at the Nyabarongo bridge and went back at the point where you leave Kigali préfecture to enter Gitarama préfecture at a point known as Ruyenzi. 
Q.	Did you encounter any other roadblocks from the -- Nyabarongo until you got to Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes.  There were a number of roadblocks.  But you know that we had soldiers with us, including Nzirorera's ordinary escort.  And they helped us to go through without any difficulty. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, Mr. Witness, would you please tell the Court, tell the Judges, how the rest of your journey up to Ruhengeri unfolded.  
A.	Mr. President, we travelled from the Nyabarongo bridge to Gitarama and looked for a place where we could have spent the night.  But we didn't find any because there were many people in the convoy, and Nzirorera decided that we should continue to Ruhengeri.  So we went from 
	Gitarama-Ngororero-Mukamira, which part of the road is tarred, but the traffic plying that segment was quite dense.  

Upon completion of the tarmac part of the road, the truck ran out of fuel.  And I continued with the passengers up till Kariya (sic), where I stopped to wait for the others.  Shortly after four, I saw the others arrive, and we continued our journey till Rwankeri in Mukingo commune.  It was night-time already, around 7 p.m., when we got to Rwankeri.  That is all I can remember, Counsel. 
Q.	When you got to Mukingo, where did you personally find accommodation? 
A.	When we got to ************************, I spent the night at ***********.  The next day in the morning, I went to visit ********* at their home, which was some ************* away, in fact, less than a *********** away from Nzirorera's house.  And that is where *********.  Then later on I visited Mr. Nzirorera's ******** from time to time. 
Q.	Did you stay in Mukingo at Nzirorera's?  No.  Not at Nzirorera's.  At -- the other place where you stayed, how long did you stay in that place?  Up until when?  
A.	We used to live at the border between *******************.  I did not have the resources to enable me to return to *************.  So I remained at that location until Nzirorera indicated that he was going to move to *********.  And he asked me to ************** him.  So in early May together we moved to *********  And it was around the 3rd that I was able to get transportation to go to *************** 
Q.	When did you finally leave Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda on the 13th of July 1994. 
Q.	Where did you go, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I have been in *********.  And from there we went on the ************* road to ***********while the others were in Goma.
Q.	Did you stay or remain in ***********? 
A.	No, I did not remain in *********.  I did not know anyone there.  So I went to ******* because it is in ******* that members of my family had sought refuge. 
Q.	After ******** did you not go somewhere else, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes.  Eventually, I left ******** and went to **************  But I had spent some time there. 
Q.	After spending the time, Mr. Witness, where did you go next? 
A.	Counsel, you asked me where I went and from which location.  My answer was that I left ****** and went to **************.  Are you asking me to tell you where I went to after I left ***************  
Q.	Yes.  That is my question.  That is exactly my question, Mr. Witness.  
A.	I left *************************.  And from *********** I went to ***********. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Witness, do you have a criminal record in Rwanda? 
A.	As far as I know, there is none.  
Q.	From the time you left Rwanda to this day, have you been informed of the possibility of any 
	criminal record against you pending in -- or pending against you? 
A.	As I have already mentioned, I have not been informed of anything along those lines.  If such had been the case, the said file would have been forwarded to the authorities of the country where I am now resident. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  Now, your country of residence, which I am not going to mention for reasons pertaining to your protection, do you have a criminal record in that country? 
A.	No.  In November I went to ask for my case file or my judicial record.  And there was no criminal record in it. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, that will be all by way of examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY: 
You're welcome, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do any of the other Defence teams wish to question this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
No, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
No.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, you are now going to have to respond to the Prosecutor, who will have an opportunity to examine you now.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
(Microphones overlapping)...one minute.  Thank you. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I am -- try -- I'm -- transmit the transcripts which I intend to use by email yesterday.

Sorry, Your Honours.  It was this morning at 7 a.m. or something like that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. N'dow.  You may -- you may proceed.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  Can you tell the Honourable Judges -- 
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.  Good afternoon. 
Q.	-- when was the last time you met the Defence team of Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Mr. President, I have forgotten the date.  I met Mr. Nimy last year, but I do not recall the exact month. 
Q.	You did not meet -- meet them this week?  Is that your evidence?  Why are you stammering, Witness?  You didn't meet them?  
A.	You are putting too many questions to me at the same time.  Well, why don't you give me a chance to answer the question?  And then I'll tell you why I'm hesitating.  You see, yes, we -- we met when I arrived in Arusha.  But when I was being prepared for this testimony, all that happened last year, and that is what I have already said, indicating also that I have forgotten the month in which we met.
(Pages 42 to 48 by Tanya West)

































1450H
BY MR. N'DOW: 
Q.	So you did meet with them this week; is that your testimony?   
A.	Yes.  When I arrived here in Arusha we met. 
Q.	And when was the last time you met them? 
A.	Yesterday. 
Q.	Why did it take you so long to give me this answer?  You met them yesterday.  
A.	When you talk about meeting the Defence team, you might meet them and simply say hello to each other, or you could meet them to talk about your testimonies.  I think you need to make that distinction and you need to be specific. 
Q.	Did you meet Mr. Nimy yesterday?  If I can be more specific.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And where did you meet him? 
A.	We met at the place where I am staying. 
Q.	And that would be a safe house, wouldn't it be?  
A.	I don't know whether the name of that place is safe house.  I don't know.  I was taken to a place, and that is where I live, and that is where I met him. 
Q.	And how long did your meeting last? 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I really do not know, but maybe it is the practice of this Court that these types of questions are authorised, but from my own legal background, and particularly in my task of procedure, I don't know whether the Prosecutor should proceed by inquisition as to the manner in which the witness has prepared for his testimony.  This is a very unwelcomed approach, and it amounts to intimidation.  He is trying to intimidate the witness upfront.  Maybe this is part of your tradition, Mr. President.  I do not know. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, you have been part of the trial for a long time.  This type of enquiry has been permitted, and even your lead counsel indulged in it quite extensively during the Prosecution case.  We don't see anything improper about these questions.  
MR. NIMY: 
Obliged, Mr. President.  The witness will calmly, very calmly, answer the question.  There is no problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, coming back to my question:  How long did your meeting with Mr. Nimy last? 
A.	I am a Defence witness.  Why are you asking this question of me?  Why do you want to know how much time I spent with Mr. Nimy?  I have answered you by putting this question to you.  Why do you want to know how much time I spent with him?  
Q.	Mr. Witness, my role here is to ask questions.  And your presence here, Witness, is to answer questions.  If we are both to ask questions, then there will be nobody to answer.  So answer my question, Witness.  How long did your meeting with Mr. Nimy last?  It's a simple question.  
A.	Well, I will answer your question.  And the answer can be a yes or no or it can be by way of the putting another question to you.  I did not time our meeting, and it did not last for more than an hour.  It lasted less than an hour, and the meeting took place in the evening. 
Q.	So would you say that this meeting was restricted only to the extent of pleasantries? 
A.	Do you want to know the content?  Do you want to know the content of our discussion, Mr. Prosecutor?  Do you want me to give you the content of our conversation, Mr. Prosecutor?  Well, that is only a matter for Mr. Nimy.  Now, if you had wanted to find out about the content, then you would have come to meet me with him.  He contacted me to appear as a Defence witness.  You have never asked me, maybe, to be your witness.  
Q.	Witness, you stayed with other witnesses at the safe house, that is, at the residence where you stayed.  You were there with other witnesses, weren't you? 
A.	I did not see any other witnesses there.  I was alone. 
Q.	And, Witness, if I suggest to you -- even though you are not answering my questions -- if I suggest to you that you did discuss your testimony here with Mr. Nimy when he went to meet you at the 
	safe house, at the residence where you stayed.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, when Mr. Nimy contacted me, it was so that I could come here and testify for the Defence.  Why do you think that he contacted me?  
Q.	Okay.  We'll move on, Witness.  Mr. Witness, you do not want the person you -- on whose behalf you are coming to testify to be incarcerated for life, would you?  
A.	I am not a judge in this case.  I have come here to tell the Judges the things that I am aware of and the things that I experienced.  The onus of judgement is not on me.  
Q.	But you are hoping by your testimony, Witness, that you could secure his release.  Am I wrong or right? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, please tell me -- you have heard what I have said -- does one come to testify in someone's defence so that the person should remain in jail?  It is for the person to be released. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And, Witness, this person on whose behalf you are testifying was your benefactor, wasn't he? 
A.	I did not come to testify in Nzirorera's defence because he was my ************  I would testify for anybody in relation to events that I experienced.  
Q.	But you could -- we can agree that he was your *****************  Can we agree on that? 
A.	In what way and how was he my ************?  Well, you're not answering (sic) me properly.  Let me take over what I said.  I came as a Defence witness for Nzirorera, as I would do for whosoever would ask me in any case where I knew the facts.  And I hope you got me -- you understood what I said. 
Q.	Witness, **********************************************? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you are an African.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover).  It was his duty -- it was not just some kind act of his.  It was his duty.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I think it could be -- there is some information which could reveal the 
	witness's identification. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That's what we were thinking.  We will redact and order that the information of the 
witness's relationship should be redacted and put under seal.  The witness is under protection, and his identity is not to be revealed.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	On the 6th of April, you were at your ********************* to spend your holidays, weren't you? 
A.	No.  I don't agree with you.  I did not tell you that I knew him as a simple benefactor.  If I was at his home, it was because he is (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover), and I did not go there on holidays.  I said we were invited to the marriage of an Adventist pastor which took place on the 4th of April 1994, and that was why we were in Kigali.  And since I was a ***********, I asked a leave of absence to visit my parents in ***********.  But also I wanted to buy a vehicle.  I hope you understood that.  And so I spent the night at ******************. 
Q.	So you heard of the president's death from **************; is that correct? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Mr. President -- Mr. President, it doesn't -- it looks like nobody is reacting, but for the witness's identity, it is further clarified that information has been revealed twice and nobody is reacting to that, please. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I must apologise.  It was a slip on my part, and if it could be redacted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I was about to address the witness to advise him that, when he's speaking, he must not speak about his personal relationships because that could be information which could reveal your identity.  And we have given you protection for the purpose of having your identity concealed.  So if any problem arises, you also have to be attentive, and we'll assist you to ensure that your identity is not revealed to the public.  
MR. N'DOW: 
So he was the one -- 
THE WITNESS:  
Thank you. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
I now make the order for redaction of the relationship to the witness.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Most obliged, Your Honour.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	So you heard news of the president's death from your ***********, didn't you? 
A.	What you are saying is correct, but, once again, let me say that this person is not my benefactor.  However, I agree with you that I got news of the death of the president from that ***************** 
Q.	And this was around 8:30 p.m. of the 6th of April, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes.  Towards 9 p.m.  Yes.  I would say around 9 p.m. 
Q.	Did he tell you how he got this information? 
A.	The situation prevalent at the time was such that everybody was frightened, and he did not explain to me how he got this information.  I was there with his wife and his children, and he did not need to explain to us the source of his information. 
Q.	Was he coming from somewhere, or did he just get the information whilst he was at the house? 
A.	I think I already told you that we were in the parlor:  Myself, his wife, his children, as well as the orphans who -- whom he kept at his home, as well as himself.  And we heard explosions, and after that, he just told us that he had heard by the telephone call that the president had been killed.  And so we got the news while we were all there in the living room. 
Q.	So he got a telephone call? 
A.	That is very likely because I don't know by what -- any other means by which he could have gotten that information. 
Q.	And according to you, he continued to talk on the phone?  Was that not your evidence? 
A.	No.  You asked me how I got news of the death of the president, and I explained to you the circumstances under which I got the news.  And may I repeat, it's the defendant who gave us this information.  He himself got the information by phone.  And thereafter, since we were all frightened, I did not see him continue talking on the phone.  Now, all this happened quite a long time ago, and I cannot recall all the petty details. 
Q.	And he left the house subsequently, did he? 
A.	I told you that we were all afraid, and since we lived before the compound in which you had Inkotanyi, we stayed indoors until a military escort came around 6 a.m. 
Q.	So ******************* did not leave the house; is that your testimony? 
A.	He did not leave the house.  I do not know whether anyone described to you where his house was found, because it was directly opposite the compound in which the Inkotanyi were found.  It was impossible for *********** to go out and, what was more, to do so in the night.  It was impossible for him to leave the house, and so he went nowhere until morning when the escort staff came around 6 a.m. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, can you tell us who this escort was? 
A.	It was a military jeep full of soldiers, four in number.  I did not know them.  And you, therefore, can understand that I cannot tell you any more, but these soldiers told us how we could leave that location.  And I, therefore, took a ********************* drive which I drove, followed by another vehicle, another Mercedes, which was driven by a soldier, and Nzirorera himself was in the four-wheel drive, and that is how we left that location to go to the city centre.  
Q.	So the car you drove, was it full? 
A.	Yes.  The jeep I was driving was full.  It had -- it's six children, other orphans, which made a total of 
	eight children, and I think the vehicle was full, but, again, this is a detail which is difficult to recall 15 years after.  I know that I drove the children, and I know that the vehicle transported the children, as well as Nzirorera.  And the jeep carried the soldiers.  
Q.	This was the Mercedes jeep, wasn't it? 
A.	As I said in answering the question from Learned Counsel Nimy, it was the same jeep that was part of the convoy that went to Ruhengeri.  But I also told you that when we were going to Ruhengeri I was no longer driving that four-wheel drive Mercedes.  I was driving another vehicle.  
Q.	And one of Mr. Nzirorera's other cars, the 350 Benz, did it go with you to ****************  
A.	I don't know this other vehicle.  He had a (inaudible) Mercedes-Benz.  He had another 
	four-wheel drive Mercedes-Benz, while his wife had a dual tec Hilux, which stayed at home.  But concerning this other Mercedes-Benz which was a 350 Mercedes-Benz, I do not know it.  
Q.	I am talking about the saloon, not the four-wheel, the saloon.  
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, I just described to you the vehicles that he had.  There was the Mercedes-Benz, the saloon make, and it was that vehicle which was driven by the soldier who had brought the 
	military vehicle in which the escort soldiers were found.  
Q.	So if I could just get your testimony, Witness, that car, the Mercedes-Benz, was also full, wasn't it? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I know that that vehicle transported the children.  Now, there were eight in number.  There were two soldiers.  There was the wife of Nzirorera.  And this vehicle was supposed to transport the vehicle as well as the young children.  Now, whether the vehicle was full or not, I do not know, and I already gave you the names of the persons -- or I described the persons who were there at the residence as well as the vehicles that left the residence.  You can draw your own conclusions from all this information. 
Q.	And there were also two housegirls in the vehicles, weren't there? 
A.	Two housegirls.  I do not recall that there were housegirls at that home.  I was a visitor there and did not know all the details, especially as it had been long since I visited that residence.  And so I can only talk to you about that which I saw during that period of time that I spent.  And so all I know is that there were two domestic staff who stayed there at the residence and who did not travel with us when we went out to go into the Kiyovu neighbourhood. 
Q.	And, Witness, if I put to you that is wrong -- because ******************, in a testimony she gave in this Tribunal, did say that you went with Nzirorera's house help, house servants.  So you are now engaged in this exercise of reducing the passengers as we go along.  Nzirorera's (sic) daughter, she did say in a testimony she gave in this Tribunal that you arrived at their residence with Nzirorera's house help.  What do you say to that?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I think there is a mix-up here.  The Prosecutor talks about Nzirorera's daughter who testified here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Only one person could speak at a time.  

Yes, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY: 
I was saying there must be some confusion here.  The Prosecutor just talked about 
	Nzirorera's daughter who testified.  In which Trial Chamber did she testify?  I can't understand that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I didn't talk about Nzirorera's daughter.  I talked about ********************, and this was her testimony in Military II. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  It must have been a slip of the tongue.  I'm sorry.  You're quite right.  Mr. Nimy.  Mr. Nimy, 
I think -- 
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you must have heard wrong.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I don't want us to speak all at the same time.  From the French I heard Nzirorera's daughter.  We could maybe cross-check the transcripts, but that is what I heard.  Maybe others also heard the same with me. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it looks like the CaseView heard that as well.  That is what transpires from the CaseView.  The CaseView heard that, Mr. President. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
And that -- even added that before this Tribunal, and that is before Your Honour, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Kam, you better settle it.  

JUDGE KAM:  
As a matter of fact, Mr. President, the transcripts on the CaseView mentioned the daughter of Nzirorera here testified right here before you.  That's what the CaseView says.  And this was at 3 - 3:21 p.m. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, you can see that even if I have problems with my glasses, I have problems with my eyes, thank God, at least my ears are still intact, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That has been judicially confirmed now.  Yes.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, the reference is on page 4 of Setako's daughter's testimony of the 18th of June 2009.  Well, this was in Setako, Your Honours, not Military II.  

Your Honours, if I could proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please do. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, what do you say to that?  Is she lying?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I would like you to repeat the statement made by *************************** and the circumstances under which she gave that testimony.  That morning we were there at the 
	defendant's home, and we travelled together on our way to Kiyovu, and so far we were leaving the defendant's home to go to ******************************, and that was the area covering your question.  And you're asking a question on another convoy and those who were part of our convoy; isn't it?  And where was Setako's daughter, since she was not with us when we left the residence of the Accused?  
Q.	What I mean, Witness, is when they went to greet you, they observed that you came with house help, two soldiers, eight children.  And you are now telling Your Honours that, as far as you know, Nzirorera did not have a house help.  So how do you reconcile that difference?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I am talking to you about that which I witnessed 15 years ago.  And the girl whose statements you are quoting, we'll leave it to the Judges to evaluate or to assess her statements and draw the ensuing conclusions. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, apart from David, did you meet anyone else at Setako's house when you arrived there on the morning of the 7th? 
A.	In the morning of the 7th, among the persons I saw at Setako's -- this was  David Biramahire, but later on ************, who was their neighbour, came over to bid us good morning there at *********************  Those were the only strangers that I saw there at ****************************. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I am telling you that which I saw.  I cannot talk about that which I did not see.  And with the fright that possessed us at the time, we could not notice every detail and notice everybody who was there at that location at that time. 
Q.	So you did not see the parties that David was with; is that your testimony? 
A.	His brother.  There also was his brother.  But since I did not know them before, I did not pay much attention to their presence.  You can only recognise people that you already know.  By chance, we met there at that location, and if we had not travelled together to Ruhengeri, I would not have noticed their presence.  But concerning the other persons, I noticed their presence because I knew them much before. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I'm looking at the clock.  It looks like it's 3:30.  I'm not sure whether this is a convenient time to take the recess. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We'll take our adjournment for the day now.  

Mr. Witness, I should advise you that during this or any adjournment while you are on the witness box, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. N'dow, I have to ask you a question.  How much longer do you anticipate being? 
MR. N'DOW: 
An hour, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hometowu, how much time does he have left? 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Forty-three minutes, Your Honours. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We'll take the adjournment now. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Thank you, Your Honours.
