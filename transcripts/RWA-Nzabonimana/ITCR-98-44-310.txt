FRANK CLAEYS,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, can we go, please, to page 4 of the bundle which ought still to be in front of you, or with the assistance of Mr. Vincent can be placed back in front of you?
MR. MORLEY:
The bundle of documents which the witness had yesterday.
MR. TISHEKWA:
It was taken back.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you have the bundle, which runs up to 40 pages, in front of you?  Thank you.
A.	Yes, I have it.
Q.	And we looked at page 4.  We were dealing with the famous fax of the 11th of January 1994.  We dealt with the capability of the Interahamwe, in paragraph 6, and the informant disagreeing with anti-Tutsi extermination, in paragraph 7, and how he believed the president did not have full control over his old party.

Turning to paragraph 8, it says there that "The informant is prepared to provide location of major weapons cache with at least 135 weapons.  He has already distributed 110 weapons, including 35 with ammunition, and can give us details of their location.  Type of weapons are G3 and AK-47, provided by the RGF."

Just pausing there: did he give you those details in the interview?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Were the figures 135 weapons, 35 with ammunition, reference to G3 and AK-47 noted?
A.	Yes, these figures were noted.
Q.	It goes on to say, "He was ready to go to the arms cache tonight if we gave him the following guarantee.  He requested that he and his family, his wife and four children, be placed under our protection."  Did he say that?
A.	Yes, indeed.
Q.	What was he looking for in terms of protection?
A.	He explained that as being a kind of safe haven within an embassy or outside the country by political asylum.
Q.	What was he worried might happen to him, his wife and his four children?
A.	Well, he was afraid for their lives, which was understandable.
Q.	Why was it understandable?
A.	As I said before, this information he was disclosing was quite shocking.
Q.	Were you able to offer protection there and then at the meeting in the evening of the 10th of January?
A.	No.  We were not able at that moment to give him any guarantee for his life or his family.
Q.	What would have to happen in order for the question of protection to be resolved?
A.	On one hand, we needed to have some more effective proof about his informations; on the other hand, it was not the four or five UNAMIR people around him that were in the position to provide him any protection.  It was depending on a higher decision.
Q.	Who would be required to be consulted on the question of protection?
A.	Well, the first one to be informed, and then eventually to find the solution, was the force commander, but also different countries should be approached to see if they were able or ready to provide any protection.
Q.	When you refer to the "force commander", is it right that that was General Dallaire?
A.	Yes, the force commander is the military chief of the mission, so it's General Dallaire.
Q.	Would United Nations headquarters need to be consulted?
A.	To my opinion, both of the military part of peacekeeping operations and the highest authorities of the UN, being the Secretary General.
Q.	Did Jean-Pierre Turatsinze show you any weapons that night, the 10th of January?
A.	No.
Q.	And why not?
A.	I recall that it was a decision of Colonel Marchal not to move to further steps at that point.  The information was already important enough to ask further instructions from higher authorities and authorisation.
Q.	If we look further at the facts, to paragraph 9, it reads: "It is our intention to take action within the next 36 hours with a possible H-hour of Wednesday at dawn."  What action was being prepared for dawn on Wednesday, which I think would have been the 12th of January?
A.	Well, the general intended to go and try to catch some weapons, once we had visited one of the possible places he would show us, but it was a personal comment of the general from this part on.
Q.	The next sentence in paragraph 9 states: "Informant states that hostilities may commence again if political deadlock ends.  Violence could take place the day of the ceremonies or the day after.  Therefore, Wednesday will give greatest chance of success and also be most timely to provide significant input to ongoing political negotiations."  Looking at those three sentences, what hostilities was Turatsinze saying may commence again?
A.	So, he was referring to the same kind of demonstration and the scenario he depicted that could be the issue of these demonstrations that took place on the 8th, and that these ones would take place again with the next try-out to install the broad-based transitional government.
Q.	From recollection, when was the next attempt scheduled to install the broad-based transitional government?
A.	I don't have any idea, but I know it was a daily process in trying to set up a new date, and as the last one on Saturday didn't succeed, the new week, starting on Monday, was already the first day to try to find a new date for installation of the government.
Q.	The fax continues at paragraph 10: "It is recommended the informant be granted protection and evacuated out of Rwanda.  This HQ does not have previous UN experience in such matters and urgently requests guidance.  No contact has, as yet, been made to any embassy, in order to inquire if they were prepared to protect him for a period of time by granting diplomatic immunity in their embassy in Kigali, before moving him and his family out of the country."  Whose recommendation was it that the informant be granted protection?
A.	This was the recommendation of General Dallaire.
Q.	What was the perception amongst you and your brother officers of the quality and reliability of the information you had received from Turatsinze?
A.	Although we were not able to verify any of these numbers at that moment, only the fact that somebody came with precise numbers and scenarios depicted, as he did, made it for us clear that if this would be confirmed, we need to do something to protect him.
Q.	Paragraph 11, it says: "Force commander will be meeting with the very, very important political person tomorrow morning in order to ensure that this individual is conscious of all parameters of his involvement."  Pause there: who is the very, very important political person referred to?
A.	At that moment, for me, it seemed to be the president of the republic.
Q.	And it goes on now to say the following: "Force commander does have certain reservations on the suddenness of the change of heart of the informant to come clean with this information.  Recce" -- a military term, I think, for reconnaissance -- "of armed cache and detailed planning of raid to go on late tomorrow.  Possibility of a trap not fully excluded.  This -- as this may be a set up against the very, very important political person.  Force commander to inform SRSG" -- who, it's right, is it not, was Mr. Booh-Booh?
A.	Yes, indeed.
Q.	-- "first thing in morning to ensure his support."  To what extent was the issue of whether the information you were receiving from Turatsinze a possible trap, discussed?
A.	I said before, we had no confirmation of any of these disclosures.  We needed any confirmation, and as we hadn't had any experience in the past with the contact with these kind of disclosures, we had to be sure that it was not maybe a trap.  Therefore, we needed to do some military operation eventually to catch these weapons and have objective proof of this distribution of armament.
Q.	What did you understand the price would be for sight of the Tutsi lists and of the arms caches?
A.	There were different prices to be paid; maybe, one of them was for the informant, if he hadn't any protection, for him that this could be a serious consequence for him.  A second one is that the party involved also would have to come over with some explanation, and another one was eventually the physical risk of involving troops in operations that could turn out badly.
Q.	As you finished your interview with Turatsinze and prepared the famous fax of the 11th of January, did you believe what Turatsinze had told you?
A.	Yes, for me, it was rather too precise to be untrue.  Of course, it needed some verification.
Q.	You told us yesterday that the fax was sent in the early hours of the 11th of January in New York, which would have been seven hours, I think, behind; it would still have been the 10th of January.  That would be right, would it not?
A.	Yes, of course it would have been the 10th in New York still.
Q.	Was it usual to send a fax to New York directly, as we can see from the document for the attention of Baril/DPKO/UN New York?  Was that a normal thing to do within the chain of paperwork and command?
A.	From my point of view, yes, because it was the military chain of command, so General Dallaire sent it to another general, being the head of the military part in the peacekeeping operations headquarters in New York.  It was from one military to another.
Q.	The general you are referring to in New York was Major General Baril; is that correct?
A.	Yes, indeed.
Q.	Did you become aware of any disquiet expressed by the United Nations representative for the secretary general, Mr. Booh-Booh, that there had been direct communication with New York, rather than via him?
A.	I never was informed of this disquiet at those days.  It was only brought to my attention during my appearance at other testimonies.
Q.	If we turn to the document, at page 10, we see here a UN outgoing code cable to Mr. Booh-Booh from Mr. Annan, dated 10th of January of 1994, referring, in paragraph 1, to sight of the 11th of January fax, and at paragraph 2, it suggests "Information is cause for certain, but there are certain inconsistencies.  We must handle this information with caution."  Paragraph 3: "We await your considered assessment and recommendations.  No reconnaissance or other action, including response to request protection, should be taken by UNAMIR until clear guidance is received from headquarters."  And if we turn over the page, at paragraph 4, there's reference to how it is said, "We would appreciate having your views on the arrangements which would need to be made regarding the custody and storage of the weapons recovered."

Is it right that there was no immediate action in terms of protection or reconnaissance ordered by UNHQ?
A.	Yes, indeed.  I never saw any paperwork at that time, but the general informed us that New York had decided -- or, didn't give any authorisation for any action to recover weapons at earmarked sites by the informant.
Q.	If we go to the United Nations document, at page 12, we see there a communication to Mr. Booh-Booh from Mr. Annan, now dated the 11th of January, in which certain instructions are given as to how to proceed with the information that had been received.  And without going through the entirety of the document, one can see that it suggests that the president of the country, Mr. Habyarimana, is approached and also that certain embassies are approached.  Were you aware that President Habyarimana was approached and that certain embassies were approached with the enquiry about protection?
A.	I was only aware of the fact that certain ambassadors had been invited to the headquarters to be briefed by General Dallaire.  I was not aware of a visit to the president of the republic.
Q.	If we go to the document, at page 14, we see there a response from Mr. Booh-Booh to Mr. Annan, and there are a number of small observations to note.  At paragraph 2 it's recorded: "Brigadier General Dallaire briefed me during the night."  You see that?
A.	Yes, paragraph 2.
Q.	In paragraph 3, it refers to the very, very important person, VVIP, as being the prime minister-designate.  Do you see that?
A.	Yes, I see it. 
Q.	A little earlier you thought the VVIP might have be the president of the country.  Do you know who the VVIP actually was?
A.	In this case it was mister -- referring to this fax to Mr. Twagiramungu, the prime minister-designate who brought us into contact with Jean-Pierre.
Q.	And at paragraph 5 on page 15, Mr. Booh-Booh tells Mr. Annan, "The prime minister-designate expressed total, repeat total, confidence on the veracity and true ambitions of the informant", and at paragraph 6, "The informant does not have long before he must distribute the remaining arms.  We are speaking of 24 to 48 hours."

Was that your perception, that the informant, Turatsinze, having described how there were arms to distribute, was under pressure to distribute them, or not?
A.	Subsequent to our interview of the 10th of January, we hadn't this feeling.  He only expressed it on a later contact.
Q.	We will see how that develops.  We can observe that there was the cable of the 11th of January and some correspondence between Mr. Booh-Booh and Mr. Annan as a result.  Can you remember when you next saw Turatsinze after the evening of the 10th of January?
A.	We saw Jean-Pierre back on the 12th of January in the same location as the first time.
Q.	All right.  That's helpful.  Now, can I please take you to the document, at page 19?  We see here a communication to Mr. Annan from Mr. Booh-Booh, dated 13th of January, and at paragraph 2 there is reference to what events took place on the 12th of January.  In short, the 12th of January involved Mr. Booh-Booh and the FC, force commander, and others, meeting with the president of the republic and informing him of some of the information which had been received.  Of interest is paragraph 6 on page 20.  And as a matter of record, the UN document records that "Mr. Booh-Booh and the force commander and a Mr. Kabia met with the president and national secretary of the MRND and told them of the information we had received on the activities their party militia, relating to the training and deployment of subversive groups in Kigali, as well as the storage and distribution of weapons to these groups."  It goes on: "We also protested the conduct of their party's militia during the demonstrations of 8 January.  Both officials denied that MRND or its militia was involved in the alleged activities.  They accepted that some members of their militia had participated in the 8 January demonstration, but were not involved in the harassment of UNAMIR personnel and acts of violence perpetrated against Rwandese nationals.  They accused infiltrators and bandits, some wearing MRND party insignia, to have been the culprits.  We urged them to investigate the allegations and report back to us as early as possible."

Is it right, you, yourself, were not present at that meeting?
A.	Yes, that is clear.  I was not present at that meeting.
Q.	For the moment, we note that the record suggests the meeting was at 4 p.m. on the 12th of January.  Can you remember when you next saw Turatsinze?
A.	We saw Jean-Pierre the same evening of the 13th (sic).
Q.	When you say the "same evening", we were dealing with the 12th of January.
A.	I say again, yeah, on the 12th of January; sorry.
Q.	And can you remember what he said to you when you saw him on the evening of the 12th of January?
A.	He said that he was late because it was not at an appointed time that we waited for him, that he had had the meeting with the party authorities, and that they were questioning him about the distribution of arms, and that he should accelerate the distribution.  And that was also the evening where he brought us, then, to the parties, each, to find weapon storage place as he had depicted before.
Q.	Thank you.  Pausing there, if we look now at the document at page 16, this is a code cable addressed to Annan, for the attention of Major General Baril, from General Dallaire.  It is dated the 12th of January, and if we look at paragraph 9 on page 17, we see there: "The first thing the informant said when he met us this evening was that he was a little late due to the debriefing he had just received from the MRND party president.  The president had evidently gone directly to brief him, as the meeting with Mr. Booh-Booh and Dallaire had ended at about 6 p.m., and he arrived at the contact point at 7 p.m.  He stated that the party president was very concerned about the weapons distribution.  He wanted to know why all the weapons were not, as yet, distributed.  Response from the informant was that he had not yet found enough responsible members to give them to.  The president seemed very scared by the words of Dallaire at the earlier meeting with him.  Mr. Booh-Booh and Dallaire had left them with the impression that they were in possession of some proof on MRND having weapons in their possession.  Dallaire had indicated that they should show their goodwill in their behaviour by some positive gesture in support of the weapons secure area rules.  The informant attempted to reassure the president that he was getting on with the distribution as fast as possible.  The informant demonstrated no adverse reaction to UNAMIR already seemingly using some of this information in its discussions with the relevant persons."
Pausing there: do you recall Turatsinze discussing in these terms what had taken place as result of Booh-Booh and Dallaire meeting with the MRND president and general secretary?
A.	He spoke, indeed, about the fact that he was late and that he was urged by his party authorities to accelerate the distribution of arms.  I don't recall him saying that he put a link between the meeting of the party president with force commander and SRSG.
Q.	Did he describe to you any suggestion from the MRND president that the arms would have to be given up and handed over to UNAMIR?
A.	No, he never spoke about this kind of action to be taken.
Q.	What was it, it was apparent to you, the MRND leadership were trying to do with the arms now that UNAMIR appeared to know about them?
A.	My impression was that instead of keeping arms on different concentrated locations, was that -- the weapons should go to individuals as soon as possible so that they were more difficult to trace.
Q.	If we return to this document dated 12th of January, at paragraph 1, it records how, "In accordance with the direction received, no offensive military action has been taken; discussions with president, head of state and, at his request, the president and national secretary of the MRND party, were held."  That seems, on the face of it, consistent with the document we have seen sent from Booh-Booh to Annan.  As a matter of observation, would you agree with that?
A.	Yes, I agree.
Q.	Paragraph 2, it records, "Contact has been maintained with the informant through a phone call and a meeting as preplanned.  The following information was volunteered from him.  The individual is getting nervous, but has reduced his keenness to assist UNAMIR in getting to the bottom of these subversive activities."  And there follows, now, further information from Turatsinze.  At paragraph 3, the information now received from further contact with Turatsinze records: "He" -- the informant -- "was advised on Friday, 7 January, evening, at 10 to 6 p.m., about the actions to take place on Saturday, 8 January.  The CND building, parliament and RPF compound was not to be reached by any of the protesters.  In the MRND opinion, the swearing-in ceremonies are to be considered illegal when the president is not present.  He" -- the informant -- "deployed the newly trained MRND youth wingers as a test case for them.  They also are the best trained militarily in case of confrontation with UNAMIR forces.  Confrontation could have been supported by presidential guards battalion as they were on a covert standby status that has not been confirmed by our UNMOs" -- pause there: UNMO stands for? 
A.	UN military observers.
Q.	Thank you. "... at their camp.  In order to support this manifestation, should the situation present itself, he" -- the informant -- "had readily available between 60 and 70 weapons, hidden in the vegetation along the roadside, covered with leaves.  For such actions, they normally dispose of six wireless communication sets.  This was reinforced with four more from either the army or gendarmerie."  Pausing there: do you recall receiving this information from Turatsinze?
A.	Yes, this information came from Turatsinze and I briefed this to the general.
Q.	The figures 60 and 70 weapons, six wireless communication sets, four more from the army or gendarmerie, are these figures that were observed cautiously by you or --  that's a bad way of putting the question -- did you get the figures wrong when you were reporting to Dallaire?
A.	No, I was not making up any figures.
Q.	The reference to Turatsinze being contacted at 10 to 6:00 in the evening on the 7th of January with a view to how the demonstration on the 8th of January should proceed, that time, is that something you made up, or is it something that was specifically from Turatsinze?
A.	That came specifically from Turatsinze.
Q.	At paragraph 4, the cable reads: "The weapons he already distributed were only distributed to the sector commanders, about 25 in number".  Pausing there: the expression "sector commander", where did that come from?
A.	It was a word that he, himself, was using, the word referring to the distribution of responsibilities over préfecture Kigali.
Q.	The number "25", where did that come from?
A.	They were given by him.
Q.	It goes on: "They" -- the weapons -- "were not distributed yet to a lower level; therefore, they have to get an order from him" -- the informant -- "in the same way he orders the return of weapons to himself."  Pausing there: who -- what was Turatsinze saying about his, Turatsinze's, control over distribution of weapons?
A.	That it was his authority to decide if the weapons would be distributed to individuals, and that it was also his responsibility if he would give the orders, that the weapons would be returned to him or collected by him to be brought back wherever they belonged to.
Q.	What impression was created in your mind by a description of his having an authority to recall weapons in terms of the level to which the Interahamwe seemed to be an organised and disciplined institution?
A.	That it was well organised and that if his authorities are ordered to stop the distribution of armaments and return them to maybe RGF or to UN, he was entitled to do it.
Q.	The paragraph 4 continues, "As well as his own car" -- pausing there: do you remember what kind of car he had?
A.	Yes.  He was driving a white Nissan.
Q.	"As well as his own car, he uses for weapons transport, minibuses of the party (6)".  Where did the figure "6" come from?
A.	He used the number 6 - or, the figure 6.
Q.	"... or army vehicles (these vehicles are of the intelligence service with civilian licence numbers)".  The information, specifically, intelligence service vehicles with civilian licence plates, where did that come from?
A.	This came from him.
Q.	It goes on, "Weapons are moved every 5 or 6 days."  Numbers "5 or 6", where did that come from?
A.	That was also his saying. 
Q.	It goes on: "There are no more grenades in his stores.  They were all distributed a long time ago and each Interahamwe should normally have at least two to three of them (up to 60 per sector).  Figure "2" to "3", where did that come from?
A.	Still this figure and information came from Jean-Pierre Turatsinze.
Q.	What impression was formed in your mind of the level of organisation if an Interahamwe is describing -- is described as normally having at least two to three grenades with up to 60 per sector, there being 25 sector commanders, from earlier in the paragraph?
A.	Well, yes, if you do some mathematics, you end up with a lot of people in each sector, well armed, at least with grenades, because 60 grenades by 25 is a quite impressing explosive device.
Q.	At paragraph 5, the document records: "Every night, he" -- the informant -- "is contacted by telephone from 10 p.m. onwards and is informed by his patrols in the different sectors about the situation in their area of interest".  Did he say that?
A.	Yes, these were also his words.
Q.	The timing, ten o'clock in the evening, only thereafter, the use of the word "patrols", these were his words or your military interpretation?
A.	No, these were his words and the use of his words.
Q.	Paragraph 6: "They are planning a political meeting this Saturday" -- which I think would have been the 17th of January -- "or Sunday with peaceful intentions.  It will go on until at 2 p.m.  He has been ordered to provide at least 100 ('discreetly armed') security people.  Party members will be dressed in the well-known party dress, which was not the case during the 8th of January demonstrations.  They are expecting about 10,000 participants in the Nyamirambo stadium."  Pausing there: did he tell you this?
A.	Yes, indeed it was what he said and announced to us.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I got my dates wrong.  Saturday would have been the 15th of January, Sunday, the 16th January; my mistake.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I am interested in the word "discreetly", which appears in inverted commas.  What was he saying about discreet weapons carrying?
A.	Well, that they would be in plain clothes and that the weapons would not be worn, as normal military would show them being on duty.
Q.	He referred to how party dress would be apparent on the 15th January, which was not the case during 8th of January.  Now, what did you understand had taken place on the 8th of January with regard to party dress, from what Turatsinze told you?
A.	He was referring to the demonstrations of the 8th of January where you couldn't identify properly to which party or to which organisation the demonstrators were belonging, and now as being official meeting from the party, they would also wear their distinctive clothing.
Q.	The figure "10,000" participants expected, where did that figure come from?
A.	These were also figures given by Jean-Pierre. 
Q.	Now, if we look on to the next paragraph, there's a description of what might happen on the 15th of January.  Paragraph 7 records: "Should the political parties attempt, once again, to have ceremonies of swearing-in without the president, they have already prepared tracts and radio releases in Kinyarwanda to advise the population that these, 'illegal ceremonies' occur.  People will have six hours to close their stores and gas stations; taxis and buses are to be brought to their depots.  If they do not comply, they would punish the non-participants by burning down the locations and destroying the concerned vehicles.  The aim of this exercise would be to paralyse the city."  Did he tell you these things?
A.	Yes, he expressed these words and this scenario to us.
Q.	The description "six hours to close their stores", where did that come from?
A.	These are his words.
Q.	And who is the "they" who were going to destroy vehicles, paralyse the city, order taxis and buses to depots, close down stores and gas stations, and who had prepared tracts of radio releases in Kinyarwanda?  Who's the "they" who were going to run this paralysis of Kigali?
A.	There, he was speaking of that general term for the organisation; so, the trained people, the Interahamwe, the sector heads and the people within the sectors.
Q.	Paragraph 8, the evening of the 12th of January, it says: "At the end of the meeting, he wanted to prove to us his reliability by showing us the weapons that were stored in the MRND party headquarters.  He took one of the officers of the force HQ with him to the building at 2100 hours" -- 9 p.m. -- "and the following weapons were seen: about 50 rifles of AK-47, FAL" -- I think -- "and G3 types, with sealed boxes of ammunition.  The weapons were packed in canvas bags.  The building of the MRND party belongs to the chief of staff of the gendarmerie."  Pausing there: did an officer on the night of the 12th of January, following a further meeting with Turatsinze that evening, see an arms cache?
A.	This was the case.
Q.	Which officer, please?
A.	It was the Senegalese Captain Deme, who was assisting me in the military information office, and we attended the same meeting that evening.
Q.	Did Captain Deme go to this location in uniform?
A.	No, those of the meetings of the 10th and of that meeting, we were in civilian dress and we used an anonymous UN-leased car to do the going and fetching of Jean-Pierre and going to this MRND location.
Q.	You go to the MRND location and not go inside the building, or did you not go there at all?
A.	Yes, I was the driver of the vehicle; Jean-Pierre was sitting in the middle of us; and Captain Deme was sitting in the outside of the vehicle.  We drove to the compound.
Q.	Why couldn't you wander in in civilian clothes?  Why was it Captain Deme who went in?
A.	For obvious reasons, my skin colour would have brought any attention to the guards of the compound to visit a place where I was not belonging.  I was not part of the MRND party.  Amadou Deme, the Senegalese captain, in his civvies was less suspicious, to enter this compound with Jean-Pierre.
Q.	The description of AK-47, FAL and G3 rifles, 50 in number in canvas bags, came from who?
A.	The information was given by Captain Deme, himself a military.
Q.	And where were these weapons, please; in what building, where?
A.	He described that the -- there was an annex to the building.  We would call it a shed, but it was still in concrete, so it was a separate entrance to the headquarters, and in this shed were located the bags with the weapons and the ammunition.
Q.	Having found 50 assault rifles, why not seize them?
A.	The seizure of these weapons would require military operation.  We were, at that moment, not entitled nor in the capacity to carry 50 weapons outside the MRND building, as it was, like every compound in Kigali, guarded at night by some sentinels, and there had been instructions from New York that these kinds of activities were not allowed.  It was not within the mandate of UNAMIR.
Q.	If we go over the page now, to page 18, continuing with the code cable from Dallaire to Major General Baril, following the meeting with Turatsinze on the 12th of January, paragraph 10 reads: "The informant is ready to meet with us again tomorrow night, the 13th of January, and at that time, provide licence numbers of the cars, vehicles, used for the arms transportation.  He will also provide the exact information of a few of the sites where some of the small arms caches are located."  Did Turatsinze have to do that for the next evening?
A.	Yes, it was what he offered to do for the next evening.
Q.	We will deal with what he did the next evening shortly.  But as a result of Captain Deme, on the 
	12th of January in the evening, at about 9 p.m., at the MRND building in a shed finding 50 assault rifles, did you, yourself, meet with the MRND national president and the general secretary?
A.	Yes, indeed, I remember from a meeting in the force headquarters with these two persons, together with General Dallaire.
Q.	When was the meeting which dealt with the events of the evening of the 12th of January, the discovery of the arms cache; the meeting was when?
A.	My recollection was that that was the next day in the afternoon, the 13th.
Q.	Where was the meeting?
A.	It was at the first or the second floor of the force headquarters in hôtel Amahoro.
Q.	Who was present?
A.	The president of the party and his secretary general; the force commander, General Dallaire; and myself.
Q.	Now that you are face-to-face with these individuals, can you remember the name of the MRND president?
A.	It was Mr. Ngirumpatse.
Q.	Can you remember the name of the general secretary?
A.	Not by recollection, no; no, I should read ...
Q.	How did you know the person you met was the general secretary?
A.	Well, I was not in the possibility to identify them as being the persons they were saying they were, but the general was at least able to say it.  It was not my role, as military information officer, to be introduced in the political circles at that time.
Q.	Do you know now who the four principal leaders of the MRND in 1994 were?  Apart from Mr. Ngirumpatse, can you remember the names of the other three?
A.	Not by recollection.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I see the time.  I wonder if that's a convenient moment, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.  We take the morning recess now for 15 minutes.
(Court recessed at 1032H)
(Pages 1 to 13 by Verna Butler)
























(Court resumed at 1058H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, with Your Honours' leave.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Are you aware that General Dallaire has written a book called Shake Hands with the Devil? 
A.	Yes, I am aware about it. 
Q.	Have you read that book?
A.	Yes, I have read it, amongst others. 
Q.	Are you aware that within that book General Dallaire refers to meeting the general secretary of the MRND and the general -- and the party president in connection with the informant? 
A.	Yes, I am aware about that. 
Q.	It is a matter of record that at page 149 in the English text of General Dallaire's book                      Shake Hands with the Devil he refers to meeting with the party president, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and the general secretary, Joseph Nzirorera.  The name Joseph Nzirorera, does that mean anything to you, it having been mentioned to you now? 
A.	Yes, then it rings a bell. 
Q.	The persons that you met in the afternoon of the 13th of January, you told us had been introduced to you by General Dallaire as the MRND party president and the MRND general secretary.  Was the person who was introduced to you as the general secretary Joseph Nzirorera?  Can you remember, or do you not remember now? 
A.	Now, that the name has been mentioned, yes, now I remember it as being one of the two introduced persons by General Dallaire. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, may I just asked that, since this has come up without any notice to me concerning General Dallaire's book, that if somebody has a copy of that book in the courtroom, I would just like, before we go any further, to look at that page for one minute.  So can that be -- can I have a look at that?  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend is very welcomed to have the extracts which I have here.  For his assistance, second paragraph, page 149, K number, K0281995; with Mr. Vincent's assistance, please. 

For my learned friend's assistance, I have highlighted the section in yellow.  If I might continue whilst that is being looked at, with Your Honours' leave?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	How long did the meeting last? 
A.	I reckoned that the meeting didn't take longer than half an hour. 
Q.	Was it tape recorded? 
A.	Yes, it was done by myself. 
Q.	On what sort of piece of equipment? 
A.	In those days we were using -- I was using a personal walkman with microphone. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I have had a chance to read this, I appreciate that.  However, I point out that this passage refers to a meeting on the 12th of January which -- and another witness has been referring to a meeting that he says took place on the 13th of January, a second meeting with General Dallaire.  And the book, in fact, only refers to one meeting which took place on the 12th of January.  It makes no reference to a second meeting on the 13th of January.  So, I think that Mr. Morley has called this witness's attention to a different meeting. 
MR. MORLEY:
The book refers to the identification of the general secretary as being Joseph Nzirorera as seen by General Dallaire on the 12th of January.  The witness has given evidence that the people that he was introduced to at the meeting on the 13th of January were the president of the MRND and the general secretary.  The general secretary has been identified within the book at that time as being Nzirorera.  And the witness, having heard the name, has given the evidence that that's the name he recalls, his memory being jogged.  It is a matter for Your Honours what weight to attach to the evidence that, I respectfully submit, that it is nothing improper in refreshing the witness's recollection from the book which he has read in respect of meetings that he knows about, and having met with people identified by General Dallaire. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I don't object to refreshing a witness's recollection with the name.  But I think that what Mr. Morley did went beyond that because he was, essentially, saying that General Dallaire had written about the same meeting and had then mentioned the person who was present as Nzirorera, and does that ring a bell.  But what, in fact, occurs from General Dallaire's book is he speaks of only one meeting that he had with Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Ngirumpatse, a meeting that occurred on the             12th before the gentlemen had visited the MRND offices.  And, in fact, there is no mention by     General Dallaire of the second meeting in his book on the 13th, nor is there any mention in any sit -- reps of UNAMIR of a second meeting on the 13th.  

So I think that Mr. Morley has mischaracterised what was in General Dallaire's book, and it has an inadvertent affect of having this witness confirm that Mr. Nzirorera was at a meeting which is not referenced in the book of Dallaire. 
MR. MORLEY:
The book references Nzirorera as being the general secretary who Dallaire met, we know, certainly, on the 12th of January from the cables which were sent by Booh-Booh to Annan.  And, insofar, as he identifies the general secretary on the 12th of January, I respectfully submit that it is available to the witness to be asked whether or not the general secretary who he, the witness, met the next day on the face of it might be the same person.  And the witness's evidence is that his memory has been refreshed -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, there is no point arguing this over and over again. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are answering a different point to the one being made by counsel for Nzirorera.  You see, I got the impression from the way you put the question that what you are putting to him was General Dallaire's account of the same meeting.  And that is what the witness seemed to have responded to.  And that is the objection that is being made; is that correct?  
MR. MORLEY:
That appears to be the objection which is being made. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but was it -- is the correction factually sound, is the objection factually sound?  I don't have the reference before us; we can't make any independent checks at this stage, so we have to rely on counsel at this stage.
MR. MORLEY:  
Mr. Robinson is right in that looking at the paragraph Dallaire is referring to a meeting with Nzirorera with Booh-Booh, but he specifically mentioned -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
On the 12th?  
MR. MORLEY:
On the 12th, but he specifically mentions that Nzirorera is the general secretary of the MRND. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but that is some very minor point, Mr. Morley.  There is a lot of evidence on the record -- in this trial already as to the identity of the officers of the MRND. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, but I am anticipating Mr. Robinson's very -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, that aspect as to the identification of Nzirorera as the general secretary is a minor point, as far as I am concerned.  What was of interest to me was the fact that it seemed to have been consistent with what was in General Dallaire's book.  But the issue has now been clarified, and I think you can move on. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You were saying that the meeting was tape recorded.  What happened to the tape? 
A.	As I said before, all of my notes and all of my equipment were left in my office of the force headquarters.  And I have never been able to have them back. 
Q.	Can you recall now what was said during that meeting? 
A.	General Dallaire expressed, in general terms, his concern about the information of weapons being stored outside military barracks, and this unmonitored and scenario of killings being expressed by Jean-Pierre without mentioning his name for whatever source.  And he requested, upon denial of the persons in front of us, that they were expected to show goodwill in the foregoing of the peace process. 
Q.	They had a meeting the day before, Dallaire and Booh-Booh, prior to seeing any weapons.  Why the meeting on the 13th of January with Dallaire and you? 
A.	Until the meeting on the previous day there were no pieces of evidence seen by anyone within UNAMIR; it was just a disclosure of information.  After the visit of the MRND headquarters and what Captain Deme had seen, and I didn't know that there had been another meeting before with those two persons, between the general and Mr. Booh-Booh.  So, for me it was the first time this concern was expressed to these persons. 
Q.	How did Ngirumpatse react? 
A.	They denied any involvement or any knowledge about this information that was addressed to them. 
Q.	How did Nzirorera react? 
A.	It was the same.  At different stages they were denying the existence of this scenario. 
Q.	Did either Ngirumpatse or Nzirorera offer to make any enquiries? 
A.	They didn't. 
Q.	Did either ask for further details of the information that you had? 
A.	No, they didn't require any more information. 
Q.	Did either express disquiet that some allegation of this nature might possibly be true? 
A.	They might have seemed surprised or been surprised, but it was difficult to read on their faces. 
Q.	Did either offer to meet again with General Dallaire after their own efforts to verify what they had been told? 
A.	I don't remember them giving this impression. 
Q.	Did General Dallaire make any observations about how they might be expected to deny this information? 
A.	No, just show of goodwill, that was the only thing he requested. 
Q.	Was it a surprise to you that Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse denied any knowledge of the information you were offering knowing on your part that there were arms in the MRND building? 
A.	I don't think I was surprised.  They had, I think, only two options; one to deny it, or to admit.  And if they admitted it, they would need a very good explanation for that. 
Q.	Bearing in mind that you were aware that there were 50 assault rifles in the MRND building, what did you make of their denials? 
A.	Well, at that moment we felt helpless because if they wouldn't cooperate then we had some problems.  And as we had been instructed by New York not to start any military action, we needed to look for other ways around. 
Q.	In light of the information you had received, did you believe their denials? 
A.	Of course not. 
Q.	Did you continue to have meetings with Turatsinze? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, excuse me.  Mr. President before we leave the topic of this alleged meeting of the 13th of January, I wonder if the Prosecution can tell us whether or not there exists or they have any reports of this meeting or maybe, perhaps, ask the witness if he has reviewed any reports of this meeting, because absolutely, as far as we are concerned, we have absolutely never seen any report of this meeting of the 13th in any way, shape or form.  And if such a report exists, it should have been disclosed to us.  So, I would ask Mr. Morley to indicate whether there is such a report, and ask the witness if he has seen anything or wrote anything after this. 
MR. MORLEY:
I can assist my learned friend.  We have no note of this meeting.  There is reference to a meeting between Dallaire and this witness in his previous testimony in other trials.  We have notes in respect of other information which has been received by Turatsinze.  And Mr. Robinson has some of that material in the bundle which he has had distributed to him.  But if I might ask the witness -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, before we go on with that, is Mr. Morley saying that General Dallaire has testified in previous trials to the meeting of the 13th, because if that is the case, maybe I don't have all of the transcripts, because I have never seen that. 
MR. MORLEY:
No, I am talking about this witness.  He has given testimony of meeting Ngirumpatse before.  And one finds it in his statements. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I understand that, but I'm asking -- thank you, I understand now. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  But if I might turn to the witness to complete the circle. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, did you write a report of what was said by Dallaire and what was said by Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera in relation to that meeting? 
A.	I don't recall having written any report, as the aim of the reports were to inform the force commander.  And the force commander being present at this meeting, there was no need to report it; and we had the tape.  So General Dallaire could refer to the tape for certain notes. 
Q.	I hope that assists.

Turning to Turatsinze and further meetings, did you see him again on the evening of the                   13th of January? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	If we go to page 21 of the bundle, we have a document noted as, "Meeting on 13 January '93."  Is this a document that you recall preparing or not? 
A.	Yes, this is a document I have wrote after the meeting of the 13th January. 
Q.	It says '93; should it say '94? 
A.	Yes, of course. 
Q.	To avoid any misunderstanding, January, of course, being the beginning of the year sometimes we put down the previous year's date until we get use to writing the present year's date.  Is that what happened in this document? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm simply trying to close down every conceivable -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know.  That is a leading question and he is your witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You actually put the answer in the mouth of the witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
All right.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Why does it say '93? 
A.	It probably was just a typing error. 
Q.	If we look at the document itself what is it referring to? 
A.	It is referring to the announced meeting, political rally, the next Sunday in Nyamirambo where there is the sports stadium where the MRND would hold their political rally. 
Q.	And -- 
A.	How he was in charge of organising a part of this rally, more specifically, the security. 
Q.	And to close the date down completely; were you actually present in Rwanda in January '93? 
A.	No, I was a student at staff college. 
Q.	Is there any way at all that this document was prepared in January '93? 
A.	This could only be possible if also in January '93 there could have been a political rally in Nyamirambo. 
Q.	What does that mean?  Is there any way at all this document was prepared in 1993, yes or no? 
A.	No, not to my knowledge. 
Q.	Did you prepare it? 
A.	This is a document I have written. 
Q.	Did you prepare it in 1993?
A.	No way. 
Q.	Thank you.  If we look at the document, it records further details from Turatsinze, referring to the meeting proposed for Sunday, now, in Nyamirambo, Sunday the 16th of January.  And we see that it repeats some of what we saw in the document of the 12th of January.  The second sentence it says:  "He confirms that the meeting will be a peaceful political meeting starting around 8 o'clock in the morning, and will finish around 2 p.m.  He is in charge of security, and says that 200 of his people will be present only for security; that they will be armed.  He mend small hand weapons" -- I think that should read meant, "he meant small hand weapons hidden under their typical party dress." Did you write that?
A.	Yes, I did write that. 
Q.	"The meeting will handle about the political view of the MRND party in the actual stall of the installation of the broad-based transitional government.  He said that MRND is against deputies from PL,        Liberal Party, from Lando wing.  That the MRND will not accept a government without ministers of the MDR Power and without ministers of the PL wing, Mugenzi; that they will fight against a government led by Faustin Twagiramungu if they try to have majority in parliament."  Is this what Turatsinze told you? 
A.	Yes, this was what Jean-Pierre reported to us. 
Q.	Reference to MDR Power, what did you understand that to be referring to, particularly the use of the word "power"? 
A.	The MDR party was known as being more radical, Hutu tainted, and they wanted Hutu in power. 
Q.	It goes on:  "He was again questioned about the vehicles that are used for weapons transport."  Who questioned him? 
A.	Captain Deme and myself. 
Q.	It continues:  "When it concerns transport of weapons coming from military camps, military vehicles are used.  These military vehicles might also be replaced by civilian cars of the national security for these purposes.  They also regularly change the licence numbers of these cars in accordance to the missions they are carrying out."  Did he tell you that? 
A.	Yes, these also were his words. 
Q.	What did you make of the regular change of licence plates? 
A.	This is a kind of standard operating procedure for security in intelligence services to make activities untraceable.  They use false number plates, and, apparently, this was also used for arms transport. 
Q.	He goes on:  "He provided us also with three licence numbers and description of cars used by the car party, colour, brand and type."  By there are you referring there to how he described the colour of cars, the brand of cars; is that what is referred to there or what is meant? 
A.	Yes, indeed, he spoke about the colour of the vehicles and the brand, where they are kind of Toyota or Mitsubishi, this kind of brand he was using. 
Q.	It goes on:  "These cars are also used for weapons transport when they have to change the caches?
MR. MORLEY:
For the stenographers that is C-A-C-H-E-S, perhaps better pronounced caches.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	"Caches are normally changed every seven or eight days." Did he also tell you that?  
A.	Yes, these were also his words. 
Q.	"He assured that he is able to keep the weapons which are at the MRND party building at this time, there until Monday night."  Pausing there, that would be the 17th of January.  "After that, he will have to move them.  He said he will move some of the weapons at his home to the party building to increase the number of weapons there if we should do an operation there."  Did he tell you that? 
A.	Yes, these were his words.  He was offering a bigger amount of weapons than the one we saw some days before. 
Q.	And what would be the advantage to you to seize a bigger number of weapons? 
A.	For us this wouldn't make any difference, but for him maybe it was easier not to distribute the large amount of weapons that he was storing at his place. 
Q.	In paragraph three, the information continues:  "The origin of these weapons is not very clear, but he said that they are likely to be the army reserve.  Most of the weapons are brand new.  At this time it will be difficult for the army to provide more weapons to the party due of the control and monitoring of UNAMIR military observers.  That is also the reason why a transport will not be caught red-handed at this moment:  A, he still has too much weapons which are not distributed; and, B, the control of UNAMIR." Was there a discussion about the origin of the weapons? 
A.	Yes, he explained that normally the weapons came from the barracks, but since the military observers had made up an inventory of the weapons in the barracks and the weapons stocking places, each movement of armaments, be it for training or other activities, had to be announced and was monitored.  So weapons going out had to be brought back also. 
Q.	It goes on:  "Where the ammunition is concerned, he told us that only a few of the distributed weapons were provided with magazines and ammo (about 20)."  Did that figure come from him? 
A.	Yes, of course, these figures came from him. 
Q.	"The other weapons had no magazines when distributed to the lower cells.  When he had to explain to his superiors why he did not distribute more weapons, he answered that he had not found the right and responsible fellows to take care of the weapons in the lower cells, and that he had not enough ammunition.  The result was that the same day he was provided with FOUR" -- in capital letter, "FOUR more boxes of ammunition."  Did he tell you all of this? 
A.	Yes, that is what he told us. 
Q.	Can you help Their Honours if a weapon doesn't have a magazine, is it still possible to load it and fire it single with bullets or not? 
A.	Yes, of course.  A weapon with one round in the chamber permits to fire one round, but you have to reload it each time.  The magazine allows to fire different shots one behind the other, one after the other. 
Q.	The paragraph four, the information continues:  "The weapons supply started, in fact, about a month ago.  Before that, weapons among the population were rare and only procured on private base by buying from former military.  Grenades were more available because they were distributed to the population during the war."  Did he tell you this?  
A.	Yes, this was also reported by him. 
Q.	If weapons distribution had begun to the Interahamwe about a month before, what month would that be; it is pretty obvious? 
A.	This was the month of December. 
Q.	It goes on:  "As we were already informed that a number of heavy weapons were transferred out of Kigali to caches all over the country, he confirmed that a number of them are in Karago," --  K-A-R-A-G-O, "the village of birth of the president and into the Nyungwe forest," N-Y-U-N-G-W-E.  "He was sure that it concerns mortars and anti-aircraft guns which were transferred half November.  He was not able to give more details but would try to collect more information about that."  Pausing there.  

	In relation to the heavy weapons moved out of Kigali said by Turatsinze to be in Karago and Nyungwe forest, had you already had some information from another source about the movement of heavy weapons? 
A.	I recall, indeed, that we had heard with the fact that was said amongst others in Kigali about heavy weapons that had been moved before the complete inventory by UNAMIR had been made up. 
Q.	Where it refers to Turatsinze saying "the weapons were transferred half November" what does half November mean? 
A.	Around the 15th November '93. 
Q.	What did you make of Turatsinze being able to talk to you about the movement of heavy weapons to Karago and Nyungwe forest identifiable as mortars and anti-aircraft guns?  What did that tell you about Turatsinze's state of knowledge? 
A.	That he knew what heavy armament meant in the military aspect, not the small caliber but larger caliber and that it needs special transport to bring it somewhere, not just hand carried. 
Q.	Did his having information about the movement of heavy weapons suggest anything to you about the relationship he enjoyed with the army? 
A.	Yes, this meant that he must have contacts, that is within the RGF saying to him what happened with this weaponry if it was not available, any more or less available in Kigali. 
Q.	The paragraph five it goes on:  "He said to be able to provide us a complete list of all of the military formed Interahamwe (plus or minus 2000) with names, place of living, place of work, some with pictures, et cetera." Did he say that? 
A.	Yes, he said that. 
Q.	The figure "plus or minus 2000" referring to the number of Interahamwe in military formation, where did that come from? 
A.	These were the figures he gave us. 
Q.	Did you ever obtain a list from Turatsinze of the 2000 military trained Interahamwe? 
A.	No, we haven't. 
Q.	Did Turatsinze ever discuss or describe the size of the Interahamwe outside of Kigali? 
A.	Not to my recollection. 
Q.	The 2000 trained Interahamwe, in your understanding, were located where? 
A.	They were located, to my knowledge, in Kigali, in the préfecture of Kigali. 
Q.	Paragraph six, referring to the meeting with Turatsinze on the 13th of January which comes after your meeting with Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera in that afternoon of the 13th of January reads as follows: "After the meeting he, the informant, showed us THREE"-- in capital letter, "THREE places in the KWSA where weapons are stored."  Pausing there:  KWSA stands for what? 
A.	KWSA stands for Kigali weapon secure area. 
Q.	Were people supposed to have weapons in the Kigali weapons secure area? 
A.	The aim of the KWSA was that all weapons in military compounds were under inventory and monitored by the UN monitoring officers, and that no other weapons were allowed to circulate, needed to be stored elsewhere. 
Q.	The showing of three places continues.  "There was a place with 15, one with 20, and the one near his house with more than 100 weapons."  Did he show you three locations? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	The figures, where did they come from, 15, 20 and 100? 
A.	These were the weapons he mentioned himself and that we took note from.  
Q.	If we add up the figures, the descriptions are of 135 weapons or more; you agree, simple math?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	If we go back to page 4 of the bundle, referring to the famous fax of the 11th of January of 1994, paragraph 8, is there reference to, how the informant is prepared to provide location of major weapons cache with at least 135 weapons? 
A.	Yes, it is the same number. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President; I'm going to object to this technique.  I think this is very misleading for the Prosecution to do this.  First of all, it speaks to a single weapon's cache with 135 weapon, there is none of that.  The 135 that Mr. Morley had magically added up, does not include some 50 weapons that were seen in the MRND, which would make it 185, which is contradictory then to the cache of 135.  So, I don't think this technique of -- it is, basically, like a jury technique and I object to it.  I ask that Mr. Morley simply stick to eliciting information from the witness, and not showing how clever he is.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm very sorry if Mr. Robinson thinks I'm being clever.  The figures add up as they do and are cross referenceable. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, Mr. Morley, what you ought to be doing at this stage is getting the witness to give his evidence.  He is not necessarily there just to approve the theories that you have. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours, it is not a theory.  It is material that appears in the document.  But I will move on.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	It goes on to say on page 22, to deal with Mr. Robinson's point a moment ago:  "At this time we thus have FOUR"-- more capital letters, "exact locations with weapons."  And that would refer, would it, to the previous MRND cache of 50 weapons and the three locations referred to on the 13th of January, making a total of four; is that right? 
A.	Yes, this is correct. 
Q.	Did you yourself go to those locations, the three locations on the night of the 13th of January? 
A.	In fact, we went with a vehicle, as I described it before, with Jean-Pierre in the middle between us, I was driving.  And we were shown these places and described as being the back shed of a bar, or being also a septic area where a box was buried and this kind, but we didn't visit the places as such. 
Q.	Did you see any of the 135 weapons distributed in the three locations? 
A.	No, we didn't. 
Q.	Come the weekend of the 15th and 16th of January, can you recall whether there was a demonstration? 
A.	I recall that there was a political rally in Nyamirambo.  It was monitored by UN, both military observers and military troops from UNAMIR.  But except of that, nothing special was to report. 
Q.	The political rally at Nyamirambo on that weekend was of which party; can you remember? 
A.	It was organised by MRND as announced.  
Q.	If we turn now to the documents at paragraph -- page 23 of the bundle, we see a document with the stamp of your name Frank Claeys, Captain, military information officer, force HQ, referring to contact on the --
A.	The 20th of January. 
Q.	At what time? 
A.	1900, 7 in the evening. 
Q.	20th of January 1994, 7 o'clock in the evening.  And does this document -- did you prepare it or did somebody else prepare it? 
A.	This is a document that I have prepared. 
Q.	Does it refer to further contact with Turatsinze? 
A.	Yes, of course.  There is a reference to a contact with him. 
Q.	It begins by saying:  "He handed over a video tape to be given back Saturday the 22nd of January.  They have an old video studio in the party building.  They taped also the meeting with the general last week, as well as the meeting at force HQ."  Pausing there.  "He handed over a video tape."  Was there a video tape?  What was on it, please? 
A.	Yes, indeed, he handed over a video tape that had been recorded during the political rally that Sunday in Nyamirambo which was showing how the rally was organised. 
Q.	That Sunday would have been the 16th of January of 1994.  Could you see Turatsinze on that video? 
A.	Yes, he was clearly visible on the tape. 
Q.	What was he doing?  In what capacity did he appear? 
A.	He was dressed in civilian costume.  He was giving the orders or directives, speak about orders, directives and instructions to personnel.  They were -- or they had civilian type radios that they used to communicate amongst each other all over the stadium.  He was also putting in place some personalities when they arrived with their vehicles, and assigning them the seats where they were supposed to sit. 
Q.	From the video you recall, was there an Interahamwe presence on it?
A.	Yes, indeed, a lot of people were wearing the distinctive uniform which characterised them belonging to the MRND party youth wing. 
Q.	The paragraph refers to:  "They taped also the meeting with the general last week, as well as the meeting at force HQ."  What meetings, two meetings are being referred to? 
A.	What the first meeting is concerned, I made up that it was a meeting where the general went to the MRND party seat from the -- where he just referred to, the meeting where Mr. Booh-Booh and     General Dallaire went to visit the party authorities. 
Q.	And the second meeting.  
A.	And I guess that they taped another meeting at the force headquarters or in Hôtel Amahoro.  But I don't know which meeting if it is a video tape, because I was not involved in a meeting where they used a video at the force headquarters. 
Q.	When you saw Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse on the 13th of January with Dallaire at force HQ, did they, Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse, audio record and tape the meeting? 
A.	Not to my knowledge. 
Q.	The note continues:  "He spoke about the distribution of weapons that started again on an individual basis with ammunition, nine, on the 20th January."  What does that mean? 
A.	This means that the day of our contact during the day he -- there had been a distribution of nine weapons with ammunition.  So from one storage place, probably, to individuals, to nine individuals, in this case with ammunition. 
Q.	It continues:  "With a blue Peugeot of a colonel of the RPF and" -- there is the name Terehaho, with a line through it.  And if one looks to the right there is in handwriting the word "Renzaho, préfet of Kigali.  He was taken with that car; the weapons were already on board.  And he had to assign the persons the weapons had to hand over."  So what is being said there?
A.	So, what he explained there is that the vehicle of the préfet of Kigali, a blue Peugeot, had already these nine weapons on board, probably in the boot.  And that he was picked up at a certain point, and had to bring this car with the weapons in the vicinity of some individuals that he had to earmark, and that these weapons were then handed over. 
Q.	Turning to the fourth paragraph, it reads:  "He said also that CDR sent 300 men to three training areas with buses (four) and a truck of the secretary national MRND Bigogwe, Mutara, Bugesera, (Gako).  In fact, they are employed undercover as sustaining personnel of the RGF troops in this area.  But in reality, they become a military training (300 were the number of people trained for CDR, not more)."  Who did you understand the CDR were? 
A.	So the CDR was one of the other parties in presence, political party which was defending a vision about Hutu in power. 
Q.	The reference to 300 CDR men in three training areas identified specifically as Bigogwe, Mutara Bugesera -- with brackets "(Gako)" after it, that information came from whom? 
A.	This was concrete information coming from Jean-Pierre. 
Q.	The 300 men, it was said were making their way to these areas in four buses, and the truck, dealing with the truck, who did you understand the truck belonged to? 
A.	As it was stated there, and being remembered to the name, it was a truck belonging to Mr. Nzirorera. 
Q.	The paragraph continues, next paragraph:  "He, the informed -- the informant warned us that the contractor of the works at CND will be killed soon.  He is accused to make RPF possible to smuggle RPF soldiers out of their compound.  In the morning he brings in workers; in the evening, soldiers are walking out.  Severa is the name.  He seems to distribute these soldiers over the city.  He says also, the informant says also, that RPF is supposed to smuggle in more soldiers by their convoys going and returning from Mulindi.  That contractor was already in prison during six months at the beginning of the war in 1990."  Just pausing there; what is it that Turatsinze is describing, Mr. Severa is being accused of doing? 
A.	He is expressing in this paragraph his concern about the fact that from the RPF battalion being contained in these quarters next to the CDN, without expressing the term Tutsi, Tutsi people are leaving the compound and are going into Kigali and are replaced the next day by a same number of non-military people, just being workers, contracted for the activities going on within the CND compound. 
Q.	But why was Severa to be killed? 
A.	Severa was, in their eyes, supporting the RPF in covert activities in Kigali by his way of handling.  And he had, apparently, already been in gaol for his probably Tutsi origin at the beginning of the war in 1990. 
Q.	Who was going to kill him? 
A.	That has not been expressed by Jean-Pierre. 
Q.	I don't mean the name, I mean what institution?  What organisation was going to have him killed? 
A.	His concern was coming from the people in his movement. 
Q.	What movement, spell it out?
A.	Well, from the Interahamwes. 
Q.	It continues, the next paragraph: "What is also being done by the MRND is taking note of all the vehicles entering the CND compound at the RPF gate; licence number and type and colour of vehicle.  Afterwards, they go to the ministry of transport to find out who is the owner of the vehicle.  This information is kept on files.  They started with this in the first days the RPF battalion came into Kigali.  He will provide us with the list of the people assigned to this job."  What did you understand Turatsinze was describing was taking place here? 
A.	So what he described to us, in fact, in other kinds of activities of inventory of sympathizers to the RPF and just Tutsi in general, by just identifying their vehicles they were able to identify the owners of the vehicles. 
Q.	If we turn the page, page 24, first paragraph, you have recorded there:  "Since the attempt at      Minister Mugenzi two days ago all of the MRND VIPs have a close protection at night at their homes with Interahamwe.  Also pro-MRND gendarme are at the outside of the compounds.  The Interahamwe are provided with arms being kept in the house of the VIP during the day.  The Interahamwe go back to their normal activities during the day." What was Turatsinze describing as the nature of the developing relationship between the Interahamwe and MRND VIPs, please? 
A.	They -- he described, in fact, that for their close protection at night, although there must have been some sentinels before in the compound, there were some Interahamwe people added to this security of these VIPs of the party.  So the link between MRND political wing and Interahamwe as a security wing was expressed there by Jean-Pierre, and the availability of weapons. 
Q.	In the next paragraph you have written:  "The informant said that after the two meetings with the force commander, Dallaire, the attitude of the MRND direction against Belgians has changed.  They are feeling that the, B" -- I assume Belgians, "are not bad intended.  But they have not been able to implement that to their gang." What was this about, please? 
A.	Well, it is, as it states, there had been two meetings with the force commander, and the MRND party leaders.  The concern expressed in this fax of the 10th of January about, maybe, actions on the Belgian troops, and the general feeling that circulated on pamphlets in Kigali against Belgian troops, they had been convinced that they should change their feeling, but this was not really done until yet or implemented until yet to the subordinates. 
Q.	The next paragraph appears to be an enquiry from Turatsinze.  You have written:  "He was informing what our attitude would be in case of an armed attack of one of the parties, RGF, RPF; how would we react to an indiscriminant killing?  Are you going to fight??" -- double question mark.  "He sketched again that action of 20 minutes in the middle of the night."  Pausing there; the word "indiscriminate" referring to indiscriminate killing, where did that word come from? 
A.	These were the words of Jean-Pierre Turatsinze. 
Q.	What was he sketching again was the action of 20 minutes in the middle of the night? 
A.	He referred to his first disclosure of the 10th of January where he depicted a scenario of their capability. 
Q.	Which was -- 
A.	About killing 1,000 Tutsi in 20 minutes. 
Q.	Were you able to answer the question, "Are you going to fight?" 
A.	We explained to him that we were ruled by the rules of engagement (French spoken).  And the rules of engagement were stipulating that we would only use our arms in self-defence or to defend protected people. 
Q.	What sort of people were protected people? 
A.	UNAMIR was in charge of giving escorts to a certain number of people since the beginning of the mission.  And then afterwards, some other requesting person, persons in Kigali got also UNAMIR protection.  It was the case of the prime minister, Ms. Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  I remember also that the president of the courts was -- got protection later.  And, of course, on request some convoys of RPF going through Kigali to meetings or leaving or coming back to Kigali were escorted by UNAMIR.  So, if these people would be attacked, they were supposed to react. 
Q.	In the next paragraph you have written:  "He came back on the incident of 5 January.  He was told that a colonel conducted a bus with the PL members to the CND.  That they considered that as an involvement in the internal affairs of the country by protecting opposition members." What sort of colonel did he think had been in the bus with the PL deputies? 
A.	I think he referred to a bus with PL members that was conducted by somebody, and that it could have been somebody from UNAMIR.  But to my knowledge, nobody of UNAMIR was involved in driving a bus or a mini-bus with party members or deputies going to the CND. 
Q.	As part of his enquiry of UNAMIR, "are you going to fight" was he enquiring whether UNAMIR were going to protect the opposition members. 
A.	He didn't asked this question in those words, but it was obvious that UNAMIR was also in charge of the co-organisation of the installation ceremonies of the new government.  There was, therefore, permanently a Tunisian size platoon at the CND building. 
Q.	Finally, your note concludes:  "He informed also about New York decision in the matter of his protection." Does that mean he was informed of a New York decision, or that he was telling you about it? 
A.	He was asking for information as this was already the fixed meeting, we had already said to him that we had no solution for the moment. 
Q.	Was the question of his becoming a protected person still open and unresolved, or had he been told that he would not be protected?  The date of this document is the 20th of January.  What was the position at that stage? 
A.	The position at that stage from New York was that no action for protection was to be taken by the UN, that the other nations had to go back to their capitols for more guidance; and until then, there was no answer from whomever. 
Q.	No answer from whoever, on the 20th of January did that mean Turatsinze was being told he could not receive protection, or was he being told the question is still as yet unresolved in relation to other countries, not UNAMIR, protecting him? 
A.	I think we put it very vaguely to him in saying that we were still looking for a solution. 
Q.	And then, of course, we look at the last part of this note, having discussed protection it reads:  "He asked for advice about arms distribution, let it be done or should he asked to have his stock of weapons back?" What discussion followed there, please? 
A.	As I stated in the beginning of our meeting, he had been, as we understood it, forced to distribute nine more weapons with ammunition.  In previous meetings, he had said that he was able -- or the distribution or the recalling of weapons could be on his orders.  So, he asked us if we were giving him any directives in this matter. 
Q.	Were you able to give him any directives? 
A.	We asked him to try to be very slow in the distribution if he was ordered to, and to try to find whatever excuse not to do it. 
Q.	This note is the 20th of January, weapons had been observed at the MRND building on the              12th of January and three weapons locations identified on the 13th of January; one week later, why no raids, why no seizure of these weapons? 
A.	Again, the Kigali weapon secure area way of operating was to catch weapons if they were circulated.  So when vehicles were checked at the road, or at check points, or at roadblocks the UNAMIR mandate did not tell us to do a cordon and search operation.  And New York had been very clear in its answer to both Booh-Booh and Dallaire; although the military were happy -- or would have been happy to do it. 
Q.	Did the information you received from Turatsinze ever get any better than the information in that early part of January, describing there being 135 weapons yet for distribution, and the 8th of January demonstration potential and the capability of the Interahamwe in killing 1,000 Tutsi in 20 minutes? 
A.	No, it was clear that these early meetings give us, apparently, all of the details he was able to give us? 
Q.	Did you see him on other occasions after the 20th of January? 
A.	Indeed, I, at least got to see him back two days later to hand over the tape we had seen in the residence of the force commander.  And I saw him quite often on certain -- certain occasions during the month of February. 
Q.	On every occasion that you saw him, did you prepare a written report or not; can you remember? 
A.	To my recollection I have made up a report each time after a meeting. 
Q.	Do you know what -- 
A.	I had to make a report as I had to each time to ask authorisation from the force commander to meet the informant; although, he had been instructed not to keep contact with him by New York. 
Q.	Pausing there:  Who instructed Dallaire not to keep contact with Turatsinze; do you know? 
A.	I haven't seen the written instruction from New York. 
Q.	How did you learn New York had instructed Dallaire not to keep contact with Turatsinze? 
A.	From General Dallaire and Colonel Marchal themselves, they said to me we can't keep or stay in touch with him as we can't provide him any guarantee for his safety. 
Q.	When was the last time that you saw Turatsinze, as best as you can recall? 
A.	To my recollection it was somewhere in the second half of the month of February. 
Q.	Do you -- 
A.	(Inaudible)
Q.	Do you know what has happened to any other reports after the 20th of January of 1994 that you may have prepared in relation to meeting Turatsinze? 
A.	I have no idea, but they must be in the computer that was in my office or somewhere available in the historical files of this mission. 
Q.	If we look at document number 20, on page 25 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, how much longer are you going to be with this witness? 
MR. MORLEY:
Probably another hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe this might be a convenient time to --
MR. MORLEY:
I was simply going to knock on the head two documents to get them out of the way before this session.  Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	If we look at page 25 of the bundle, this is a document from, it appears yourself, dated the                10th of February of 1994, "Report on Meeting With Informant", looking at that document, is that informant Turatsinze or somebody else? 
A.	It is still Jean-Pierre Turatsinze which we are meeting there. 
Q.	And turning to page 27, a document dated the 17th of February of 1994 to Dallaire, apparently, from yourself, copied to Captain Deme, "Complimentary Information" it is referred to, is that a document in relation to information from Turatsinze or from somebody else? 
A.	To my knowledge, this is also from Jean-Pierre Turatsinze. 
MR. MORLEY:
That's a convenient moment.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take our luncheon break now for approximately 90 minutes, and then we'll resume.  
(Court recessed at 1232H)
(Pages 14 to 31 by Donna M. Lewis)
































(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honours' leave, if I may continue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Colonel, looking at the document on page 25 of the bundle, you told us before lunch that this is a further report from you to Dallaire in respect of information from Turatsinze.  In summary, at paragraph one, is there reference to how an Interahamwe had been caught drunk, firing into the air with his weapon, and how there had then been intervention by Turatsinze and the chief of staff of the gendarmerie so that the weapon had been returned to the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, I remember about that. 
Q.	What did you make of Turatsinze saying to you he and the chief of staff of the gendarmerie had secured the return of the weapon to the Interahamwe? 
A.	There, again, he was stating that he had close interaction from his position to the Rwandese governmental forces where the gendarmerie was part of. 
Q.	Should the weapon have been returned to the Interahamwe under the Kigali weapons secure area protocol? 
A.	Yes, it is true, and it happened also on other occasions, where at checkpoints individuals, through intervention of some authorities, weapons had to be handed over, back to them. 
Q.	Thank you.  It may have been my question was clumsy.  If a weapon had been seized, should it have been returned to members of the Interahamwe, or should it have been confiscated by the authorities? 
A.	To my understanding, the weapon could have been handed back to the gendarmerie or the RGF, but not to Interahamwe. 
Q.	What did you make of information from Turatsinze that the chief of staff of the gendarmerie agreed to hand back a weapon to a member of the Interahamwe? 
A.	We couldn't make a lot of this information -- out of this information because then we had to go and cross-check towards this individual, and this meant that we had to do actions that were beyond our mandate.  
Q.	Did the act of returning a weapon to the Interahamwe by the gendarmerie suggest anything to you about the relationship between the Interahamwe and the gendarmerie? 
A.	Indeed, it suggested that there was a relationship and that the gendarmerie was also involved in the Interahamwe way of operating. 
Q.	There is further reference in that paragraph to a gun being seized from an Interahamwe member at Butamwa, and it suggests at the bottom of the paragraph, Turatsinze says, "As Interahamwe wants to recover the weapon, they are planning a raid on the communal office of Butamwa on the night of Friday, Saturday, or Sunday."  

Did Turatsinze tell you that? 
A.	Yes, this were information that we got through Jean-Pierre Turatsinze. 
Q.	Were you able to do anything about the proposed raid on the communal office to recover a weapon? 
A.	No, we didn't manage to do anything in this matter.  And, to my knowledge, there was no raid finally on the communal office of Butamwa. 
MR. MORLEY:
To assist the stenographers, "Butamwa" is B-U-T-A-M-W-A.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Where there is reference to the communal office, what sort of office is that? 
A.	In the -- to -- to my recollection, the préfecture of Kigali was divided in different sous-préfectures or communes, where there was also an administrative head office.  And, to my recollection, in some of these communal offices, there was a kind of police station and also a jail.  So there were also some judiciary authorities who held office there. 
Q.	What did you make of Turatsinze saying, "The Interahamwe were planning on Friday or Saturday or Sunday to raid a communal office with a police presence," as I think you just described it, "to recover a weapon"? 
A.	I don't think they were intending to be assisted by the police services.  The only thing they -- they were able to do it on their own.  That was my understanding of it. 
Q.	Did you understand from Turatsinze there would be a fight between the Interahamwe and the police, or did you understand the recovery of the weapon would not require fighting? 
A.	It could require us -- the word "raid" was used by us afterwards -- some violence.  But I'm not sure that it would be against any forces present there. 
Q.	In paragraph two Turatsinze appears to give the -- the information that "A hundred and twenty two Interahamwe were trained by Israel people in the forest of Nyungwe and Gishwati --" spelled N-Y-U-N-G-W-E and G-I-S-H-W-A-T-I -- and it goes on to say, "Four died already in different incidents, or due to the war; three died by AIDS; and two are in France for studies."  

The figures, please, came from who? 
A.	The figures and the locations came from Jean-Pierre. 
Q.	In paragraph three there is reference to a grenade attack at Kigali secteur HQ.  Is that an attack on anything to do with UNAMIR? 
A.	Yes, indeed, it was on the headquarters of the Kigali secteur where Colonel Marchal held office. 
Q.	Do you recall this incident yourself? 
A.	Absolutely. 
Q.	What had happened? 
A.	I'm not sure about the dates, but at the end of January, beginning of February, during the nights there were a lot of grenades exploding all over Kigali, with no apparent reason or explanation.  And one day, in the garden of the compound of the secteur headquarters, a grenade was thrown and exploded without any injury to anybody within the compound.  It seemed to be intimidation and trying to bring a feeling of insecurity throughout Kigali. 
Q.	You have recorded Turatsinze as identifying the grenade thrower as a Mr. Muhutu, M-U-H-U-T-U, working at Electrogaz and belonging to the CDR.  Did he give you that information? 
A.	Yes.  This information came from Jean-Pierre. 
Q.	The reason for the attack you've recorded, as being explained by Turatsinze, is it was to intimidate the Belgians after the incident with the CDR political advisor at the ministry of foreign affairs.  What was that about?  Can you help us? 
A.	I can't help you with recollection on that incident. 
Q.	In paragraph five now on page 26, Turatsinze refers to a grenade attack on a Major Kamanzi, K-A-M-A-N-Z-I, brackets, RPF LO.  

What does "LO" stand for? 
A.	Major Kamanzi was one of the RPF liaison officers to the UNAMIR headquarters. 
Q.	What was his function as a liaison officer to the UNAMIR headquarters? 
A.	Both parties, the Rwandese governmental forces and the RPF, had liaison officers that were supposed to facilitate the communications between the headquarters of UNAMIR and their forces they were representing. 
Q.	The information you've recorded from Turatsinze says that that attack on Major Kamanzi was on the 29th of January of 1994 and that it was commended and executed by the MRND. 

Did Turatsinze say that the MRND were responsible for that attack? 
A.	Yes, that were his words. 
Q.	There is reference in the same paragraph as follows:  "The place where the attack happened was in front of the house of the chef de cellule, MRND in Kacyiru --" spelled K-A-C-Y-I-R-U -- "the man works at the social security in the buildings of the ministry of justice in the ministry area in Kacyiru."  Pausing there.  

Who works at the social security?  Is it Major Kamanzi or the chef de cellule of the MRND? 
A.	It should be clear that it was the chef de cellule of this part of Kigali. 
Q.	It says further, "He is supposed to have at least 60 weapons in his compound."  
Who's "he"?  Is it Major Kamanzi or is it the chef de cellule of the MRND in Kacyiru? 
A.	It is, again, the men working at the social security, so the chef de cellule of the MRND in Kacyiru. 
Q.	In paragraph six you've recorded, "Our informant, Turatsinze, said that he was threatened by Colonel Ntiwiragaba --" N-T-I-W-I-R-A-G-A-B-A -- brackets, "G2 RGF."  

What does "G2" mean? 
A.	In the staff positions of an headquarter, you have different numbers.  G1 is a personal officer, and G2 is normally the person in charge of security and intelligence.  G3 is operations.  G4 is for logistics, and it goes on. 
Q.	Turatsinze seems to say that colonel -- "The colonel accused him having voluntarily scheduled to less attacks on Tutsi people before Interahamwe decided to reduce their actions." 

Pausing there, it may be, Colonel, that when a captain in your heyday, 12 years ago -- your English has since improved enormously -- can you help us with what "The colonel accuses Turatsinze having voluntarily scheduled to less attacks on Tutsi people," what is that?  Can you remember what that's a reference to? 
A.	That they schedule not enough attacks.  He was supposed to organise more attacks, and he didn't do that. 
Q.	I think in paragraph seven there's reference to how Turatsinze is planning to go on a two-month training period to be confirmed.  No details as yet -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- and what sort of training did you understand?  Was it in computers?  Was it in cars?  Was it in something else? 
A.	As he told us that he was going to the village where President Mobutu of, in that time, still Zaire, Republic of Zaire, Ngabadolite, there where the president had kind of presidential palace, and this was in the north province of -- of Congo, not far from a commando training centre, which was held in Kotakoli.  This commando training centre could be -- have been a place where he would had to (unintelligible), kind of international airport, reserved for the president, so all kind of airplanes could land there.  And from there it was easy then to go to other places in that part of Congo, now Congo, then Zaire. 
Q.	Thank you.  I seem to have stumbled on to something.  
MR. MORLEY:
Ngabadolite is spelled, to assist the stenographers, N-G-A-B-A-D-O-L-I-T-E. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What sort of training would you expect him to be undergoing over two months in that place, in that area? 
A.	My assumption was that, if he went into that neighbourhood and also to Kotakoli, it would be for an extra commando training, close combat, rock climbing, discipline, and these kind of activities. 
Q.	Is this an area you are familiar with? 
A.	I've never been there, but to -- the training centre is quite a copy of the training centre that existed in Bigogwe in Rwanda.  Both have been installed and occupied by military -- Belgium military cooperation in the past. 
Q.	Thank you.  Just to complete matters, can you help with some spelling?  What is the name of the place near Ngabadolite that you mentioned, and can you spell it, please? 
A.	Kotakoli, K-O-T-A-K-O-L-I, Kotakoli. 
Q.	Thank you.  If we turn the page to the document at page 27, you told us before lunch this was another report on information from Turatsinze for Dallaire from you dated the 17th of February of 1994.  And does this report refer, in brief, to the existence of a death escadron?  
A.	Can you repeat the question?  I was reading the paragraph. 
Q.	Is this a report referring to something which appears in the first paragraph in the second sentence, in inverted commas, called a death escadron? 
A.	Yes, it is referring to the name circulating about death squadrons. 
Q.	Is there reference to Turatsinze saying there is a plan to conduct sabotage in the Chez Lando hotel and murder Mr. Lando and the president of the constitutional court? 
A.	Yes, that is what is mentioned in this paragraph, and those were his words. 
Q.	At paragraph three does Mr. Turatsinze say that the death squad is headed by Mr. Zigiranyirazo, Protais, the brother-in-law of the president of the republic? 
A.	Yes, it is what he said.
MR. MORLEY:
To help those stenographying (sic), Z-I-G-I-R-A-N-Y-I-R-A-Z-O, first name Protais, P-R-O-T-A-I-S.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Were you able to take any action in respect of information about the existence of a death squad being run by President Habyarimana's brother-in-law? 
A.	We didn't take any real action against these people, but at the same moment, as stated before, those two persons asked themself for protection from UNAMIR.  Mr. Lando -- Landouald Kazinga and Mr. Joseph Kavaruganda had already some close protection of those days, or had asked for it and got it through UNAMIR. 
Q.	Thank you.  Lando -- A-L-D-O -- A-L -- stop -- L-A-N-D-O.  

	And Kavaruganda, was he the president of the constitutional court? 
A.	Yes.  And to illustrate the way that Mr. Kavaruganda asked this protection, he had been studying in Belgium, so he knew some Flemish.  And he had contacted the Belgian authorities in Kinshasa -- in Kigali, sorry, and spoken in Dutch about the threaten -- of the feeling of threatening he had at that time to be sure he was speaking with Belgians and with nobody else. 
Q.	Spelling K-A-V-A-R-U-G-A-N-D-A.  

What did it tell you that Turatsinze was able to give you information about an apparent death squad being run by the brother-in-law of the -- of President Habyarimana? 
A.	They said to me that the rumours that we had heard about a death squadron -- and in those days different Belgian journalists were also in Kigali and had written articles in magazines about the inner circle of a subversive organisation and had also written about the death squadron.  So he'd said to us that the -- exists something like that in reality and that Jean-Pierre was aware of it through his place in the organisation of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And what did it tell you was the level of his place within the Interahamwe organisation that he would be able to offer you information about the activities of the brother-in-law of President Habyarimana? 
A.	It was stating, or confirming, the initial information that he had close contacts, being former security member of the president, and that he had access to the highest level within the party and with the president. 
Q.	Can I ask you now to look at a document, which appears on page 28.  There is a fiche de transmission, marked 2FC, dated the 23rd of February of 1994, with a short note, one regards, and there is the name -- am I right in reading Deme, D-E-M-E?  Is that right? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And two, also now included in this text, the information of training camps, exclamation mark, with a signature after it.  Whose signature is that? 
A.	This is my signature. 
Q.	If we turn the page to the document appended to that routing slip, there is a handwritten note which runs to nine pages.  What is this? 
A.	This is information that was brought in -- in notes, in handwriting, by other informants on a certain day and that -- well, we spoke about with the force commander, and he asked us to forward it.  So we copied it and sent it with a message and transmission slip for his assessment. 
Q.	Do I understand from your answer that this is the handwriting of an informant rather than of you or Captain Deme? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  It's not our handwriting, it's the handwriting of an informant. 
Q.	Can I take your attention to page 2 of the handwriting, bottom of the page.  There is some French there in the informant's handwriting, which you'll forgive me for reading in my poor schoolboy French -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Before you do that -- 

Mr. President, I have an objection to the contents of this document.  I don't believe that this meets the threshold of reliability for admission, and, therefore, it shouldn't be -- the contents of it shouldn't be made known to the Trial Chamber.  And we have basically some notes of an unidentified informant, who this witness apparently never met, simply forwarded to General Dallaire, and I think that's the -- the kind of hearsay that even at this Tribunal can't be admitted because of no probative value or reliability. 
MR. MORLEY:
The document went through the military information officer's hands.  My learned friend makes a reasonable point when he says that this is hearsay.  However, it is a species of real evidence in the sense that it is an original note on the evidence of the handwriting of an informant offering a piece of information, the weight of which is a matter for Your Honours.  But its admissibility, I respectfully submit, is plain.  Its reliability is another matter.  

And Your Honours, I know, in this environment are used to receiving documents and appending different amounts of weight to them.  What is interesting about the short paragraph that I propose to invite the witness to look at is it refers to a decision, allegedly, by the president of the MRND to invite the Interahamwe to stop wearing their uniforms.  That is not inconsistent with what Turatsinze had said about the demonstration of the 8th of January where, Your Honours will recall the evidence from the witness, Colonel Claeys, is that on that day people were not in uniform either.  

So in terms of its weight, it may have a weight.  It seems consistent with other evidence.  It's a matter for Your Honours.  I respectfully submit it's plainly admissible, as the document went through this witness's hands as part of his duties as the military information officer.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, anything that goes through a witness's hands, if that becomes admissible at this Tribunal, then I think that we have actually no standard whatsoever for reliability.  He could have read scandal sheets.  He could have read information from all kinds of unreliable people.  Just because it came through his hands means nothing other than the document itself that's before us is something that he recognizes.  But it says nothing about the reliability or probative value of the underlying information.  And I don't think on this record you could even come close to admitting a document such as this, which is anonymous and unverified. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I join my learned friend in the objection.  And let me add that there are several handwritten documents which have passed through Colonel Claeys's hands and would have been necessary that the probative value that my learned friend, Morley, is attributing to this one, which he took from many other documents, that the entire document be given to us.  That is not the case.  And this document, which may have come from an informant, does not bear the name of the person.  Perhaps it has been redacted.  So the reason why they are trying to put this document in, for me, is quite biased, and I think you should sustain our objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We think the document can be used to refresh the witness's memory about information he received.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The section which I invite your attention to appears on page 30 at the bottom of the page, and it is in the following terms -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  This isn't the way you refresh a witness's recollection.  I think that the witness should be shown the document.  First, I think he should be asked whether or not he has any recollection of what the -- independent of this document, of what this informant reported concerning uniforms.  If he does have some recollection, he can give that recollection.  If he doesn't, his attention can be drawn to the document, and which he can read it silently.  And then he can tell us, having had his recollection refreshed, what he recalls.  But there's no reference to the document to be made to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, may I say I'm perfectly agreeable with that approach, but I would ask that Mr. Robinson remembers what he said, for I imagine there will be occasions when he will use documents in a different way himself.  

And I see him nodding now, and maybe these words will come back to haunt him.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	However, perhaps, Colonel, could you have a look at the -- it's the bottom of what is page 30 of the bundle, and it's simply the section which begins "Le décision".  And can you tell us whether you have seen that section in your duties as military information officer?  If it causes your memory to recollect anything about Interahamwe uniforms, what observation can you make? 
A.	Concerning this -- excuse me.  Concerning this document, of course, when I put the transmission slip to it, I had read it.  I had briefed the force commander about it.  And on his request, you will see that there was written on the transmission slip that it was as requested.  We transmitted this information for his assessment, and we made -- or, we made the connection with some sayings of Jean-Pierre, that on this demonstration in January, Interahamwe were not wearing any uniforms or distinctive clothing, which happened to be the case at the political rally that were -- was held a week later in the Nyamirambo stadium, so that there was an explanation on which occasion they should or should not wear this clothing.  
Q.	And what was the information you'd received from a separate source, other than Turatsinze, that appears at the bottom of page 30 of the bundle? 
A.	So that these directives were given by the president of the party to make it difficult to trace eventual perpetrators of violence during demonstrations and eventually blame somebody else, or other organised movements than the Interahamwe.  
There was also mentioned in this paragraph something about the CDR, which was also mentioned before today, and where Jean-Pierre stated that at a certain moment that CDR youngsters, he gave the number of 300, were sent outside Kigali for extra training.  So this was another link to a -- maybe making difficult tracing perpetrators. 
Q.	In February of 1994, did you ever encounter any bodies on the street? 
A.	Yes, indeed, at night, of course.  
Q.	How many, and how is it that you came to find them? 
A.	As I often was driving around at night with my UN vehicle, after messages coming from places where apparently there had been trouble, small riots, I have been halted three times by the gendarmerie, requesting to load a dead body and bring it to the mortuary of the Kigali central hospital.  
Q.	Did you leave Rwanda toward the end of March of 1994 to go on leave? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  I left Kigali on the 29th of March with the airplane that left with the last members of the first Belgian contingent in Kigali.  The battalion had been relieved and placed (sic) at that time by a French-speaking battalion.  
Q.	My apologies.  Coming back to the bodies, were you able to determine what ethnicity the bodies were that you collected and brought to the mortuary? 
A.	No, I didn't make any attention to this origin. 
Q.	Having left on the 29th of March, did you attempt to land back in Rwanda on the 6th of April of 1994 in a Belgian army airplane? 
A.	I was, indeed, in the airplane on the evening of the 6th of April that didn't succeed to land in Kigali. 
Q.	And why not? 
A.	The -- the airport had been closed, and we -- there was no illumination on the airport, and we didn't get any authorisation to land. 
Q.	And what had happened that you now know about which meant you couldn't land?  
A.	So we did some standby above Kigali during half an hour, maybe one hour, and then were diverted to Nairobi, spent the night in a hotel in Nairobi, where we found out on CNN that the presidential aircraft had been shot down and that there were no survivors.
Q.	Did you land back in Rwanda on around the 9th of April of 1994? 
A.	Yes, I did.  
Q.	What had happened to members of the Belgian contingent between the time you were circling the airport above the wreckage of the president's plane and the time that you landed three days later on the 9th of April? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'd like to call the Trial Chamber's attention to the witness summary that was received for this witness from the Prosecutor and next to the pre-trial brief.  It's about a half a page long, and it makes no reference whatsoever to any testimony about events after the 6th of April from this witness.  We've had no notice that such testimony would be elicited, and I object to it. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, that's not strictly right.  There are a whole variety of statements.  There are transcripts of evidence in two previous cases.  This particular section of the witness's testimony is, arguably, quite unproblematic.  It simply rounds off his stay in Rwanda.  

To assist Your Honours, he arrives on the 9th, and he's gone again around the 16th.  So it brings, as it were, the testimony of Colonel Claeys to a neat end in that it tells Your Honours the end of his story.  My learned friend knows what it is he would say because I have no doubt Mr. Robinson, being as thorough as he always is, he's read everything.  But to simply point to what is a short summary as part of the pre-trial brief and say that and no more so that the end of the story over the next ten minutes cannot be offered, is, I respectfully submit, perhaps overly technical.  

If the situation was I was about to embark on a traunche of new evidence, which is directly relevant to Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera, that would be different.  But I'm not.  I'm simply bringing his story to an end.  And this, I respectfully submit, is a technical objection.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, the question related, I believe, to the murder of the Belgian soldiers.  Now, if -- if the whole issue is being opened up simply to round off his testimony, it seems a very small reed of admissibility that we're rounding off testimony.  I think if the witness wants to say that he left Rwanda on the 16th of April, he can do that without referring to any acts which are not in his witness statement.  So I don't believe that the reasons advanced by Mr. Morley, that he's simply trying to round off the testimony, justifies the admission of evidence which we have not had notice of.  

And I think Mr. Morley knows well enough that the jurisprudence is that witness statements, prior testimony, and the like do not provide adequate notice of what will be offered at the trial, and that the Defence is not expected to be prepared for anything a witness has ever said in any statement or testimony, but the -- the testimony that we're expected to meet is that which is focussed by the notice we receive in the pre-trial brief and the opening statement and the indictment.  

Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours, I respectfully submit, listening to what Mr. Robinson was saying there, I was puzzled.  We all know ten Belgian soldiers, unhappily, died sometime on the 6th or the 7th of April.  We all know that, as a consequence of that, the Belgian contingent ceased to be part of UNAMIR, and we all know that there was an extraction of expatriates and the Belgians with the expatriates and some others left.  And that's the end of the story.  

And I respectfully submit that submissions of this nature, suggesting that Mr. Robinson doesn't know what material is coming from the witness, I put it neutrally, is wrong.  I could use more colourful language.  To say that the short summary in the pre-trial brief is the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...Mr. Morley, I think we have heard your submission.  You can continue.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have decided to allow the testimony, as it is relevant, and the summary that Mr. Morley has given of information he intends to elicit, we think it's acceptable for it to be addressed by this witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I've already summarised it.  Is it right that the ten Belgians, unfortunately, had died on around the 7th of April at a time you were out of the country? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	As a result of their deaths, was a decision taken for the Belgian contingent to come out of UNAMIR? 
A.	This was indeed the reaction from the Belgian authorities. 
Q.	Was there an extraction of foreign nationals out of Rwanda with the assistance of the Belgian contingent? 
A.	There was a separate Belgian contingent sent to Rwanda, to Nairobi, that landed and that assisted in the extraction of expatriates. 
Q.	And when was it that you, yourself, left Rwanda, having arrived back on the 9th of April? 
A.	I must have left around the 15th or 16th of April.  So I stayed for another week on Kanombe airport. 
Q.	From Kanombe airport did you -- were you posted anywhere else in Kigali, or were you posted at the airport? 
A.	The operations centre for the extraction mission done by the Belgian contingent, not being UNAMIR, was posted on the first floor of the Kanombe international airport. 
Q.	Just so it helps Their Honours, is that where you were posted, at the airport, rather than wandering around Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I was posted there on the terrace (sic).  
Q.	Turning, finally, to Turatsinze, in light of what you know happened in Rwanda after the 6th of April of 1994; in light of your meeting Turatsinze and having met him, you've told us, about ten times; in light of the military information you were able to garner here and there, did you believe what you were being told by him? 
A.	Yes.  At that moment there was no doubt anymore about the facts and figures he had given.

MR. MORLEY:
I hope that helps Your Honours.  I have brought my examination-in-chief now to an end in respect of this witness.  And I'm wondering whether Your Honours would like to take the 3:30 break 15 minutes early or whether we should just proceed, as Your Honours may wish, with the cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you join in the Prosecution application, or are you chomping at the bit? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, this is Ms. Hounkpatin's cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...oh, sorry.  I thought you said you were going to cross-examine first.  
MR. ROBINSON, 
No, I'm actually doing it last. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, do you join in Mr. Morley's application, or are you -- Mr. Morley's application, or are you chomping at the bit and ready to start? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes.  Traditionally it is my learned friend, Counsel Robinson, who begins, but I see no difficulty in -- either in my beginning it either now or later.  

There is one small anxiety:  If we take the break now, I am under the impression that the exhibits I'd like to use are not -- have not yet been handed to the -- all the parties.  So maybe that break could be put to good use for that purpose.  Otherwise, I'm ready to begin, if you wish, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Under those circumstances we take our midafternoon recess now, still about 15 minutes. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I mention, just to close off the examination -- the examination-in-chief, that the various documents referred to, up to page 37, at the conclusion of testimony, I'll have an application to put it in evidence?  I can do it now, if necessary, but I'm simply putting Your Honours on notice that, although the first two documents are already exhibits, the remainder will be applications from the Prosecution to have exhibited as part of this witness's testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We take our midafternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1518H) 
(Pages 32 to 43 by Ann Burum)




(Court resumed at 1545H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, are you ready now?  You may -- you may commence your cross-examination.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I am quite ready, Mr. President, but my apologies to the Trial Chamber and the Prosecution bench for the fact that my documents in hard copy are not available.  Seemingly, the electronic formats have been received.  

And let me avail myself of this opportunity to sort of complain about the working resources of the Defence team.  You see, we are so many Defence teams, and we have only one photocopy machine.  Now, the sorting mechanism of the photocopy machine is just down.  When you have one piece of paper to photocopy, then it's fine.  When you have more than ten pages, it becomes a whole lot of a problem.  That is why today we are starting other cross-examination in a situation where I'm not quite easy with my working method at all. 

Anyway, thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Colonel Claeys.  I am Chantal Hounkpatin, counsel for the Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and I am of the Paris bar.  I am going to start your cross-examination after your examination-in-chief conducted by my colleague Iain Morley. 

First of all, you said yesterday in your introduction that you were born in the Congo, that you lived there up until the age of 18, when you joined the army.  First question:  Were you born in the former Belgian Congo or in Congo, Brazzaville?  
A.	I was born in Kinshasa, Congo, known as Congo Belge. 
Q.	Were you born in the Belgian Congo before or after independence? 
A.	I was born in November '59, so that was almost eight months before the independence of Congo. 
Q.	Very well.  But your parents opted to remain there for 18 more years, or at least you, you spent your childhood and adolescence there.  It was while you were already an adult that you left that country.  Am I right? 
A.	I spent, indeed, my youth and my education in Congo, that became Zaire at a certain point, but I was still not an adult when I left, because in Belgium in those days you had to be 21 to be an adult. 
Q.	That is true.  At the time it was 21, and it was in the 1970s that even European countries decided to bring down the age required for one to be an adult to 18 years. 

So at the age of 18 you left to join the army.  I am going to put a two-pronged question to you.  Firstly, why did you choose the army, and secondly, what was your subsequent training?  
A.	My main concern to join the armed forces was to be able to lead men and have the opportunity, as I experienced it as a youngster, to bring military cooperation in one of the former colonies of Belgium, which was still ongoing at the time when I intended to start military academy in two of the three countries where Belgium was contributing.  My education was, in the first five years, the basic officers' academical training, and then spent ten years in armoured infantry in Germany where Belgium was part of the NATO forces. 
Q.	Very well.  Did your family have a military tradition?  
A.	There has been a military tradition, but not my father.  My father was not a military.  
Q.	So who of your close relatives was a soldier?  That is, apart from your father, who was not a soldier, there was perhaps a close relative who made you want to join the army.  
A.	Those who had been in military before, I never met them.  They were killed during World War II or died after World War II before I was born.  Both my grandfathers had participated in World War II, and before that, there were also ancestors having been part of the military over the Belgian history. 
Q.	Thank you.  So when you left Congo, Kinshasa, at the age of 18, during your training, how often did you go back to Congo or how often did you visit any other African country?  And I'm referring to the time when you were undergoing your training.  
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...referring to whatever country during my academic education in the military academy. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, perhaps we need to advise the witness to wait for the English interpretation before he starts giving his answer.  Thank you.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	So not even for any pleasure trip, that is, for you to return to the country of your childhood?  You didn't go back there? 
A.	The period I returned to Congo was before the military academy.  And then only years later when I was already posted in Germany, I went on visit with my wife to my parents', who were still living in Kinshasa. 
Q.	During that period, during those years, were you able to be familiar with Rwanda, given that Congo, Kinshasa and Rwanda shared a border? 
A.	During my youth in Congo I had the opportunity to visit the national parks in the eastern part of the country but never crossed the border to Rwanda, so I hadn't been in contact with Rwanda, as such. 
Q.	Congo are Rwanda -- Congo and Rwanda are in the eastern part of Africa.  Were you able to familiarise yourselves with other countries of this fairly vast continent?  
A.	In the same period of my -- my raising up in Congo, I know I went through Angola, but that was in the early '60s as a baby, shortly after independence of Congo.  And we did some stopovers with the cargo boats that brought some holidays back to Belgium, so we had visited -- but I was very young -- Lobito kind of harbour in Angola, and also Abidjan, being a harbour, on the way back to Belgium, but not just -- more than a one-day visit. 
Q.	Very well.  Let us now look at your years as a soldier.  Can you tell us how many missions, like the one which you carried out in Rwanda, did you undertake before you went to Rwanda? 
A.	None of them. 
Q.	So your Rwandan experience was indeed your maiden experience.  Yesterday in chief you mentioned -- in any case, my learned friend Morley told us of your experience in Somalia.  Was it your experience or was it the experience of the Belgian army? 
A.	It is indeed the experience of Belgium in Somalia but not my personal experience. 
Q.	So you were not a member of the Belgian contingent which went to Somalia? 
A.	At no point in time. 
Q.	When did you know that you would be a member of the mission sent to Rwanda -- or let me rephrase my question -- was it a week before, 48 hours before?  Could you give me some time frames in that connection? 
A.	It might be strange, but the notice to travel to Rwanda was given 12 hours before.  
Q.	You were being sent on a reconnaissance mission of such an importance and you're made aware 
	12 hours before? 
A.	Was this a question?  
Q.	Yes.  Actually, in my sentence I forgot the verb.  

And you were made aware of that only 12 hours before. 
A.	Your Honour, this is part of the military education being adaptive and supple, so if you don't want to travel on short notice, you don't -- don't join the army.  
Q.	Your answer, Colonel, is satisfactory.  I consider it as an answer coming from a soldier.  Thank you, Colonel.  

So, under such conditions, when you were not familiar with Rwanda, how did you prepare yourself to tackle that mission?  
A.	A reconnaissance mission, as the words states for itself, is a reconnaissance to get a feeling on the ground on what you might expect, what you might find, and how to prepare for.  We knew that there was a peace agreement, we got some information, and the rest we had to find it on the ground, with the help of the local authorities.  They were there to help us to understand the problems they were facing and to assist them in the bringing to the final issue of their peace agreement they had signed.  It was a peace assistance mission.  We didn't have to enforce anything.  We were just to facilitate their peace agreement.  
Q.	But in order for me to understand you, I have a question, sir.  For Belgian soldiers, Rwanda -- well, they were not the first contingents going there, so by the time you went there, were there other Belgians there? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...military personnel in Kigali and in other places in Rwanda.  
Q.	Under what circumstances were they present there? 
A.	As stated before, there was a coopération technique militaire, military assistance mission, in Rwanda from Belgium, from France, and, if I am not wrong, also from Germany, helping actively the Rwandese governmental forces in different aspects of the building and the training of their army.  They had also sent people from their country to Belgium to be trained there and being academically trained also. 
Q.	Please tell me why Belgium did not think about assigning the reconnaissance mission to soldiers who were already present in the country? 
A.	To my opinion, this was a complete other story.  They were there to assist, and already for some time the Rwandese governmental forces, what we were doing, was out of their framework, preparing a deployment of Belgium military under UN flag.  They needed accommodation.  They needed storage places.  They needed logistical supplies.  This was to be found out, really, on the spot to feed 340 Belgians, except of the others that should arrive, needed more than just a small staff working at the école militaire or in Kanombe hospital.  They were there on a full-time job.  They hadn't time to do anything else. 
Q.	I have clearly heard your answer, but you are explaining to me that the mission you were assigned with in October 1993 was to handle logistics and the setting up of soldiers.  Am I correct? 
A.	Indeed, this is what I have explained.  It was a fact-finding mission to see what we would need, what we would have to bring from Belgium or from another country and what we would find locally. 
Q.	Fine.  But it would have also been an efficient method to request the Belgian soldiers who are there who knew the lie of the line -- who knew the lie of the land to inform the Belgian state about the arrangements to be made for the contingent which would be dispatched there, unless your mission was different from what you are telling me.  
A.	It doesn't belong to me or to anyone else to rewrite the history, but at that point in time, the Belgian military authorities in the capital had decide to send a fact-finding mission out the coopération technique militaire, and we had been instructed to avoid too much interference with the coopération technique militaire.  So, there was a separate mission, although there were already Belgians.  We could have also asked to the Belgian ambassadors, for example.  No, it was a military mission for the UN and nothing else.  
Q.	Was there a Belgian intelligence unit based in Rwanda at the time? 
A.	I suppose your question is towards the military cooperation, because we were just arriving on the spot. 
Q.	Yes, that is correct.  
A.	I would say that it's not an - the - an open question has an open answer.  Every diplomatic or whatever mission abroad is origin for a change of information of whatever kind.  If you want to call that an intelligence source, I would say no, because, as I declared previously, for intelligence, you need analyses, and analyses are not done without trained people and would probably not have been done there on the spot.  
Q.	And you yourself, did you undergo that training? 
A.	I didn't have any training in that domain at that point.  
Q.	Can you tell me, what were your impressions when you arrived in Kigali on the 26th or 27th?  
A.	I discovered a rather clean town, large avenues, friendly people.  And we were accommodated in the Amahoro stadium -- in a part of the Amahoro stadium, and we felt rather comfortable in doing our reconnaissance and fact-finding missions, assisted by the Rwandese government forces. 
Q.	So, how long did your recce mission or reconnaissance mission last, and were you alone in undertaking that task? 
A.	As I stated before already, Your Honour, that we were with more than myself, because I remained after it with four other persons, and by recollection, we were over ten people to land for this reconnaissance, except of the air force crew that was conducting or piloting the aeroplane that stayed on the ground for the period.  The reconnaissance itself lasted four or five days, to my recollection, and flew back to Belgium around the 1st or 2nd of November, latest. 
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	November, I said.  
Q.	Colonel Claeys, tell me, there were ten of you.  Can you tell me what precisely was the task of each one of the ten people? 
A.	It will be by recollection, but I remember there was a full colonel, head of delegation, which was preparing the reports to be sent out every day to Brussels.  There were at least three communication guys.  And there were people from the general staff with interest in financial issues, how to get money, how to transfer money, what should be paid for renting accommodations, if there would be accommodations to be rent, renting of vehicles.  There were people from logistics interested in what was available to feed or concerning the fuel.  And there were people from the operation branch, which, together with the Rwandese governmental forces, and at that time, if I recall well, colonel (unintelligible) Rwabalinda was already appointed as a liaison officer, brought us to the different barracks within Kigali to show where the different units of the governmental forces were located and how they were installed.  

So we visited a lot of military installations during this period also, independently from logistics and financial matters.  I think there was also somebody from the medical branch present, but I'm not sure about that. 
Q.	You visited, with General Rwalinda (sic), military installations.  Those were not Belgian military installations that were visited.  
A.	Of course not.  It was -- and I recall -- or I will remember it was Lieutenant Colonel Rwabalinda -- I spell:  Romeo-Whiskey-Alpha-Lima - Alpha-Bravo-Alpha-Lima-India-November-Delta-Alpha, Rwabalinda; Ephrem from his Christian name -- who made us visit the Rwandese barracks.  There was no Belgian barracks.  There was a Belgian settlement for the military cooperation mission, but that was not a military installation.  And we were only interested in Kigali, as Belgium had agreed to deploy their forces in Kigali, not elsewhere.  
Q.	So if I correctly understood at that time, you did not only undertake reconnaissance to make it possible for Belgian soldiers to come and install themselves comfortably, is that, reconnaissance work was large -- developed into something larger than that? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...not something we had asked for.  This was organised through the United Nations mission and offered to us by the Rwandese authorities.  
Q.	So the reconnaissance mission lasted about seven days, if my totting up from the 26th to the 1st or 2nd of November is correct.  October has 31 days.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel in an aside.
THE WITNESS:
(Microphones overlapping)...maybe seven days.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	During those six to seven days, did you have the opportunity to have contacts with other Rwandans? 
A.	It must have been the case, but it doesn't ring me a bell if this brought any special attention to us by speaking with the men in the street or with the military in general.  
Q.	In fact, I was putting that question in order to understand how finally you were appointed to stay in UNAMIR.  
A.	This also remains an enigma for me, why I was designated, together with Major Kesteloot, to stay on the ground.  I was part of a reconnaissance party.  My intention was to go back and go on leave on the 3rd of November to the southern part of France with my familiar, and this didn't happen.  I stayed in Rwanda until end of March.  
Q.	During that week of reconnaissance or before, did you try to understand the political situation of the country where you were going to undertake that mission?  
A.	If I would have had the time, probably I would have done it, but with 12 hours of notice to move, you just have the time to pack your luggage, say goodbye, in plane and leave.  There was no Internet at those days available to go over a lot of information in a short time, so I had to rely on the authorities in Rwanda to give us the best possible overview, and the rest was a learning process on the ground. 
Q.	You ended your answer by saying you had to get the information in the field.  How did you go about that learning process and how were you informed of the situation? 
A.	There were different learning processes.  One of them was to be informed by my own authorities, week by week, that I would stay longer until beginning of December, where they decided that I would stay for another six months, which didn't happen.  

The other learning process was just meeting people every day to get a feeling of what was going on in Kigali, was a day-by-day process, open sources, expatriates, Rwandese people, Zairean people living in Kigali, Germans, whatever.  
And then, of course, we got some briefings that had been made by General Dallaire, because he had been appointed before as commander of the observation mission between Rwanda and Uganda and then became finally force commander for the UNAMIR mission.  

So with all these things in mind, we were trying to build a picture, and it was a constant evolution, of what had happened and how we arrived to this peace process agreement signed here in Arusha and what were the next objectives in the peace process that were implemented by a United Nations resolution.  
Q.	I should like to understand, in 12 hours you had to leave, well, that's your profession, but did you, for your own information, have the United Nations Security Council resolution deciding to establish the force?  How, on your own initiative, did you try to understand your mission, the mission so brutally thrust upon you? 
A.	This document was brought to our attention through the UN channels once we came on the ground, and one of the first things we got as information during this reconnaissance mission were the briefings that were given in the office of General Dallaire to the complete reconnaissance party with an overview of -- a short overview of the past wars and what has -- what brought us to this low-budget mission. 
Q.	The answer you have given me leads me to fear that you were not informed and you arrived on completely unknown ground, and even that resolution, which is, in fact, the definition of UNAMIR's mission was not known to you.  
A.	I will not deny that we came on the ground and had to be briefed, so we were there to help in a peace process that was, let's say, a broad mission that would be filled in, and we knew that still on that point even the number of Belgian troops that would contribute to this mission were not defined at that point.  Even in Belgium there was still some discussion about that. 
Q.	You told us, unless I am mistaken, under examination-in-chief, that UNAMIR's mission was to -- also to gather information, and to be able to collect or gather information, it was necessary to know what type of information and why you were asked to collect information.  So before being able to do that, you should have had a thorough knowledge of the situation, or you were going there blindly; is that what you're telling me? 
A.	I can't recall having stated that the mission of UNAMIR was to collect information.  My appointment at a certain point in time became military information officer, and the job description of this position in the headquarters of the force is to provide incoming contingents and staff members with information about ongoing mission and distribution of maps that were provided by Belgium.  So I never stated that the mission of UNAMIR was to collect information.  And to provide this information, of course I had to find traces and some historical facts for others that came into the mission who may be blind or deaf or without any source of information before they were appointed to the post.  

At the same time, all this information was mostly in French, as Rwanda, at that time, was still a French-speaking country, and UNAMIR was an English spoken mission.  So all this information had to be translated before it could be briefed to incoming people.  Also that needed some time. 
Q.	Forgive me for my confusing your mission -- perhaps confusing your mission with that of UNAMIR.  

	In your answer you told me that being a French speaker you were called upon to explain certain historical events, so you had access to documents.  Can you tell us what historical events you're referring to? 
A.	Captain Deme and myself, we depicted the recent history of the wars of 1990, the different offensives that took place and the creation of the DMZ zone démilitarisée between the Rwandese governmental forces and the RPF, how these different front lines changed during the past three years.  We sketched also the existence or the arrival of the multipartyism, and finally, with the available information, we gave also an overview of skirmishes, incidents that happened throughout Rwanda, not only in Kigali, since the beginning of October.  
Q.	That answer is very dense.  First of all, what were the sources to which you had access to undertake that task, because you did not know the political and historic -- historical situation?  So, first of all, I'd like to -- like you to tell me what the sources were.  
A.	To my recollection, the country book was issued by the United Nations with an overview of the major capital episodes in the wars between the Rwandese governmental forces and the FPR.  The other documents and information, we got it from the diplomatic missions on the ground, were sent to us from Belgium; also, we had some telecommunication equipment available.  And for the rest, it was looking for information, open sources, as I said before, which made us able, to the best of your capability, to provide an incoming briefing. 

I remember also that I visited the préfet of Kigali who was working at the primature, if I recall well, which was close to the roundabout of the Méridien, gave also some information about Kigali in general.  
Q.	Did you ever seek information in the demilitarised zone under RPF control in order to carry out your information-gathering activity? 
A.	I went to the DMZ but never in the beginning of the mission.  It was only at a certain point that 
	General Dallaire went there with a helicopter and that I was able to go with him and visit some places in the DMZ.  At certain points in the deployment of other contingents from the UN, I visited some places close to the DMZ, as Byumba, Ruhengeri, but not in the beginning of the mission, not in the beginning of my stay in Kigali or Rwanda.  
Q.	I didn't quite understand you.  Did you do it at the start of your stay, that is, in the month of October?  About what time, then, did you do it? 
A.	I can't give you a precise date about that.  It was not in October, certainly, because there was the reconnaissance mission.  So it must have been somewhere in November, maybe December, or even after new year. 
Q.	According to the layout of the zones at the time, I think there was two distinct zones:  the demilitarised zone and the RPF-controlled zone.  Did you have access to that zone? 
A.	Yes, I've been certainly to one area of the zone d'occupation RPF, because I visited Mulindi with General Dallaire at a certain point.  That is the only place I can recollect to have been visiting and where the RPF was in control. 
Q.	Did you visit that place in October, November, December?  At what time? 
A.	To my recollection, it must have been before the operation clean corridor, which was the operation named for bringing in the RPF battalion to Kigali and install it in the CND compounds.  So, that was around half December, so it must be the week before, I think.  
Q.	When did the operation clean corridor take place?  Was it in October or in December? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	Let us backtrack a little bit so as to clearly determine the two periods of your presence in Rwanda.  We will take them date after date.  So you arrived on the 26th of October and you were there up until the 1st or the 2nd of November for a reconnaissance mission on behalf of the Belgian army; is that correct? 
A.	The dates are exact.  The mission was for the UN where Belgium was planning to deploy a Belgian contingent, yes.  
Q.	Very well.  You went back to Belgium on the 2nd of November? 
A.	Your Honour, I thought I have been clear about that.  At different times I never returned to Belgium since I arrived at the end of October.  The only time I went back was 29th of March '94.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are you listening to the French channel or the English channel?  
THE WITNESS:
Only to the English -- to the French channel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, well, that's causing a bit of a problem because -- 
THE WITNESS:
I'm going to fast. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- you're responding before the English translation is completed, so there is an overlap of microphones.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you have to estimate a time and wait for the translation to be completed. 
THE WITNESS:
I will take this in account, Your Honour. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	It is sort of my fault, too.  I ought to have advised you when we started our examination.  Since we are both French speaking, it is true we think too fast and we forget to observe the pause. 

So let me come back to this sequencing of the dates.  So, on what date did you become an UNAMIR official? 
A.	I don't know if it is administratively retraceable, but the reconnaissance mission was still Belgian headed.  Let's call it that way.  But when the reconnaissance mission left, I became a UN mission to be entitled to stay and work for the UNAMIR mission.  So it must have been beginning of November, as soon as the reconnaissance mission left Rwanda, I stayed on the ground. 
Q.	Can it be said that the difficulty which you encounter in delimiting the differences and giving the dates stems from the fact that you played a dual role, you were answering two authorities, that is, the Belgian authority and then UNAMIR? 
A.	No, in no way.  
Q.	So, for you, there was no difference; the two missions were clearly distinct? 
A.	There is indeed a clear difference between the first week, and afterwards I was employed by the UN for a mission of the UN.  
Q.	Did you ever give information to or receive information for the Belgian mission present in Rwanda? 
A.	Are you asking this question towards the cooperation mission or for the Belgians within UNAMIR?  
Q.	With regard to UNAMIR. 
A.	As I said before, whatever information got through my hands, I didn't make any distinction.  It was -- and my direct boss was the force commander, so I informed the force commander and not whoever as a senior Belgian officer on the ground.  This information, if necessary, would get through the appropriate channels to the different sector or senior officers deployed on the ground. 
Q.	Could you please describe the information-gathering method which you had set up?  How did you go about gathering information? 
A.	It was a quite simple system.  We had access to television.  We had access to radio.  We had access to local press, international press, the Rwandese population working or not working in the UN, the expatriate population.  We would meet them at several occasions or they would come and find us in the headquarters.  Whatever they had to tell or to bring us was then put forward within the headquarters information system.  There was no network at that moment, so everything was typed on a computer -- speaking about '93, UN was working in Word Perfect 4 point nil, I think -- printed out and then brought to the personnel within the headquarters that needed to be aware about the information.  That was our system.  
Q.	So you had access only to information in French or in English?  What do you confirm? 
A.	No, that is not true, because at certain points, as stated before, there were Rwandese working in the UN headquarters, even at the political site of the mission, assisting Mr. Booh-Booh, who put our attention to certain parts in the Kinyarwanda press, which then were translated and also put forward for information, be it radio, television, leaflets, or party documents -- or publications maybe is a better word, party publications.  So the local language was not excluded from the information flow.  
Q.	So if I construe you properly, the gathering of information in Kinyarwanda was done internally via UNAMIR employees.  You did not put in place a direct information-gathering system? 
A.	This is exact.  We were not able to do that. 
Q.	So what you had was second or otherwise third-hand information? 
A.	Your Honour, without going in argument here, Jean-Pierre was also a second-hand source, because he was brought to us by the premier ministre désigné.  I hope that that answer is enough.  
Q.	I have not at all started dealing with your informant, Turatsinze.  For now, I just want to understand your working methods before we start dealing with that aspect.  That is why I put that question to you.  
A.	Whatever information you use, if it is radio, television, open sources, it has been collected by somebody else, so you will never have first-hand information, or it should be disclosed by a very reliable first-hand source.  

And, again, I have been assigned to this position as an information officer, not as being an intelligence trained officer, so whatever information was coming to us would be used to make -- or sketch a picture about Rwanda and how life was in Kigali.  If it was from third, second or tenth source, we didn't make any analysis.  
Q.	At this stage of the proceedings, I would like to ask you whether you had an interpreter assisting you, apart from the official interpreter.  
A.	To my knowledge, there was no translator in the UNAMIR headquarters for translation.  The Rwandese employees at a certain position were involved to translate documents or to bring forward documents that should be translated on official way.  I can't recall having met an official translator within the mission. 
Q.	So there was no official interpreter, and just any employee could serve as an interpreter.  
A.	That is not correct.  I haven't said that.  Depending on their position, and I can give an easy example.  There was also a PIO, public information officer.  It will be very difficult to recall his family name, but his Christian name was Venuste working at the second floor of the building for Mr. Booh-Booh and Dr. Kabia, his political adviser.  And he was responsible for the relations with the press in general, not only the local press.  I think he was a journalist from training.  And from his position, he was able to put -- or attract our attention to certain publications in Kinyarwanda and translate them for us.  So I wouldn't say that this was n'importe qui dans n'importe quelle position. 
Q.	Colonel Claeys, did you remain in your office at UNAMIR throughout that time to gather information, or did you sometimes go down to the field? 
A.	Except for writing reports and giving some briefings, I think I spent most of the time on the ground and mostly not during working hours, but after working hours. 
Q.	That is why my question concerning an interpreter is quite significant, unless you tell me that "Apart from working hours, when I went down to the field, I met with only French-speaking people."  
A.	I might be wrong and I might have been wrong informed, but the education system in Rwanda at that time, primary school and even secondary school, was still given in French.  So everybody in Kigali of a certain age -- and, of course, we didn't ask the view of the school boys being in primary school, but secondary school, there was a university in Kigali, even a military of a certain age, were all able to speak French.  When we visited a restaurant, we didn't have to order in Kinyarwanda to have a beer or to eat of the local food.  So we were not bound to an interpreter or a translator to speak with the local population.  In every patrol that would be sent out at a certain time in Rwanda by UNAMIR, Rwandese gendarmes from the governmental forces would go with them, so also these military were able to speak French with the Belgian or other patrols that they were assisting.  I think it was more difficult to communicate with the Bengali soldiers, but for the rest, I think we didn't need translation with the men in the street, which were able to communicate with us at a certain level. 
Q.	So, as far as you are concerned, going out to the field was, for instance, at times when you would go to the restaurant and where you would meet, for instance, a Rwandan bartender.  So do you think it was possible for you to discuss with that Rwandan bartender on the political situation, for instance? 
A.	Your Honour, I could use more colourful words, as was stated before, but one goes to eat and drink something, but you don't spend the whole night to eat and drink.  You go on patrol, if it is called a patrol, with the military vehicle.  You go running.  You go to the post office.  You go and visit the prefect of Kigali.  You meet some people at some international occasions like (French spoken), where not only French were coming but also Rwandese.  You go to the outskirts of Kigali and visit some refugee camps from displaced persons.  You attend some food distribution by the non-governmental organisations.  You go and visit UN military observers in the military camps on duty, talk with them, talk with their counterparts from the RGF.  

So if one would just cut this part of an example of restaurant and ordering of a beer as being considered to go on the field, I think I have had enough experiences on the ground to have had the feeling.  I have also visited, for example, Rasta movements in Nyamirambo that also had been threatened at certain points.  They were not able to communicate in Kinyarwanda, because they needed to speak in Lingala, what I was able to do with them.  
Q.	You speak Lingala, no problem about that, but you don't speak Kinyarwanda.  Those displaced persons whom you were able to see, as you indicate in your answer, when you communicated with them, was it in French or in another language? 
A.	Amongst them were certainly people speaking French, and the NGOs that were distributing aid had also Rwandan people hired to help them with the distributions and were also able to speak to us -- or the displaced persons were able to speak through them with us.  The Belgian contingents one on the ground -- once on the ground also brought some food help at certain points to these people.  So it was a matter of interaction with those displaced persons.  
Q.	So the population were not at all hostile to you.  They opened up spontaneously and in a direct manner? 
A.	Indeed, I have never experienced any hostility against my person during my stay in Kigali.

1700H
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Please tell me which political parties of the political scene in Rwanda were present when you took up your mission.
A.	To my knowledge the president had accepted multipartyism after -- at the end of the years 1990 or beginning '91, so for me there wasn't only one party present in the political scene in Kigali or Rwanda at that time; there were different parties.  We have spoken about two of them in the past two days, at least.  We spoke also about the PL, which had two wings, and there were more.  There was also something of an Islamic party.  So, there were more than the MRND alone, which had been for a long time the unique party in Rwanda.
Q.	Did you follow the transformation of the MRND?  Can you tell me what the initials MRND stand for?
A.	The "M" stands for movement; the "N" stands for national; the "R", I assume, stands for republic; and the "D" for development, but it could also be for democracy, but I can't recall it at this point.
Q.	Did you have any contacts personally with the agents or representatives of all those political parties?
A.	No, at no point, except one meeting, but not about political matters with the MRND.
Q.	No.  I'm not asking if you had discussions of a political nature.  I wanted to know whether you knew the representatives of all the political parties on the scene at that time, in view of the difficulties that we shall subsequently come to.
A.	I haven't met them personally, but it's clear that we had made up a kind of inventory of the different parties: their party leaders; their flags they were putting around their local meeting places; also some Kinyarwanda names for the youth movements, so that wherever we would pass in Kigali, we would recognise their flags and know that this was a possible meeting point for this party or the youth members.  But, indeed, I have never met personally their leaders; none of them.
Q.	And in the gathering of -- in your gathering of information, did you note whether -- if -- and, apart from your contacts with Turatsinze, were there other members of other political parties, as they were numerous, who contacted you to give you information?
A.	We have never met somebody expressing his belonging to a political party, and we have also not met anybody giving the same kind of information that Jean-Pierre Turatsinze brought to us.
Q.	Can you tell me, then, how and, more specifically, what you described under examination-in-chief, how did you come into contact with Faustin Twagiramungu, and whether you knew him before?
A.	I know who -- I knew who the prime minister-designate Faustin Twagiramungu was because he had appeared in the local press, on television, in the newspapers.  How was I put in contact with him?  So, we were flying our desks in the headquarters, UNAMIR, when we were asked to visit the general's office on the 10th of January, around noon, where he said to us that we should visit the prime minister-designate in his office, being located in the Rwegero hotel settlement, not far from the ministry alley or avenue, and that we would get some information of quite importance.  No more, no less.  So, we used the UN vehicle because we were expected to be there at one o'clock in the afternoon.

We were introduced in a room next to the office of Mr. Twagiramungu and he joined us a few moments later, where he gave us a paper with the name and the Christian name "Jean-Pierre Turatsinze" and also a phone number with five digits, plus a local phone number that we should use on the local landline -- with the local landline.  He didn't give any more information about the person; he just said, "I was brought in contact with this person and I suggest that you would contact him.  He will disclose some information to you."  So, this must have been taking 10 minutes, maybe 15 minutes, longest, because there was also a small chat going on about his life and such small social talk.  We went back to the headquarters and used landlines of the headquarters to phone Jean-Pierre.
Q.	Who is "we"?  Who told you to go and contact Faustin Twagiramungu?
A.	(Microphones overlapping) ... that be badly translated, but I spoke about General Dallaire who asked us to come to his office, and "us" means Captain Deme and myself, and we both went to the office of the prime minister-designate.
Q.	That was the 10th of January.  All right.  At what time, approximately?
A.	My recollection says that we were expected at the office of the prime minister-designate at one o'clock in the afternoon. 
Q.	Et quand vous êtes arrivés, il avait déjà préparé le petit papier sur lequel était inscrit le nom et le téléphone de l'informateur; vous n'avez pas eu à lui expliquer l'objet de votre déplacement chez lui?
A.	No, indeed, he was aware of what the purpose of our visit was.  He knew that we would come, and that was also what the general asked us to do, go and be at the office of the prime minister-designate at one o'clock this afternoon.
Q.	And that manner of proceeding did not surprise you, you didn't have any concerns?
A.	(Microphones overlapping) ... the kind of question I should ask myself in that matter.  My commanding officer sent me to an appointment, which I execute, and I get the information that is supposed to come to me.  If you could suggest me, I might learn again today.
Q.	Yes.  I should like to know whether Mr. Twagiramungu was among your usual informers?
A.	Not to my knowledge, but to my knowledge, although, apparently, I was not aware about the situation in Kigali, he had been appointed as the future prime minister and was one of the main actors in the installation of the government he would be heading in the near future, so there was a real reason to believe that he was regularly exchanging views, opinions, concerns, with both Mr. Booh-Booh and the general commanding the military wing of the UN mission, so he might have been an informant for the general, but not for me. 
Q.	So, you left the hotel, you called the informer.  How did the conversation take place?  Was he surprised at your call?  Did he consider it normal that you should call him?  How did it shape up?
A.	We had, indeed, called the given number.  We got a "hello" answer at the other end of the line.  We asked if we could speak to Jean-Pierre and then the voice answered that he was Jean-Pierre.  So, then, we said that we had got his number, without disclosing the person who gave us the number, and that we were apparently to be informed about certain things he would tell to us.  He was -- if you can discover it through a telephone -- I think not surprised, and what followed in the conversation was how we would meet, and at what point and at what time we would meet the same day.  We imposed the place of the pickup, it was not his choice, and we imposed also the time.
Q.	If I have understood your answer, on the paper that Twagiramungu gave you, was the Christian name "Jean-Pierre".
A.	And his family name.
Q.	So, the same day -- you met the same day or at another time?
A.	No, I think we have been clear about that.  We got information from the prime minister-designate, the 10th, at one o'clock in the afternoon.  We phoned to Jean-Pierre coming back to the headquarters and made an appointment for the same evening, the 10th of January.
Q.	Well, maybe I did not understand the translation correctly, but from what I hear it was that you saw him on that same day, the self-same day, the very same day, the 10th of January.
A.	Yes, indeed; everything happened on the 10th of January.
Q.	Very well.  In what context did you meet him; at what place?
A.	The appointment was made on the parking place, I would say, belonging to the Kigali nightclub.  He was there in advance.  He was leaning against his white vehicle.  We arrived.  We greeted each other.  He went into our car, sitting next to me; Captain Deme was sitting in the back of the sedan car, four doors; and we drove off from this parking place by the main road uphill to the roundabout of the Meridien hotel and then used the avenue from the roundabout to the headquarters -- of the sector headquarters and drove into this compound -- the compound was blacked out, which is a term to say every light was out at the outside -- and we introduced him by the back side of the building into the basement, where then we used a candle to light the room and start the interview.
Q.	How did the introductions take place between the participants to that meeting?
A.	If we start at the beginning, when we met at the parking place, I didn't present myself, as such, but I went to him and in a questioning sound I spoke to him, "Jean-Pierre?", if you will understand, to which he said, "Yes, I am".  And then when we came to the headquarters, being the second step of the instruction of everybody, well, Captain Deme and myself we were in civilian dress, but the other two officers, Major Kesteloot and Colonel Marchal, were in their military fatigues, wearing their name tag on the right, upper parts of their uniform, so it was easy for him to see who was in front of him, although Colonel Marchal introduced himself as being the sector headquarter commander.  He then, himself, disclosed his identity with his identity card, as I stated already before.
Q.	I am asking myself a question: why this drama?  You are used to getting information from informers.  What required this drama?  Was it Twagiramungu who had advised you, or was that your usual practice?
A.	This might look like a set-up.  It was not the usual way to get in contact with informants.  As I said before, or -- we were meeting them in the street when we went to the field, or they came to us straightly to the headquarters, but by the way we were put in contact with him, it was already clear that it was not just somebody trying to speak about his personal feelings of what was going on.  So, we were informed.  I had also to inform the general at a certain point that this meeting would take place and that we were looking for a place for this meeting.  So, he went to one of his sector commanders; it could have been the chief of the UN military observers.  He addressed himself to Colonel Marchal, asking him to organise this meeting.  I was not in the position to implement the condition of the meeting in the sector headquarters.  This was Colonel Marchal and his operations officers' entitlement.  The only thing I could organise was his pickup and, by doing it at night, give it some discretion, but I don't think this is very special, otherwise he would have come straightly to the headquarters of UNAMIR.
Q.	I want to backtrack somewhat.  When you met him -- when you entered into contact with him, did he tell you to take exceptional measures, take precautions?  It isn't what you told me before.  He merely gave you a paper with the name and Christian name "Jean-Pierre"; maybe the surname with it.  Does that mean that it was necessary to make all those dramatic arrangements for an informer who, in the final analysis, is just like any other informer whom you have been put in contact with at that specific time?
A.	(Microphones overlapping) ... who has not given any clue about the way we should treat these informants.  So, if this was maybe in the eyes of someone, an enscenering (sic), or a special enscenering, it doesn't belong to my responsibilities to judge that.  It was -- the enscenering was then done -- or, instructed by other channels, but not from Mr. Twagiramungu.  And I don't know what the general and Colonel Marchal decided among themselves for this meeting.
Q.	I'm putting a question to myself which I will divulge to you: Colonel Marchal and General Dallaire, did they have knowledge of the name and the significance of that testimony since you say that the conditions of the -- the meeting, it was they that asked you to take those steps?
A.	To my knowledge, they didn't know the names, and, secondly, to my knowledge, they didn't know what his acquaintances were with -- would be.  And as I said before, I was only responsible to get in contact with Jean-Pierre and bring him to the headquarters.  If you consider that as an enscenering, let be it.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, it is exactly 1730.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take an adjournment.

Do you have any idea as to when you are going to complete?  The chances are we may not be able to sit on Friday morning, and I'm just wondering if you'd be completing tomorrow.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I think, yes, Mr. President.  Unless anything really extraordinary and unforeseen occurs, I should be able to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, tomorrow morning we will indicate our scheduling for the rest of the week, but there is a likelihood that we will not be sitting on Friday morning.
MR. MORLEY:
May I raise two matters with Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.
MR. MORLEY:
The first concerns the likely length of the witness's testimony.  For reasons I'm not clear about, the witness was under the impression that he might be finished by Friday, and the Belgian military are anticipating his return.  That's plainly not practicable, and it would be helpful, I think, to the witness and, also, possibly to WVSS, who organise ticketing, to have some idea as to when the colonel is likely to finish, assuming we don't sit Friday, in the coming week.  I know that the colonel would like to be able to communicate with his colleague in Belgium to explain what's his position, and if that can be done sooner rather than later, it would be of assistance.  It is presently Wednesday, and I understand he is expected back on Friday or Saturday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, what I suggest, right, can counsel first have some -- by now it's quite clear the issues that have to be addressed in cross-examination.  I suppose by tomorrow morning, we could have a clearer picture of what he is going to do.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know if it's possible to initiate some discussions among the counsel.  I know you can't discuss it with the witness -- 
MR. MORLEY:
That's the point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- until tomorrow in court --
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- but that may provide an information base to address the matter more fully tomorrow morning.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  The colonel can hear, then, that we will have some sort of answer by tomorrow morning.

The other thought I have is that Your Honour's very helpful staff, Mr. Vincent, has asked me to put the documents in evidence, that I flagged up, now rather than a little later.  He'd like to keep his books in order, and I wonder if I might do that now or first thing in the morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, first thing in the morning.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I beg your pardon?

If I may borrow your linguistic style, our every helpful registrar said it would be better to do it now.
MR. MORLEY:
To use my linguistic style then, may I invite Your Honour's attention to page 10 of the bundle?  There is the outgoing code cable of the 10th of January from Annan.  I would invite that that become a Prosecution Exhibit; I think 39.
MS. KOUO:
Yes, P. 39.
MR. MORLEY:
That is a two-page document.

At page 12 of the bundle, the outgoing code cable from Annan, a two-page document as P. 40; at page 14 of the bundle, from Booh-Booh, the outgoing code cable of two pages, P. 41, dated the 11th of January; at page 16, the outgoing code cable from Dallaire, dated the 12th of January, a three-page document, P. 42; at page 19, the outgoing code cable from Booh-Booh, a two-page document, P. 43; at page 21, the report from Colonel Claeys, marked as "Meeting on 13 January", P. 44; at page 23, the report from Colonel Claeys marked, "Contact on 20 January", a two-page document, P 45; at page 25, the report from Colonel Claeys, dated 10th of February, a two-page document, P. 46; at page 27, the report from Colonel Claeys, dated the 17th of February, a one-page document, P. 47; at page 28, in total, a 10-page document, the movement of an informant's note from Deme, through Claeys, to Dallaire, P. 48.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was provision made for the translation in your admissions?
MR. MORLEY:
No, I'm afraid not.  These documents are as I find them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, but there was one document which is in both English and French.

MR. MORLEY:
Yes, that document is D. NZ15, the famous fax, the original in English, translated at some stage in the long history in French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have been giving the English and French translations an "A" and "B" number for ease of reference.
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are putting in both the English and French documents?
MR. MORLEY:
I'm not putting in the outgoing 11 January fax because that is also in evidence, as Your Honour will remember, as D. NZ15.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I did forget that.  Thank you.
MR. MORLEY:
And also the French is already in evidence.  Mr. Robinson did that some time ago.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. MORLEY:
The documents which I have listed are the documents that are, in fact, new.
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question has been answered satisfactorily.
MR. MORLEY:
Maybe not to Mr. Robinson; I see he is getting ready to get on his feet.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I have no objection to these exhibits, except to the last one, which I think you've already ruled basically can only be used to refresh the witness's recollection.  When the one paragraph that he used to refresh his recollection and give oral testimony, there's no basis to add in the entire document.  So, this is the document from the unnamed informant.  So, I'd ask the other exhibits can be admitted, but the proposed P. 48 should be excluded.
MR. MORLEY:
At the very least, P. 48 might properly be admissible as to that section which the colonel gave evidence about.  And I can identify those pages for Your Honour's assistance.  However, in the grand scheme of things, it may be thought, arguably, perhaps too attentive to detail to be excluding various sections of documents.  Now, if that meets with Your Honour's approval, very well.  But Your Honours know what part of --

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley --
MR. MORLEY:
-- the evidence was referred to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not necessary to advance further arguments.  We had already formed the view that it could be admitted for the purpose for which it was utilised.  It's not admitted for the truth of its contents, but, of course, when we are reviewing the testimony it would be useful for us to observe what it was the witness used to refresh his memory.
(Exhibit No. P. 39 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 40 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 41 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 42 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 43 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 44 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 45 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 46 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 47 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 48 admitted)
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully entirely agree.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now and we resume tomorrow morning at the usual time.
(Court adjourned at 1740H)
